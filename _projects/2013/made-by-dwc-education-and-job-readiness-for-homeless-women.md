title: 'MADE by DWC: Education and Job Readiness for Homeless Women'
project_summary: "Over our 35-year history, the Downtown Women’s Center has created innovative programming focused on meeting the unique needs of homeless, formerly homeless, and extremely low-income women. When the Center first opened in 1978, it was the first and only resource for women living on Los Angeles’ Skid Row.\r\n\r\nIn 1986, DWC opened the United States’ first permanent supportive housing for women, a program that has since been modeled as a national prototype. DWC now offers 119 units of permanent supportive housing among our two Residences to women who are primarily elderly, mentally ill, and/or physically disabled. More than 95% of the 500 women we have served through our Residence program have remained permanently housed.\r\n\r\nWe have also scaled up our housing efforts beyond our own 119 apartments by piloting our Critical Time Intervention (CTI) model with clients housed off-site. Our CTI model, a proven evidence-based program launched in 2011, provides intensive case management for individuals transitioning out of chronic homelessness, ensuring that they have the support and access to resources they need to stay housed. DWC is also committed to sharing best practices; this April, our Director of Clinical Health Services and Lead CTI Case Manager will present DWC's CTI model at the Housing California Conference in Sacramento.\r\n\r\nAs the need on Skid Row has continued to grow, DWC is grateful that we have been able to expand our programming and services, offered through our Day Center, Learning Center, two Residence locations, and on-site Medical and Mental Health Center. In 2012, DWC served 4,300 women with 90,000 meals, 23,000 showers, and 6,500 case management and counseling sessions. \r\n\r\nAlong with our direct service, DWC contributes to national and local policy discussions and to best practice research in service provision for people experiencing homelessness. In 2001, DWC spearheaded the Downtown Women's Action Coalition, addressing women’s policy and research needs. The coalition has since performed several needs assessments for women on Skid Row.\r\n\r\nDWC’s well-reputed history is a testament to our mission and work in the community. DWC received a Los Angeles Office of the City Attorney Commendation in 1993, a Bank of America Neighborhood Excellence Initiative Neighborhood Builder Award in 2007, and \"Organization of the Year\" by the Los Angeles Business Journal in 2011.\r\n\r\nSeveral other organizations have utilized DWC as a prototype for creating services for homeless women, including Friends In Deed in Pasadena, and organizations in San Francisco, San Jose, Amarillo, Texas; and New Orleans.\r\n\r\nFinally, we attribute our long-term success to the overwhelming community support and volunteer efforts that allow us to make the greatest impact with limited resources. DWC has been recognized as a Blue Ribbon Service Enterprise by the state of California, and our model has been developed into a case study in best practices in nonprofit volunteer engagement."

  success: "DWC measures both the total number of women accessing each of our services and the progress of individual participants. These numbers are audited on a monthly basis and used to determine our overall social impact.\r\n\r\nEach woman we serve through our Education and Job Readiness Program will complete an initial assessment to capture a brief education and employment history and her related short- and long-term goals. Participants will attend a one-on-one counseling session to determine the next steps in their development path, as well as complete assessment tests in basic reading, math, and computer use.\r\n\r\nSuccess for our Education and Job Readiness Program participants will be measured in relation to our Impact Metrics, which measure each individual woman’s progress on the path to stability and her ability to end the cycle of homelessness in her life. Our measurement guide evaluates each woman’s progress on a 5-point scale to determine her success at meeting basic needs; accessing healthcare; accessing mental health services; achieving a sense of self-worth and purpose; building a social network; and maintaining a reliable source of income. Additionally, we consider a woman’s access to a safe, permanent home. The measurement guides are implemented when a woman first accesses services, and are administered each six months by case managers and other program staff. \r\n\r\nTo track our metrics, DWC developed an outcome database to record and analyze these performance measures. These metrics reflect DWC’s service model of reducing barriers to personal stability, which is an essential component of success for women in homelessness looking to re-enter the workforce.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, we plan to engage 925 women in services offered within our Learning Center. Of these, 225 women will engage in the Education and Job Readiness Program, and 75% will complete their assessed learning level and progress to the subsequent level. Our pilot SET to Work program will engage 54 women in the intensive 12-week intensive curriculum, providing job-readiness training, vocational education, and one-on-one case management.  \r\nWe will evaluate program success throughout this year with our initial cohort of 54 women, with the intention to improve and expand impact each year.\r\n\r\nThis year, we will offer SET to Create product-development 700 workshops, engaging 140 women in learning practical and soft skills. Of the 140 participants, 90% will attend at least four workshops and receive income from their crafted products.\r\n\r\nIn addition to evaluating program outcomes, we will continue refining our business models for our two MADE by DWC social enterprises. As with any new venture, we will continue to test products in the market, form new sales relationships with businesses and online channels, and grow our local customer base. These business expansions will allow us to continue scaling our Education and Job Readiness Program to reach more women."

  brief: "Women experiencing homelessness face complex, intersecting barriers on their paths to personal stability. Since 1978, the Downtown Women’s Center (DWC) has been empowering women to break the cycles of homelessness and poverty by providing a wide array of services that can be tailored to each woman’s needs. The recent economic downturn has shown an increased demand for income and employment opportunities, and women on Los Angeles’ Skid Row are no exception.\r\n\r\nDWC, an agency that serves 4,300 homeless and extremely low-income women annually, is meeting that need by expanding our comprehensive Education and Job Readiness Program to serve the complex income and employment needs of homeless, formerly homeless, and extremely low-income women.\r\n\r\nWith over three decades of experience, DWC is uniquely prepared to offer services for the hardest to employ women. Many of the women we serve may never be able to reenter the traditional workforce because of physical disabilities, mental health issues, ageing, or other barriers related to their experience of homelessness. Our programs allow these women to learn practical skills, gain a sense of purpose, and regain self-sustainability and earn income from alternative job opportunities.\r\n\r\nOur Education and Job Readiness Program is made possible through DWC’s on-site Learning Center, as well as our two MADE by DWC social enterprises, a café and gift shop opened in April 2011, and a resale boutique that opened in November 2012. Both businesses offer hands-on job training opportunities, as well as support the local economy in downtown Los Angeles while inviting community members to engage in ending homelessness through socially conscious shopping.\r\n\r\nSET to Create\r\nIn 2013, we are building on the initial successes of our SET to Create product-development program allows participants to gain soft skills by participating in workshops, as they simultaneously gain practical skills in creating handcrafted products to industry standards. The MADE by DWC product line emphasizes sustainable goods and includes organic soaps and candles, jewelry, ornaments, and upcycled picture frames and bound journals. Women who complete an initial certification process are able to earn supplemental income, as DWC purchases their items for resale in our two stores.\r\n\r\nSET to Work\r\nWith the recent opening of our second social enterprise, a resale boutique, we are able to offer even more hands-on job-training opportunities. This year, we are piloting an intensive 12-week job-readiness training program through both stores, which we will expand as we grow our businesses and community partners. SET to Work participants will develop marketable skills including inventory management, customer service, food handling, and administrative tasks. Each woman will receive one-on-one case management to set goals and address housing, sustenance, and health-related needs. Program graduates will then be connected to employment opportunities, including exclusive externships and entry-level positions designated by our growing network of corporate partners.\r\n\r\n2013 Impact\r\nOur Education and Job Readiness Program will impact LA2050’s Income and Employment indicator by improving literacy, job readiness, employment, and employment retention among homeless and low-income women on downtown Los Angeles’ Skid Row. This year, DWC plans to engage 925 women in services through our Learning Center; launching SET to Work and scaling up our SET to Create workshops will allow us to provide paths out of homelessness and poverty for more women.\r\n\r\nOur Holistic Approach\r\nDWC’s services and programs have been developed with an understanding that the women we serve continue to experience the barriers, trauma, and daily hardships correlated with homelessness and poverty. DWC is committed to meeting each woman’s needs and to providing a safe haven where women can access the resources they need to remove these barriers.\r\n\r\nAll program participants have access to DWC’s full spectrum of supportive services, offered through our Day Center on Skid Row. Along with basic needs such as showers, meals, and clothing, DWC provides individualized counseling and case management; a Learning Center offering a variety of courses and computer access; an on-site health clinic offering extensive medical and mental health services; and referrals to housing and local community resources. All programs are also open to residents who live in our 119 units of permanent supportive housing."

  description: "DWC’s mission is to provide permanent supportive housing and a safe and healthy community fostering dignity, respect, and personal stability, and to advocate ending homelessness for women. Los Angeles is currently the homeless capital of the United States; the Los Angeles Homeless Services Agency’s 2011 count found more than 50,000 homeless individuals in LA County, with a high concentration of those individuals on Skid Row. One-third of these homeless individuals are adult women.\r\n\r\nOur Education and Job Readiness Program is a direct response to the service barriers and gaps that directly impact Los Angeles’ homeless and extremely low-income women. According to a 2010 Women's Needs Assessment, the Skid Row community has an extreme lack of accessible education and employment opportunities.\r\n\r\nAmong women surveyed, 68.2% lacked a high school diploma or GED equivalent, and only 7.6% had college degrees, the lowest level since the survey’s creation in 2001. Nearly half (46.9%) lacked access to computer classes and/or internet, and 59.4% of women identified educational opportunities as a resource they would most like to see in local community and service centers. Of women surveyed, 90.3% did not believe there were employment opportunities available in the downtown area, and only 4.3% reported income from employment.\r\n\r\nWomen in homelessness are often thrust into instability as a direct result of poor physical and/or mental health, disability, loss of employment, and familial loss, among other issues. As federal funding for affordable housing and social programs faces further cuts, we are investing efforts into providing women with practical skills and alternative income to increase their long-term independence. \r\n\r\nOur Education and Job Readiness Program will influence the personal wellness and stability of Los Angeles’ most underserved population, while also impacting the well-being of our local community on multiple levels. We will (1) increase direct access to job-training and employment services (2) ensure stabilization of our participants, assisting them in building skills and reentering the workforce, (3) reduce utilization and decrease dependency on high-cost emergency services, (4) mobilize the Los Angeles community through volunteerism and the shopping experience, and (5) improve the overall social, economic, and health outcomes on Skid Row.\r\n\r\nIn addition to providing direct benefits to homeless women, DWC’s programs engage members of the greater Los Angeles community. Volunteers lead many of our SET to Create product-development workshops, offering both practical skills and mentorship to participants. Our two MADE by DWC stores bring in foot traffic and engage our neighbors in the local economy. Additionally, the MADE by DWC product line is offered through several locations across Los Angeles, including Bloomingdale’s in Century City, and several Hudson News locations at LAX, expanding the scope of our public education efforts."
  collaborators: "Our social enterprise partners include corporations, small businesses, and other agencies who have provided support for our Education and Job Readiness Program through cash and in-kind donations and pro bono consultation, as well as by carrying our product line. These partners include Bloomingdale’s; Hudson News; the Skirball Center; Munger, Tolles, & Olson; Yahoo!; Groundwork Coffee; and Chrysalis.\r\n\r\nOther partners include our wide range of volunteers, including students, working professionals, retirees, and corporate groups. We have also engaged other Skid Row agencies to encourage referrals to our programs; these include LAMP, St. Vincent’s, LA Christian Health Center, and JWCH Institute."

DWC has been recognized as a Blue Ribbon Service Enterprise by the state of California, and our model has been developed into a case study in best practices in nonprofit volunteer engagement."
  description3: "The Downtown Women’s Center is interested in building collaborative relationships with other agencies on Skid Row. Because of the wide range of services we provide, what we would consider our competition includes providers of permanent supportive housing, emergency shelters, other homeless service providers, and social enterprises across Los Angeles. \r\n\r\nDWC understands that the scope of homelessness in Los Angeles – the homeless capital of the United States – requires partnership among all of these agencies. Many of the women we serve in our Day Center reside in other agencies or rely on temporary shelter beds. Our staff outreaches to other agencies to increase awareness of DWC’s programs, and we link our participants to other agencies, to ensure that they have access to the resources they require to meet their specific needs.\r\n\r\nOur Education and Job Readiness Program differ from other programs such as WorkSource or Goodwill because of our ability to serve individuals who are not ready – or may never become ready – to re-enter the traditional workforce. Our alternative income opportunities allow us to serve women with major barriers such as physical disabilities, mental health issues, substance use, or past trauma, among others. A woman who is navigating these issues may not be able to adhere to the demands, schedule, or physical requirements to hold a traditional job.\r\n\r\nOther job-training providers on Skid Row include Chrysalis and The Weingart Center. DWC does refer job-ready participants to The Weingart Center, though they primarily enroll their residents, leaving limited space for others. We have also referred some women to Chrysalis, though some of the opportunities they offer are not a fit for the most chronically homeless individuals we serve.\r\n\r\nAs much as possible, DWC strives to partner with and share best practices with other social enterprises. For example, Chrysalis offered expertise to our business and program development as we were preparing to launch MADE by DWC. In our café, we carry baked goods created by Homeboy Industries, which provides employment opportunities to former gang-involved individuals, and products created by Food Forward, a nonprofit that gleans fruit from backyard orchards to support meals programs – including ours.\r\n\r\nDWC continues to seek opportunities to collaborate with other agencies. We have agreed to partner with the Skid Row Housing Trust on their LA2050 grant proposal to create a community vision for a healthy and sustainable Skid Row. We would provide outreach, engage our participants in community forums about housing needs and design, and lend staff support in the design selection and presentation process.\r\n\r\nSince its inception, the Downtown Women’s Center has relied on the support of the local community, and we plan to continue building collaborations between agencies, local businesses, foundations, and individuals. Only together can we make greater impact and end homelessness in Los Angeles."
  vision: "DWC’s vision of success in 2050 is an end to homelessness through innovation and cross-functional services. While our grant proposal specifically addresses the Income and Employment indicator, we recognize that the causes and effects of homelessness reach across several of the indicators outlined in the LA2050 report. Our Education and Job Readiness Program is just one of the ways in which the Downtown Women’s Center provides a pathway out of homelessness; our holistic approach is focused on removing multiple intersecting barriers that women in homelessness and extreme poverty may face.\r\n\r\nWe envision a Los Angeles where all women can access the resources they need to establish and maintain her personal stability. In terms of income and employment, our Education and Job Readiness Program is designed to ensure that all women who are interested in participating in the local economy have opportunities to do so, whether through re-entry into the traditional workforce or, for those who face extreme barriers, through alternative income opportunities. The collaborative, supportive environment we promote in our SET to Create and SET to Work workshops will provide a place where women can earn an income, break out of the isolation of homelessness, contribute to the local community, and gain a sense of fulfillment.\r\n\r\nIn addition to striving to improve outcomes for homeless and low-income women as a direct service provider, the Downtown Women’s Center also engages in advocacy efforts to increase affordable and permanent supportive housing options and ensure that fewer individuals are becoming homeless for the first time. Because of that, we consider success in the year 2050 for the Income and Employment indicator as closely linked to the Housing and Social Connectedness indicators, as well. \r\n\r\nAs a service enterprise that engages more than 2,500 individuals in volunteerism each year, we recognize that it takes the support of the entire community to achieve our vision of a Los Angeles where all individuals have access to housing, healthcare, and employment. As we work to achieve our goals, however, we see the need for employment programs that take into account the unique employment challenges that homeless and formerly homeless women face.\r\n\r\nOur two social enterprise stores, our café and resale boutique, provide spaces where women experiencing physical and mental health barriers are able to gain hard and soft skills, whether to enter the work force or to develop alternative streams of income to support their efforts to regain personal stability. Beyond impact in Los Angeles, we seek to end homelessness for all women, and as such, we envision that by 2050 our model and best practices will be leveraged by other communities across the nation."

  Women experiencing homelessness face complex, intersecting barriers on their
  paths to personal stability. Since 1978, the Downtown Women’s Center (DWC) has
  been empowering women to break the cycles of homelessness and poverty by
  providing a wide array of services that can be tailored to each woman’s needs.
  The recent economic downturn has shown an increased demand for income and
  employment opportunities, and women on Los Angeles’ Skid Row are no exception.






  DWC, an agency that serves 4,300 homeless and extremely lowincome women
  annually, is meeting that need by expanding our comprehensive Education and
  Job Readiness Program to serve the complex income and employment needs of
  homeless, formerly homeless, and extremely lowincome women.






  With over three decades of experience, DWC is uniquely prepared to offer
  services for the hardest to employ women. Many of the women we serve may never
  be able to reenter the traditional workforce because of physical disabilities,
  mental health issues, ageing, or other barriers related to their experience of
  homelessness. Our programs allow these women to learn practical skills, gain a
  sense of purpose, and regain selfsustainability and earn income from
  alternative job opportunities.






  Our Education and Job Readiness Program is made possible through DWC’s onsite
  Learning Center, as well as our two MADE by DWC social enterprises, a cafÃ©
  and gift shop opened in April 2011, and a resale boutique that opened in
  November 2012. Both businesses offer handson job training opportunities, as
  well as support the local economy in downtown Los Angeles while inviting
  community members to engage in ending homelessness through socially conscious
  shopping.






  SET to Create



  In 2013, we are building on the initial successes of our SET to Create
  productdevelopment program allows participants to gain soft skills by
  participating in workshops, as they simultaneously gain practical skills in
  creating handcrafted products to industry standards. The MADE by DWC product
  line emphasizes sustainable goods and includes organic soaps and candles,
  jewelry, ornaments, and upcycled picture frames and bound journals. Women who
  complete an initial certification process are able to earn supplemental
  income, as DWC purchases their items for resale in our two stores.






  SET to Work



  With the recent opening of our second social enterprise, a resale boutique, we
  are able to offer even more handson jobtraining opportunities. This year, we
  are piloting an intensive 12week jobreadiness training program through both
  stores, which we will expand as we grow our businesses and community partners.
  SET to Work participants will develop marketable skills including inventory
  management, customer service, food handling, and administrative tasks. Each
  woman will receive oneonone case management to set goals and address housing,
  sustenance, and healthrelated needs. Program graduates will then be connected
  to employment opportunities, including exclusive externships and entrylevel
  positions designated by our growing network of corporate partners.






  2013 Impact



  Our Education and Job Readiness Program will impact LA2050’s Income and
  Employment indicator by improving literacy, job readiness, employment, and
  employment retention among homeless and lowincome women on downtown Los
  Angeles’ Skid Row. This year, DWC plans to engage 925 women in services
  through our Learning Center; launching SET to Work and scaling up our SET to
  Create workshops will allow us to provide paths out of homelessness and
  poverty for more women.






  Our Holistic Approach



  DWC’s services and programs have been developed with an understanding that the
  women we serve continue to experience the barriers, trauma, and daily
  hardships correlated with homelessness and poverty. DWC is committed to
  meeting each woman’s needs and to providing a safe haven where women can
  access the resources they need to remove these barriers.






  All program participants have access to DWC’s full spectrum of supportive
  services, offered through our Day Center on Skid Row. Along with basic needs
  such as showers, meals, and clothing, DWC provides individualized counseling
  and case management; a Learning Center offering a variety of courses and
  computer access; an onsite health clinic offering extensive medical and mental
  health services; and referrals to housing and local community resources. All
  programs are also open to residents who live in our 119 units of permanent
  supportive housing.
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  Over our 35year history, the Downtown Women’s Center has created innovative
  programming focused on meeting the unique needs of homeless, formerly
  homeless, and extremely lowincome women. When the Center first opened in 1978,
  it was the first and only resource for women living on Los Angeles’ Skid Row.






  In 1986, DWC opened the United States’ first permanent supportive housing for
  women, a program that has since been modeled as a national prototype. DWC now
  offers 119 units of permanent supportive housing among our two Residences to
  women who are primarily elderly, mentally ill, and/or physically disabled.
  More than 95% of the 500 women we have served through our Residence program
  have remained permanently housed.






  We have also scaled up our housing efforts beyond our own 119 apartments by
  piloting our Critical Time Intervention (CTI) model with clients housed
  offsite. Our CTI model, a proven evidencebased program launched in 2011,
  provides intensive case management for individuals transitioning out of
  chronic homelessness, ensuring that they have the support and access to
  resources they need to stay housed. DWC is also committed to sharing best
  practices; this April, our Director of Clinical Health Services and Lead CTI
  Case Manager will present DWC's CTI model at the Housing California Conference
  in Sacramento.






  As the need on Skid Row has continued to grow, DWC is grateful that we have
  been able to expand our programming and services, offered through our Day
  Center, Learning Center, two Residence locations, and onsite Medical and
  Mental Health Center. In 2012, DWC served 4,300 women with 90,000 meals,
  23,000 showers, and 6,500 case management and counseling sessions. 






  Along with our direct service, DWC contributes to national and local policy
  discussions and to best practice research in service provision for people
  experiencing homelessness. In 2001, DWC spearheaded the Downtown Women's
  Action Coalition, addressing women’s policy and research needs. The coalition
  has since performed several needs assessments for women on Skid Row.






  DWC’s wellreputed history is a testament to our mission and work in the
  community. DWC received a Los Angeles Office of the City Attorney Commendation
  in 1993, a Bank of America Neighborhood Excellence Initiative Neighborhood
  Builder Award in 2007, and "Organization of the Year" by the Los Angeles
  Business Journal in 2011.






  Several other organizations have utilized DWC as a prototype for creating
  services for homeless women, including Friends In Deed in Pasadena, and
  organizations in San Francisco, San Jose, Amarillo, Texas; and New Orleans.






  Finally, we attribute our longterm success to the overwhelming community
  support and volunteer efforts that allow us to make the greatest impact with
  limited resources. DWC has been recognized as a Blue Ribbon Service Enterprise
  by the state of California, and our model has been developed into a case study
  in best practices in nonprofit volunteer engagement.
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  Our social enterprise partners include corporations, small businesses, and
  other agencies who have provided support for our Education and Job Readiness
  Program through cash and inkind donations and pro bono consultation, as well
  as by carrying our product line. These partners include Bloomingdale’s; Hudson
  News; the Skirball Center; Munger, Tolles, & Olson; Yahoo!; Groundwork Coffee;
  and Chrysalis.






  Other partners include our wide range of volunteers, including students,
  working professionals, retirees, and corporate groups. We have also engaged
  other Skid Row agencies to encourage referrals to our programs; these include
  LAMP, St. Vincent’s, LA Christian Health Center, and JWCH Institute.
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  DWC measures both the total number of women accessing each of our services and
  the progress of individual participants. These numbers are audited on a
  monthly basis and used to determine our overall social impact.






  Each woman we serve through our Education and Job Readiness Program will
  complete an initial assessment to capture a brief education and employment
  history and her related short and longterm goals. Participants will attend a
  oneonone counseling session to determine the next steps in their development
  path, as well as complete assessment tests in basic reading, math, and
  computer use.






  Success for our Education and Job Readiness Program participants will be
  measured in relation to our Impact Metrics, which measure each individual
  woman’s progress on the path to stability and her ability to end the cycle of
  homelessness in her life. Our measurement guide evaluates each woman’s
  progress on a 5point scale to determine her success at meeting basic needs;
  accessing healthcare; accessing mental health services; achieving a sense of
  selfworth and purpose; building a social network; and maintaining a reliable
  source of income. Additionally, we consider a woman’s access to a safe,
  permanent home. The measurement guides are implemented when a woman first
  accesses services, and are administered each six months by case managers and
  other program staff. 






  To track our metrics, DWC developed an outcome database to record and analyze
  these performance measures. These metrics reflect DWC’s service model of
  reducing barriers to personal stability, which is an essential component of
  success for women in homelessness looking to reenter the workforce.






  In 2013, we plan to engage 925 women in services offered within our Learning
  Center. Of these, 225 women will engage in the Education and Job Readiness
  Program, and 75% will complete their assessed learning level and progress to
  the subsequent level. Our pilot SET to Work program will engage 54 women in
  the intensive 12week intensive curriculum, providing jobreadiness training,
  vocational education, and oneonone case management.  



  We will evaluate program success throughout this year with our initial cohort
  of 54 women, with the intention to improve and expand impact each year.






  This year, we will offer SET to Create productdevelopment 700 workshops,
  engaging 140 women in learning practical and soft skills. Of the 140
  participants, 90% will attend at least four workshops and receive income from
  their crafted products.






  In addition to evaluating program outcomes, we will continue refining our
  business models for our two MADE by DWC social enterprises. As with any new
  venture, we will continue to test products in the market, form new sales
  relationships with businesses and online channels, and grow our local customer
  base. These business expansions will allow us to continue scaling our
  Education and Job Readiness Program to reach more women.
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  DWC’s mission is to provide permanent supportive housing and a safe and
  healthy community fostering dignity, respect, and personal stability, and to
  advocate ending homelessness for women. Los Angeles is currently the homeless
  capital of the United States; the Los Angeles Homeless Services Agency’s 2011
  count found more than 50,000 homeless individuals in LA County, with a high
  concentration of those individuals on Skid Row. Onethird of these homeless
  individuals are adult women.






  Our Education and Job Readiness Program is a direct response to the service
  barriers and gaps that directly impact Los Angeles’ homeless and extremely
  lowincome women. According to a 2010 Women's Needs Assessment, the Skid Row
  community has an extreme lack of accessible education and employment
  opportunities.






  Among women surveyed, 68.2% lacked a high school diploma or GED equivalent,
  and only 7.6% had college degrees, the lowest level since the survey’s
  creation in 2001. Nearly half (46.9%) lacked access to computer classes and/or
  internet, and 59.4% of women identified educational opportunities as a
  resource they would most like to see in local community and service centers.
  Of women surveyed, 90.3% did not believe there were employment opportunities
  available in the downtown area, and only 4.3% reported income from employment.






  Women in homelessness are often thrust into instability as a direct result of
  poor physical and/or mental health, disability, loss of employment, and
  familial loss, among other issues. As federal funding for affordable housing
  and social programs faces further cuts, we are investing efforts into
  providing women with practical skills and alternative income to increase their
  longterm independence. 






  Our Education and Job Readiness Program will influence the personal wellness
  and stability of Los Angeles’ most underserved population, while also
  impacting the wellbeing of our local community on multiple levels. We will (1)
  increase direct access to jobtraining and employment services (2) ensure
  stabilization of our participants, assisting them in building skills and
  reentering the workforce, (3) reduce utilization and decrease dependency on
  highcost emergency services, (4) mobilize the Los Angeles community through
  volunteerism and the shopping experience, and (5) improve the overall social,
  economic, and health outcomes on Skid Row.






  In addition to providing direct benefits to homeless women, DWC’s programs
  engage members of the greater Los Angeles community. Volunteers lead many of
  our SET to Create productdevelopment workshops, offering both practical skills
  and mentorship to participants. Our two MADE by DWC stores bring in foot
  traffic and engage our neighbors in the local economy. Additionally, the MADE
  by DWC product line is offered through several locations across Los Angeles,
  including Bloomingdale’s in Century City, and several Hudson News locations at
  LAX, expanding the scope of our public education efforts.
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  DWC’s vision of success in 2050 is an end to homelessness through innovation
  and crossfunctional services. While our grant proposal specifically addresses
  the Income and Employment indicator, we recognize that the causes and effects
  of homelessness reach across several of the indicators outlined in the LA2050
  report. Our Education and Job Readiness Program is just one of the ways in
  which the Downtown Women’s Center provides a pathway out of homelessness; our
  holistic approach is focused on removing multiple intersecting barriers that
  women in homelessness and extreme poverty may face.






  We envision a Los Angeles where all women can access the resources they need
  to establish and maintain her personal stability. In terms of income and
  employment, our Education and Job Readiness Program is designed to ensure that
  all women who are interested in participating in the local economy have
  opportunities to do so, whether through reentry into the traditional workforce
  or, for those who face extreme barriers, through alternative income
  opportunities. The collaborative, supportive environment we promote in our SET
  to Create and SET to Work workshops will provide a place where women can earn
  an income, break out of the isolation of homelessness, contribute to the local
  community, and gain a sense of fulfillment.






  In addition to striving to improve outcomes for homeless and lowincome women
  as a direct service provider, the Downtown Women’s Center also engages in
  advocacy efforts to increase affordable and permanent supportive housing
  options and ensure that fewer individuals are becoming homeless for the first
  time. Because of that, we consider success in the year 2050 for the Income and
  Employment indicator as closely linked to the Housing and Social Connectedness
  indicators, as well. 






  As a service enterprise that engages more than 2,500 individuals in
  volunteerism each year, we recognize that it takes the support of the entire
  community to achieve our vision of a Los Angeles where all individuals have
  access to housing, healthcare, and employment. As we work to achieve our
  goals, however, we see the need for employment programs that take into account
  the unique employment challenges that homeless and formerly homeless women
  face.






  Our two social enterprise stores, our cafÃ© and resale boutique, provide
  spaces where women experiencing physical and mental health barriers are able
  to gain hard and soft skills, whether to enter the work force or to develop
  alternative streams of income to support their efforts to regain personal
  stability. Beyond impact in Los Angeles, we seek to end homelessness for all
  women, and as such, we envision that by 2050 our model and best practices will
  be leveraged by other communities across the nation.
