title: Learning Equipment Supply Service
indicator: ' Education'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  My idea is to create a team of science teacher support  specialists who will
  visit up to fifteen teachers per week in Los Angeles middle and elementary
  schools, including the three high school science teachers whom we already
  serve.  We would support their students’ acquisition of gradelevel math and
  science skills and knowledge by offering three services:  



  <p>(1) creation of tutoring programs, </p>



  <p>(2) delivery of teacherdriven technical support and professional
  development, and </p>



  <p>(3) facilitation of projectbased and other types of laborintensive
  innovative learning activities.  



  Experience and material resources for these three services already exist on
  our team.</p>






  <p>My indicator is Education. </p> <p> On a completely volunteer basis,
  running on personal donations from  me, we have been serving a few Los Angeles
  science teachers with lab equipment loans for about a year.  Feedback from
  teachers, administrators, and project advisors has indicated that lab
  equipment is not the biggest problem in Los Angeles innercity science
  education.  Instead, we need to address deficits in basic skills and
  scientific background knowledge for younger students before they hit high
  school.  Formal research studies confirm that the basic academic skill levels
  of innercity students diverge from the skill levels of their richer
  counterparts by the sixth grade, as reviewed by this scholarly article from an
  education research agency: http://educationnorthwest.org/webfm_send/529 .  



  Journalism in Los Angeles confirms the need for more science education at
  elementary schools too, as proclaimed in this Los Angeles Times article:
  http://articles.latimes.com/2006/nov/20/opinion/edscience20 .






  The three services that I am proposing for funding here would directly address
  these problems.  These are not new ideas. </p>



  <p>1) Basic skills tutoring programs already exist at a few Los Angeles
  schools, and we have set one up ourselves at a high school; our innercity
  students either need more of these or need to be connected to these.  </p>



  <p> 2) Highquality professional development sessions for science teachers are
  made available by agencies such as CalTeach at UCLA and JPL at NASA, but none
  of these programs provide teachers with customized technical help to meet each
  teacher’s specific needs and goals in their respective classrooms with their
  own students.  </p>



  <p> 3) Many L.A. schoolteachers already implement new ways to get more of
  their students to learn science, such as projectbased learning and
  problembased learning, but these inspiring incidences of active learning can
  be increased and spread to other teachers too, if expert help, teacher support
  and equipment were to be more readily available. </p> 






  <p>These activities will impact education in Los Angeles by improving the
  skills and interests of students, especially the minority students, flowing
  into our innercity Los Angeles high schools.  There, our high school teachers
  will encounter more confidence and better skills in their students, along with
  better college and career prospects.  Innercity high school science and math
  teachers will be able to teach at higher levels, with greater rigor.  The
  resultant increases in selfefficacy of both high school students and their
  teachers will be evident in higher graduation rates and higher rates of
  interest in scientific careers.  Ultimately, we will see more of our students
  going to college and more of our students landing stimulating and wellpaid
  jobs in L.A. associated with science, technology, engineering, and
  mathematics. </p>






  <p>The Learning Equipment Supply Service is currently staffed by volunteers,
  including me,  in our spare time.  The skills that we practice in our
  sustaining day jobs directly relate to the services that I am proposing here;
  for example,  I’m an experienced lab technician at a fancy private school
  where I serve and support eight science teachers with their technical needs,
  and I have also been a middle school science teacher, a high school chemistry
  teacher, and an adjunct college chemistry instructor.  With the LA 2050 grant,
  we can bring our alreadypolished skills into the public school arena, to
  produce a better L.A. for 2050. </p>
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  <p>In March of 2013, we began lending lab equipment to the science teacher at
  YouthBuild Charter School in Pacoima. </p>






  <p>In March of 2013, we constructed a physics demonstration device and donated
  it to a physics teacher at University High School in Los Angeles.</p>






  <p>In February of 2013, we successfully arranged for a college chemistry major
  to volunteer as a teaching assistant and tutor in a local Los Angeles high
  school chemistry classroom (Humanitas Academy of Art and Technology, LAUSD). 
  The following month, we made this arrangement more permanent by establishing a
  formal partnership between that high school and EPIC (Educational
  Participation In Communities) of the California State University Los Angeles,
  whereby college students may earn academic credit for volunteer work at the
  high school. </p>






  <p>In February of 2013, we brought liquid nitrogen to four Los Angeles middle
  and high schools for use in demonstrations by teachers.  We also provided the
  teachers with appropriate safety gear when necessary. </p>






  <p>In January and February of 2013, we acquired valuable lab equipment
  donations from Dr. Vivian Medina of Baxter Bioscience.</p>






  <p>In January of 2013, we acquired valuable lab equipment donations from Luz
  Rivas of Iridescent Learning.</p>






  <p>In January of 2013 and in December of 2012, we planned and ran handson
  science activities sessions at the Zimmer Children's Museum.</p>






  <p>In October of 2012, we acquired valuable lab equipment donations from
  Pasadena City College.</p>






  <p>In August of 2012, we became a nonprofit project under the 501(c)3 auspices
  of the Education Consortium of Central Los Angeles, directed by Jacqueline
  Hamilton.</p>






  <p>In May of 2012, we lent our first piece of lab equipment to a public school
  physics teacher in Los Angeles (James Rice of Humanitas Academy of Art and
  Technology)</p>






  <p>In October of 2011, we opened as a private, profitseeking business.</p>

Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  <p>We will measure success by using beforeandafter teacher surveys, student
  surveys, and anonymous student grade averages.  I have budgeted for an
  independent consultant to evaluate our work, in order to maximize the
  impartiality and validity of our evaluation.</p>






  <p>Tentatively, I think the following metrics would be appropriate.  I have


   adapted these from the United States Navy’s STEM2Stern educational outreach program’s evaulation metrics document, located online at:

  postproject surveys</p>



  <p> Number of projectbased or other multimodality, innovative learning
  activities completed in class due to this project's assistance</p>
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  My project will support higher achievement in science in Los Angeles schools,
  and will contribute to the pipeline of scientists and engineers needed to
  replace the aging workforce in L.A.'s considerable technology and bioscience
  industries.  As many as 50% of the current workforce in those industries
  locally will become eligible to retire within the next five years.  A larger,
  more diverse pool of qualified engineers and others will benefit L.A.
  significantly over the long term.






  Further, increased familiarity and comfort with science at the middle 



  and high school level will increase the number and quality of local 



  applicants to college and technical programs.  A better, more diverse, 



  larger applicant pool will benefit technical employers in Los Angeles 



  such as Baxter Healthcare, Google, Grifols, SpaceX, others whose hiring needs
  are expected to increase in coming years.    






  In addition to this economic benefit to the area, my project may  



  create a better understanding of scientific issues among the general 



  public, including voters.  Such a voting public will have a better 



  understanding of how to evaluate what is presented in the media about science
  issues relating to public policy, such as energy generation, pollution,
  climate change, and many other issues.  






  My project empowers future, voting Angelenos by helping them to acquire the
  background knowledge that they will need to form wellreasoned opinions on
  local issues of electoral interest.
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  In  2050, science education in Los Angeles will be a model for the nation in
  the frequency and quality of handson activities at even the poorest of public
  schools.  Graduation rates will have seen significant, sustained increase at
  the many schools served by my 



  project.  For a couple of decades up to 2050, state and community 



  college science programs in Los Angeles will have been seeing larger 



  numbers of highcaliber students entering with focused interests in 



  science, and this trend will have encouraged these highered schools to
  increase the quality of their own science programs.  Students served by my
  project will raise the bar when it comes to science education.






  By 2050, my project will have evolved to provide services to schools to ensure
  that their own equipment is always inventoried, in good repair, and ready to
  use.  The project will also have expanded to  serve teachers in other
  disciplines such as mathematics, in addition to science.  State and school
  officials across the nation are developing a new set of curricular standards
  ("Common Core State Standards") which encourage handson activities in several
  different subjects.  The adoption of Common Core will have increased the need
  for support services like LESS, which will have evolved into better support
  for teachers learning to use projectbased and other innovative handson
  activities.






  In 2050, my idea's project will be continuing under someone else's 



  leadership (I'm 38 years old right now), and different funding sources 



  will have been identified.  By that time, the project will have been an 



  independent nonprofit organization for a few decades.  Some schools or maybe
  even LAUSD will have chosen to support the project as well.
