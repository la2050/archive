title: Gardens Gardens  Everywhere!
indicator: ' Environmental Quality'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  The Learning Garden wants to build a garden at every school, church, empty
  lot, public library, traffic median and every home in Los Angeles.   Over the
  ten years as one of the most vibrant school and community gardens in Los
  Angeles, The Learning Garden has learned that a garden is not just a place
  that grows wonderful organic fresh food which brings people to good health.  
  It is not just a place that grows medicinal herbs which not only cure illness
  but teach health care practitioners how and why each plant creates health in
  people.   It is not just a place where school children are exposed to nature,
  the knowledge of how to grow their own food, and learn about careers in
  nutrition, horticulture, science, art and ecology.   It is not just a place
  where people learn to grow their own cotton and flax, dye plants and the
  traditional art techniques to create both utile and artistic materials.   It
  is not just a place to save seeds from heirloom foods that are becoming
  extinct, helping to save our biodiversity.  It is not just a place that
  beautifies a neighborhood, adds oxygen to our air and reduces waste.  A garden
  is also a place that brings people together and even more profound — connects
  them to the earth.   It’s a place to celebrate each other — to share both
  knowledge and food  a place of “common ground” for young and old, rich and
  poor, men and women — a place that enriches the quality of life on every
  level. 



  While we chose the Indicator of Environmental quality, this project also
  impacts education, arts and cultural vitality, health, and social
  connectedness.  The mission of The Learning Garden is to bring back that
  connectedness to nature, and teach people the importance of plants in our
  lives.   By creating an outdoor learning center in an underutilized area of
  Venice High School, The Learning Garden offers handson education in
  horticulture, permaculture, herbology, botany, nutrition, art, photography,
  and environmental science to students and community.   It not only beautifies
  the community, but offers a place of peace and serenity in an often turbulent
  “concreted” world.



  In the ten years of existence, The Learning Garden has been instrumental in
  starting gardens in many other LAUSD schools by offering teacher training,
  workshops, starter plants, mulch and wood chips and volunteers.    Seeing
  amazing results, not only in the creation of gardens, but in the creation of
  supportive communities within our city, we now want more gardens in our city.



  Gardens, Gardens Everywhere is a project to make that happen.   With the
  funding we would receive from Good, we will facilitate the installation of a
  minimum of 10 gardens in interested communities throughout the city.  We will
  train project leaders to assist communities to build what THEY need in their
  community, offering classes, supplies, seeds, mulch, plants and helping them
  find their community volunteers and local businesses.    We will ask that
  groups fill out a questionnaire, commit to the project and to training and get
  a minimum of 20 people involved.   We will offer free monthly classes to
  inspire the participants what needs to be done each month.  We will supply
  tools for big work days and give each group funds for tools of their own.   We
  will supply mulch, compost, seedlings, seeds, trees, and workday food and
  water.   We will offer lifetime memberships to the Seed Library of Los Angeles
  so they will have access to nonGMO open pollinated seeds for their gardens.



  A project manager, together with the board of The Learning Garden, will design
  the application process, and criteria on which projects are chosen.   The
  project manager will also design the protocols of the lending tool library and
  all forms, and be responsible for the inventory.    A “propagation crew” will
  be hired to start seeds, transplant, propagate cuttings, graft trees, to
  create a huge resource of plant materials for the new gardens.   Any
  participant will be able to “intern” with the propagation crew to learn how to
  do this for their own garden.   A monthly class will be offered for all
  participants, and will be taught what to do in the garden that month, with
  hands on learning, and opportunity to have their specific questions answered
  by a highly respected horticulturist.    Each project will have its own
  project leader who will guide them in the design, implementation and
  sustainability of the garden.  



  We will also work with Good Karma Gardens, a payitforward operation that
  starts gardens in individual’s homes, whether in their yard, on their patio or
  roof.   The recipient of their labor would be expected to help install someone
  else’s garden in the near future.   Again, all individuals will be offered
  free monthly classes, and membership to the Seed Library of Los Angeles.  
  Good Karma Gardens will have access to the Lending Tool Library, seed, mulch,
  chips and plants, and a working fund for water and refreshments for work
  days. 
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >+
  The most important achievement of The Learning Garden is the continual growth
  of programs and gardens it has inspired over the past ten years.   With very
  little funding, The Learning Garden has demonstrated the true meaning of
  sustainability through community spirit and volunteerism.    Over 250 high
  school students a year are trained in organic horticulture, and many have
  pursued careers in horticulture related fields.  In our Seed to Sale program,
  students learn the process from planting to harvesting to selling at the local
  Farmers Market.    Our art students regularly use the garden to draw and
  paint. The science classes are out in the compost piles learning the nitrogen
  and phosphorus cycles.



  We have inspired and supported gardens at many of our feeder schools so that
  garden curriculum is developing from Kindergarten thru High School.  



  The Learning Garden has one of the most extensive Chinese Medicinal gardens in
  the country and our local Traditional Chinese Medicine schools are trained
  from seed to harvest to medicinal use at our garden by world experts.   Our
  Native Californian and Succulent gardens are works of beauty and an example
  for homeowner to strive for in water wise gardening. This year, our Natural
  Arts Garden is in the process of being installed and will be home for classes
  in weaving, dying, painting, all with natural fibers and dyes.    Upcoming
  plans include simple designs for water catchment and water gardens as
  demonstration for homeowners to emulate.    We offer classes through UCLA
  extension and the UC Davis Master Garden programs, as well as our own Victory
  Garden classes and regular gardening, tai chi, chi gong and cooking classes.  
  The Learning Garden works with organizations such as Occupy Venice and
  Sivananda Yoga to make sure that all extra food goes to those in need.   



  Our community events, including the Spring Equinox Celebration, the July 4th
  Ice Cream Social (with ice cream made from the garden), Pesto Day (our garlic
  and basil whipped into a heavenly meal) and our Winter Solstice all bring
  together our community in celebration.    We also sponsor, with Transition Mar
  Vista/Venice, a 100 Mile Meal, stressing the importance of eating locally. 
  Most important, our weekly potlucks create a regular and safe place for people
  of all kinds to join together to share their garden foods.  





Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  The Learning Garden partners with many organizations and will promote this
  project through all its venues.  For this project, we will work with SLOLA,
  Transition Towns, Tree People and Good Karma Gardens.   The Seed Library of
  Los Angeles will supply seeds for the seedlings as well as seeds for the
  gardens directly.   Good Karma Gardens will supervise the installation of
  individual gardens.  We will work with the Transition groups to offer
  reskilling and repurposing workshops, Little Free Library builds, cooking and
  canning classes, and other interests.    We will contact Tree People for large
  tree donations and Better for help with water catchment designs.  We will
  create contacts with local businesses in each area for additional support.
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  The first measure of success would be the physical completion of 10 garden
  projects throughout the city.   Each project leader will document the process
  and participants will be asked to write about their experience in the
  process.    A blog page on The Learning Garden website will be created for
  each garden to document ongoing progress.    The true measure of success will
  be the yearly reports and stories of the effect the garden has on its
  community, and the programs and other gardens it inspires.
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
  The building of neighborhood gardens in the vastness of Los Angeles will help
  the city in many ways.  We have learned over the last ten years that a garden
  that is shared by community and students builds a strong support system.    It
  beautifies the city, creating green lush food and flower gardens, adding trees
  and community gathering areas.   Growing and eating locally helps the ecology,
  reduces the carbon footprint, reduces excess trash, and creates healthier
  individuals.  Most importantly, it creates community;   a garden has no limits
  as to age, race, gender, creed, culture or color, or economic status.  A
  garden brings together people at an equal level to work together and develop
  trust and support.   It reconnects people to each other, making our city rich
  in positive relationships working toward the good of the community, not just
  the individual.   It will bring educational opportunities to schools ,
  churches and neighborhoods.    Each garden will exemplify the culture of the
  community around it and the network of gardens will share knowledge across the
  city to each other.


What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >+
  Imagine a Los Angeles of the future with gardens on every block, in every
  school, church, office building, roof top  everywhere!  Gardens which are rich
  in food and beauty bringing nature back into everyone’s lives   how could this
  not be good?   Communities will be brought together with the common goal of
  growing food, herbs and flowers that will benefit their own neighborhoods.  
  Eating local will be as local as it can be which benefits our ecology in so
  many ways:  reducing traffic, oil consumption, the carbon foot print and
  adding oxygen into the air.  People will be healthier from eating fresh
  organic produce and working the land in their spare time.  Our retired and
  elderly will have purpose, as well as a community that supports them.  People
  in need will have access to fresh food and herbs.  Our children will learn
  through the garden — science, art, nutrition, ecology, respect for nature and
  community,  naturally and profoundly. And the most important thing that we
  have found — people will connect to each other and resilient communities will
  evolve.    Resilience is the quality that will see us through all that may
  face us in 2050, whether due to climate change, peak oil results, earthquakes
  and fires, economic collapse, or anything that will challenge us as a
  people.    At The Learning Garden, we have seen remarkable changes in ten
  years.  We can only imagine what the next 37 could manifest if we start now.
