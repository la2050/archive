  brief: "Angelenos are hungry for community, face-to-face.  For nearly 40 years Liberty Hill has been bringing communities together across race, class, gender, sexuality and geography, but we’ve been doing this on a relatively small scale. Now, we see a huge opportunity to advance community-building to a new scale by the Impact Professionals who will build the L.A. of 2050. \r\n\r\nWhen Liberty Hill has brought these Impact Professionals together whether they are nonprofit staff, tech-savvy social entrepreneurs, community organizers, elected officials, or Angelenos who simply want to “do good,” they have asked us for more, more! Liberty Hill’s L.A. Boot Camp 2050 for Change is our answer.  \r\n\r\nWe propose to host a series of pop-up events in the next seven months in partnership with dozens of our grantees whose roots in L.A.’s low income and minority communities run deep in order to recruit and galvanize a new generation of idealists.  \r\n\r\nThese pop-up events will be inspired and fun gathering places for people to begin to learn “the science” of social change. Most people - no matter how much good they want to do - don’t know the lessons of community organizing or how to strategically advance change in their communities, let alone across Los Angeles. \r\n\r\nFor the last several years Liberty Hill has had a training program specifically designed to help individuals strengthen their skills in making change. We will recruit this Next Generation of Idealists into a Boot Camp 2050 for Change –a hands-on, practical training. It’s part “TEDx for Social Justice,” part roll-up-your-sleeves, nuts and bolts, “here’s how you make change” training. \r\n"
  budget explanation: "Approximately 83% of Liberty Hill’s overall resources are invested in program costs, 9% is allocated for administrative costs and the remaining 8% supports fundraising costs. As a result, the strategic communications department at Liberty Hill strives to achieve its goals without having a marketing budget.\r\n\r\nLiberty Hill has compensated by becoming savvy in social media campaigns. We have learned to identify our power users, fans and followers who are influencers in the community and give them certain campaign management responsibilities such as curating content, updating posts, etc.  Social media marketing which is far less expensive to create and maintain than traditional advertising campaigns has helped increase our visibility.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity before us with this grant is to invest in marketing that will dramatically scale up the support for a social media campaign to augment the outcomes of our Boot Camp 2050 for Change.\r\n\r\nLiberty Hill will invest this grant equally between marketing (50%) and program expenses (50%) for our Boot Camp 2050 for Change.\r\nThe following is a detailed budget for this grant\r\n\r\nOrganizational Budget $4,393,495\r\n\r\nBoot Camp 2050 for Change Project Budget $100,000\r\n\r\nRequest to LA2050 \r\n\r\nSalaries\t           \t                                                          15,000 \r\nEmployee Benefits\t             \t                                    2,300 \r\nTotal Personnel\t           \t                                        $17,300 \r\n \t\t \r\nEvent Expenses (3-5 events held by 12/31/2013)\t$27,700\r\n\r\nMarketing:\t             \t                                                $50,000         \r\n---Publicity/Public Relations\r\n---Copywriting\r\n---Creative Services\r\n---Publishing/Printing\r\n---Website design and maintenance\r\n---Design and Packaging Services\r\n---Brand Support\r\n---Consulting Services\r\n---Event support, Graphs & Signs\r\n     \r\nTotal Nonpersonnel costs\t           \t                      77,700 \r\n \t\t \r\nTotal Administrative Expenses\t             \t              $5,000 \r\n \t\t \r\nTotal Expenses\t           \t                                  $100,000 \r\n"

    We will partner with Liberty Hill grantees and their allies in order to plan
    and host events that represent the diversity of the Liberty Hill community
    and inspire Impact Professionals and other Next Generation idealists to meet
    each other and begin to collaborate on campaigns for change. 
  success: >-
    Initial outcomes will be measured by tracking the number of people who
    participate at the events, the number of people who participate in the Boot
    Camp 2050 for Change, and the scale of the social media reach generated by
    this unprecedented partnership of community organizations and Impact
    Professionals.

  description3: "Liberty Hill’s model of (1) grants, (2) capacity-building training and (3) alliance building is unique for southern California public foundations.  Over time our own grantees grow their organizational capacity and while they no longer need support from Liberty Hill, they engage funders who support Liberty Hill.  This is the closest we can come to defining a pool of competitors. We see this growth as opportunity.\r\n\r\nWe believe in collaborative leadership and we engage our grantees and other larger institutions who might be considered “competition” in alliance building. By pooling our resources and the talent of our people we can achieve much greater gains than working in isolation."
  vision: "Success in 2050 will be measurable in several incremental improvements in the quality of life in Los Angeles.   By laying the groundwork in Social Connectedness now, some examples of success might be evidenced by:\r\n\r\n•\tAdvancing EDUCATION reform that will reward success and not punish youth\r\n•\tExpansion of green spaces and clean air quality, two fundamental ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY improvements which will reduce environmentally-related cases of asthma and cancer\r\n•\tImproving access to HEALTH care services and well-being opportunities\r\n•\tAmplifying the voices of marginal communities in the ARTS and strengthening CULTURAL VITALITY by making LA the venue of choice for creative thinkers and innovators\r\n•\tLifting the most vulnerable low-wage workers our of poverty through increased INCOME & EMPLOYMENT opportunities\r\n•\tSafeguarding affordable HOUSING stock\r\n•\tIncreasing PUBLIC SAFETY through community centered policing and common sense neighborhood restoration\r\n"

  L.A. needs a social force to bring the next generation of idealists into
  conversation and action. This proposal will bring together Impact
  Professionals and grassroots leaders representing a cross section of race,
