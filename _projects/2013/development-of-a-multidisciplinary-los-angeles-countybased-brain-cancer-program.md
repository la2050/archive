  Development of a Multidisciplinary Los Angeles CountyBased Brain Cancer
  Program 
project_summary: >-
  The multidisciplinary Neuro-Oncology program at LAC+USC is one of the few in
  all of Southern California to provide multidisciplinary care to complex brain
  tumor patients, and the only designated Los Angeles County facility to do the
  same.  The establishment of this clinic has streamlined care for chronically
  ill patients with brain cancer, and the demands placed on accommodating
  patients within this clinic highlights the need for this integral service to
  the population of LA County as a whole.  Over the past decade, we have treated
  thousands of patients with complex benign and malignant brain and spine tumors
  using various combinations of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, and have
  always strived to maintain the highest comparable standards with regard to
  quality of care as we have done for patients at our affiliated USC Norris
  Cancer Center (one of three National Cancer Institute-designated Cancer
  Centers in Southern California).  Perhaps most importantly, we have maintained
  an open door policy in treating all-comer patients with brain cancer referred
  from dozens of hospitals all over Southern California, and have never turned a
  patient with the diagnosis of a brain tumor away based on insurance or
  socioeconomic status.  We have enrolled hundreds of patients in some of the
  latest and most promising clinical trials available worldwide. Our program has
  been the major site of the Los Angeles County Cancer Surveillance Program, and
  chronicles information on all new cancer cases in LA County (approximately
  30,000 patients per year). The LA County Cancer Surveillance Program is now
  the largest contributing registry to the NCI-funded Surveillance,
  Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program.  Many of our Brain Tumor Center
  physicians are internationally recognized for their contributions to patient
  care and clinical-translational research, and have won numerous awards in
  recognition of their research contributions.  Finally, clinician-scientists in
  our group have published numerous peer-reviewed research articles pertaining
  to novel treatments for brain tumors (such as inhaled therapies and vaccine
  trials), healthcare disparities and trends relating to brain tumors, and brain
  tumor genomics studies.

  Indicator: ' Health'
  brief: "     Being diagnosed with a brain tumor is a life-changing and potentially harrowing experience that greatly affects patients and families alike.  The treatment of brain tumors is inherently complex, and requires streamlined management by a variety of healthcare practitioners (physicians, nurses, rehabilitation specialists, social workers, hospice workers, etc.)  Patients diagnosed with brain tumors are often young and otherwise healthy and productive members of society that may suddenly transition to requiring frequent and chronic care, resulting in reduced workforce participation and mandating a variety of additional support services.  The physical, financial, and emotional burdens on patients diagnosed with brain cancer, as well as their families, are further exacerbated when they are constrained by complex socioeconomic factors. \r\n\tNumerous studies have identified significant healthcare disparities with regard to access to care and treatment outcomes in brain tumor patients with lower socioeconomic or minority status, less education, and no insurance (Curry WT, Neurosurgery, 2010 and Mukherjee D, J Clin Neurosci, 2013).  For brain tumor patients with such disadvantages, following complex treatment regimens (such as chemotherapy, daily radiation therapy, or clinical trials) and navigating a complex healthcare system composed of fragmented clinics and/or hospitals or non-native languages can be especially disheartening.  These factors, coupled with the neurological deficits often caused by these tumors (such as paralysis or language/memory deficits) makes adherence to complex medical regimens even more of a struggle.  It is therefore no surprise that many patients with socioeconomic disadvantages receiving brain tumor care have a difficult time making all their appointments (often several per week), or adhering to physician recommendations, sometimes resulting in delays in time-sensitive care.  \r\n\tThe LA County+USC Medical Center is the largest public hospital in Southern California, serving as a safety net institution and providing quality healthcare to millions of underserved and indigent Angelenos and other U.S. and world citizens.  In January 2013, a group of Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center and Keck School of Medicine of USC physicians decided to form a multidisciplinary Brain Tumor/ Neuro-Oncology Clinic at LAC+USC in an attempt to streamline care for patients with complex primary brain tumors being treated at all LA County facilities.  The weekly LAC+USC Brain Tumor Clinic staffed by these physicians receives patient referrals from any LA County-DHS sites AND OTHER LA HOSPITALS, thus serving as the ONLY centralized multidisciplinary Neuro-Oncology clinic for LA county residents.  Patients have access to neurologists, neuro-oncologists, neurosurgeons, and radiation-oncologists during the SAME clinic visit, allowing the panel of physicians to discuss best-practice treatment options as a team, rather than fragmenting this care over several visits and potentially weeks or months.  Furthermore, the clinic allows ALL patients to access the same therapeutic clinical trials as first-rate private academic institutions and cancer centers, which is a factor that has independently been associated with prolonged survival in patients with brain cancer (Shahar T, J Clin Neurosci, 2012).  Although the Brain Tumor Clinic at LAC+USC was designed to accommodate a maximum of 12 patients per day, it is already overbooked to 15-18 patients per clinic for the next 3 months, demonstrating the dire need for this integral service in LA County.  \t\r\n\tOur primary aim is to develop a world-class multi-disciplinary Brain Tumor/Neuro-Oncology Center of Excellence that will provide all LA County patients, regardless of insurance status, race, or education level with the same access to quality care for years to come.  The development of a formal program at LAC+USC will ensure that this service is centralized at the County’s primary safety-net institution for decades.  Support from the LA2050 grant will be used to develop a LA County Neuro-Oncology Center of Excellence, support a clinical nursing navigator/coordinator, manage a prospective patient database, create a program website and referral system, and provide seed money for researching brain tumor genomics and healthcare disparities in patients with brain tumors.  \r\n     By 2050, the potential for healthcare delivery in complex medical problems such as brain tumors to become even more disparate is a sad but sobering reality.  Most indigent LA County patients with brain tumors do not have the luxury of visiting several practitioners or “shopping around” for their care.  The potential to establish a Brain Tumor Center of Excellence embedded in our County’s largest public medical center is likely to at least partially offset this disparity, and help ensure that all patients with brain tumors in LA have access to the same basic care, clinical trials, and rapidly-evolving therapies."
  budget explanation: "We aim to develop a sustainable Brain Tumor Program within 2 years following funding from the LA2050 grant.  The $100,000 will be implemented immediately to develop aspects of a program that will, over the next 1-2 years, allow the program to demonstrate improvement in several key benchmark indicators, increase clinical volume and ancillary support staff, and generate quality research, all in an effort to secure future independent grant and clinical trial support.  \r\n\r\nThe $100,000 will be allocated as follows:\r\n\r\n$30,000 will be used to support a nurse navigator/clinical program coordinator for 1 year. \r\n\r\n$20,000 will be used to develop a clinical patient database and database support system.\r\n\r\n$10,000 will be used to develop a DHS-LAC Brain Tumor and Neuro-Oncology website, to inform referring physicians and provide a means for patient referral.\r\n\r\n$40,000 will be used as seed money for LAC+USC based brain tumor research, focusing on brain tumor genomics and healthcare disparity research.  Brain tumor research will focus on genetic factors causing the development and progression of brain tumors such as glioblastoma multiforme, meningiomas, and others, and will be performed in collaboration with the USC Epigenome Center and Zilkha Neurogenetic Institute at USC.  Healthcare disparities research will focus on the National Inpatient Sample database and LA County Cancer Surveillance Program (which is based at USC), and identifying key barriers to equal healthcare access as well as cost-effectiveness research within these systems.  Funding will additionally be used to purchase data access and to support a biostatistician for these projects.\r\n"

    This project will benefit Los Angeles in several ways.  First and foremost,
    it will improve direct care to the thousands of Angelenos who already have
    existing benign and malignant brain tumors by developing the
    multidisciplinary Neuro-Oncology program at LAC+USC.  LAC+USC Medical Center
    is one of the busiest public hospitals in the western United States and the
    largest single provider of health care in Los Angeles County.  LAC+USC
    records nearly 39,000 inpatient discharges, 150,000 emergency department
    visits, and 1 million ambulatory care visits each year.  Secondly, it will
    help ensure that all residents of LA County have future access to a
    specialized Neuro-Oncology care, physicians, clinical trials, and emerging
    therapies for years to come, so that care provided to LAC+USC patients is on
    par with any National Cancer Center.  When new therapies for brain cancer do
    emerge, having the infrastructure in place to efficiently deliver care to
    patients with brain cancer will be critical; The proposed clinic will help
    with streamlined care delivery.  Thirdly, it will help develop a Center of
    Excellence in LA County for many years to come, serving as a structural
    model and network for additional specialty centers to develop.  Finally,
    research that emerges from this program may have indirect benefits for LA
    residents with brain tumors for years to come.  Although complete
    elimination of healthcare disparities in Los Angeles by 2050 is a daunting
    task, we aim to serve as a model program for how a group of
    practitioners/providers with converging goals for patients can be a Center
    of Excellence despite limited resources, and reduce healthcare disparities
    within our treatment focus area.

    Although our competition is technically other hospitals in LA County who
    also provide medical care to patients with complex brain tumors, we do not
    consider any of these institutions as our competition for several reasons. 
    Because LAC+USC is a “quaternary” academic referral center and a safety-net
    institution, we generally see patients that for one reason or another (i.e.
    level of complexity or loss of/no insurance) are no longer offered treatment
    at their original hospital and are subsequently referred to us.  As
    mentioned, we are the only designated DHS-LA County multidisciplinary clinic
    devoted entirely to Neuro-Oncology, and are in this respect a truly unique
    entity in Southern California worth fostering and developing.  As such, we
    work closely with treating and referring physicians and nurses at hospitals
    across Southern California to accommodate patients into the LAC+USC Brain
    Tumor clinic.  We therefore view our role as more of a complimentary and
    reinforcing institution to all other LA County provider locations, rather
    than being in direct competition with these centers.  At the same time, we
    aim to provide the highest standards of care possible for our patients, and
    maintain our goal of providing equal access to a comparable quality of
    multimodality care that patients with brain cancer can receive at any
    private institution in Los Angeles.  Our goals are directly in line with,
    and may potentially serve as a model, for improving healthcare disparities
    and eliminating barriers to quality care within LA County by 2050 and
    perhaps even by 2015.
  vision: "True success regarding health in malignant brain tumors will mean finding a CURE for this disease by 2050.  This can only be achieved through high-quality RESEARCH AND CLINICAL STUDIES.  In addition, finding risk factors for brain tumors (such as genes, environmental factors, social factors, etc.) may help in preventing brain cancer or identifying individuals who are at particular risk for developing these tumors, and thereby increasing surveillance and providing earlier treatment.  \r\nRealistically, however, if a promising clinical trial, emerging therapy, or even cure was to be developed for malignant brain tumors today, the time to dissemination into public county-based hospitals may lag behind some private institutions.  Development of a Neuro-Oncology Center of Excellence in the LA County system would provide an INFRASTRUCTURE FOR DELIVERING EQUAL ACCESS TO THE LATEST THERAPIES, cure or not, within the LA County referral network. Based on national healthcare trends and prior research studies, it has been shown that centralized/specialized care sites for complex diseases such as brain tumors provide the best outcomes for patients possible.  By 2050, prespecified Centers of Excellence may very well be the referral sites for a majority of patients with newly diagnosed conditions.  As such, a major parameter of success over the next several decades would be to become such a Center of Excellence and to minimize or eliminate healthcare disparity as it relates to availability of brain cancer treatment in LA.  By 2050, we aim to be a first-rate national and international Center of Excellence in Neuro-Oncology housed within a public county institution, ensuring that the latest therapies, such as vaccines, stem cell treatments, and drugs are delivered in a timely fashion to patients without regard to socioeconomic status, race, or neighborhood.\r\n\r\n"
