title: 'EMA PLAY:  Dance Create Think Make the Future'
indicator: Arts & Cultural Vitality
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >+
  The Electronic Music Alliance (EMA) is a 501c3 nonprofit and a global alliance
  of dance music fans and artists, uniting the electronic dance music community
  to be the "Sound of Change." We organize around issues important to the
  community, cultivating, collaborating, and celebrating social and
  environmental responsibility, volunteerism and our culture. 






  Our idea for LA2050 would be an event we will refer to as PLAY.






  PLAY -would be a community sustainability, futurist, art, music, and cultural
  event will be held at LA Center Studios in downtown LA in the Fall of 2013. 
  LA Center studios is an old oil company headquarters that was transformed into
  an eco-conscious movie studios.  






  PLAY -is a free event to the Angeleno community and a chance to unite the
  diversity of our city through electronic dance music, art (digital visual,
  live art, and installations).  Electronic dance music (edm) festivals already
  have one of the most diverse crowds for any musical genre.  All musical
  artists and attendees of electronic music events are extremely creative and
  typically forward thinking. Electronic Music festivals are currently some of
  the biggest festivals in the world and the popularity of our music style is
  increasing exponentially amongst the youth here in the U.S. 






  PLAY would be a showcase of Los Angeles's most talented and artistic
  individuals and thinkers.  The idea would be to create art and discussion
  about the future in an interactive manner to inspire and spark further
  discussion and action through interactive "play".






  What we hope to create at PLAY is a chance to bridge the ages of our audience
  by creating an event that is inclusive of all age ranges within our musical
  genre which is comprised of numerous sub-genres.  We want this to be an event
  that both parents and their kids would like to attend.  We would hope to
  create something that could turn into a World's Fair or SXSW.  LA deserves
  that.






  The first year would concentrate on people being at the studios and having the
  event concentrated in the Vortex Dome (where we do 3D visual mapping), the
  beaudry building, and the streets below.  Overtime we see this event spilling
  into other areas of the the studio as well as downtown.






  PLAY will be an event for the future.  A chance to talk openly about current
  events and future projections through panels but in a fun format.  The most
  important thing we believe is we just need to make the education about the
  future accessible, not intimidating, and fun.  We believe this can really only
  be achieved by integrating music and art into the event. 


What are some of your organizationâ€™s most important achievements to date?: >+
  We are still a young organization.  We worked hard last year to get over 100
  founding industry and cultural veterans to come on board as our founding
  members. 






  We have also made many key collaborative partners such as E-stewards for our
  Ewaste program and The Center for Conscious Creativity in downtown LA.






  We know we have changed the lives of individuals through personal testimonials
  and we truly believe we are doing good work.  We have inspired both people and
  organizations to consider the environment and our other responsibilities back
  to society.  A few of our industry partners, RaveReady.com & RollRandom now
  adds "green tips" into their newsletters, and the retail stores for Emazing
  Lights are working with us in the development of our Ewaste program.






  Last September we were co-sponsor of "State of the Arts" at the Center for
  Conscious Creativity:






  STATE OF THE ARTS - AMPLIFY! turns up the volume on emerging arts and media
  trends in this one-of-a-kind immersive symposium, exploring the critical
  impact of human creativity on digital innovation, with a deep focus on 21st
  century education and the accelerating convergence of traditional
  entertainment with groundbreaking content and formats.  You'll experience the
  extraordinary power of fulldome immersive cinema during the conference,
  engulfed by phenomenal planetarium programming, vivid music visuals and
  stunning live dance productions.  This is storytelling at its most innovative
  and transformative.  






  This year we are pleased to plant the seed of a new idea incubated by the c3
  called f2: FUTUREFEST, in the form of an experiential showcase featuring
  cutting-edge immersive entertainment, technology exhibits, an arts and
  performance showcase; music, dance, 360 film, and new forms of educational
  experiences in LA's first ever fulldome immersive showcase.

  Member list for any support they can provide personally or through their
  companies and affiliations.
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  Success will be measured by attendance and the interaction we are able to
  spark from our attendees before, during, and after the event through a
  dedicated hashtags and other social media response. We will also measure
  success by how many people sign up for volunteer opportunities with us (and
  our collaborative alliance non-profit member organizations) during and after
  the event.
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
  Los Angeles will benefit by having a culturally diverse event that they can
  attend for free.  






  Los Angeles based chosen artists will benefit from being showcased.






  Some downtown (mainly restaurant and club) businesses will benefit from
  increased business.






  The City of Los Angeles will benefit from having a cultural event that will
  inspire attending Angelenos to participate in our future.






  All showcased artists and vendors will be LA based.





What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  Success in 2050 would look like all 50 states having their own PLAY events
  that have spawned off of the annual PLAY event we seek to create here in our
  hometown of Los Angeles!






  We see this being an annual event Angelenos will look forward to attending
  every year.  Over the years we would like to see this event take over downtown
  like a SXSW, slowly building it out and showcasing the art and culture of our
  beloved Angelenos.
