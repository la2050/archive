title: 'EMA PLAY:  Dance Create Think Make the Future'
project_summary: "The Electronic Music Alliance (EMA) is a 501c3 nonprofit and a global alliance of dance music fans and artists, uniting the electronic dance music community to be the \"Sound of Change.\" We organize around issues important to the community, cultivating, collaborating, and celebrating social and environmental responsibility, volunteerism and our culture. \r\n\r\nOur idea for LA2050 would be an event we will refer to as PLAY.\r\n\r\nPLAY -would be a community sustainability, futurist, art, music, and cultural event will be held at LA Center Studios in downtown LA in the Fall of 2013.  LA Center studios is an old oil company headquarters that was transformed into an eco-conscious movie studios.  \r\n\r\nPLAY -is a free event to the Angeleno community and a chance to unite the diversity of our city through electronic dance music, art (digital visual, live art, and installations).  Electronic dance music (edm) festivals already have one of the most diverse crowds for any musical genre.  All musical artists and attendees of electronic music events are extremely creative and typically forward thinking. Electronic Music festivals are currently some of the biggest festivals in the world and the popularity of our music style is increasing exponentially amongst the youth here in the U.S. \r\n\r\nPLAY would be a showcase of Los Angeles's most talented and artistic individuals and thinkers.  The idea would be to create art and discussion about the future in an interactive manner to inspire and spark further discussion and action through interactive \"play\".\r\n\r\nWhat we hope to create at PLAY is a chance to bridge the ages of our audience by creating an event that is inclusive of all age ranges within our musical genre which is comprised of numerous sub-genres.  We want this to be an event that both parents and their kids would like to attend.  We would hope to create something that could turn into a World's Fair or SXSW.  LA deserves that.\r\n\r\nThe first year would concentrate on people being at the studios and having the event concentrated in the Vortex Dome (where we do 3D visual mapping), the beaudry building, and the streets below.  Overtime we see this event spilling into other areas of the the studio as well as downtown.\r\n\r\nPLAY will be an event for the future.  A chance to talk openly about current events and future projections through panels but in a fun format.  The most important thing we believe is we just need to make the education about the future accessible, not intimidating, and fun.  We believe this can really only be achieved by integrating music and art into the event. \r\n"

    Success will be measured by attendance and the interaction we are able to
    spark from our attendees before, during, and after the event through a
    dedicated hashtags and other social media response. We will also measure
    success by how many people sign up for volunteer opportunities with us (and
    our collaborative alliance non-profit member organizations) during and after
    the event.

  The Electronic Music Alliance (EMA) is a 501c3 nonprofit and a global alliance
  of dance music fans and artists, uniting the electronic dance music community
  to be the "Sound of Change." We organize around issues important to the
  community, cultivating, collaborating, and celebrating social and
  environmental responsibility, volunteerism and our culture. 






  Our idea for LA2050 would be an event we will refer to as PLAY.






  PLAY -would be a community sustainability, futurist, art, music, and cultural
  event will be held at LA Center Studios in downtown LA in the Fall of 2013. 
  LA Center studios is an old oil company headquarters that was transformed into
  an eco-conscious movie studios.  






  PLAY -is a free event to the Angeleno community and a chance to unite the
  diversity of our city through electronic dance music, art (digital visual,
  live art, and installations).  Electronic dance music (edm) festivals already
  have one of the most diverse crowds for any musical genre.  All musical
  artists and attendees of electronic music events are extremely creative and
  typically forward thinking. Electronic Music festivals are currently some of
  the biggest festivals in the world and the popularity of our music style is
  increasing exponentially amongst the youth here in the U.S. 






  PLAY would be a showcase of Los Angeles's most talented and artistic
  individuals and thinkers.  The idea would be to create art and discussion
  about the future in an interactive manner to inspire and spark further
  discussion and action through interactive "play".






  What we hope to create at PLAY is a chance to bridge the ages of our audience
  by creating an event that is inclusive of all age ranges within our musical
  genre which is comprised of numerous sub-genres.  We want this to be an event
  that both parents and their kids would like to attend.  We would hope to
  create something that could turn into a World's Fair or SXSW.  LA deserves
  that.






  The first year would concentrate on people being at the studios and having the

  beaudry building, and the streets below.  Overtime we see this event spilling
  into other areas of the the studio as well as downtown.

  future accessible, not intimidating, and fun.  We believe this can really only
  be achieved by integrating music and art into the event. 


What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >+
  We are still a young organization.  We worked hard last year to get over 100
  founding industry and cultural veterans to come on board as our founding
  members. 






  We have also made many key collaborative partners such as E-stewards for our
  Ewaste program and The Center for Conscious Creativity in downtown LA.






  We know we have changed the lives of individuals through personal testimonials
  and we truly believe we are doing good work.  We have inspired both people and
  organizations to consider the environment and our other responsibilities back
  to society.  A few of our industry partners, RaveReady.com & RollRandom now
  adds "green tips" into their newsletters, and the retail stores for Emazing
  Lights are working with us in the development of our Ewaste program.






  Last September we were co-sponsor of "State of the Arts" at the Center for
  Conscious Creativity:






  STATE OF THE ARTS - AMPLIFY! turns up the volume on emerging arts and media
  trends in this one-of-a-kind immersive symposium, exploring the critical
  impact of human creativity on digital innovation, with a deep focus on 21st
  century education and the accelerating convergence of traditional
  entertainment with groundbreaking content and formats.  You'll experience the
  extraordinary power of fulldome immersive cinema during the conference,
  engulfed by phenomenal planetarium programming, vivid music visuals and
  stunning live dance productions.  This is storytelling at its most innovative
  and transformative.  






  This year we are pleased to plant the seed of a new idea incubated by the c3
  called f2: FUTUREFEST, in the form of an experiential showcase featuring
  cutting-edge immersive entertainment, technology exhibits, an arts and
  performance showcase; music, dance, 360 film, and new forms of educational
  experiences in LA's first ever fulldome immersive showcase.

  beloved Angelenos.
