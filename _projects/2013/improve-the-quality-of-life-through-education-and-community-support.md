title: Improve The Quality of Life Through Education and Community Support
project_summary: "We currently have a 100% success rate in graduates from our Bright Futures Scholars Leadership Development program. They have ALL graduated from high school and moved on to college. Many of these students come from group home or foster home environments. Many of these same students are also the first ones to attend college from their families.\r\n\r\nOne of our other programs is a second chance program that allows juvenile first offenders an opportunity to turn their lives around. These Juveniles, referred into the program from the Juvenile Justice System are given an opportunity to redeem themselves, build self-esteem, and develop character while learning to make positive life choices. Many have taken that opportunity that they were given and done just that. Most of them have gone on to college and are living a life \"on the straight and narrow\"."

  success: "Our success will be evaluated and measured by the high school and college graduation rates of our program participants. We maintain contact with all of our participants long past their graduation from this program and high school. We regular check up on our graduates to check on their college progress and success, including graduation from college as well.\r\n\r\nIt will also be measured by the continued growth of this program and ultimately the reduction of the high school drop-out rates in this community through our Stars for Stripes program and the increase in graduation rates of juveniles who go through this program."
  Organization Name: 'Quality of Life Center, Inc.'
  Indicator: ' Education'
  brief: "The Quality of Life Center, Inc., a charitable, community based non-profit agency, was established in 2004. The specific purpose of the agency is to institute programs that will educate urban communities on the availability of assistance to low-income, at risk youth and families residing in the Altadena, Pasadena and surrounding areas. The Quality of Life Center, Inc.'s mission is to develop and manage centers with multi-cultural programs and services designed to ensure that opportunities for success are equally shared by all participants with a desire to improve their quality of life. Through Art and Education we reach out to our youth and our communities.\r\n\r\nQuality of Life Center, Inc. programs mark a bold departure from traditional guidance programming. Through innovative instruction and individualized attention, youth travel a road to success that begins with believing in themselves and never giving up on the fact that success is yours for the taking. Though our programs somewhat defy the norm, they are now \"nationally acclaimed\" and have proven to be extremely successful in meeting the needs and providing youth an opportunity to prove to themselves that honesty and hard work can and will bring about positive life changes.\r\n\r\nMany of our youth programs address: youth who are dropping out of school, depressed, some with no sense of self worth, and others turning to the \"streets\" for love and understanding. Some are trapped in situations in which they have had no chance to follow their dream. \"If we don't help them, who will?\r\n\r\nOur nationally esteemed Bright Futures Scholars program participants are brilliant scholars with extremely high GPA&'s. Quality of Life Center programs are designed to assist the young, enabling them to become productive citizens, build self esteem, dream and then conquer their most \"impossible\" dream.\r\n\r\nWithout programs such as the ones offered in the Quality of Life Center, Inc., one out of every three low-income minority students attending high school will drop-out before earning a diploma (2005 PUSD Statistic). Most will not be encouraged to return to school, nor offered pre-training to become marketable in corporate America. Many students, even young scholars, if coming from low-income families will not have an opportunity to reach their full potential and scores of juvenile first offenders will be placed in the justice system.\r\n\r\nMuch of our programming depends on community support. We are proud to say that our programs are endorsed by community leaders who see the value in what is being accomplished to direct positive changes in the future of our communities. The National Education Association (NEA), as well as many surrounding school districts, plan to foster pilot programs using Quality of Life Center Inc. components in 2008.\r\n\r\nAt the Quality of Life Center, we have an opportunity to service families with many different needs. We will strive not only to meet the needs but to eliminate the problems causing the need.\r\n\r\nThe Quality of Life Center will continue to make every effort to assist the youth, young adults and families in low income at-risk communities by providing services that improve the quality of life for all."

    We are unlike any other organization in this and the surrounding
    communities. Most other organizations focus solely on the kids who are doing
    poorly but our organization's biggest program is focusing on the high
    achieving (3.0+ GPA) students in the lower and extremely low income brackets
    who might otherwise become distracted and drop out of school. They have no
    organizations that are their for them. Our goal is to keep them in school
    and help them to realize all the opportunities that are out their for them.
  vision: >-
    In the year 2050 success would be represented by many things: 1. Our Bright
    Futures Scholars Leadership Development Program curriculum will be in every
    middle and high school in the nation. These school will see an increase in
    the graduation rates of at least 15%.  2. Graduates of these programs will
    not only be successful in their personal lives but have a desire to give
    back and improve their communities stemming back to their volunteering while
    being a part of the Quality of Life Center, Inc. Their desire is to improve
    the quality of life of others.   3. Our mentors will still consist of
    community leaders such as senators, congressmen and women, assembly members,
    county supervisors, mayors, council members, corporate executives, doctors,
    lawyers, judges, local schools superintendents, law enforcement and others,
    but now those faces will be the faces of graduates of BFS who are themselves
    giving back to others what was given to them in their teenage years, which
    will make their messages and experiences even more poignant because they
    truly did come from where the current year 2050 students are coming from.

  The Quality of Life Center, Inc., a charitable, community based nonprofit
  agency, was established in 2004. The specific purpose of the agency is to
  institute programs that will educate urban communities on the availability of
  assistance to lowincome, at risk youth and families residing in the Altadena,
  Pasadena and surrounding areas. The Quality of Life Center, Inc.'s mission is
  to develop and manage centers with multicultural programs and services
  designed to ensure that opportunities for success are equally shared by all
  participants with a desire to improve their quality of life. Through Art and
  Education we reach out to our youth and our communities.






  Quality of Life Center, Inc. programs mark a bold departure from traditional
  guidance programming. Through innovative instruction and individualized
  attention, youth travel a road to success that begins with believing in
  themselves and never giving up on the fact that success is yours for the
  taking. Though our programs somewhat defy the norm, they are now "nationally
  acclaimed" and have proven to be extremely successful in meeting the needs and
  providing youth an opportunity to prove to themselves that honesty and hard
  work can and will bring about positive life changes.






  Many of our youth programs address: youth who are dropping out of school,
  depressed, some with no sense of self worth, and others turning to the
  "streets" for love and understanding. Some are trapped in situations in which
  they have had no chance to follow their dream. "If we don't help them, who
  will?






  Our nationally esteemed Bright Futures Scholars program participants are
  brilliant scholars with extremely high GPA&'s. Quality of Life Center programs
  are designed to assist the young, enabling them to become productive citizens,
  build self esteem, dream and then conquer their most "impossible" dream.






  Without programs such as the ones offered in the Quality of Life Center, Inc.,
  one out of every three lowincome minority students attending high school will
  dropout before earning a diploma (2005 PUSD Statistic). Most will not be
  encouraged to return to school, nor offered pretraining to become marketable
  in corporate America. Many students, even young scholars, if coming from
  lowincome families will not have an opportunity to reach their full potential
  and scores of juvenile first offenders will be placed in the justice system.






  Much of our programming depends on community support. We are proud to say that
  our programs are endorsed by community leaders who see the value in what is
  being accomplished to direct positive changes in the future of our
  communities. The National Education Association (NEA), as well as many
  surrounding school districts, plan to foster pilot programs using Quality of
  Life Center Inc. components in 2008.






  At the Quality of Life Center, we have an opportunity to service families with
  many different needs. We will strive not only to meet the needs but to
  eliminate the problems causing the need.






  The Quality of Life Center will continue to make every effort to assist the
  youth, young adults and families in low income atrisk communities by providing
  services that improve the quality of life for all.
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  We currently have a 100% success rate in graduates from our Bright Futures
  Scholars Leadership Development program. They have ALL graduated from high
  school and moved on to college. Many of these students come from group home or
  foster home environments. Many of these same students are also the first ones
  to attend college from their families.






  One of our other programs is a second chance program that allows juvenile
  first offenders an opportunity to turn their lives around. These Juveniles,
  referred into the program from the Juvenile Justice System are given an

  well as in groups.
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  Our success will be evaluated and measured by the high school and college
  graduation rates of our program participants. We maintain contact with all of
  our participants long past their graduation from this program and high school.
  We regular check up on our graduates to check on their college progress and
  success, including graduation from college as well.
