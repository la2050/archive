title: Craft Services
indicator: ' Social Connectedness'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  A mobile arts and crafting unit that visits targeted community sites around LA
  County providing the opportunity to create hands on art projects and community
  dance classes ultimately combining the two to produce urban situated community
  based performance works that are created by the people and for the people. 






  Participlay is passionately committed to building vibrant, connected and
  creative communities through the combination of our art + play initiatives. We
  know art has the power to elevate, enlighten, transform, and celebrate. We
  know our particular brand of interactive, experiential arts programming is
  transformative. With the assistance of the MyLA2050 grant we will expand our
  base of skilled facilitators with a campaign to take a mobile crafting unit
  and “caravan” to neighborhoods across LA County, providing the opportunity for
  adults, children and families to create works of art that are made from their
  own life stories for their communities.






  Through this art+play initiative Participlay’s Craft Services will enhance
  social connectedness by increasing participants own creative thinking,
  confidence, personal awareness, individual leadership, personal and
  professional satisfaction, and above all provides a norm for a kinder and
  gentler people which is at the core of our commitment to creating
  unconditionally loving communities that enhance each individuals and each
  groups sense of interconnectedness and belonging.

Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >+
  We will evaluate our initiative and measure the outcomes in a variety of ways,
  such as by asking teachers and parents what changes they perceive in their
  students and children before and after participating in Participlay's
  program. 






  We will also delve more deeply into how students, teachers, and parents see
  the effects by conducting indepth interviews with them using the following
  questions. It is very rewarding to know, through this empirical evidence, what
  we already knew in our hearts: that Participlay programs do, indeed, work and
  make an important difference in the lives of people and their communities.


How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
  The fact is that the arts foster creativity, innovation, good health and
  happiness. 






  National studies show that early and successful gateway arts experiences
  create lifelong participation in and enthusiasm for the arts. Yet the people
  of our communities, schools and afterschool programs are struggling with
  everincreasing funding challenges. 






  Studies also show that individuals and families that play together create
  stronger positive bonds and a deeper experience of connectedness.






  With the support of this LA2050 grant, Participlay can expand the reach of our
  art+play initiatives into the LA communities, bringing the opportunity to
  create individual and group artworks that are largely made of repurposed
  materials. 


   


  Many of the neighborhoods we hope to serve, have ethnic and native language
  diversity and kids on the school lunch program. Others have rigorous academic
  programs, but limited opportunities for arts and creative expression. 






  This art+play initiative will:



  Build Arts Audiences/Make the Arts Accessible



  Engage Young People in Active, Handson Experiences



  Train new Leaders & Mentoring Youth



  Prepare Innovators for Tomorrow








What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  Success would look like that schools, families, individuals and children
  taking the time to make things, objects, crafts, and artworks with their own
  hands from the materials that they had around them--re-purposing everything
  into art.  Art+play initiatives would become an active part of everyday life.
  That groups within neighborhoods would come together to share of their
  experiences, regarding the works that they produced and create scheduled
  appointed times to dovetail this activity into the life of their community. 
  That in the future individuals live and art+play life and that as a
  neighborhood take into their own hands the artistic development of their
  community.
