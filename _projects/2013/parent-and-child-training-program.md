title: 'Parent and Child Training Program '
project_summary: "Roosevelt High School is quite possibly one the largest high school in the country with a student body of approximately 5,000 students.  It is located in the Boyle Heights area of the City of Los Angeles.  The school is known for having violent incidents on campus and students report that they often do not feel safe at school.  Boyle Heights is also home to many gangs.  While there are local programs such as the Gang Reduction and Youth Development Program that have made some progress, the teens continue to be exposed to various risk factors that might lead to gang affiliation including but not limited to poor parental supervision, negative peer influences, substance use, tagging crews and underlying mental health issue which often are undiagnosed.  With the increase in violence and gun violence in schools in this country, this project proposes to provide a 20-week group family sessions in an effort to preventing future violence.  \r\nThe Parent and Child Training Program will raise parent’s awareness of risk factors, warning signs and behaviors that might indicate more serious issues. This program falls under the Prevention and Early Intervention model by providing parents and youth with coping skills as a way of prevention potential incarcerations, school failure or dropout, prolonged suffering, legal problems and removal of children from their homes. These 20-week sessions will be provided to both parents and their children simultaneously.  Parents and Youth will meet at the School Site and then break into their two groups which will be lead by their respective group facilitators. At the end of each group discussion a meal will be provided where parents and youth will engage together in a family activity aimed at promoting family bonding, modeling the use of appropriate relational skills and reinforcing concepts introduced during instructional groups. A violence reduction and behavioral modification curriculum will be used to assist youth to identify the roots of violence, how to prevent violent outbursts, increasing their awareness of the connections between alcohol/drugs and violence and ultimately develop better interpersonal and problem solving skills. In other words, teens will discuss a range of topics aimed at increasing their analytical skills, ability to integrate what they learn in real life and learn how to work collaboratively. Simultaneously, a diverse set of problem-solving skills and interventions will be introduced, modeled and role-played with parents. Group instruction will also make way for parents to share their personal struggles, parenting styles and interventions.\r\n This Projects’ outcomes include but are not limited to: Projected Outcomes: \r\n•    Improvement in the quality of the parent-child relationship\r\n•    Improvement in parenting skills, including positive discipline\r\n•    Improvement in parent's attitude about parenting \r\n•    Improvement in the youth’s behavior at home, at school and with peers\r\n•    Improvement in parents’ self esteem and confidence over their parenting skills\r\n•    Reduction in risk of child abuse\r\nThis program will be open for Students from Roosevelt High school and their parents/caregivers. This project is aligned with the ongoing development of a “Super Highway” of services between Roosevelt High School and The Wellness Center at the Historic General Hospital currently being developed by Supervisor Gloria Molina’s office. Alma Family Services will connect students and their families (when appropriate) to additional services provided at the Wellness Center set to open between May and July, 2013. Alma Family Services will be able to screen project participants’ needs and link these individuals/families to the various organizations providing services at the Wellness Center. Safety discussions and interventions will be related to the improvement of the school climate at Roosevelt High School as well as the Boyle Heights community at large. \r\n"

    Alma will measure progress towards goals of this project through participant
    surveys, track attendance and closely monitor and document each activity of
    the project to assure that objectives and deliverables are completed
    according to plan. At enrollment, each student and parent will be
    interviewed by a case manager who will collaboratively identify goals to be
    met at the end of the project. 2-3 Behavioral goals will be identify for
    each student and each parents regarding their academic/social functioning as
    well as the parent-child relationship. Goals will be reviewed with students
    and parents individually after 10 weeks and once again at the end of the
    project.  Students will be linked to academic enrichment and recreational
    activities as way to utilize pro-social skills introduced by this project.
    Student’s school attendance and report cards will be collected at the
    beginning and at the end of the program. Case Manager will also collaborate
    others involved with the student/family such as the school counselor,
    probation officer and DCFS social worker (if applicable) in order to
    identify target risk factors that must be further address beyond the group
    instruction.  Surveys will be provided to case workers involved with
    student/family if applicable. 
  description: "•\tThis project can be replicated throughout Los Angeles once proven effective at Roosevelt High School. Alma Family Services’ knowledge and track record using different Evidence Based Practices and other Prevention and Early Intervention models has led to significant reduction of risk factors that might lead to violent behavior. Implementation of this program will directly affect Roosevelt High School and the community at large by addressing the roots of violence. Several studies have indicated that violence leads to truancy, lower educational attainment and thus lower level jobs. Also, the psychoemotional and financial cost of violence in schools to poorer families is high, affecting their ability to escape the poverty trap. This project aims at reducing youth’s arrests for crimes including vandalism, trespassing, and tagging. Primary and secondary prevention programs have the potential to generate systemic change. Students will be encouraged to practice cooperation and show responsibility towards their own school and community. Family engagement is critical to promote student achievement. Successful students are more likely to become productive citizens and contribute with their community, the City and County of Los Angeles. "

  vision: >-
    Each school in Los Angeles should implement programs aimed at promoting
    family engagement, improving school readiness and reducing risk factors that
    might lead to violence. Our hope is that increasing parental participation
    in their children’s social and academic lives can become a priority for our
    schools. It is true that schools alone cannot meet all their student’s
    needs, specially the needs of students with psycho-emotional issues and/or
    families dealing with multiple stressors. By facilitating parents’ access to
    existing networks of service providers, schools will be able to empower
    these caregivers to take charge of their children’s overall functioning and
    development. That begins with educating parents on the importance of
    supporting their children and becoming more involved with the school,
    community and the different systems of care capable of contributing to
    students’ success. Educators, parents and community members will be able to
    build a common understanding of each person’s role in helping students meet
    academic and social expectations and help students meet their goals.
