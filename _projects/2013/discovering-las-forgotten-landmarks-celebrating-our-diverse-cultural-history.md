title: 'Discovering LA’s Forgotten Landmarks: Celebrating Our Diverse Cultural History'
indicator: Arts & Cultural Vitality
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >+
  Los Angeles County is home to over 1,000 City of Los Angeles HistoricCultural
  Monuments, over 100 California Historical Landmarks, and 20 National Historic
  Landmarks. Some, like the Coliseum, are prominent fixtures in the area. Others
  are hidden, such as the first Jewish site in LA tucked away on a hill by
  Dodger Stadium, or St. Vincent’s Place, the first institution of higher
  education in Southern California in what is now an alley between Broadway and
  Hill. Our idea is to create an interactive online guide and userfriendly
  smartphone app that highlight city, state, and national cultural and historic
  landmarks in LA County by mapping them with linked photos and content about
  each site’s history and cultural relevance. This service would increase
  exposure to the full spectrum of LA’s landmarks and paint a more complex,
  multicultural portrait of LA.






  Previously, we mapped over 940 City of Los Angeles monuments, with interesting
  findings (www.mapsportal.org/thecityproject/monuments). The official
  government listings contain limited information about the number, name,
  location, and date of designation of a monument. Through our research and
  mapping, we linked city monuments to map locations and added photos and brief
  content about the history and cultural relevance of the site. In so doing, we
  discovered that only ten percent of the city monuments were related to people
  of color, women, or Native Americans. This stands at odds with the diversity
  brought on by migration and immigration that was pivotal in LA’s creation, and
  it reflects the glaring inequities in our city. Statedesignated landmarks more
  closely approach an accurate reflection of LA’s demographics, with nearly 40
  percent of the landmarks honoring people of color, women, or Native Americans.






  We will update and expand upon our online mapping of city monuments to include
  city monuments designated since our prior work and all state and federal
  historic landmarks. We will create a smartphone app that provides photos,
  locations, and content about each site’s history and cultural relevance to
  facilitate onthego access to and appreciation of all of LA’s landmarks.






  Mapping LA’s cultural and historic landmarks will reinvigorate forgotten
  cultural aspects of the county’s history. Local residents will gain a deeper
  understanding of their neighborhoods, and visitors will be able to see LA
  beyond its famous tourist attractions. In so doing, we hope to draw attention
  to the past and present demographics of the city and celebrate the history and
  diversity of LA.


What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >+
  The City Project is a nonprofit organization committed to achieving equal
  justice, democracy, and livability in Los Angeles. Since our founding in 2000,
  we have influenced the investment of over $41 billion in underserved
  communities.






  Working with community allies, we have helped create the Los Angeles State
  Historic Park and RÃ­o de Los Angeles State Park as part of the greening of
  the LA River. We helped save the sacred Native American site of Panhe and San
  Onofre State Beach and helped save the community and park in Baldwin Hills. We
  have mapped and analyzed green access and equal justice for nine counties in
  Southern California and beyond.






  We have received recognition and awards from the American Public Health
  Association, Hispanic Business Magazine, American Society of Landscape
  Architects, California Parks and Recreation Foundation, Los Angeles Regional
  Water Quality Board, City of Los Angeles, Community Partners, and Cultural
  Landscape Foundation.


Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  We will work with a GIS consultant, a web consultant, and an app developer to
  package the research and content we create.
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  After we launch the app, we will measure success by the number of downloads.
  We hope the number of downloads will correspond with increased familiarity
  with all of LA’s cultural and historic landmarks. We also can include a
  checkin feature in the app to gauge if people are visiting the landmarks.
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  Los Angeles has never been a monolithic city or county. The cultural and
  historic landmarks in LA chronicle the major developments in the city’s
  formation, in which people of diverse ethnicities played a crucial role. By
  increasing awareness of these landmarks, our project will enhance
  understanding and fill the knowledge gaps in LA’s history. 






  Beyond this education, our project will increase traffic at the lesserknown
  landmarks. For example, there is a plaque commemorating La Mesa Battlefield,
  where the last battle of the war on the California front was fought in 1847,
  by the railroad tracks in the tiny industrial area of Vernon. Generating
  interest in this landmark could spur development, beautification, or perhaps
  green space around that city, which currently lacks parks. 






  Specifically, this project will benefit cultural vitality in LA; ultimately,
  it will work towards reducing the inequity that is inherent in the county.
  People of diverse ethnicities were instrumental in LA’s founding and continue
  to play a critical role today. By making forgotten historic landmarks visible
  on the LA landscape, we can create a more holistic sense of place that
  includes all those who live in it.
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  The diverse and vibrant art, music, dance, fashion, cinematography, and
  photography in LA that continuously push the envelope would continue to thrive
  in 2050. Along with this forward momentum, however, success in 2050 would also
  include preservation of LA’s past in a manner that is alive, engaging, and
  dynamic. By the year 2050, the number of cultural and historic landmarks in LA
  will have surpassed the number registered now. And an app might be as archaic
  and obsolete as floppy disks are now. Nonetheless, we hope that in 2050 the
  spirit of our project will be manifested in an inclusive, multicultural Los
  Angeles that celebrates its past.
