  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    One major barrier in which we are in need of establishing this program is
    funding to purchase materials, permits and equimpment needed to accomplish
    each mural. 
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    We will be able to evaluate our work through community acceptance and pride
    of their community mural 
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    We know of other organizations whom have done similar work. However not to
    the degree we have in mind to incorporate community first hand. 
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    We would like to include Homeboy industries with Fabian Debora. This
    organization will recieve if agreed 20% of funds established for each
    mural. 
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    We have estimated that each mural will cost 20,000.00 - 25,000.00 which will
    include aminstration fees, materials, and payed fee for each muralist,
    graffiti artist, and fine artist who will be over seeing the process from
    beginning to end for each mural 
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Permits: 200.00-1000.00 depending on wall size\r\nBrushes.Paint,spray cans, rags, buckets: 3000.00- 6000.00\r\nScaffolding rental: 200.00 to 500.00 per day \r\nAdministration fees: 2500.00\r\nCelebration of community mural festival and mural dedication that will attend the completion of each mural. 5000.00\r\nPayment for Muralist, Graffiti artist and Fine artist:approximately 10,000"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    Under the guidance of a professional muralist the process of creating a
    mural will be clearly laid out, from community involvement, to subject
    matter, to funding, to legal permitting, to implementation and completion,
    all required in the accomplishment of a meaningful neighborhood mural
    project. The program will provide a template for the community to go on an
    create more public art projects.
