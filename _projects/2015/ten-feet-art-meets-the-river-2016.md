  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to play.: "The 2015 10 FEET event brings together arts, culture, neighborhood and environmental groups to achieve unique and inspiring play along the river.  The event leverages existing facilities like The Women’s Center for Creative Work, the Elysian Valley Arts Collective and Folar’s Frog Spot along with additional locations within the newly purposed 10 feet on the west bank of the LA River to engage visual, sensory and physical relationships with the River.  Participants will exercise their bodies and their minds traveling between installations, seeing and sensing interpretations of the natural feature that gave life to the City of Los Angeles. \r\n\r\nWe envision an expanded event and children’s after school and family programs for 2016. For TEN FEET 2016 we propose to curate 20 individual sites from the Glendale Narrows to the Arroyo Seco.  Participating artists and performers will create playful art and culture installations.    Our after school program will partner with existing organizations and events to leverage and compliment existing resources. \r\n\r\nOur inclusionary curatorial process requires research of the numerous neighborhood, arts and cultural and environmental groups in the River neighborhoods to identify potential exhibitors, venues, participants, contributors and volunteers.  \r\n\r\nWe would like to supplement our exhibit with an after school program for students and families along the river.  This will require resources for outreach to schools, community organizations, existing recreation programs at parks and non profits to provide a series of events and programs for students to become involved in arts and culture in their neighborhoods. This program will be focused on the playful qualities of arts and culture.  \r\n\r\nTEN FEET is the first and only community based initiative to advocate for an arts and culture infrastructure on Los Angeles River projects. We are advocates for the inclusion of arts and culture design and planning for public and private River projects as an essential ingredient to more inspiring, attractive and effective play along the river.  The TEN FEET event demonstrates how we can transform the LA River Greenway and parkland into a globally significant and vital urban oasis where people of all ages and interests come to play.\r\n"
