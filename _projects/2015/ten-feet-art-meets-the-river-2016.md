  TEN FEET 2016 will be a temporary arts and culture exhibition and a series of
  after school intergenerational workshops featuring local artists engaging
  residents, visitors, students, and others. 10 FEET explores the potential for
  new River friendly relationships between private properties and the LA River
  increasing and elevating our places to play in LA. We propose to expand our
  2015 inaugural event of 7 participants and venues along a 2 mile linear
  portion of the LA River to 20 locations alon
Please specify below: >-
  River adjacent communities of Frog Town, Atwater Village, Cypress Park, Echo

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  The 2015 10 FEET event brings together arts, culture, neighborhood and
  environmental groups to achieve unique and inspiring play along the river. The
  event leverages existing facilities like The Women’s Center for Creative Work,
  the Elysian Valley Arts Collective and Folar’s Frog Spot along with additional
  locations within the newly purposed 10 feet on the west bank of the LA River
  to engage visual, sensory and physical relationships with the River.
  Participants will exercise their bodies and their minds traveling between
  installations, seeing and sensing interpretations of the natural feature that
  gave life to the City of Los Angeles. 
   
   We envision an expanded event and children’s after school and family programs for 2016. For TEN FEET 2016 we propose to curate 20 individual sites from the Glendale Narrows to the Arroyo Seco. Participating artists and performers will create playful art and culture installations. Our after school program will partner with existing organizations and events to leverage and compliment existing resources. 
   
   Our inclusionary curatorial process requires research of the numerous neighborhood, arts and cultural and environmental groups in the River neighborhoods to identify potential exhibitors, venues, participants, contributors and volunteers. 
   
   We would like to supplement our exhibit with an after school program for students and families along the river. This will require resources for outreach to schools, community organizations, existing recreation programs at parks and non profits to provide a series of events and programs for students to become involved in arts and culture in their neighborhoods. This program will be focused on the playful qualities of arts and culture. 
   
   TEN FEET is the first and only community based initiative to advocate for an arts and culture infrastructure on Los Angeles River projects. We are advocates for the inclusion of arts and culture design and planning for public and private River projects as an essential ingredient to more inspiring, attractive and effective play along the river. The TEN FEET event demonstrates how we can transform the LA River Greenway and parkland into a globally significant and vital urban oasis where people of all ages and interests come to play.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  The most challenging issue facing all River projects, including TEN FEET, is
  funding support. We successfully crowd funded our first TEN FEET event (2015)
  . Building on the demonstrated success of our first event we plan to solicit
  grant funding and corporate donations to support the 2016 TEN FEET event and
  after school children’s program. We have a great deal of support from
  complementary organizations, our ability to contribute resources will greatly
  facilitate their participation and our mutual effectiveness. 
   
   Our activities in 2015 have achieved broad interest and support from a number of local organizations including the Elysian Valley Arts Collective, the Women’s Center for Creative Work, FOLAR, and The Mayor’s Riverworks office. As the River continues to evolve, we will continue to be guided by and focus on the needs of the communities and organizations who consider the River their neighborhood place to play.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: |-
  For 2015/6 TEN FEET will be successful if we are able to:
   • Secure funding for a curator and administrator to manage events and programs
   • Execute an expanded and memorable 2016 TEN FEET event
   • Successfully obtain grants and other funding 
   • Plan and conduct children’s and family after school arts and culture programs to provide healthy and fun activities for kids and families.
   • Further engage the Riverfront communities in dialogue regarding the value of arts and culture in their neighborhoods. 
   
   Benchmarks
   • # of children participating in TEN FEET programs and events
   • # of participants in TEN FEET event 
   
   Methodology
   • On-site surveys and suggestions from participants to evaluate how arts and culture can provide new and unique play experiences on the River.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  The LA River Art Project is a unique advocacy organization whose goal is to
  leverage arts and culture to create LA’s finest environment for play along the
  River. We have met with numerous organizations and public agencies over the
  past 14 months and found that here are no similar groups focused on this
  subject. All of the groups we have met and worked with have expressed
  enthusiastic support for The LA River Art Project’s goals to create an
  intergenerational arts and culture infrastructure in all River projects. The
  TEN FEET event and future family and children’s programs will work with
  existing organizations to expand arts and culture in river neighborhoods. Our
  approach is unique because we are dedicated to working with local
  organizations and residents. Other similar public art programs have lacked a
  commitment and connection to local communities. 
   
   There are many precedents around the country and the world that demonstrate the power of public arts programs to enrich public spaces making them more exciting and rewarding places to play. Some recent examples include The Seattle Water Front, Millennium Park in Chicago, Governor’s Island and The High Line in New York. Numerous studies recognize that arts and cultural ingredients are key to socially and economically sustainable public spaces. The urgency to develop a lasting engagement with art at the River is inspired by our belief that the LA River is our next great public space. We should all enjoy playing at the River.

  LA River Public Art Project partners will include:
   
   Sandy Rodriguez an artist and educator in Los Angeles associated with The J. Paul Getty Museum and Art + Practice. Sandy will develop the children’s and family after school art program curriculum and coordinate with program partners including schools and community organizations. We anticipate a budget of $10,000 for these services.
   
   Local Arts Organizations and Partners - We anticipate working with a number of local arts organizations to host arts and culture after school programs. We anticipate costs of $15,000 for venue rental, materials, advertising and outreach. 
   
   Artists – All artists participating in the TEN FEET event receive a stipend as compensation. We estimate a total of $40,000 for the 2016 event. 
   
   The LA River Public Arts Project will provide project administration, outreach, coordination and other services to plan, develop and execute programs and event costs are estimated at $33,000

'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  We anticipate a minimum cost of $125,000 for 2016 TEN FEET programs and
  events. Based on our experience in 2015 we are confident that we will be able
  to raise any funds required over the $100,000 LA 2050 grant. We will pursue
  additional grants and funding to fund our general advocacy programs and future
  events. Additional funds would allow us to plan this as a multi year, multi
  track program. We believe that partnering with neighborhood community
  organizations will help us to raise funds to cover our expenses and provide
  scholarships for fee based activities. We will promote our after school
  program with a suggested donation fee and encourage all participants to
  register to build our contact list. Commitment via registration and affordable
  fees will solidify participation. We will make sure that potential
  participants know that our program is open to all.

How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  We see the opportunity to create a long term program for the entire Los
  Angeles River to grow from our site this year of 2 miles, to 11 miles of arts
  and culture programs and events in 2016, to 32 miles in the City of Los
  Angeles and ultimately 51 miles of the entire river in the future. To grow
  beyond a relatively small event and a series of after school and weekend
  activities we need to create a program structure and build our non profit to
  have the resources to work with multiple cities, the County of Los Angeles,
  open space conservancies, community based organizations and the US Army Corps
  of Engineers. 
   
   We will build an advisory board, hire administration and technical staff, and continue our efforts to advocate for arts and culture in public and private river revitalization projects. We will seek the resources and opportunity to develop a comprehensive and coordinated plan for the River that maximizes the opportunity for playful art and culture as an essential component of the anticipated and future revitalization projects. The plan will include an approach to build long term resources and partnerships to sustain arts and culture on the River for the future as essential ingredients of great play. We believe there are excellent partnerships possible with community based organizations, arts institutions, educational institutions, philanthropic organizations, and public agencies that do not currently exist. 
   
   If we are going to spend over a billion dollars of our public funds on habitat restoration, water quality and passive recreation in the next decade we should make sure that it will provide great intergenerational play opportunities along with education, work force opportunities and fuel for our City’s global creative economy. Our efforts will be scaled according to the resources available. Partnerships and financial support will expedite the process. 
   
   We envision a generation of children and families growing up in Los Angeles who will think of the River as a memorable place that shaped their experiences and provided great places to play.
