Citizens Of Culture harnesses the power of culture to communicate the values of critical thinking,problem solving, and instill a sense of efficacy and entrepreneurship through our events, platform and content. \r\n\r\nWe’ve developed a series of programs dedicated to helping people transition from consumers to creators by recognizing problems, their potential solutions, and developing an entrepreneurial skill set that will make their efforts sustainable into the year 2050 and beyond. \r\n\r\nThrough partnership with experts in the fields of entrepreneurship at Loyola Marymount College of Business, civic leaders of the Youth Justice Coalition, and individuals who have started successful enterprises we will create and active community that moves from ideation and prototyping, to refinement and revenue. \r\n\r\nWe are taking the principles put to use in incubators and classrooms across the field and embedding them into the culture of our city through various communities in the transcending geography, age, and economic status.\r\n"
