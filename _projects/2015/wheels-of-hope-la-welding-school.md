title: Wheels of Hope LA Welding School
project_summary: >-
  Wheels of Hope LA trains and certifies hard to employ people in Los Angeles
  and then certifies them through the American Welding Society. The AWS
  certification is good in all 50 states and once our students pass we then
  place them in jobs. The end of term project is welding motorcycle ambulances,
  which once completed we send to villages in Africa.

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "Wheels of Hope LA puts on 16 weeks welding courses. These courses are free of charge for our students.

Once our students have passed the AWS exam, we help to place them in jobs.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Labor says there is a shortage of 300,000 welders in the US and this statistic will continue to grow into the future. \r\n\r\nThe end of term project is welding together a motorcycle ambulance. Wheels of Hope LA then sends these ambulances to Angola, Uganda or Congo. The ambulances save lives on a weekly basis in Africa. \r\n\r\nIt is a huge paradigm switch for a former gang member or ex-convict to get certified as a welder, make an ambulance that is saving lives in Africa and get a job.

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "Our biggest challenge and opportunity is our students. Our students in the past have been in rival gangs, have tracking beacons on their ankle so their parole officer knows where they are as well as have a mix of latino, black and white students. At first everyone feels very uncomfortable because our society is quite divided.\r\n\r\nWheels of Hope LA has over come this challenge by having a low teacher to student ratio. The teachers see their role as mentors as much as welding instructors. The instructors are able to keep the focus on welding and not on the other stuff that goes on outside the classroom. \r\n\r\nOur instructors have decades of experience to share and our assistant instructors are former students. Our former students can connect and often communicate better to students. "
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "On the surface, the easiest way to measure success is counting the amount of students we train, get certified through the AWS and place in jobs. We have had incredible success, especially when considering our students' past. \r\n\r\nAt the end of each term we invite the families to our school so they can see the ambulances their parents built as well as see them in action. It is always a incredible feeling to know that these children will now be able to be provided for because their parents have a career. "
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "We are a department of Fred Jordan Mission. FJM has been around for over 70 years, feeding and caring for the homeless on skid row. We started operating on the 3rd floor of FJM and out grew their rooms and now are located down the block. FJM still sends us students and is very connected to our work. \r\n\r\nHomeboys Industries has programs teaching students to install solar systems or work in food services but no welding program. They are currently sending us students to learn welding now. \r\n\r\nMany of our students are referred to us by local churches in the Los Angeles area. Many church leaders then come and act as mentors for our students as well. "
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    All funds will be used by Wheels of Hope LA for our welding program and no
    funds will be diverted to other groups. 
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    We are hoping to triple our capacity in 2016 from 50 students to 150
    students. The cost will be $195,000. To do this we need to raise more funds
    then in the past. Thus far we have received funding from M&K Metals, Rev Co

    Rentals and Zambikes.

    The more funds we raise, the more students we can train, certify and place
