  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "Wheels of Hope LA puts on 16 weeks welding courses. These courses are free of charge for our students. Once our students complete our training program, they then take the American Welding Society test. In our five year history all 150 students have passed this test. Once our students have passed the AWS exam, we help to place them in jobs.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Labor says there is a shortage of 300,000 welders in the US and this statistic will continue to grow into the future. \r\n\r\nThe end of term project is welding together a motorcycle ambulance. Wheels of Hope LA then sends these ambulances to Angola, Uganda or Congo. The ambulances save lives on a weekly basis in Africa. \r\n\r\nIt is a huge paradigm switch for a former gang member or ex-convict to get certified as a welder, make an ambulance that is saving lives in Africa and get a job.

Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Our biggest challenge and opportunity is our students. Our students in the
  past have been in rival gangs, have tracking beacons on their ankle so their
  parole officer knows where they are as well as have a mix of latino, black and
  white students. At first everyone feels very uncomfortable because our society
  is quite divided.
   
   Wheels of Hope LA has over come this challenge by having a low teacher to student ratio. The teachers see their role as mentors as much as welding instructors. The instructors are able to keep the focus on welding and not on the other stuff that goes on outside the classroom. 
   
   Our instructors have decades of experience to share and our assistant instructors are former students. Our former students can connect and often communicate better to students.

Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  We are a department of Fred Jordan Mission. FJM has been around for over 70
  years, feeding and caring for the homeless on skid row. We started operating
  on the 3rd floor of FJM and out grew their rooms and now are located down the
  block. FJM still sends us students and is very connected to our work. 
   
   Homeboys Industries has programs teaching students to install solar systems or work in food services but no welding program. They are currently sending us students to learn welding now. 
   
   Many of our students are referred to us by local churches in the Los Angeles area. Many church leaders then come and act as mentors for our students as well.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  All funds will be used by Wheels of Hope LA for our welding program and no
  funds will be diverted to other groups.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  The more funds we raise, the more students we can train, certify and place in
  jobs. There is a massive demand for welders in the US and southern California.
