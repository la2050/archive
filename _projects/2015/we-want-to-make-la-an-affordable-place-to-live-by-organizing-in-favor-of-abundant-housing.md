title: >-
  We want to make LA an affordable place to live by organizing in favor of
  abundant housing.
project_summary: >-
  Abundant Housing LA will organize people to advocate for more housing in Los
  Angeles. Through community organizing, online tools and media coverage, we
  will empower renters, young people and others burdened by high housing costs
  to attend hearings, submit comments and champion the construction of more
  places to live. An influx of new voices demanding more housing can help expand
  housing options for everyone.
