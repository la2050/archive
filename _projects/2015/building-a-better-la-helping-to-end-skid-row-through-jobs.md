project_summary: >-
  At Union Rescue Mission, we propose that jobs are the first step to financial
  stability for those experiencing homelessness on the streets of Los Angeles.
  The program we are proposing for this Grants Challenge is our Jobs Program,
  which helps the men and women we serve do just that – find good, living wage
  jobs. We propose that as recipients of this $100,000 grant we can expand our
  current program—and double the number of men and women securing employment
  (currently at 75) to 150 during 2016. 
Please specify below: Skid Row
category: create
'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Los Angeles County has 366 jobs for every 1,000 adults. But for the men and
  women who live on Skid Row, the chances of ever finding employment is far
  less. In fact, most of the people who come through our doors have simply given
  up trying. As reported by Mayor Garcetti in his Sept. 22 address to the
  City—the homeless problem is enough to declare a “state of emergency” for
  homelessness. In fact, Central City LA, or Skid Row, now has the largest
  population of individuals experiencing homelessness in the State and Country.
   
   At URM, we believe that every person deserves the chance to find, secure and maintain employment to provide for themselves and their families. Over the last 18 months, URM piloted a Jobs Program to help guests prepare for, find and keep jobs. 156 men and women have found living-wage jobs through this project. Our idea is to double our annual goals for job placement over the next year. 
   
   This idea will: 1) expand our job readiness services; 2) create new opportunities to gain work experience and apprenticeships; and 3) build a robust network of employers and training partners to connect our guests with jobs. 
   
   This Grants Challenge will build our capacity to serve more people by hiring two part time employment assistants to join our team, allowing us to fuel further job placement and growth. Our team will work to expand opportunities for more guests to take part in skills training programs through our partners, access educational support from URM’s Learning Center, and receive coaching from our team. Additionally, our team will work alongside our corporate and business partners to expand our network of job placement and training partners—creating a vibrant networking tool for our men and women to use as they search for just the right job. We anticipate that as a result, over the next 12 months, we will place 150 men and women in jobs. 
   
   At URM, we believe that jobs are the key to a future and a hope for the more than 40,000 men and women who are currently experiencing homelessness on the streets of LA County. What better way to transform our city than to provide a tangible pathway from the streets, and from under the bridges, from cars and motels, from hopelessness and despair--through jobs. 
   
   Our idea is simple, but it works, and now we want to expand. Our dream for LA in 2050, is a place where everyone has the chance of a job, food, and a roof over their head.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  One of the greatest challenges is overcoming prejudices some employers may
  have regarding our guests. Some employers are initially held back by beliefs
  that our guests may not have the job skills needed to maintain employment for
  the long-term. However, overtime, we have grown to build a trusting and
  positive relationship with a growing network of employers. Many have
  discovered that our guests often maintain skills that are extremely well
  suited to the workforce – such as determination to succeed, or the tenacity
  and character that is built through hardship.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  This project will be evaluated as an on-going part of URM’s commitment to
  measuring and tracking progress and impact. Outcome measurements tracked will
  include: number of men and women participating in the program; number of men
  and women completing training; number of men and women placed in jobs; and the
  number of men and women maintaining jobs for at least 3 to 6 months. Specific
  measurements include: 90% of those who participate in readiness program will
  complete training; more than 150 clients will find employment in 2016; the
  number of employers working within URM’s employment network will increase by
  20% in 2016.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Although some other organizations do similar work, URM is one of the only
  organizations that works solely with men and women experiencing homelessness
  on Skid Row. Our jobs program is uniquely designed to meet their complex and
  diverse needs--more than just a job placement agency, we provide a highly
  customized service, helping each individual address their employment struggles
  with the goal of finding good, living-wage jobs that can turn into a career,
  not just a pay check. 
   
   The guests URM serve face tremendous obstacles when seeking work. Many are held back by complex problems that stem from a lack of education, neglect or poverty. Many have not completed high school—have very limited work experience, and lack the basic communication and job skills necessary to successfully find and keep a job. At least 75% of those we serve have criminal records making the task of finding work almost impossible in the current job climate. Others suffer from addictions and mental illness, making finding and keeping work an almost impossible task. 
   
   Our program provides an individualized approach that focuses on the following three steps: 1) job readiness (getting guests to a place where they can start looking for work – including education completion and basic works skills training programs, occupational and vocational skills assessments, and career counseling), 2) work experience (giving hard-to-place guests opportunities to be mentored and to get work experience to start building skills that can be used to find work out in the community), followed by: 3) job placement (helping to connect guests with jobs and work-place training in the community). 
   
   Our unique approach helps build the confidence of our guests, including a step-by-step job coaching process for preparing for and finding a job. Activities include occupational and vocational testing to match skills with employment opportunities, access to Employability Competency System to assess academic and cognitive potential of clients, linkage to technical and careers colleges for computer tech and vocational training opportunities, resume writing and/or cover letters as well as communicating with potential employers, access to vocational and occupational training, addressing barriers to employment (such as criminal records), assistance initiating the job search, preparation for and succeeding in an interview, job mentoring from URM corporate volunteers, and securing and keeping employment.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  URM works alongside numerous partners as part of this jobs program. They
  include: Skid Row Redevelopment Corporation – STRIVE, Living Independently
  Through Employment – LITE, Skid Row Housing Corporation – Avenues to Work
  Program, Weingart – Workforce and Economic Service Program, Downtown
  WorkSource Center, Chrysalis, Dress for Success, Job Corp, Vocational Rehab,
   Homeboy Industries, Goodwill Industries, Pacoima Skills Center, WorkSource, Culinary Training Schools, LA Mission College. Employer Partners include: Norms, Toyota/Lexus, Porto Bakery, Southern Girl Bakery, Farmers Boys, Buffalo Wild Wing, Vons, and X-Lines Bowling Alley. If awarded, URM will be the sole recipient of grant funding.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  It will cost $484,000 to achieve this jobs program over the coming year. Full
  costs of this program will be met as a result of on-going fundraising efforts
  to procure funding from individual donors, corporate and foundation funders,
  including recent grant funding from US Bancorp. Past grant funding includes
  Bank of America (a $200,000 Neighborhood Excellence Grant helped launch our
  jobs program), the Gilead Foundation, and Pfaffinger Foundation.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
  A $100,000 grant from the Grants Challenge will be used to fund two employment
  assistants (two part-time salaries at $32,500 each = $65,000), partial funding
  of our lead job developer ($23,500), and increased costs of supplies,
  materials and tuition as part of our job readiness classes ($11,500). The
  impact of this funding will be considerable, with grant funding allowing URM
  to double the number of men and women placed in jobs during the coming 12
  months.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  What began as a simple outreach to hungry and homeless men more than 125 years
  ago has grown to become the largest and most comprehensive program of
  restoration for men, women, families and youth experiencing homelessness on
  the streets of Los Angeles. 
   
   Emerging from the Great Depression as the leading provider of food and shelter in Los Angeles, URM has continued provide bold leadership in its unwavering commitment to serving the most vulnerable in our city. URM was the first organization on Skid Row to open its doors to women, children and families; the first to open a transitional housing program specifically serving single mothers and their children; and the only rescue mission to allow families to stay together in family rooms, as opposed to being separated by age and sex. In this capacity, URM has become the established leader on Skid Row, leading the campaign to end homelessness on the streets of Los Angeles. 
   
   Given this rich heritage of forging new pathways and expanding to meet the needs of the population we serve, we are confident that the goals outlined in our program will be achieved within the 12 month timeline, doubling the number of men and women currently place jobs by the end of 2016. 
   
   Building our jobs team will allow URM to significantly scale our program, doubling the number of men and women served during the 12 month grant funding period. Given the critical importance that jobs play in restoring the futures of the men and women we serve, we plan to leverage this grant to attract more funding, building our capacity to grow the meet the increasing needs. Over time, we plan to scale the program to serve all guests who turn to us for help, achieving our ultimate goal of Building a Better LA -- by Helping to End Skid Row through Jobs.

      Los Angeles. The program we are proposing for this Grants Challenge is our
      Jobs Program, which helps the men and women we serve do just that – find
      good, living wage jobs. We propose that as recipients of this $100,000
      grant we can expand our current program—and double the number of men and
      women securing employment (currently at 75) to 150 during 2016.

    answer: "Los Angeles County has 366 jobs for every 1,000 adults. But for the men and women who live on Skid Row, the chances of ever finding employment is far less. In fact, most of the people who come through our doors have simply given up trying. As reported by Mayor Garcetti in his Sept. 22 address to the City—the homeless problem is enough to declare a “state of emergency” for homelessness. In fact, Central City LA, or Skid Row, now has the largest population of individuals experiencing homelessness in the State and Country.\r\n\r\nAt URM, we believe that every person deserves the chance to find, secure and maintain employment to provide for themselves and their families. Over the last 18 months, URM piloted a Jobs Program to help guests prepare for, find and keep jobs. 156 men and women have found living-wage jobs through this project. Our idea is to double our annual goals for job placement over the next year.  \r\n\r\nThis idea will: 1) expand our job readiness services; 2) create new opportunities to gain work experience and apprenticeships; and 3) build a robust network of employers and training partners to connect our guests with jobs. \r\n\r\nThis Grants Challenge will build our capacity to serve more people by hiring two part time employment assistants to join our team, allowing us to fuel further job placement and growth. Our team will work to expand opportunities for more guests to take part in skills training programs through our partners, access educational support from URM’s Learning Center, and receive coaching from our team. Additionally, our team will work alongside our corporate and business partners to expand our network of job placement and training partners—creating a vibrant networking tool for our men and women to use as they search for just the right job. We anticipate that as a result, over the next 12 months, we will place 150 men and women in jobs.  \r\n\r\nAt URM, we believe that jobs are the key to a future and a hope for the more than 40,000 men and women who are currently experiencing homelessness on the streets of LA County. What better way to transform our city than to provide a tangible pathway from the streets, and from under the bridges, from cars and motels, from hopelessness and despair--through jobs. \r\n\r\nOur idea is simple, but it works, and now we want to expand. Our dream for LA in 2050, is a place where everyone has the chance of a job, food, and a roof over their head."

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "One of the greatest challenges is overcoming prejudices some employers may have regarding our guests. Some employers are initially held back by beliefs that our guests may not have the job skills needed to maintain employment for the long-term. However, overtime, we have grown to build a trusting and positive relationship with a growing network of employers. Many have discovered that our guests often maintain skills that are extremely well suited to the workforce – such as determination to succeed, or the tenacity and character that is built through hardship.  \r\n\r\n"
  - name: Please explain how you will evaluate your work.

    answer: "This project will be evaluated as an on-going part of URM’s commitment to measuring and tracking progress and impact. Outcome measurements tracked will include: number of men and women participating in the program; number of men and women completing training; number of men and women placed in jobs; and the number of men and women maintaining jobs for at least 3 to 6 months. Specific measurements include:  90% of those who participate in readiness program will complete training; more than 150 clients will find employment in 2016; the number of employers working within URM’s employment network will increase by 20% in 2016.  \r\n"

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Although some other organizations do similar work, URM is one of the only organizations that works solely with men and women experiencing homelessness on Skid Row. Our jobs program is uniquely designed to meet their complex and diverse needs--more than just a job placement agency, we provide a highly customized service, helping each individual address their employment struggles with the goal of finding good, living-wage jobs that can turn into a career, not just a pay check. \r\n\r\nThe guests URM serve face tremendous obstacles when seeking work. Many are held back by complex problems that stem from a lack of education, neglect or poverty. Many have not completed high school—have very limited work experience, and lack the basic communication and job skills necessary to successfully find and keep a job. At least 75% of those we serve have criminal records making the task of finding work almost impossible in the current job climate. Others suffer from addictions and mental illness, making finding and keeping work an almost impossible task. \r\n\r\nOur program provides an individualized approach that focuses on the following three steps: 1) job readiness (getting guests to a place where they can start looking for work – including education completion and basic works skills training programs, occupational and vocational skills assessments, and career counseling), 2) work experience (giving hard-to-place guests opportunities to be mentored and to get work experience to start building skills that can be used to find work out in the community), followed by: 3) job placement (helping to connect guests with jobs and work-place training in the community).  \r\n\r\nOur unique approach helps build the confidence of our guests, including a step-by-step job coaching process for preparing for and finding a job. Activities include occupational and vocational testing to match skills with employment opportunities, access to Employability Competency System to assess academic and cognitive potential of clients, linkage to technical and careers colleges for computer tech and vocational training opportunities, resume writing and/or cover letters as well as communicating with potential employers, access to vocational and occupational training, addressing barriers to employment (such as criminal records), assistance initiating the job search, preparation for and succeeding in an interview, job mentoring from URM corporate volunteers, and securing and keeping employment. \r\n\r\n"

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      It will cost $484,000 to achieve this jobs program over the coming year.
      Full costs of this program will be met as a result of on-going fundraising
      efforts to procure funding from individual donors, corporate and
      foundation funders, including recent grant funding from US Bancorp. Past
      grant funding includes Bank of America (a $200,000 Neighborhood Excellence
      Grant helped launch our jobs program), the Gilead Foundation, and
      Pfaffinger Foundation.

    answer: >-
      A $100,000 grant from the Grants Challenge will be used to fund two
      employment assistants (two part-time salaries at $32,500 each = $65,000),
      partial funding of our lead job developer ($23,500), and increased costs
      of supplies, materials and tuition as part of our job readiness classes
      ($11,500). The impact of this funding will be considerable, with grant
      funding allowing URM to double the number of men and women placed in jobs
      during the coming 12 months.

    answer: "What began as a simple outreach to hungry and homeless men more than 125 years ago has grown to become the largest and most comprehensive program of restoration for men, women, families and youth experiencing homelessness on the streets of Los Angeles. \r\n\r\nEmerging from the Great Depression as the leading provider of food and shelter in Los Angeles, URM has continued provide bold leadership in its unwavering commitment to serving the most vulnerable in our city. URM was the first organization on Skid Row to open its doors to women, children and families; the first to open a transitional housing program specifically serving single mothers and their children; and the only rescue mission to allow families to stay together in family rooms, as opposed to being separated by age and sex. In this capacity, URM has become the established leader on Skid Row, leading the campaign to end homelessness on the streets of Los Angeles. \r\n\r\nGiven this rich heritage of forging new pathways and expanding to meet the needs of the population we serve, we are confident that the goals outlined in our program will be achieved within the 12 month timeline, doubling the number of men and women currently place jobs by the end of 2016.  \r\n\r\nBuilding our jobs team will allow URM to significantly scale our program, doubling the number of men and women served during the 12 month grant funding period. Given the critical importance that jobs play in restoring the futures of the men and women we serve, we plan to leverage this grant to attract more funding, building our capacity to grow the meet the increasing needs. Over time, we plan to scale the program to serve all guests who turn to us for help, achieving our ultimate goal of Building a Better LA -- by Helping to End Skid Row through Jobs. \r\n"
