'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  The YBA was formed in 2012, servicing one disadvantaged school. We are now in
  14 schools serving 350 disadvantaged high school students this year. 
   
   The YBA provides a year-long after school course ("Introduction to Business & Careers") to these students. The course description/breakdown is as follows: 
   
   1. The course meets every week for two hours for an entire year.
   
   2. The first hour of each 2 hour meeting has the instructor teaching the students about business/careers/entrepreneurship from a textbook (Careers for the 21st Century). In addition, students learn both the fundamental soft and hard skills a young professional will need to know to succeed in their future job or business. Students are taught critical elements such as how to communicate as a professional, resume writing, business plan development, and even participate in experiential exercises like a stock market trading game or a Shark Tank type pitch workshop.
   
   3. The second hour of each 2 hour meeting has a different Guest Speaker from the business community presenting their life journey to the class. 
    a.These Guest Speaker presentations include their childhood, high school, college, career and industry.
    b. In general, the Guest Speaker presentations are approximately 40 minutes along with 20 minutes of Q&A.
    c.The Guest Speaker program allows for these underprivileged students, most of whom have never met a single professional, aside from their teacher, to meet approximately 35 Guest Speakers over the course of the year. We have already seen some internships happen organically through the program.
   
   4. The YBA takes each class of students on 1-2 field trips per year to local area businesses. What an impact it makes for our students to get out of the classroom and see a thriving company up close and personal. We've had teachers who have told us that after these field trips, some of their students are so inspired they pick up their grades almost immediately. Past field trips have gone to Google, SpaceX and StartEngine (a technology incubator in Santa Monica).
   
   5. We are currently working on developing an additional element to YBA – A Summer Internship Program. This way our students can put the skills they have learned to use and gain valuable experience, not to mention earn some money in their pocket. Most importantly, the internship serves as a crucial springboard to catapult them into college and beyond.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  One major barrier/challenge that we anticipate is lack of funding. It takes a
  lot of resources to operate in the 14 schools we are currently in, serving 350
  students. There are about 35 schools on the waiting list who want the YBA
  Program. By next year would like to expand to 25 schools serving 625 students.
   
   Our strategy is to continue to apply for grants from different foundations like The Goldhirsh Foundation, seek partnerships with banks through the Community Reinvestment Act, and engage donors though appeals and fundraising events.
   
   We are also working on developing an internship program through our partnerships with local businesses. The business would pay a flat fee to employ high school graduates who have gone through the YBA program. YBA would handle payroll, logistics, insurance, and other details. Leftover resources would go towards funding the YBA program.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: |-
  We will evaluate our work through:
   1. Student Surveys. YBA students will take a survey at the beginning of the program and at the conclusion to measure the program's effectiveness.
   2. Teacher/Couselor Feedback.
   3. Attendance and Persistence Rates
   4. Student GPA's
   5. Disciplinary and Suspension Rates
   5. High School Graduation Rates
   6. College Acceptance Rates
   7. College Attendance Rates
   8. Job Shadow/Internship Rates
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: |-
  NFTE: In School Curriculum that focuses on creating a business plan.
   
   Junior Achievement: 3-12 Sessions. Exposure to 1-2 working professionals through their job shadow/reverse job shadow program.
   
   Year Up: Focuses on young adults ages 18-24.
   
   YBA is unique in its approach that it covers both job readiness as well as entrepreneurial skills training. High School students need exposure to both elements to give them options in their future career. In addition, YBA students will meet roughly 35 guest speakers (professionals) throughout the course of the school year as opposed to 1 or 2.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  We are currently working with Greendot High Schools, Alliance High Schools,
  and LAUSD. Currently, 100% of the grant award will go towards YBA.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  To expand from 14 to 25 schools and go from serving 350 students to 625
  students will cost an additional $171,750. We will cover any additional costs
  through private donations and fundraisers. Will we also continue to apply for
  foundation/corporate grants and seek partnerships with banks through the
  community reinvestment act.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
  Here is a snapshot of our 2016 budget. The $100,000 will help us get closer to
  our goal of having the YBA program in 25 schools and serving 625 students.
   
   Expenses 
   Program Costs 
   Teacher and Champion Stipends $150,000 
   Textbooks and Materials $31,250 
   Field Trips $50,000 
   Administrative Costs 
   Web Design/Support $2,000 
   Legal $1,000 
   Administrative Personnel $70,000 
   Fundraising Costs
   Fundraising Personnel $70,000 
   Total Expenses $374,250 
   
   Revenue Goals 
   Private Donations $200,000 
   Grants $200,000 
   Total Revenue $400,000 
   
   Net $25,750
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  We use Dropbox to give each YBA teacher access to our curriculum and as a hub
  to share information. Our custom website gives our teachers their own account
  to manage their weekly YBA schedule online for the entire school year. Our
  guest speakers also have their own account to upload their presentation and
  manage their speaking calendar. Everything is automated through the website,
  as well as email reminders to everyone involved in YBA whenever something
  needs to be done or there is an upcoming event.
   
   We are also currently working on standardized marketing material (flyers, videos, etc.) to help our teachers recruit students for the YBA Program. We are also working on releasing a best practices guide for all our teachers and guest speakers to ensure that there are systems in place and standards maintained. Next summer we plan on hosting a workshop for all YBA teachers to share ideas and what works. The internship program we are designing has huge potential to be a consistent funding source for YBA.

    answer: "The YBA was formed in 2012, servicing one disadvantaged school. We are now in 14 schools serving 350 disadvantaged high school students this year. \r\n\r\nThe YBA provides a year-long after school course (\"Introduction to Business & Careers\") to these students.  The course description/breakdown is as follows: \r\n\r\n1. The course meets every week for two hours for an entire year.\r\n\r\n2. The first hour of each 2 hour meeting has the instructor teaching the students about business/careers/entrepreneurship from a textbook (Careers for the 21st Century). In addition, students learn both the fundamental soft and hard skills a young professional will need to know to succeed in their future job or business. Students are taught critical elements such as how to communicate as a professional, resume writing, business plan development, and even participate in experiential exercises like a stock market trading game or a Shark Tank type pitch workshop.\r\n\r\n3. The second hour of each 2 hour meeting has a different Guest Speaker from the business community presenting their life journey to the class.   \r\n     a.These Guest Speaker presentations include their childhood, high school, college, career and industry.\r\n     b. In general, the Guest Speaker presentations are approximately 40 minutes along with 20 minutes of Q&A.\r\n     c.The Guest Speaker program allows for these underprivileged students, most of whom have never met a single professional, aside from their teacher, to meet approximately 35 Guest Speakers over the course of the year. We have already seen some internships happen organically through the program.\r\n\r\n4. The YBA takes each class of students on 1-2 field trips per year to local area businesses. What an impact it makes for our students to get out of the classroom and see a thriving company up close and personal. We've had teachers who have told us that after these field trips, some of their students are so inspired they pick up their grades almost immediately. Past field trips have gone to Google, SpaceX and StartEngine (a technology incubator in Santa Monica).\r\n\r\n5. We are currently working on developing an additional element to YBA – A Summer Internship Program. This way our students can put the skills they have learned to use and gain valuable experience, not to mention earn some money in their pocket. Most importantly, the internship serves as a crucial springboard to catapult them into college and beyond."

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "One major barrier/challenge that we anticipate is lack of funding. It takes a lot of resources to operate in the 14 schools we are currently in, serving 350 students. There are about 35 schools on the waiting list who want the YBA Program. By next year would like to expand to 25 schools serving 625 students.\r\n\r\nOur strategy is to continue to apply for grants from different foundations like The Goldhirsh Foundation, seek partnerships with banks through the Community Reinvestment Act, and engage donors though appeals and fundraising events.\r\n\r\nWe are also working on developing an internship program through our partnerships with local businesses. The business would pay a flat fee to employ high school graduates who have gone through the YBA program. YBA would handle payroll, logistics, insurance, and other details. Leftover resources would go towards funding the YBA program."

Attendance and Persistence Rates\r\n4. Student GPA's\r\n5. Disciplinary and Suspension Rates\r\n5. High School Graduation Rates\r\n6. College Acceptance Rates\r\n7. College Attendance Rates\r\n8.

    answer: "NFTE: In School Curriculum that focuses on creating a business plan.\r\n\r\nJunior Achievement: 3-12 Sessions. Exposure to 1-2 working professionals through their job shadow/reverse job shadow program.\r\n\r\nYear Up: Focuses on young adults ages 18-24.\r\n\r\nYBA is unique in its approach that it covers both job readiness as well as entrepreneurial skills training. High School students need exposure to both elements to give them options in their future career. In addition, YBA students will meet roughly 35 guest speakers (professionals) throughout the course of the school year as opposed to 1 or 2."

    answer: "We use Dropbox to give each YBA teacher access to our curriculum and as a hub to share information. Our custom website gives our teachers their own account to manage their weekly YBA schedule online for the entire school year. Our guest speakers also have their own account to upload their presentation and manage their speaking calendar. Everything is automated through the website, as well as email reminders to everyone involved in YBA whenever something needs to be done or there is an upcoming event.\r\n\r\nWe are also currently working on standardized marketing material (flyers, videos, etc.) to help our teachers recruit students for the YBA Program. We are also working on releasing a best practices guide for all our teachers and guest speakers to ensure that there are systems in place and standards maintained. Next summer we plan on hosting a workshop for all YBA teachers to share ideas and what works. The internship program we are designing has huge potential to be a consistent funding source for YBA."
