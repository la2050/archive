title: The Los Angeles Service Academy
project_summary: >-
  We seek philanthropic support to fund LASA's ongoing operations and next
  cohort of student participants in the 2016-2017 programmatic year. 
  Specifically, LASA brings together high school juniors from all over Los
  Angeles County for an intensive week in the summer, plus one Saturday per
  month during the school year. Each meeting combines experts with field trips
  tied to themes critical to civic life in LA: transit, governance, water, the
  LA River, the harbor, law enforcement, food/housing, etc.

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "LASA BEGINS WITH QUESTIONS. \r\n\r\nHow does a city run?  How does a vast metropolitan region like Los Angeles work?  Which institutions are responsible for moving water, people, food, and power from points A to points Z?  How are such agencies funded?  Who runs them?  How can neighborhoods be made more livable?  What does an elected official do all day?  What role do cultural institutions play in the life of greater Los Angeles?  What about businesses and non-profits?  What are the potential career paths for young people interested in civic, civil, and public service in the Los Angeles Basin?  These are among the thousands of questions that students have about the city and region in which they live. There are a million more that they would have if they knew more about place, region, and history.\r\n\r\nLASA participants (all high school juniors) will gain the experience and knowledge necessary to better understand the intricacies – infrastructural, historical, political, economic, and otherwise – of the region in which they live, and will build lasting bonds of friendship, camaraderie, and work experience with a diverse group of peers they connect with over the course of  a year.  Over time, LASA will change the lives and career paths of hundreds of high school students in the region and will become an agent of change, community building, and connection throughout Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nFor example, a perennial LASA theme is water: where does it come from? Who buys and sells it? How is it delivered to cities, regions, neighborhoods, homes?  In answering these questions, LASA's students meet with officials from agencies such as MWD and DWP and then visit water treatment and delivery facilities to see firsthand the complex processes at work in watering such a vast region.\r\n\r\nGarnering such knowledge will allow the students to become more civic minded and engaged with a critical aspect of life in the Los Angeles Basin.  Over the year, LASA grapples with other issues equally important to the future of the region and to every Southern California resident.  These include investigations of law enforcement and police oversight, business and entrepreneurialism, sports and entertainment, technology, governance and electoral politics, the harbor and the basin's rivers, food security, housing access, museums and cultural institutions.\r\n\r\nIn studying these issues, young people from across the entire basin will connect with one another and gain confidence in their roles as agents of change."

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "As we move into year five of our project, we recognize even more clearly that LASA works best when it reaches across the entire basin and when its student cohorts are reflective of the diversity of the region in all metrics.  Sustaining that breadth is a challenge, and we address it by way of rigorous outreach and face-to-face recruitment of young people.  Simultaneously, we work hard to develop and nurture LASA's relationships with a network of teachers, counselors, and school administrators who assist us in identifying young people who can become part of the program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "We approach evaluation in two ways.  One, we monitor the program by way of annual evaluations from participants.  This process is a way of seeking ongoing feedback in order to make regular, modest adjustments to the program.  \r\n\r\nSecond, and more important, we have always maintained that the best measure of LASA's effectiveness will be evident in years ahead.  As our students graduate from high school, move on to college (which we track), and return to Los Angeles to begin careers, we believe that their time with LASA will enable them to become effective agents of change.  As they become increasingly engaged in civic life, our hope is that they will draw upon productive connections to one another, connections initially fostered when they were sixteen years old."
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "To our knowledge, there is no such program aimed at the region's young people.  The Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, in its non-profit capacity, sponsors Leadership LA.  This is a program with LASA-like structure and aims, but it is entirely reserved for mid-career professionals (who pay to participate).\r\n\r\nLASA is offered at no cost to all participants."
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    LASA's two institutional partners -- The Huntington Library and the Los
    Angeles Public Library -- offer in-kind support to the program (primarily
    meeting spaces).  If successful with LA2050, LASA will utilize the entirety
    of the $100,000 grant for programmatic use in 2016-2017 and 2017-2018.
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': "LASA currently operates on an $85,000 budget annually.  LA2050 funds would be utilized at $50,000 for 2016-2017 and the same for the following year.\r\n\r\nWith LA2050 support, we feel confident that the additional $35,000 per year could be raised from other philanthropic sources -- several of which have indicated a willingness to help with such shortfalls if LA2050 funds are provided.\r\n\r\n"
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "$80,000 total:\r\n\r\n$7000 expert stipends\r\n$6000 teacher participant stipends\r\n$6000 tickets (harbor, kayaking LA River, various admission fees)\r\n$7000 bus transportation\r\n$10,000 food/snacks/water\r\n$4000 book purchases\r\n$2500 website design/maintenance and communication\r\n$ 500  misc\r\n$42,000 director stipends (2)"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    LASA has grown.  From an initial class of 20 students in 2011-2012, we now
    have a class of 35 students.  We would like to increase the size of a given
    class to between 40 and 50 students per year. More than that on an annual
    basis would inhibit the connections and lines of engagement fostered
    throughout the year.  However, we would like to continue to grow the program
    beyond the aggregation of "students served."  We are considering
    programmatic "wings" to LASA's central, student-participant model, but we
    have made no firm decisions in this regard as yet.
