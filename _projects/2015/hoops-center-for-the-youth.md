'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  We want to build a Dream Big Hoops Center that's a positive environment of
  learning, teaching discipline, sound fundamentals, and techniques that will
  help the youth reach their athletic and academic goals. Basketball is a sport
  to keep children healthy and entertained at the same time. Instead of renting
  facilities out in different areas we want to create a space for the youth of
  all ages to come and enjoy a facility that caters to the LA Area. It will be a
  safe haven for children to come play basketball, receive proper training, gain
  knowledge on nutrition, and meet new people. It will be a facility that will
  give everyone in the community a chance to be involved. The facility will have
  two indoor basketball courts, strength and conditioning section, and homework
  area.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Traffic is a main concern and we understand parents have jobs as well. We will
  consider offering rides to students who want to attend but have no means of
  transportation. If those who cannot attend during the week, we will also have
  the weekend available to them as well. We plan to have irregular hours to
  accommodate everyone and not your regular 9-5 hours.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We will evaluate our work by the number of participants we have each day. See
  and monitor who is improving, who is not, see who's returning and who is not,
  always ask for feedback from parents/youth on how we can keep improving or
  what we need to change or fix. Long term, we can track and see who furthers
  their education and see who obtains a college athletic scholarship.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  No. Our approach is different because we offer basketball training sessions to
  help them improve, we are involved and in contact with college/professional
  programs in the area so our youth can attend games, be engaged, and be
  inspired to one day play in college. We also attend and film their middle
  school/high school games for them to share with college coach's. This helps
  them get recruited now days. You visually have to show college coach's how
  talented you are.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  We will collaborate with several different basketball trainers in and out of
  the area that will be $500-1000( depends on out of state). Also local college
  basketball programs and will look to hire their players/athletes during the
  off season to come and work with the youth.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': 'This will be right on target $95,000-100,000'
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  $30,000 for wood flooring (two courts) 
   $20,000 equipment (balls, basketball goals, weights, accessories). $7,000($600 a month) Healthy Snacks/Food/Beverages. 
   Building rental fees/amenities $3,000 a month $36,000/yr. 
   $5000 for basketball trainers
   $100,000 will meet our budget
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Making sure our overhead is kept low, keep creating new ways to engage the
  youth. Continue having great relationships with parents making sure their
  happy and their children are happy with what we are doing. Maintaining a
  certain number of youth each day for participation and getting new interested
  youth involved.
