Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to play.: >-
  We want to build a Dream Big Hoops Center that's a positive environment of
  learning, teaching discipline, sound fundamentals, and techniques that will
  help the youth reach their athletic and academic goals. Basketball is a sport
  to keep children healthy and entertained at the same time. Instead of renting
  facilities out in different areas we want to create a space for the youth of
  all ages to come and enjoy a facility that caters to the LA Area. It will be a
  safe haven for children to come play basketball, receive proper training, gain
  knowledge on nutrition, and meet new people. It will be a facility that will
  give everyone in the community a chance to be involved. The facility will have
  two indoor basketball courts, strength and conditioning section, and homework
  area. 
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We will evaluate our work by the number of participants we have each day. See
  and monitor who is improving, who is not, see who's returning and who is not,
  always ask for feedback from parents/youth on how we can keep improving or
  what we need to change or fix. Long term, we can track and see who furthers
  their education and see who obtains a college athletic scholarship. 
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
  - Money (financial capital)
  - Volunteers/staff (human capital)
  - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
  - 'Infrastructure (building/space/vehicles, etc.)'
  - Education/training
  - 'Technical infrastructure (computers, etc.)'
  - Community outreach
  - Network/relationship support
  - Quality improvement research
