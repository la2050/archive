  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to play.: >-
    We want to build a Dream Big Hoops Center that's a positive environment of
    learning, teaching discipline, sound fundamentals, and techniques that will
    help the youth reach their athletic and academic goals. Basketball is a
    sport to keep children healthy and entertained at the same time. Instead of
    renting facilities out in different areas we want to create a space for the
    youth of all ages to come and enjoy a facility that caters to the LA Area.
    It will be a safe haven for children to come play basketball, receive proper
    training, gain knowledge on nutrition, and meet new people. It will be a
    facility that will give everyone in the community a chance to be involved.
    The facility will have two indoor basketball courts, strength and
    conditioning section, and homework area.

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    Traffic is a main concern and we understand parents have jobs as well. We
    will consider offering rides to students who want to attend but have no
    means of transportation. If those who cannot attend during the week, we will
    also have the weekend available to them as well. We plan to have irregular
    hours to accommodate everyone and not your regular 9-5 hours. 
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    We will evaluate our work by the number of participants we have each day.
    See and monitor who is improving, who is not, see who's returning and who is
    not, always ask for feedback from parents/youth on how we can keep improving
    or what we need to change or fix. Long term, we can track and see who
    furthers their education and see who obtains a college athletic
    scholarship. 
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    No. Our approach is different because we offer basketball training sessions
    to help them improve, we are involved and in contact with
    college/professional  programs in the area so our youth can attend games, be
    engaged, and be inspired to one day play in college. We also attend and film
    their middle school/high school games for them to share with college
    coach's. This helps them get recruited now days. You visually have to show
    college coach's how talented you are.
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    We will collaborate with several different basketball trainers in and out of
    the area that will be $500-1000( depends on out of state). Also local
    college basketball programs and will look to hire their players/athletes
    during the off season to come and work with the youth. 
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': 'This will be right on target $95,000-100,000'
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "$30,000 for wood flooring (two courts) \r\n$20,000 equipment (balls, basketball goals, weights, accessories). $7,000($600 a month) Healthy Snacks/Food/Beverages. \r\nBuilding rental fees/amenities $3,000 a month $36,000/yr. \r\n$5000 for basketball trainers\r\n$100,000 will meet our budget"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    Making sure our overhead is kept low, keep creating new ways to engage the
    youth. Continue having great relationships with parents making sure their
    happy and their children are happy with what we are doing. Maintaining a
    certain number of youth each day for participation and getting new
    interested youth involved.
