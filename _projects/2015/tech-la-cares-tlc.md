  The Los Angeles tech space is growing at a rapid pace -- so much so, that it
  is difficult for tech companies to devote time, resources, and energy into
  being a strong partner within their own communities.
   
   Tech LA Cares (TLC) aims to bridge that gap by matching companies with organizations and events, both by in-person needs assessments, as well as online volunteer signup mechanisms.
   
   We believe in the efficiency of online tools, but also believe that human contact is key to success.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  The Los Angeles tech sector is on the verge of Very Big Things -- led by Mayor
  Eric Garcetti and fueled by an influx of venture capital, the City is now the
  third largest tech ecosystem in the US, #1 in Open Data, and graduates more
  engineering students than any other region in the nation (many of whom are now
  choosing to stay in LA, rather than head north upon graduation).
   
   As founder of LA Tech Digest (hence the preliminary links above to LATD), I have spent the past year chronicling a city with an upward trajectory that clearly shows that right here, right now, LA in 2015, is the absolute best place in the world to be, in order to pursue your dreams and secure a brighter future.
   
   And yet for all the great things happening in Los Angeles, we cannot allow a disconnect between the rising fortunes of the area's tech businesses and their surrounding communities.
   
   Tech LA Cares (TLC) aims to bridge this gap by making it easy for startups and established companies to identify, and participate in, the success of charitable organizations and events in their area -- community centers, food banks, neighborhood cleanups, donation drives, volunteer / mentorship opportunities, hackathons, school trips, and more.
   
   True Corporate Responsibility is hard, and it requires a dedicated staff to match opportunities with resources. 
   
   Unfortunately, most companies do not have the energy to find the right opportunity for their employees to get involved.
   
   We aim to streamline this process, with an array of tools, both online and real-world: 
   
   The TLC website will feature a LA nonprofit directory and neighborhood map, an events calendar, organization spotlights, and events recaps that showcase these two worlds connecting for the good of their communities.
   
   The weekly TLC email will deliver this info directly to interested companies and individuals as well.
   
   The TLC social media will also highlight events, organizations, and companies, in order to better show and share with the world the strong ties between LA tech and their local communities.
   
   In-person visits by TLC to the organizations and companies will help assess the needs of the organizations, as well as the capabilities of the companies involved.
   
   Participating companies and organizations will also be TLC-certified, so that they can display their involvement, both online and in the real world.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  The biggest obstacle in this process is the allocation of resources by
  potentially participating companies.
   
   LA's tech companies are on a fast track to success, logging long hours in order to grow their businesses at a very competitive pace.
   
   LA's tech companies embrace a work hard / play hard mantra that can make it very difficult to layer charitable work in as well.
   
   But two macro issues come into play: 
   
   1) Millennials want to do well by doing good, to live a life of purpose, as evidenced by their willingness to volunteer, by their choices in conscious commerce, by their choices of group & individual experiences.
   
   2) There is, and there has always been, a tension between social classes as the fortunes of some sectors rise faster than others'; you see it and hear it every day, in areas such as Venice and Downtown.
   
   Tech LA Cares looks to connect these worlds for the benefit of all, in a manner that makes it easy for companies to get involved, without draining internal resources.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Since we're in the beginning stages, it will be very easy to benchmark
  progress based on actions and data gathered: 
   
   From the real world side, we can continually measure:
   
   How many companies were visited?
   What causes mean the most to them?
   What is their current involvement in the community?
   Which companies are interested in participating?
   What resources do they have to offer?
   What do we need to build in order to make this a smooth process for them?
   
   How many community organizations were visited?
   How are they receiving support right now?
   What areas need further support?
   What resources do they need in order to best serve their community?
   What is the best way to collect and broadcast such information?
   
   From the digital side, we can easily measure progress of the site buildout, and watch metrics daily:
   
   Site traffic
   Email signups
   Open / click-through / bounce / retention rates
   Social shares / likes / comments / followers
   Company / individual signups
   Events listed / hours volunteered
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: |-
  There are quite a few national organizations that do what we propose!
   
   Total respect to the numerous organizations and sites that aim to connect individuals and corporations to relevant charitable entities.
   
   But what is missing from these national sites is, well, a sense of community. 
   
   And what Los Angeles needs is a local organization that understands its startup world, that understands the needs of local charities and community organizations, that can go out into the field and physically match both sides of the table.
   
   An organization built by LA, for LA, to show the rest of the world what we are capable of.
   
   An organization that can properly marry real-world with digital, social events with social media, to instill a sense of philanthropy and giving into our local workforce, that is more than just writing a check or wearing a t-shirt to an event.
   
   I lived in San Francisco during the original dotcom bubble, a time in which every other company was going public, and throwing a huge party to announce it -- even as thousands roamed south of Market and throughout town in search of food, spare change, and maybe a place to sleep where they wouldn't get harassed or mugged.
   
   I see the seeds of this happening in LA, here, now. And I believe we can address this early on -- sure, a lot of companies may already be contributing to local organizations, but perhaps they're not telling their story properly.
   
   Good deeds do not always need to be publicly broadcast, but there does need to be a constant stream of positive information going out to our communities, backed by real deeds, not just lip service.
   
   So in addition to the real benefits that come from local companies being actively engaged in their communities, there is a narrative to tell the world that Tech LA Cares.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  We have not sought any additional partners or collaborators at this point,
  since a large portion of the grant will be devoted to covering the manpower
  needed to build out the program and the actual website.
   
   But by running LA Tech Digest, we have built a network of trust across all strata of LA's tech scene, and plan on strengthening these alliances by working closely with government agencies, charitable organizations, and local tech companies in order to identify entities in need, match company resources to community needs, and help spread the word about the efforts of those involved.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 â€“ how will you cover the additional costs?': |-
  The entire plan is to keep this capped at $100,000 for at this early stage.
   
   The effort right now is 1) to build the site platform, 2) collect the information necessary to populate the site + have a continuous flow of information, and 3) connect local tech companies with community opportunities.
   
   All this will be done in a fiscally conservative manner, so that we have proof of concept in order to seek out additional funding via private donations, corporate matching, public grants, and other government instruments.
   
   There is much that we would like to add over time, but it really is a matter of taking baby steps in getting the product just right, in getting local tech companies excited to efficiently work with their communities.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
  We anticipate $50,000 to go to the manpower needed for community and corporate
  outreach in order to collect the data to populate the site, $40,000 budgeted
  to the build out of the site itself, and $10,000 in PR / social amplification.
   
   We are treating this endeavor like a tech startup in which LA2025 is the seed round, then seek further funding from other resources as needed, and as momentum builds.
   
   The biggest mistake anyone makes is trying to do too much too soon; it is our plan to keep a tight lid on expenditures in our earliest stages, and simply focus on building the core product before adding too many bells & whistles.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Success begets success, and people want to do good -- they just need the
  proper channel in order to easily do so.
   
   I've seen a lot of charity / volunteer services focus on the individual, which is good in encouraging friends to join friends; however, the network effect of 1 + 1 is largely 3.
   
   Now, you get companies involved, within a defined vertical (in this case being Los Angeles-area tech companies), and you've tapped into the network effect of a tight-knit, devoted group, thus bringing the network effect of 10 + 10 = 50.
   
   Do this enough times, and you've instilled a sense of involvement beyond LA's tech community, so that local companies from other verticals become involved -- first, from the initial periphery, next, from areas one would not anticipate.
   
   Tell these stories enough times, and you've created a movement, in which other cities want to know how to unify their businesses in order to strengthen ties between local businesses and charities.
   
   There are a lot of large companies that already have their own Corporate Responsibility departments. 
   
   However, LA is seeing a huge surge in tech-based startups that do not have the luxury of such departments to handle this work.
   
   We aim to make it easy for companies to better connect with their communities, so that the rising tide lifts all boats, and so that LA can serve as a model for yet another incredible civic achievement.
   
   (And yes, to be more concrete, it will be necessary to scale this model via earned and paid media across traditional, social, and online channels.)
