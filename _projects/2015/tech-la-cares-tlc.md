title: Tech LA Cares (TLC)
project_summary: "The Los Angeles tech space is growing at a rapid pace -- so much so, that it is difficult for tech companies to devote time, resources, and energy into being a strong partner within their own communities.\r\n\r\nTech LA Cares (TLC) aims to bridge that gap by matching companies with organizations and events, both by in-person needs assessments, as well as online volunteer signup mechanisms.\r\n\r\nWe believe in the efficiency of online tools, but also believe that human contact is key to success.\r\n"

    volunteer opportunities within their communities.
  'In one to three sentences, please describe your proposal.': "The Los Angeles tech space is growing at a rapid pace -- so much so, that it is difficult for tech companies to devote time, resources, and energy into being a strong partner within their own communities.\r\n\r\nTech LA Cares (TLC) aims to bridge that gap by matching companies with organizations and events, both by in-person needs assessments, as well as online volunteer signup mechanisms.\r\n\r\nWe believe in the efficiency of online tools, but also believe that human contact is key to success.\r\n"
  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "The Los Angeles tech sector is on the verge of Very Big Things -- led by Mayor Eric Garcetti and fueled by an influx of venture capital, the City is now the third largest tech ecosystem in the US, #1 in Open Data, and graduates more engineering students than any other region in the nation (many of whom are now choosing to stay in LA, rather than head north upon graduation).\r\n\r\nAs founder of LA Tech Digest (hence the preliminary links above to LATD), I have spent the past year chronicling a city with an upward trajectory that clearly shows that right here, right now, LA in 2015, is the absolute best place in the world to be, in order to pursue your dreams and secure a brighter future.\r\n\r\nAnd yet for all the great things happening in Los Angeles, we cannot allow a disconnect between the rising fortunes of the area's tech businesses and their surrounding communities.\r\n\r\nTech LA Cares (TLC) aims to bridge this gap by making it easy for startups and established companies to identify, and participate in, the success of charitable organizations and events in their area -- community centers, food banks, neighborhood cleanups, donation drives, volunteer / mentorship opportunities, hackathons, school trips, and more.\r\n\r\nTrue Corporate Responsibility is hard, and it requires a dedicated staff to match opportunities with resources. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, most companies do not have the energy to find the right opportunity for their employees to get involved.\r\n\r\nWe aim to streamline this process, with an array of tools, both online and real-world: \r\n\r\nThe TLC website will feature a LA nonprofit directory and neighborhood map, an events calendar, organization spotlights, and events recaps that showcase these two worlds connecting for the good of their communities.\r\n\r\nThe weekly TLC email will deliver this info directly to interested companies and individuals as well.\r\n\r\nThe TLC social media will also highlight events, organizations, and companies, in order to better show and share with the world the strong ties between LA tech and their local communities.\r\n\r\nIn-person visits by TLC to the organizations and companies will help assess the needs of the organizations, as well as the capabilities of the companies involved.\r\n\r\nParticipating companies and organizations will also be TLC-certified, so that they can display their involvement, both online and in the real world.\r\n"
