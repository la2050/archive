project_summary: >-
  "Afraid of Karma" has been workshopped a few times in Los Angeles. Each time,
  we have helped audience members to not only heal from child abuse, sexual
  abuse, eating disorders and traumatic loss but also to create their own art
  that can help them continue to heal long after experiencing the performance.
  We would like to develop new videos and bring the experiential performance to
  underserved communities so that all Angelenos can have the opportunity to heal
  in this unique way.
