title: 'The Impact of a Second Chance: An Innovative Women’s Prison Diversion Program'
project_summary: >-
  To address the skyrocketing rates of incarceration for women who suffer from
  substance use disorders, LA County developed the Second Chance Women’s
  Re-entry Court (WRC) program as an alternative. WRC provides behavioral health
  treatment, helps women unite with their children and provides practical
  solutions like job training, parenting and life skills to help women become
  self-sufficient. Prototypes proposes to expand services to include additional
  mental health and psychiatry services.

  Prototypes and its partners track outcomes including improved mental health,
  reduced drug use, increased employment and housing, and reduced recidivism.
  Recently, the LA County Department of Public Health conducted a Health Impact
  Study that found multiple health and public safety benefits. Some of the major
  findings from the report include: graduates from WRC have a lower chance of
  rearrests, re-convictions and returns to custody compared to the California
  state prison population; and, compared to their employment status before
  entering the WRC, graduates experienced more than a 10-fold increase in
  employment after completing the WRC program and WRC graduates experienced a
  54% decrease in homelessness after program completion. Prototypes is currently
  implementing an Electronic Health Record System that will better data
  collection. With enhanced services under this new project, Prototypes will
  monitor client access and outcomes with additional mental health services.
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
  - Money (financial capital)
  - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
