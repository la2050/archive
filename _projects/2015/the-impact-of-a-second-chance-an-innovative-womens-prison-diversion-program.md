title: 'The Impact of a Second Chance: An Innovative Women’s Prison Diversion Program'
project_summary: >-
  To address the skyrocketing rates of incarceration for women who suffer from
  substance use disorders, LA County developed the Second Chance Women’s
  Re-entry Court (WRC) program as an alternative. WRC provides behavioral health
  treatment, helps women unite with their children and provides practical
  solutions like job training, parenting and life skills to help women become
  self-sufficient. Prototypes proposes to expand services to include additional
  mental health and psychiatry services.

  'DESCRIBE IN GREATER DETAIL HOW YOU WILL MAKE LA THE HEALTHIEST PLACE TO LIVE: ': "The Second Chance Women’s Reentry Program (WRC) helps women charged with a felony who also have a history of substance use disorders get the treatment that they need instead of continuing to cycle in and out of jail. The women that Prototypes and WRC seek to help have higher rates of past trauma, relapse, mental health disorders, homelessness, family instability and unemployment. And, often, they are the sole caregivers for their young children. By providing a continuum of care, including residential substance abuse treatment and outpatient services to this target population, the program transforms not only the lives of women but the health and wellness of their children as well. \r\n\r\nAs Los Angeles County struggles with overcrowding prisons with subpar services for those with mental illness and substance abuse, the Second Chance Women’s Reentry Program is an already implemented and proven program for successfully helping families. Women with histories of substance abuse are more likely to cycle in and out of jail. Their children are more then likely to end up unstable living situations or foster care. By diverting women to this program, Prototypes reunites women and their children so they can both receive integrated care, including primary and mental health care. Children also get to rebuild the bond with their mothers in a safe and structured environment so they can grow and thrive. \r\n\r\nIn addition to comprehensive care for addiction, mental illness and any other medical concerns, the program provides wraparound services to help women gain vital vocational skills, complete their GED, and find employment. Case managers also help women with basic life skills to create a safe and healthy household for their families and help women find permanent housing. Employment and housing are critical components in helping women remain successful in their recovery. These comprehensive services also support a mother’s ability to create a safe, stable and healthy household for her children. \r\n\r\nBy addressing the underlying issues that led women to the criminal justice system in the first place, WRC empowers women to become independent and healthy members of the Los Angeles community. WRC also includes entire families and connects them with extensive services designed to increase a family’s self-sufficiency."

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    Policy at the state and local level could have a drastic impact on this
    program. Public Safety Realignment (AB 109) continues to present challenges
    by shifting how people are classified, from Parole to Probation, which has
    an impact on eligibility for funding for this program. Currently, there is
    no dedicated funding source for the Second Chance Women’s Reentry Court
    program. Instead, Prototypes uses existing funding streams to ensure access
    to care. Even so, Proposition 47 reduces penalties for drug possession and
    other nonviolent crimes so that many are able to reduce their convictions
    from felonies to misdemeanors. When treatment  is voluntary (like under Prop
    47), it can be more challenging to recruit and retain clients in treatment,
    even though those who graduate have a high success rate. Prototypes monitors
    LA County and California’s policy activities and advocates for the
    investment in community reentry and diversion programs for this women in the
    criminal justice system. 
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    Prototypes and its partners track outcomes including improved mental health,
    reduced drug use, increased employment and housing, and reduced recidivism.
    Recently, the LA County Department of Public Health conducted a Health
    Impact Study that found multiple health and public safety benefits. Some of
    the major findings from the report include: graduates from WRC have a lower
    chance of rearrests, re-convictions and returns to custody compared to the
    California state prison population; and, compared to their employment status
    before entering the WRC, graduates experienced more than a 10-fold increase
    in employment after completing the WRC program and WRC graduates experienced
    a 54% decrease in homelessness after program completion. Prototypes is
    currently implementing an Electronic Health Record System that will better
    data collection. With enhanced services under this new project, Prototypes
    will monitor client access and outcomes with additional mental health
    services.
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    No, this diversion program is the only one of its kind for women in Los
    Angele County, perhaps in the country. It utilizes an unprecedented
    collaboration among public agencies to identify, engage, and monitor women
    who have cycled in out of prison for most of their lives. There are similar
    drug court programs but WRC is unique because it serves women with criminal
    records who are facing felony offenses, including women facing more serious
    offenses. Because of the collaborative approach, the Public Defender and
    District Attorney work closely together to identify women who would be
    eligible for the program, often making exceptions so that women with some of
    the most challenging histories are offered this program. Started as a pilot
    program in 2007, the members of this collaboration agreed early on that
    there would not be cherry picking of clients. Rather, the program was
    designed and implemented to accept women with co-occurring disorders,
    significant histories of trauma, and lengthy histories of involvement with
    the criminal justice system. In fact, the average woman accepted into the
    program has spent two-thirds or more of her life incarcerated without having
    received any treatment. Finally, this program is unique in that it reunites
    women with their children in the early stages of their treatment. 
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    WRC is based on collaboration between District Attorney’s Office, Public
    Defender’s Office, Department of Probation, LAC Superior Court, California
    Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation, County Criminal Justice
    Coordination Committee and the Department of Public Health’s Substance Abuse
    and Prevention Control Program. Each entity uses its own resources to
    support WRC. The LA2050 grant will be used to enhance mental health services
    for women and their children at Prototypes.
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    The enhanced mental health and psychiatry services for WRC will cost
    $100,000 which the LA 2050 grant will would cover. Prototypes will be able
    to continue the enhanced services beyond this grant by accessing additional
    funding that will come available under the Affordable Care Act. The other
    program costs for WRC are covered through the public contracts that
    Prototypes has in place to serve this population. Through awareness and
    continued evaluation, the aim is for leaders in the community to realized
    the true benefits of WRC and create dedicated funding streams to serve more
    women in the criminal justice system. 
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Prototypes\t\t\r\nLA 2050 Budget\t\t\r\n\t\r\nGrant Revenue\t\t\r\n\tLA 2050 Award\t $100,000 \r\nTotal Revenue\t\t $100,000 \r\n\r\nExpenses\t\t\r\n\tMental Health Clinician - 0.5 FTE\t $27,500 \r\n\tMental Health Clinician Benefits - 0.5 FTE \t $7,700 \r\n\tPsychiatry Services - 40 hours per month\t $64,800 \r\nTotal Expenses\t\t $100,000 \r\n"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    Prototypes’ proposal focuses on improving mental health services for women
    in the WRC program since many women with a substance use disorder also have
    co-occurring mental health issues. The LA 2050 grant will fund comprehensive
    and evidence-based mental health treatment as well as psychiatric assessment
    and services to better meet the mental health needs of the target
    population. This includes individual, group and family therapy that
    incorporates evidence-based practices including: Seeking Safety which
    assists women with trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder by seeking help
    from supportive peers, accessing community resources, increasing
    participation in disease prevention/health promotion, practicing honesty and
    increasing self-care; Motivational Enhancement Therapy in which staff
    develop a partnership with the women to better match the level of care to
    her readiness for change and to resolve ambivalence to change; and Cognitive
    Behavioral Therapy to help develop positive beliefs and attitudes by helping
    women to identify with peers, receive support and practice new behaviors. By
    more effectively improving women’s mental health, Prototypes can increase
    the likelihood of a woman’s successful recovery once they leave the program.
    This will further increase the outcomes for women and demonstrate the
    overall effectiveness of WRC. Reducing mental health barriers, along with
    advocating for treatment for formerly incarcerated women among elected
    officials, will provide Prototypes the leverage to scale the Second Chance
    Women’s Reentry Program.
