title: 'The Impact of a Second Chance: An Innovative Women’s Prison Diversion Program'
project_summary: >-
  To address the skyrocketing rates of incarceration for women who suffer from
  substance use disorders, LA County developed the Second Chance Women’s
  Re-entry Court (WRC) program as an alternative. WRC provides behavioral health
  treatment, helps women unite with their children and provides practical
  solutions like job training, parenting and life skills to help women become
  self-sufficient. Prototypes proposes to expand services to include additional
  mental health and psychiatry services.

    Prototypes and its partners track outcomes including improved mental health,
    reduced drug use, increased employment and housing, and reduced recidivism.
    Recently, the LA County Department of Public Health conducted a Health
    Impact Study that found multiple health and public safety benefits. Some of
    the major findings from the report include: graduates from WRC have a lower
    chance of rearrests, re-convictions and returns to custody compared to the
    California state prison population; and, compared to their employment status
    before entering the WRC, graduates experienced more than a 10-fold increase
    in employment after completing the WRC program and WRC graduates experienced
    a 54% decrease in homelessness after program completion. Prototypes is
    currently implementing an Electronic Health Record System that will better
    data collection. With enhanced services under this new project, Prototypes
    will monitor client access and outcomes with additional mental health
    services.

  The Second Chance Women’s Reentry Program (WRC) helps women charged with a
  felony who also have a history of substance use disorders get the treatment
  that they need instead of continuing to cycle in and out of jail. The women
  that Prototypes and WRC seek to help have higher rates of past trauma,
  relapse, mental health disorders, homelessness, family instability and
  unemployment. And, often, they are the sole caregivers for their young
  children. By providing a continuum of care, including residential substance
  abuse treatment and outpatient services to this target population, the program
  transforms not only the lives of women but the health and wellness of their
  children as well. 
   
   As Los Angeles County struggles with overcrowding prisons with subpar services for those with mental illness and substance abuse, the Second Chance Women’s Reentry Program is an already implemented and proven program for successfully helping families. Women with histories of substance abuse are more likely to cycle in and out of jail. Their children are more then likely to end up unstable living situations or foster care. By diverting women to this program, Prototypes reunites women and their children so they can both receive integrated care, including primary and mental health care. Children also get to rebuild the bond with their mothers in a safe and structured environment so they can grow and thrive. 
   
   In addition to comprehensive care for addiction, mental illness and any other medical concerns, the program provides wraparound services to help women gain vital vocational skills, complete their GED, and find employment. Case managers also help women with basic life skills to create a safe and healthy household for their families and help women find permanent housing. Employment and housing are critical components in helping women remain successful in their recovery. These comprehensive services also support a mother’s ability to create a safe, stable and healthy household for her children. 
   
   By addressing the underlying issues that led women to the criminal justice system in the first place, WRC empowers women to become independent and healthy members of the Los Angeles community. WRC also includes entire families and connects them with extensive services designed to increase a family’s self-sufficiency.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Policy at the state and local level could have a drastic impact on this
  program. Public Safety Realignment (AB 109) continues to present challenges by
  shifting how people are classified, from Parole to Probation, which has an
  impact on eligibility for funding for this program. Currently, there is no
  dedicated funding source for the Second Chance Women’s Reentry Court program.
  Instead, Prototypes uses existing funding streams to ensure access to care.
  Even so, Proposition 47 reduces penalties for drug possession and other
  nonviolent crimes so that many are able to reduce their convictions from
  felonies to misdemeanors. When treatment is voluntary (like under Prop 47), it
  can be more challenging to recruit and retain clients in treatment, even
  though those who graduate have a high success rate. Prototypes monitors LA
  County and California’s policy activities and advocates for the investment in
  community reentry and diversion programs for this women in the criminal
  justice system.

Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  No, this diversion program is the only one of its kind for women in Los Angele
  County, perhaps in the country. It utilizes an unprecedented collaboration
  among public agencies to identify, engage, and monitor women who have cycled
  in out of prison for most of their lives. There are similar drug court
  programs but WRC is unique because it serves women with criminal records who
  are facing felony offenses, including women facing more serious offenses.
  Because of the collaborative approach, the Public Defender and District
  Attorney work closely together to identify women who would be eligible for the
  program, often making exceptions so that women with some of the most
  challenging histories are offered this program. Started as a pilot program in
  2007, the members of this collaboration agreed early on that there would not
  be cherry picking of clients. Rather, the program was designed and implemented
  to accept women with co-occurring disorders, significant histories of trauma,
  and lengthy histories of involvement with the criminal justice system. In
  fact, the average woman accepted into the program has spent two-thirds or more
  of her life incarcerated without having received any treatment. Finally, this
  program is unique in that it reunites women with their children in the early
  stages of their treatment.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  WRC is based on collaboration between District Attorney’s Office, Public
  Defender’s Office, Department of Probation, LAC Superior Court, California
  Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation, County Criminal Justice
  Coordination Committee and the Department of Public Health’s Substance Abuse
  and Prevention Control Program. Each entity uses its own resources to support
  WRC. The LA2050 grant will be used to enhance mental health services for women
  and their children at Prototypes.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Prototypes’ proposal focuses on improving mental health services for women in
  the WRC program since many women with a substance use disorder also have
  co-occurring mental health issues. The LA 2050 grant will fund comprehensive
  and evidence-based mental health treatment as well as psychiatric assessment
  and services to better meet the mental health needs of the target population.
  This includes individual, group and family therapy that incorporates
  evidence-based practices including: Seeking Safety which assists women with
  trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder by seeking help from supportive
  peers, accessing community resources, increasing participation in disease
  prevention/health promotion, practicing honesty and increasing self-care;
  Motivational Enhancement Therapy in which staff develop a partnership with the
  women to better match the level of care to her readiness for change and to
  resolve ambivalence to change; and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to help
  develop positive beliefs and attitudes by helping women to identify with
  peers, receive support and practice new behaviors. By more effectively
  improving women’s mental health, Prototypes can increase the likelihood of a
  woman’s successful recovery once they leave the program. This will further
  increase the outcomes for women and demonstrate the overall effectiveness of
  WRC. Reducing mental health barriers, along with advocating for treatment for
  formerly incarcerated women among elected officials, will provide Prototypes
  the leverage to scale the Second Chance Women’s Reentry Program.
