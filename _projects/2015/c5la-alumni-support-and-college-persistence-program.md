project_summary: >-
  C5LA serves kids at high risk for school dropout due to poverty, precarious
  living circumstances, and prevalence of gangs in their neighborhoods. Our
  5-year program of leadership camps, college/career prep, and service learning
  helps students realize their true potential. C5LA gets at-risk youth to
  college; however, many are unable to stay the course. Funding from LA2050 will
  enable C5LA to implement college retention initiatives for this vulnerable
  population to persist and succeed in college.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Making LA the best place to learn means that every high school student will
  graduate and be college and career ready. Making LA the best place to learn
  means turning current statistics upside down: during the 2013-2014 school
  year, 15,990 students in LA County dropped out of school. Of these students,
  an overwhelming 88% (14,089) were from socioeconomically disadvantaged
  backgrounds (California Department of Education Reporting Office). 
   
   At C5LA, we are beating these odds at an astounding rate. For the past 15 years, 100% of our students have graduated high school and for the past 3 years, 100% of our students have gone to college or another post-secondary opportunity. 
   
   The purpose of C5LA is to serve students most at-risk for dropping out of school by providing them with hope for the future, life-changing experiences, and the skills needed to not only graduate high school, but to succeed in college and beyond. We are doing this with our innovative, outcome driven programming based on the belief that a comprehensive multi-year experience is vital in supporting this vulnerable population. Our success has been great with getting students to enter college, now we need to make sure they stay there, succeed, and complete their degree. 
   
   Nationwide, nearly one-third of college students drop out before their second year. Many factors contribute to the decision to drop out of college, including financial strain, stress, lack of engagement, and academic struggles, but having support from adults and peers can help students overcome these adversities. 
   
   We are confident that our program prepares youth well for many of the challenges they will face in college and beyond. Unfortunately, due to our limited resources and the intensive nature of our regular programming, we have not yet been able to systematically support and track the outcomes of C5LA alumni.
   
   Funding from LA2050 will support a natural expansion of our core programming to offer greater support to our alumni throughout their college experience. Supporting C5LA graduates through the sometimes difficult transition to college will improve the likelihood of graduating from college and achieving success as adults.
   
   To better support college persistence, we aim to implement the following initiatives in 2015-2016: 
   - Create a C5LA Grad 1st Year College Boot Camp 
   - Cultivate Strategic Partnerships with College Retention Experts 
   - Enhance Data Collection 
   - Expand Social Media Outreach
   - Alumni
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  While our program youth have spent five years building their academic skills
  and confidence, once they graduate from high school and enter college, the
  support system they had relied upon is greatly diminished. C5LA, at present,
  does not have the staffing capacity to provide support beyond high school. 
   
   C5LA has a very rigorous evaluation process for participants throughout the five-year program and up until high school graduation, but we currently do not have the systems or staffing capacity to track students and evaluate their progress once they leave our program. Seeking to build a continuum of support for our youth—the majority of whom are from very low-income households and the first in their families to attend college—funding from LA2050 would enable us to dedicate a Program Manager to track and fully evaluate the long-term impact of our programming on students, as well as to coordinate ongoing student support to ensure college retention and graduation.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Through the program expansion, we expect C5LA graduates to achieve an 80%
  first-year college persistence rate. 
   
   Specific information we plan to track includes: 
   • Matriculation data (four-year, two-year, vocational or career) 
   • Year over year college persistence rates
   • Participation in school groups and on-campus programs
   • Participation in C5LA events and Boot Camp sessions
   • C5LA peer-to-peer collaborations 
   • Alumni association participation and attendance 
   • Social media engagement
   • Challenges or issues interfering with college success and degree completion 
   
   Our process for tracking student data over time will include: oneone engagement with C5LA alumni, instituting a quarterly check-in process (during the five-year, pre-college program students do monthly check-ins), and a quarterly newsletter. Our success in building a robust evaluation initiative and college support program is contingent upon having dedicated staff who can coordinate these efforts consistently
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  C5LA works with organizations such as Educare, the Posse Foundation,
  Champions, Impact, and UCLA Uni-Camp to collaborate on serving more youth
  through our leadership programs. We are also partnered with the Fulfillment
  Fund and Princeton Review to enrich our college preparatory programming,
  including our youth participating in their standardized test taking prep
  classes and the Fulfillment Fund’s Destination College fair. 
   
   C5LA partners with 20 schools in the LAUSD through the Beyond the Bell Program, an initiative that provides afterschool enrichment opportunities for underserved youth. Because C5LA aims to prepare youth for college through programs like the Road to College, the agency has developed extensive partnerships with dozens of colleges and universities across the country. C5LA’s A.C.T. Now Summit enables students to spend a week on a local college campus designing and developing a day-long college access and awareness event for other at-risk students. C5LA youth deliver college preparatory presentations to hundreds of peers. 
   
   C5LA has also partnered with South Central Scholars in the creation of the “College Access Brain Trust,” which includes leadership from several key organizations, including the National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship and the Magic Johnson Foundation. 
   
   C5LA maintains a complementary relationship with the above organizations as well as other youth-serving agencies in LA. There is a tremendous need for support services for at-risk youth throughout LA County and C5LA offers innovative programming with unique components, including: 1) our five-year, year round model; 2) our proprietary curriculum which was developed by a team of nationwide youth development experts and honed over the years by the staff; 3) our robust evaluation processes including third party entities; 4) our signature, residential summer experiences; and 5) adventure-based leadership development training in Wyoming and Washington and at sites around greater Los Angeles during the school year. 
   
   We ensure our collaborations are successful by:
   - Working closely with existing collaborative partners to further develop our program;
   - Seeking out relationships with college preparatory programs that have been proven effective; and
   - Constantly exploring how we can partner with new organizations that serve a similar youth demographic.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Part of our program expansion includes the development of strategic
  partnerships with college retention experts. The first several months of the
  grant, if awarded, will be dedicated to exploring who the key stakeholders are
  and conducting outreach. C5LA will begin reaching out to current partners such
  as the Southern California College Access Network and the Posse Foundation to
  leverage resources and identify best practices.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  The total program budget is $140,000. In addition to funding in the amount of
  $100,000 from LA2050, $40,000 will be funded through support from other
  foundations. 
   
   $51,500 to Create a 1st Year College Boot Camp: The first few months of college can be overwhelming. To help smooth the transition from high school to college life, C5LA will host a weekend 1st Year College Summer Boot Camp. Beginning in 2016, sessions will include what students need to know, coping strategies, campus resources, and ways to connect with peers. 
   
   $46,000 to Enhance Data Collection: To understand factors contributing to college success or failure, we will develop and implement a rigorous data collection system. C5LA plans to use the National Student Clearinghouse to determine where C5LA students are now and to collect data on college enrollment. We are interested in capturing both quantitative and qualitative data along with anecdotal and social aspects of student progress. Due to the intensive work of following up on the students, finding out where they are, and understanding what barriers they may be facing, we would need an additional, dedicated staff member to accomplish this. 
   
   $42,500 to Support Alumni Association Initiatives: An important factor in C5LA’s success is the sense of belonging and ownership students take in their experience. Building upon the work we do through the Association, we will reach out to students via newsletters and social media to engage them and remind them that they are always part of the C5 family. C5LA will also host at least two events for college students per year (during the holidays and spring break).
   
   
   C5LA has a robust year-round fundraising campaign, and we currently receive grant support from the Morris and Mayer Kaplan Family Foundation ($50,000), the Ball Corporation ($25,000), Insperity ($5,000), Rose Hills Foundation ($50,000), Joseph Drown Foundation ($50,000), Weingart Foundation ($25,000), the Carl E. Wynn Foundation ($5,000), LA Lakers ($5,000), the Ralph M. Parsons Foundation ($25,000), Windsong Trust ($125,000), Venable Law Firm ($1,000), the John W. Carson Foundation ($5,000), Kimberly-Clark Foundation ($50,000), and Berkshire Hathaway Charitable Foundation ($2,500). C5LA plans to include alumni support in all future proposals to ensure sustainability. In addition to grants, C5LA’s diverse fundraising plan includes special events, corporate support, board engagement, and individual donations.

How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  C5LA is actively seeking funding so that we can expand our current programming
  to offer greater support to our alumni through college. The amount of funding
  received will directly impact the level and depth of services we are able to
  provide our students. We hope to continue to broaden the services and outreach
  activities for C5LA alumni to be able to identify and address all barriers to
  successful completion of their college degree. 
   With the support of LA2050 we will:
   • Roll out the program at the top of 2015. 
   • We will pilot the boot camp in the summer of 2016.
   • We hope to connect with and engage 40% of our alumni in Year One and increase that to 75% in Year Two and 100% in Year Three.
   • We will host two alumni events in Year One and four events in Years Two and Three.
   • Migrate data and launch new software in the third and fourth quarters of Year One.
