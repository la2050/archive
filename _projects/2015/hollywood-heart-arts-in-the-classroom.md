  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "Hollywood HEART is dedicated to building the best future for our young people, regardless of the challenges they face. If our city is to thrive in 2050, we must educate our youth to become innovative thinkers and problem solvers, to move comfortably between art and technology, and to have the skills and perseverance to succeed in the creative economy. Hollywood HEART strives to ensure that the opportunities that lie ahead are open to all. From filmmaking to culinary arts, fashion to photography, the arts lead to growth and opportunity for our young people and for LA.\r\n \r\nThrough our programming, Hollywood HEART provides a pathway that encourages students to graduate from high school and succeed in college/career training programs.  By linking in-class and after-school Workshops, we encourage long term engagement in the arts that has been proven to increase academic achievement and graduation rates. Arts education is vital to the future of Los Angeles. As noted scholar, Shirley Brice Heath, observes “cultural strategies are vastly underutilized and misunderstood…What leaders fail to realize is that culture is a school-to-work strategy, a youth development strategy, and an economic enterprise strategy.” Nowhere is this more true than in Los Angeles, the heart of the creative economy, not just for the US but for the world.\r\n \r\nHollywood HEART works with schools to design in-class Educational Arts Workshops that integrate creative skills into core academic curriculum and provide after-school programs for students who want to continue working in their chosen art form. We bring in volunteers and guest speakers to work with the students and talk to them about creative career opportunities. Hollywood HEART is also forging partnerships with community and four-year colleges to build a high school to college pipeline for low-income students interested in creative careers. We are partnering with the entertainment industry to encourage diversity and incorporate new perspectives into their workforce.\r\n \r\nWith support from LA 2050, Hollywood HEART will be able fully implement its program at LA High School and expand to two new schools. We will be able to tailor our workshops to each school’s curriculum and provide performances and exhibitions to engage the entire community.\r\n\r\nBy ensuring that young people have sustained access to the arts, we are making LA the best place to learn.\r\n"

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    The greatest challenge Hollywood HEART faces is that some of the students we
    serve have such little exposure to the arts that they won’t seek out arts
    electives and after-school programs even if offered. We have encountered
    this challenge at a number of schools and are developing two complementary
    responses.  The first strategy, which we are implementing at LA High School
    with initial success is to implement in-class workshops. Past experience has
    shown us that once students experience our workshops and get to know our
    talented teaching artists they will voluntarily participate in after-school
    programs and even recruit their friends. We are also launching an outreach
    effort to better market our workshops. Can we encourage participation by
    re-imagining some programs and changing others: are young people more
    motivated if we call their short films Youtube videos? Would they be more
    inspired by guitar or dance workshops?
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Hollywood HEART is committed to a strong evaluation process. Our extensive internal assessment strategy includes administering pre- and post-program surveys to measure student interest and skill acquisition in the arts as well as their self-assessment of school engagement and class participation. Classroom teachers will evaluate program implementation, the quality of instruction, and alignment to the Common Core as well as the impact on student engagement and performance. We encourage the school administrations to provide comparative data on school attendance and achievement.\r\n"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "We are aware of many organizations that bring arts programming to schools but none that that share the breadth and depth of our vision. The great majority of nonprofit arts organizations working in the schools concentrate primarily on elementary and middle school students. This includes many of the larger programs such as P.S. Arts and the CalArts Community Arts Partnership. There are also a number of significant nonprofits working to encourage low-income and minority students to stay in school and transition successfully to college. These efforts, including the Fulfillment Fund, work in schools with similar demographics as Hollywood HEART but target high achieving students. In contrast, Hollywood HEART works with older youth and seeks to impact the entire student body at our partner schools\r\n\r\nA number of characteristics set Hollywood HEART’s program apart; first and foremost is our willingness to listen to classroom teachers and school administrators and create programs tailored to the needs and interests of their students. We arrive with many ideas but few restrictions: we build workshops around class readings, adapt programs to student interests, and work with teachers to use our programs to offer struggling students extra-credit projects. Hollywood HEART’s approach is also unique in its focus on school culture. Our goal is not just to impact individual students, or even classes; our goal is to transform the culture of the school. We do this by bringing multiple programs into the schools; supporting schoolwide performances, linking in-class and after-school programs. We also collaborate with other nonprofits to integrate their work into our efforts and reach out to the surrounding community. \r\n\r\nThe LA 2050 Challenge encourages the applicants to look beyond their immediate objectives to consider how we can work together to create a powerful future for Los Angeles. Hollywood HEART also stands out for its long-term vision. Our goal is to work towards building bridges between our partnership schools and community and four-year colleges. We know that an investment in our schools and our students is critical to forging a successful future, and by focusing on those most in need we can maximize the impact of our efforts.\r\n"
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    Hollywood HEART hires teaching artists to implement our Educational Arts
    Workshops. On occasion we have implemented curriculum developed by other
    nonprofits who offer specific workshops that align with our pedagogical
    model. We have collaborated with the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice
    and Human Rights, using their free social justice curriculum, Speak Truth to
    Power and Rabbit Hole Screenings, a small nonprofit that uses film as an
    entryway into personal creativity and personal growth for at-risk students.
    Hollywood HEART has hired individuals trained by these organizations to lead
    the workshops but has not entered into any contracts directly with the
    nonprofit organizations.
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    The program we are proposing is for the LA 2050 Challenge is budgeted at
    $100,000. We have a number of additional grant proposals pending for this
    effort.  The ultimate size of the effort will depend on the total amount of
    funds we receive. However, the LA 2050 Challenge grant by itself will allow
    us to sustain and further improve our partnership with LA High School and to
    begin programming at two new sites.

  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "Hollywood HEART’s proposal is in fact the first stage for scaling our Integrated Arts Program by introducing it to two new schools. We have recently launched a major fundraising campaign to increase our school-based programming which complements this effort. We are expanding our partnerships with the entertainment industry to increase both financial support for our programs and mentoring and internship opportunities for our students. We do not envision going beyond three high schools at this time. Goals for the future include the addition of professional development for classroom teachers to institutionalize the integration of the arts into school curricula. We also anticipate extending the program to build a pathway for students into community and four-year colleges.\r\n \r\nThere is extensive research supporting both the need and the potential impact for college-based programs. Recent studies have highlighted the fact that while the high school graduation rates for low-income and at-risk youth are improving, and more of these students are entering college, the college graduation rates for low-income students has remained essentially unchanged since 1970 at a dismal 20%. Studies have long supported the link between a sustained engagement in the arts and improved academic achievement and graduation rates at the high school level. Hollywood HEART proposes that we take advantage of this fact to improve college outcomes as well.\r\n \r\nHollywood HEART is currently reaching out to community colleges who have targeted programs for first generation and low-income students to provide encouragement and support for our students who wish to continue working in art-related fields. We are also in preliminary discussions with a four-year college who has expressed an interest in launching a similar effort. Our initial programming will target students interested in career opportunities for “below the line” positions in film and television which aligns not only with our film and digital media workshops but also our culinary arts and fashion programs which translate easily to catering and costuming careers."

Hollywood HEART proposes that we take advantage of this fact to improve college outcomes as well.
    
   Hollywood HEART is currently reaching out to community colleges who have targeted programs for first generation and low-income students to provide encouragement and support for our students who wish to continue working in art-related fields. We are also in preliminary discussions with a four-year college who has expressed an interest in launching a similar effort. Our initial programming will target students interested in career opportunities for “below the line” positions in film and television which aligns not only with our film and digital media workshops but also our culinary arts and fashion programs which translate easily to catering and costuming careers.
