  CISLA’s goal is to improve educational outcomes for underserved students at 12
  schools in Los Angeles Unified School District, leading to an increase in
  graduation rates. Through the use of one-on-one case management and
  school-wide or small group interventions, we will place passionate and trained
  social service professionals onto school campuses every day to identify the
  needs – academic and non-academic - of students and offer on-site programs and
  referrals services that address those needs.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Transportation in LA is undergoing a sea change, guided by the expansion of
  public transit, efforts to promote safe walking and bicycling, and the growth
  of technology enabled bikesharing, carsharing, and ridesharing. People today
  can access a bike or car for short-term use or to share a ride with someone
  heading in the same direction thus splitting the cost. This offers a
  tremendous opportunity to benefit low income communities because owning a car
  costs up to $9,000 a year. 
   These resources have the potential to tackle the 1st/last mile gap of public transit, lower the need to purchase a vehicle, and reduce air pollution from vehicles. They could also lower the need to build unnecessary parking spaces, reducing construction costs and increasing the stock of affordable housing. However, figuring out how to tailor these services to low income communities has not received sufficient attention. Given the large number of LA’s neighborhoods that were deemed “disadvantaged communities” by the California Environmental Protection Agency, due in large part to socioeconomic factors and exposure to air pollution, this proposal seeks to create a shared mobility ecosystem model that could guide private and public efforts in this arena.
   CBE will work with Trust South LA, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and the Shared Use Mobility Center (SUMC) to build on the momentum of recent developments in shared mobility – namely the City of LA’s launch of low income electric carsharing in central LA low income neighborhoods and LA Metro’s launch of bikesharing in Downtown LA. 
   Focusing these programs on the needs of South and Southeast LA – where median incomes are well below the county’s median – can improve residents’ quality of life with affordable on-demand access to cars and bikes, filling in gaps in the transit network and drastically reducing the need to own a car to be able to live and work. We will lead a participatory planning process to identify the range of residents’ transportation needs that could be met through a mix of bikesharing, carsharing, and ridesharing that can leverage the growing public transit network. Their input will be captured through community focus groups in a customized plan, which we will pitch to local government and transportation officials as well as private providers to develop a competitive public-private implementation proposal to state and other funding. This model can be then expanded to more communities in LA.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Disinvestment: These communities have faced a pattern of disinvestment that
  makes private companies less likely to take risks on their own, and has
  resulted in physical environments without the mix of land uses and household
  income levels that are often prerequisites for shared mobility systems. This
  Plan will proactively address this through creative program startup
  investments.
   Accessibility: Many of the community members in greatest need of transportation solutions also face the most significant barriers to accessing them, whether barriers of language, physical disability, internet access, or banking. This Plan will address these barriers in the program design using popular education methods to meet the community where it is in terms of language, availability, skills, and resources.
   Design Bias: In addition to accessibility barriers, existing shared mobility systems are tailored to attract above-median income clientele. We will work to create a design that is affordable and useful
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  During the first 6 months, we will analyze the communities’ socioeconomic
  characteristics and conduct two focus groups. It is estimated that the focus
  groups will engage up to 100 residents and stakeholders each to develop an
  assessment of their transportation needs. The second 6 months will focus on
  gaining local buy-in from elected and community stakeholders through letters
  of support and ultimately securing support in 2017 to launch programs. Thus,
  the first quarter (post grant award) will focus on the analytical work with
  the focus groups and community engagement taking place in the second quarter.
  The third and fourth quarters will focus on securing endorsements and funding
  commitments from local elected and city officials as well as private providers
  in the bikesharing and carsharing industries. Ultimately, the success of this
  project will be determined by both the scale at which these programs are
  deployed and the extent to which the programs are used by low-income
  residents.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  This project is being proposed by many of the organizations involved in the LA
  City EV carshare project (EV pilot), which will be led by LADOT and SUMC and
  focuses on Central Los Angeles. NRDC has convened a Steering Committee, of
  which CBE & TRUST South LA are part, for Phase One of EV pilot, and project
  partners will translate lessons learned to this Shared Mobility Plan for South
  and Southeast LA. Although carsharing will only be one aspect of the Plan, the
  Phase One project will tackle the same disinvestment, accessibility, and
  design issues.
   Additionally, there are parallel efforts from which we can learn. Specifically, there is an effort in the central valley focused on bringing ridesharing and vanpooling solutions to farmworkers and farmworker communities so that they can get to and from work, clinics, and school. The SUMC project lead has hands on experience managing the Buffalo carshare operation that provided shared cars to low income residents of this upstate New York community. Finally, the LA County Bike Coalition has worked with the cities of Bell, Bell Gardens, and Huntington Park to pursue California Active Transportation funding to develop a south LA county bike masterplan, which will lay the groundwork for bikeshare expansion. Our proposal aligns the best of these projects and planning efforts to develop a shared mobility ecosystem that meets the unique needs of these communities and then pursue a mix of public and private resources to expand these innovative transportation solutions into our communities.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': |-
  • CBE - $25,000
   • TRUST South LA - $25,000
   • NRDC - $25,000
   • SUMC - $25,000
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  We believe that urgency and opportunity of this proposal will necessitate an
  investment of $250,000. However, given the participation of the partners in
  the LA City’s grant funds for Phase 1, this proposal is able to leverage the
  resources available for community, public/government engagement and
  stakeholder engagement to expand the analysis and outreach into South and
  Southeast LA communities for minimal additional cost. 
   
   All told, an expansion of car and bikesharing systems alone (not to mention ridesourcing and car/vanpooling) could mean anywhere from a $3 – 10 Million initial investment in these communities, and the Shared Mobility Plan would be the first step towards advocating for these investment of these resources in South and Southeast LA. A solid plan that comes from the community will be critical to securing public resources and inducing private investment.

   II. Community Engagement - $34,161

   V. Analysis & Feasibility Study - $11,875
   VI. Social Media - $4,772
   VII. Drafting Shared Mobility Plan - $13,765
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Phase 1 of the LA City EV low income car share project created the momentum
  that allowed community-based organizations to consider a scope of this
  proposal – namely, a consideration of potential funding resources that’d allow
  a modified version of the former project to be expanded into these
  communities. We believe that the focused analysis, scoping, and stakeholder
  engagement, including with mobility providers, of this Shared Mobility Plan
  will help channel future resources, should the City of LA (or the cities of
  Bell, Bell Gardens, or Huntington Park) pursue future grants from the sources
  described above, to these communities. We believe that this proposal will
  provide timely analysis to nudge Metro to bring future bikeshare resources to
  South and Southeast LA. 
   This targeted Shared Mobility Plan could be a prototype for other disadvantaged communities in Southern California, from East LA to Long Beach to Inglewood and parts of the San Fernando Valley. All of these communities deserve to be part of the shift towards affordable shared mobility solutions, and this Plan will be a prototype for how to get there.

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "With 80% of students in LAUSD living at or below the federal poverty line, many students do not have the resources they need to be successful. Even the highest-quality teachers and the most state-of-the-art technology cannot effectively educate a child who is missing school, arrives hungry, or is experiencing the effects of unaddressed trauma. This is evidenced in the fact that only 77% of LAUSD students graduated from high school in 2014. \r\n\r\nCISLA is helping to change the way children are educated in our city through an evidence-based and data-driven approach: addressing social-emotional needs first, so that students are equipped to learn. We start by focusing on underserved, high-poverty communities that are struggling to keep students in school. We assess their schools’ greatest overall barriers to student achievement, such as gang involvement, cyberbullying, or a simple lack of basic things like food and clothing, and we hire Site Coordinators – passionate and trained social service professionals – to create on-campus initiatives and broker resources to address these barriers.\r\n \r\nIn addition to implementing school-wide programming at each school, our Site Coordinators also seek out the 5-10% of students who need the most support and offer them individualized case management – continual, one-on-one guidance and a listening ear throughout the entire school year. Our Site Coordinators meet students where they are, working with them, their families, and their teachers to do whatever it takes to ensure that they stay in school and succeed.\r\n\r\nCISLA’s approach has been proven to work. We have a four-year graduation rate of 92%, and throughout the 2014-2015 school year:\r\n-\tWe served over 17,000 students with school-wide supports\r\n-\tWe served 1,900 students most at risk of dropping out with individualized, one-on-one case management. \r\n-\t95% of case-managed seniors graduated in 2015\r\n-\t70% of case-managed eighth graders culminated in 2015\r\n-\t75% of case-managed students reduced their number of behavioral infractions\r\n-\t56% of case-managed students improved their grades\r\n-\t62% of students improved their attendance rates\r\n\r\nFunds from this grant will help us to place four full time Site Coordinators in underserved schools this year, where they will provide hundreds of students with the personalized support they need to focus on their education and stay on track to graduate. "
  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    The largest barrier we anticipate in this program is a lack of awareness in
    our communities surrounding what it is that we do. In order for our program
    to thrive, we need buy-in from people in the neighborhoods we serve. This
    includes students and their families, school personnel, other community
    organizations, and funders. To address this challenge, we are getting the
    word out to as many of these key stakeholders as possible. We are doing this
    through website, email and social media marketing, as well as student,
    family and teacher activities at our schools.
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    We measure our success by the progress our students make toward 8th grade
    culmination and high school graduation. This progress correlates directly
    with improvements in attendance, behavior, and coursework. A 2010 Johns
    Hopkins University study found that students who present at 6th grade with
    poor attendance, behavior, or coursework – known as Early Warning Indicators
    – are less likely to graduate high school. We also know that as students
    transition from middle to high school, aptitude in the areas of confidence,
    stress, and motivation is very important, so we employ Success Highways
    resiliency assessments at the beginning and end of each year. CISLA uses an
    off-track/on-track system to identify the most at-risk students and to
    measure their progress. Improvements in attendance, behavior, and coursework
    as well as improved results in resiliency are key interim success measures
    as we support students on the pathway toward eighth grade culmination and
    high school graduation. 
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    Los Angeles has a large number of community organizations dedicated to
    improving educational outcomes, and their collaboration with us in this
    endeavor is crucial to our program. Our approach is unique in that it
    combines, rather than competes with, organizations that work toward
    achieving the same goals we have. We triage the resources of partner
    organizations to bring them to the campuses of our schools so that students
    and their families are not overburdened with the need to seek out multiple
    agencies outside of the school. Our campuses now act as hubs for support
    services. A student in one of our schools could, for example, find a tutor,
    mental health counseling, a mentor, and an arts program all within the
    parameters of a normal school day. Our Site Coordinators ensure that
    students need not miss instruction time to seek out these resources, and
    that their parents - many of whom work two or more jobs - need not take more
    time than is absolutely necessary out of their paying hours. We are excited
    to find other agencies with our mission, and we gladly embrace them as
    partners in our work.
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    CISLA will partner with over 50 community organizations in order to serve
    individual student needs. These collaborations continue to grow, and include
    providers of basic needs like Operation School Bell and the Los Angeles
    Regional Food Bank; health and fitness organizations like South Central
    Family Health Center, j.k. livin, and St. John's Well Child and Family
    Center; academic resources like City Year Los Angeles and Diplomas Now; and
    educational enrichment partners like Girls, Inc., Museum of Tolerance, the
    Venice Boys & Girls Club, and the Woodcraft Rangers. CISLA also convenes a
    community Advisory Council made up of school principals, LAUSD
    representatives, and professionals working in the nonprofit and academic
    fields. The work of all of these organizations will be independently funded
    by their own 501(c)3 fundraising efforts.
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    CISLA’s program in total will cost approximately $3 million dollars. This
    includes overhead and administrative costs, as well as the program costs for
    personnel, supplies, field trips, and incentive materials. If this grant is
    awarded, CISLA will fund the rest of its work through a variety of
    foundation grants (about 25-30% of its budget), government grants (10%),
    special events (25%), and individual contributions (35%).
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "All $100,000 will be used for personnel salaries for our trained Site Coordinators, ensuring that they are able to remain on campus full-time to support the needs of students. We will allocate the grant monies as follows:\r\n\r\n$25,000 x 4 Site Coordinators FTE (partial salaries)\r\n\r\nAll grant monies will be used directly for this purpose and will not be reallocated by the organization."

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "With 80% of students in LAUSD living at or below the federal poverty line, many students do not have the resources they need to be successful. Even the highest-quality teachers and the most state-of-the-art technology cannot effectively educate a child who is missing school, arrives hungry, or is experiencing the effects of unaddressed trauma. This is evidenced in the fact that only 77% of LAUSD students graduated from high school in 2014. \r\n\r\nCISLA is helping to change the way children are educated in our city through an evidence-based and data-driven approach: addressing social-emotional needs first, so that students are equipped to learn. We start by focusing on underserved, high-poverty communities that are struggling to keep students in school. We assess their schools’ greatest overall barriers to student achievement, such as gang involvement, cyberbullying, or a simple lack of basic things like food and clothing, and we hire Site Coordinators – passionate and trained social service professionals – to create on-campus initiatives and broker resources to address these barriers.\r\n \r\nIn addition to implementing school-wide programming at each school, our Site Coordinators also seek out the 5-10% of students who need the most support and offer them individualized case management – continual, one-on-one guidance and a listening ear throughout the entire school year. Our Site Coordinators meet students where they are, working with them, their families, and their teachers to do whatever it takes to ensure that they stay in school and succeed.\r\n\r\nCISLA’s approach has been proven to work. We have a four-year graduation rate of 92%, and throughout the 2014-2015 school year:\r\n-\tWe served over 17,000 students with school-wide supports\r\n-\tWe served 1,900 students most at risk of dropping out with individualized, one-on-one case management. \r\n-\t95% of case-managed seniors graduated in 2015\r\n-\t70% of case-managed eighth graders culminated in 2015\r\n-\t75% of case-managed students reduced their number of behavioral infractions\r\n-\t56% of case-managed students improved their grades\r\n-\t62% of students improved their attendance rates\r\n\r\nFunds from this grant will help us to place four full time Site Coordinators in underserved schools this year, where they will provide hundreds of students with the personalized support they need to focus on their education and stay on track to graduate.

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      The largest barrier we anticipate in this program is a lack of awareness
      in our communities surrounding what it is that we do. In order for our
      program to thrive, we need buy-in from people in the neighborhoods we
      serve. This includes students and their families, school personnel, other
      community organizations, and funders. To address this challenge, we are
      getting the word out to as many of these key stakeholders as possible. We
      are doing this through website, email and social media marketing, as well
      as student, family and teacher activities at our schools.
  - name: Please explain how you will evaluate your work.
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      We measure our success by the progress our students make toward 8th grade
      culmination and high school graduation. This progress correlates directly
      with improvements in attendance, behavior, and coursework. A 2010 Johns
      Hopkins University study found that students who present at 6th grade with
      poor attendance, behavior, or coursework – known as Early Warning
      Indicators – are less likely to graduate high school. We also know that as
      students transition from middle to high school, aptitude in the areas of
      confidence, stress, and motivation is very important, so we employ Success
      Highways resiliency assessments at the beginning and end of each year.
      CISLA uses an off-track/on-track system to identify the most at-risk
      students and to measure their progress. Improvements in attendance,
      behavior, and coursework as well as improved results in resiliency are key
      interim success measures as we support students on the pathway toward
      eighth grade culmination and high school graduation.

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      Los Angeles has a large number of community organizations dedicated to
      improving educational outcomes, and their collaboration with us in this
      endeavor is crucial to our program. Our approach is unique in that it
      combines, rather than competes with, organizations that work toward
      achieving the same goals we have. We triage the resources of partner
      organizations to bring them to the campuses of our schools so that
      students and their families are not overburdened with the need to seek out
      multiple agencies outside of the school. Our campuses now act as hubs for
      support services. A student in one of our schools could, for example, find
      a tutor, mental health counseling, a mentor, and an arts program all
      within the parameters of a normal school day. Our Site Coordinators ensure
      that students need not miss instruction time to seek out these resources,
      and that their parents - many of whom work two or more jobs - need not
      take more time than is absolutely necessary out of their paying hours. We
      are excited to find other agencies with our mission, and we gladly embrace
      them as partners in our work.

      Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on
      this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner
      receive?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      CISLA will partner with over 50 community organizations in order to serve
      individual student needs. These collaborations continue to grow, and
      include providers of basic needs like Operation School Bell and the Los
      Angeles Regional Food Bank; health and fitness organizations like South
      Central Family Health Center, j.k. livin, and St. John's Well Child and
      Family Center; academic resources like City Year Los Angeles and Diplomas
      Now; and educational enrichment partners like Girls, Inc., Museum of
      Tolerance, the Venice Boys & Girls Club, and the Woodcraft Rangers. CISLA
      also convenes a community Advisory Council made up of school principals,
      LAUSD representatives, and professionals working in the nonprofit and
      academic fields. The work of all of these organizations will be
      independently funded by their own 501(c)3 fundraising efforts.

      CISLA’s program in total will cost approximately $3 million dollars. This
      includes overhead and administrative costs, as well as the program costs
      for personnel, supplies, field trips, and incentive materials. If this
      grant is awarded, CISLA will fund the rest of its work through a variety
      of foundation grants (about 25-30% of its budget), government grants
      (10%), special events (25%), and individual contributions (35%).

      goal of adding three additional schools by the 2018-2019 school year. We
      plan to achieve this with the full support of our board of directors, our
      executive director, and our dedicated administrative staff, as well as
      outside consultants in order to ensure that our reach extends across Los
      Angeles, improving its graduation rate and helping its students to see
      beyond limitations toward the great things that lie ahead.
