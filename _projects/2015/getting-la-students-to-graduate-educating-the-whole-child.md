title: 'Getting LA students to graduate: educating the whole child'
project_summary: >-
  CISLA’s goal is to improve educational outcomes for underserved students at 12
  schools in Los Angeles Unified School District, leading to an increase in
  graduation rates. Through the use of one-on-one case management and
  school-wide or small group interventions, we will place passionate and trained
  social service professionals onto school campuses every day to identify the
  needs – academic and non-academic - of students and offer on-site programs and
  referrals services that address those needs.

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "With 80% of students in LAUSD living at or below the federal poverty line, many students do not have the resources they need to be successful. Even the highest-quality teachers and the most state-of-the-art technology cannot effectively educate a child who is missing school, arrives hungry, or is experiencing the effects of unaddressed trauma. This is evidenced in the fact that only 77% of LAUSD students graduated from high school in 2014. \r\n\r\nCISLA is helping to change the way children are educated in our city through an evidence-based and data-driven approach: addressing social-emotional needs first, so that students are equipped to learn. We start by focusing on underserved, high-poverty communities that are struggling to keep students in school. We assess their schools’ greatest overall barriers to student achievement, such as gang involvement, cyberbullying, or a simple lack of basic things like food and clothing, and we hire Site Coordinators – passionate and trained social service professionals – to create on-campus initiatives and broker resources to address these barriers.\r\n \r\nIn addition to implementing school-wide programming at each school, our Site Coordinators also seek out the 5-10% of students who need the most support and offer them individualized case management – continual, one-on-one guidance and a listening ear throughout the entire school year. Our Site Coordinators meet students where they are, working with them, their families, and their teachers to do whatever it takes to ensure that they stay in school and succeed.\r\n\r\nCISLA’s approach has been proven to work. We have a four-year graduation rate of 92%, and throughout the 2014-2015 school year:\r\n-\tWe served over 17,000 students with school-wide supports\r\n-\tWe served 1,900 students most at risk of dropping out with individualized, one-on-one case management. \r\n-\t95% of case-managed seniors graduated in 2015\r\n-\t70% of case-managed eighth graders culminated in 2015\r\n-\t75% of case-managed students reduced their number of behavioral infractions\r\n-\t56% of case-managed students improved their grades\r\n-\t62% of students improved their attendance rates\r\n\r\nFunds from this grant will help us to place four full time Site Coordinators in underserved schools this year, where they will provide hundreds of students with the personalized support they need to focus on their education and stay on track to graduate.

    We measure our success by the progress our students make toward 8th grade
    culmination and high school graduation. This progress correlates directly
    with improvements in attendance, behavior, and coursework. A 2010 Johns
    Hopkins University study found that students who present at 6th grade with
    poor attendance, behavior, or coursework – known as Early Warning Indicators
    – are less likely to graduate high school. We also know that as students
    transition from middle to high school, aptitude in the areas of confidence,
    stress, and motivation is very important, so we employ Success Highways
    resiliency assessments at the beginning and end of each year. CISLA uses an
    off-track/on-track system to identify the most at-risk students and to
    measure their progress. Improvements in attendance, behavior, and coursework
    as well as improved results in resiliency are key interim success measures
    as we support students on the pathway toward eighth grade culmination and
    high school graduation.

  Transportation in LA is undergoing a sea change, guided by the expansion of
  public transit, efforts to promote safe walking and bicycling, and the growth
  of technology enabled bikesharing, carsharing, and ridesharing. People today
  can access a bike or car for short-term use or to share a ride with someone
  heading in the same direction thus splitting the cost. This offers a
  tremendous opportunity to benefit low income communities because owning a car
  costs up to $9,000 a year. 
   These resources have the potential to tackle the 1st/last mile gap of public transit, lower the need to purchase a vehicle, and reduce air pollution from vehicles. They could also lower the need to build unnecessary parking spaces, reducing construction costs and increasing the stock of affordable housing. However, figuring out how to tailor these services to low income communities has not received sufficient attention. Given the large number of LA’s neighborhoods that were deemed “disadvantaged communities” by the California Environmental Protection Agency, due in large part to socioeconomic factors and exposure to air pollution, this proposal seeks to create a shared mobility ecosystem model that could guide private and public efforts in this arena.
   CBE will work with Trust South LA, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and the Shared Use Mobility Center (SUMC) to build on the momentum of recent developments in shared mobility – namely the City of LA’s launch of low income electric carsharing in central LA low income neighborhoods and LA Metro’s launch of bikesharing in Downtown LA. 
   Focusing these programs on the needs of South and Southeast LA – where median incomes are well below the county’s median – can improve residents’ quality of life with affordable on-demand access to cars and bikes, filling in gaps in the transit network and drastically reducing the need to own a car to be able to live and work. We will lead a participatory planning process to identify the range of residents’ transportation needs that could be met through a mix of bikesharing, carsharing, and ridesharing that can leverage the growing public transit network. Their input will be captured through community focus groups in a customized plan, which we will pitch to local government and transportation officials as well as private providers to develop a competitive public-private implementation proposal to state and other funding. This model can be then expanded to more communities in LA.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Disinvestment: These communities have faced a pattern of disinvestment that
  makes private companies less likely to take risks on their own, and has
  resulted in physical environments without the mix of land uses and household
  income levels that are often prerequisites for shared mobility systems. This
  Plan will proactively address this through creative program startup
  investments.
   Accessibility: Many of the community members in greatest need of transportation solutions also face the most significant barriers to accessing them, whether barriers of language, physical disability, internet access, or banking. This Plan will address these barriers in the program design using popular education methods to meet the community where it is in terms of language, availability, skills, and resources.
   Design Bias: In addition to accessibility barriers, existing shared mobility systems are tailored to attract above-median income clientele. We will work to create a design that is affordable and useful
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  During the first 6 months, we will analyze the communities’ socioeconomic
  characteristics and conduct two focus groups. It is estimated that the focus
  groups will engage up to 100 residents and stakeholders each to develop an
  assessment of their transportation needs. The second 6 months will focus on
  gaining local buy-in from elected and community stakeholders through letters
  of support and ultimately securing support in 2017 to launch programs. Thus,
  the first quarter (post grant award) will focus on the analytical work with
  the focus groups and community engagement taking place in the second quarter.
  The third and fourth quarters will focus on securing endorsements and funding
  commitments from local elected and city officials as well as private providers
  in the bikesharing and carsharing industries. Ultimately, the success of this
  project will be determined by both the scale at which these programs are
  deployed and the extent to which the programs are used by low-income
  residents.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  This project is being proposed by many of the organizations involved in the LA
  City EV carshare project (EV pilot), which will be led by LADOT and SUMC and
  focuses on Central Los Angeles. NRDC has convened a Steering Committee, of
  which CBE & TRUST South LA are part, for Phase One of EV pilot, and project
  partners will translate lessons learned to this Shared Mobility Plan for South
  and Southeast LA. Although carsharing will only be one aspect of the Plan, the
  Phase One project will tackle the same disinvestment, accessibility, and
  design issues.
   Additionally, there are parallel efforts from which we can learn. Specifically, there is an effort in the central valley focused on bringing ridesharing and vanpooling solutions to farmworkers and farmworker communities so that they can get to and from work, clinics, and school. The SUMC project lead has hands on experience managing the Buffalo carshare operation that provided shared cars to low income residents of this upstate New York community. Finally, the LA County Bike Coalition has worked with the cities of Bell, Bell Gardens, and Huntington Park to pursue California Active Transportation funding to develop a south LA county bike masterplan, which will lay the groundwork for bikeshare expansion. Our proposal aligns the best of these projects and planning efforts to develop a shared mobility ecosystem that meets the unique needs of these communities and then pursue a mix of public and private resources to expand these innovative transportation solutions into our communities.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': |-
  • CBE - $25,000
   • TRUST South LA - $25,000
   • NRDC - $25,000
   • SUMC - $25,000
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Phase 1 of the LA City EV low income car share project created the momentum
  that allowed community-based organizations to consider a scope of this
  proposal – namely, a consideration of potential funding resources that’d allow
  a modified version of the former project to be expanded into these
  communities. We believe that the focused analysis, scoping, and stakeholder
  engagement, including with mobility providers, of this Shared Mobility Plan
  will help channel future resources, should the City of LA (or the cities of
  Bell, Bell Gardens, or Huntington Park) pursue future grants from the sources
  described above, to these communities. We believe that this proposal will
  provide timely analysis to nudge Metro to bring future bikeshare resources to
  South and Southeast LA. 
   This targeted Shared Mobility Plan could be a prototype for other disadvantaged communities in Southern California, from East LA to Long Beach to Inglewood and parts of the San Fernando Valley. All of these communities deserve to be part of the shift towards affordable shared mobility solutions, and this Plan will be a prototype for how to get there.
