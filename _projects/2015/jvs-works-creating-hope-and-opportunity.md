  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: "In LA County, the rate of unemployment remains high at 7%, compared to the nationwide rate of 5% (Aug-2015, DOL), and the rate of poverty remains high at 19%, compared to the statewide rate of 16% (2014, U.S. Census).  And, while employers are looking to fill a wide array of higher paying jobs that require only a H.S. diploma they are not finding workers who have the technical and job readiness skills required (2015, JPChase Morgan).  \r\n\r\nJVS WorksTM training programs help people who have a H.S. diploma and remain unemployed or under-employed get started on a career pathway that can lift them out of poverty today and beyond 2050.  JVS WorksTM training programs prepare people for careers in the high growth industries of healthcare, finance and property management.  Our training programs are provided at no cost to students, allowing them to start their career debt-free upon graduation.  Each training program is developed in close partnership with top industry employers to ensure that our students are fully prepared with the knowledge needed to advance along a meaningful career pathway.  JVS provides all classroom supplies, curricula, and fees for required certification or licensing for graduates. At program completion, all employer partners attend the formal graduation and job fair where they interview our graduates for immediate job placement.  \r\n\r\nJVS Works graduates reflect the diversity of Los Angeles (43% African American, 35% Hispanic, 18% Caucasian, and 4% Other) and are bringing greater diversity to the workplace.  When our graduates return to their communities, they become role models and mentors for future generations.  The steady employment and income that our graduates enjoy provides them and their families with stability, economic self-sufficiency and independence.  As our graduates are no longer dependent on public assistance, they are now contributing to the local economy in their communities.  \r\n\r\nWith the help of LA2050, JVS WorksTM   will hire a staff person to launch a public awareness and outreach campaign to increase the number of people from low-income communities across LA that have access to our proven job skills training programs which prepares and places graduates in high-growth industries with an average annual starting salary of $34,000 with benefits.  In 2014, JVS WorksTM placed 186 graduates in jobs earning a cumulative annual salary and benefits of $6.1 million, providing funders a return on investment that is more than 8-fold!"

Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Developing trust among residents in a new community is always a challenge. Our
  strategy will be to partner with local human services providers who can assist
  with outreach and to conduct program orientation and enrollment sessions in
  these communities. 
   
   Another challenge we anticipate will in getting students to leave their community and travel to our training sites. Our strategy will be to provide students with transportation passes and a support needed to preemptively address any family crisis of childcare or other issues that may interfere with their ability to consistently attend classes. JVS will also seek to identify available free space in the targeted communities where we can conduct the training sessions, whenever possible.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  JVSWorks will evaluate the effectiveness of our Outreach Campaign throughout
  the year by tracking the number of attendees at our program orientation
  sessions. The impact of JVS WorksTM Training Program will be evaluated based
  on the number of enrollments, completions, state certifications/industry
  recognized certificates, job placement rates; and job retention rates at 3, 6,
  and 12 months. Our goal is to place 83% of graduates in a job earning at least
  $15/hr and for 85% to retain employment at six months. 
   Program staff will monitor our graduates’ success on the job by directly contacting each individual to ensure they are thriving in their new work environment. JVS will also track how many graduates receive promotions or go on to pursue advanced training. 
   We will also seek feedback from our employer partners and students to evaluate their level of satisfaction with our services, through pre- and post-program satisfaction surveys, roundtable discussions and idea exchanges.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Each JVS WorksTM training program operates a highly successful model that
  incorporates these essential elements: 
   • Employer engagement
   Perhaps the most distinguishing feature of JVS WorksTM programs is their high level of engagement with employers in our community. JVS frequently seeks feedback from our employer partners to ensure that our curriculum remains current at all times and relevant to the jobs they are seeking to fill. We host formal graduations for all of our JVS WorksTM programs that are immediately followed by a job fair at which recruiters from the employer partners interview every graduate. This greatly facilitates the numbers of our candidates who are hired, as well as the speed of the hiring process.
   • Supporting people facing barriers to employment
   JVS WorksTM programs specifically target the most economically- disadvantaged communities in greater Los Angeles in its recruitment efforts. Those served include single-parents, emancipated foster youth, veterans, people with disabilities, people for whom English is a second language, and many more. Further, the education requirement in each program is a high school diploma or GED, a relatively low hurdle compared with requirements for entry level jobs in other fields. 
   
   • Available at no cost to participants
   JVS is committed to raising the funds needed to provide these JVS WorksTM training programs at no cost to our participants, allowing them to start their career debt-free.
   
   • Technical skills AND “soft” skills
   Each JVS WorksTM program ensures that participants receive all of the technical skills training they need in order to interview well and perform well once they secure a position. JVS augments this technical training with additional training in skills valued by any employer: communication and customer service. We also provide the participants with all they need to mount an effective job search (resume and interviewing preparation) as well as what they will need to get off to a good start on their new job and maintain it. 
   • Employment with long-term growth opportunity
   Each program prepares individuals for entry-level employment in high- growth industries. The industries were selected in part for the career pathing opportunities they offer, facilitating income growth for our graduates as well as career progression.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  We anticipate a grant of $100,000 from LA2050 will cover the cost of hiring a
  full-time staff person needed to implement this public awareness and outreach
  campaign aimed at eliminating the skills gap for 350 disadvantaged individuals
  (18+ years old) living in communities of high poverty across Los Angeles by
  providing them access to JVS WorksTM Award-winning suite of training programs.
  Our outreach efforts will focus on reaching more deeply into communities of
  high poverty and connecting individuals who struggle with a wide range of
  barriers to employment with our training programs.
   
   JVS has the commitment from several funders as well as lead employers in each training industry to provide the funds needed to screen, assess, train, and place these students in jobs that link to careers with a starting wage of at least $15/hour plus benefits.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  JVSWorksTM outstanding program outcomes have brought recognition to our
  training programs which has allowed us to expand our training programs from
  BankWorksTM in 2006 to include HealthWorks in 2009 and now ApartmentWorks in
  2014. In each case, the process for scaling the success of our programs is
  very deliberate and it is based on the level of demand for skilled workers as
  expressed by our employer partners, it follows our proven model of effective
  service delivery that is well documented, and it is done with the support and
  interest of our funders.
