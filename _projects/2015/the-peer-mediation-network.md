  Students will lead the conflict resolution revolution and be agents of
  peaceful change in LA and via the internet. Young people who have received
  Peer Mediation Training will produce and ‘star in’ video podcasts, YouTube
  videos and interactive programs. They will share the basic tenets of
  alternatives to violence and social emotional learning using technology that
  is fast becoming a universal language and whose integration into all facets of
  communication will be de rigueur for citizens of 2050.
