title: The Peer Mediation Network
project_summary: >-
  Students will lead the conflict resolution revolution and be agents of
  peaceful change in LA and via the internet. Young people who have received
  Peer Mediation Training will produce and ‘star in’ video podcasts, YouTube
  videos and interactive programs. They will share the basic tenets of
  alternatives to violence and social emotional learning using technology that
  is fast becoming a universal language and whose integration into all facets of
  communication will be de rigueur for citizens of 2050.

Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "INVLA is in its 4th year training students in South LA to be Peer Mediators. (See attached video). Via the Peer Mediation Network, youth (ages 8 – 18) will take their work to the next level and be agents of peaceful change in their schools and communities. They will collaborate to create regular Vodcasts on the PeerMediationNetwork.org, interviewing other peer mediators, school personnel, families, and potentially reenacting real ‘cases.’ While mastering communication and listening skills, these young people will model alternatives to violence at school and in communities and integrate technology to expand the reach of the program. Combining mediation and social emotional learning with the focused use of technology will provide an invaluable formula for personal and professional life-long success, utilizable in many contexts.\r\n\r\nPeer mediation is a restorative practice in which trained students help their peers resolve conflicts. Based on restorative principles, it promotes interpersonal connection, builds a sense of community and integrates the voices of participants. Training teaches students social emotional learning and conflict resolution skills that allow them to manage their feelings and behaviors and co-exist more peacefully. Disputes that would otherwise escalate to violence, get diffused and agreements reached generally 'stick'. A single suspension increases the chances of low achievement, dropping out of school and being pushed into the criminal justice system. Evidence shows that peer mediation programs (1) reduce violent conflict and generally decrease the number of office referrals and school suspensions by 45% and (2) trained peer mediators have higher academic achievement, increased self-esteem and better communication.  \r\n\r\nThis project will enable INVLA to augment its Peer Mediation Training Program by providing funds for full implementation support at the schools. Creating a safe, stable learning environment, Peer Mediation- especially when offered as a regularly scheduled elective- improves school climates and builds greater student connectedness. \r\n\r\nProject Goals: \r\n(1)\tModel the mastery of the Vodcast, social media, and other technologies as integrated and purposeful tools, in order to mainstream the concept that there are alternatives to violence in society.\r\n(2)\tReduce the rates of suspension and expulsion at each school\r\n(3)\tImprove school climates and increase students’ perceived sense of safety at school"
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Prior to and after providing peer mediation training, the project will analyze school discipline data and administer online and paper surveys to students to assess their knowledge of conflict resolution principles as well as their perception of the school climate and level of safety at school.  Parents will also complete surveys to assess their knowledge of conflict resolution initiatives.\r\nProject trainers will evaluate real time peer mediations and provide feedback and support and mediation participants will complete surveys following each mediation. Surveys will measure outcomes, including:\r\n- The number of cases mediated and agreements reached \r\n- Whether students knew about mediation before the mediation and how they found out \r\n- Satisfaction levels with the mediation\r\n- Ability of each party to communicate feelings and understand the other person’s point of view \r\n- Whether program participation has an impact on how parties manage disputes outside the classroom"
