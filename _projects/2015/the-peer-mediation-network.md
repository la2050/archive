  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "INVLA is in its 4th year training students in South LA to be Peer Mediators. (See attached video). Via the Peer Mediation Network, youth (ages 8 – 18) will take their work to the next level and be agents of peaceful change in their schools and communities. They will collaborate to create regular Vodcasts on the PeerMediationNetwork.org, interviewing other peer mediators, school personnel, families, and potentially reenacting real ‘cases.’ While mastering communication and listening skills, these young people will model alternatives to violence at school and in communities and integrate technology to expand the reach of the program. Combining mediation and social emotional learning with the focused use of technology will provide an invaluable formula for personal and professional life-long success, utilizable in many contexts.\r\n\r\nPeer mediation is a restorative practice in which trained students help their peers resolve conflicts. Based on restorative principles, it promotes interpersonal connection, builds a sense of community and integrates the voices of participants. Training teaches students social emotional learning and conflict resolution skills that allow them to manage their feelings and behaviors and co-exist more peacefully. Disputes that would otherwise escalate to violence, get diffused and agreements reached generally 'stick'. A single suspension increases the chances of low achievement, dropping out of school and being pushed into the criminal justice system. Evidence shows that peer mediation programs (1) reduce violent conflict and generally decrease the number of office referrals and school suspensions by 45% and (2) trained peer mediators have higher academic achievement, increased self-esteem and better communication.  \r\n\r\nThis project will enable INVLA to augment its Peer Mediation Training Program by providing funds for full implementation support at the schools. Creating a safe, stable learning environment, Peer Mediation- especially when offered as a regularly scheduled elective- improves school climates and builds greater student connectedness. \r\n\r\nProject Goals: \r\n(1)\tModel the mastery of the Vodcast, social media, and other technologies as integrated and purposeful tools, in order to mainstream the concept that there are alternatives to violence in society.\r\n(2)\tReduce the rates of suspension and expulsion at each school\r\n(3)\tImprove school climates and increase students’ perceived sense of safety at school"

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    Challenges in the form of student motivation and scheduling peer mediations
    will need to be addressed to ensure the longevity of the project. Special
    events to acknowledge peer mediators and incentives to participate, such as
    sweepstakes with the prize being an appearance on the Vodcast can provide
    motivation. Working with schools to design an implementation plan that
    includes a class period during which mediations can occur will also be
    important. School administrators, teachers, and families will need to be
    curried and brought into the program, as their buy-in will ensure success.
    To this end, INVLA will provide introductory workshops on Peer Mediation and
    Alternative Dispute Resolution training for parents and staff.   
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Prior to and after providing peer mediation training, the project will analyze school discipline data and administer online and paper surveys to students to assess their knowledge of conflict resolution principles as well as their perception of the school climate and level of safety at school.  Parents will also complete surveys to assess their knowledge of conflict resolution initiatives.\r\nProject trainers will evaluate real time peer mediations and provide feedback and support and mediation participants will complete surveys following each mediation. Surveys will measure outcomes, including:\r\n- The number of cases mediated and agreements reached \r\n- Whether students knew about mediation before the mediation and how they found out \r\n- Satisfaction levels with the mediation\r\n- Ability of each party to communicate feelings and understand the other person’s point of view \r\n- Whether program participation has an impact on how parties manage disputes outside the classroom"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "Several community organizations provide peer mediation training and support in LAUSD schools. All schools benefit from having this training integrated into the curriculum. What is unique about INVLA’s proposed approach is that students will develop and produce conflict resolution education technology that will undergird a grassroots movement of peace and change in their schools and communities.  As students produce creative content, educating their peers and parents about alternatives to violence, they will garner excitement and support for their initiatives and build more peaceable schools and communities.\r\nWhile Peer Mediators work together to produce and generate content for podcasts, videos, blogs and apps, they will strengthen their ability to integrate disciplines such as english, science and art, and sharpen their critical thinking skills. We believe that this approach- learning how to use communications technology along with a subject matter that promotes good communication and personal understanding- will provide the interdisciplinary connective tissue that is essential for most if not all productivity, innovation, and creative pursuits in Los Angeles today, and will be even more so, in LA2050."
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    The INVLA has a network of over 100 active, trained volunteer mediators,
    facilitators and educators that provide in-kind support in the form of
    training students, teachers and administrators and monitoring and evaluating
    programs. In order to effectively develop, implement and evaluate this
    project, INVLA will use paid staff and skilled volunteer mediators to train
    students in peer mediation, work with students to develop conflict
    resolution awareness campaigns, support implementation of the campaigns by
    providing access to technology and all necessary resources and provide
    follow up support. INVLA will also partner with principals and
    administrators at selected schools. The role of the principals will be to
    assist with creating buy in for the project among teachers and parents,
    assist with the design and implementation of the peer mediation program (and
    in some cases delegate), including outreach, recruitment, training,
    deployment, evaluation and support of peer mediators. In our experience,
    each school‘s program is customized. Principals and administrators are key
    players, working with INVLA staff and volunteers in all aspects of program
    implementation. School administrators will also help find resources (LAUSD
    or other) to sustain the project subsequent to the end of the grant
    period.    School partners and trained volunteer mediators will provide
    in-kind support in the form of time and use of facilities.
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    $161,00.00 - In-Kind contributions will cover additional costs.  Please see
    the budget below.
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "LA2050 REQUEST\t- 100,000\r\n\r\nIN-KIND CONTRIBUTIONS\r\nTrained volunteer mediators - 20,000\t\t\r\nLAUSD staff - 20,000\t\t\r\nLAUSD facilities - 5,000\r\nVideographer & Website development - 10,000\r\nSnacks for youth - 500\t\r\nGraduate student independent evaluator - 500\t\r\nEquipment (computers, camera, printers, editing software) - 5000\t\r\nTOTAL - 61,000\r\n\t\r\nEXPENDITURES\t\t\t\t\r\nProgram Director- Schools - 16,000 (includes benefits)\t\t\t\r\nProgram Director-Vodcasts and other online elements - 16,000 (includes benefits)\t\t\r\nINVLA:  Program Oversight, Resources, Marketing, Office & Conference space, equipment - 20,000\t\t\t\r\nLead Trainers’ stipend (3 people, part time) - 20,000\t\t\t\r\nVideographer/Trainer - 10,000\t\t\r\nWebsite design, development and maintenance - 4,000\t\r\nSnacks for youth - 700\t\r\nVolunteers’ live scans - 300\t\t\t\r\nVodcast studio rental, related expenses, personnel - $3000\t\t\r\nFiscal Sponsor Fee reqd by Community Partners for all contributions-- 10000\t\t\t\r\nTOTAL - 100,000\r\n\r\nPROJECT TOTAL 161000\t\t"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    National expansion of this project will primarily depend on the project’s
    ability to highlight best practices as well as the benefits of
    implementation and education about peer mediation, social emotional
    learning, and restorative practices as alternatives to violence. INVLA will
    engage various stakeholders, including schools, student groups and trained
    facilitators in dialogues that will highlight best practices and lessons
    learned.  Community dialogues will  highlight the project’s findings and
    identify resulting benefits, which may include increased school funding as a
    result of higher attendance, sustained decrease in time spent on discipline
    and classroom distractions, improved perceptions of school safety , higher
    graduation rates, and significant diminution in the schools-to-prison
    pipeline. Stakeholders will have access to the tools necessary to implement
    relevant components of the project in their schools and communities, but
    more importantly the dialogue sessions will engage communities in the
    development process and create grassroots support. The Peer Mediation
    Network (www.peermediationnetwork.org - website is under construction) will
    provide content and opportunities for further learning and doing.
