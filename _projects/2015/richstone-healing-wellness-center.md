  Richstone provides services to children and families in its surrounding
  Hawthorne community as well as in neighboring high-need communities in Service
  Planning Areas (SPA) 6 and 8. Both of these areas are home to a large number
  of children and adults who have experienced violence and other traumatic
  experiences in the home and in the broader community. Exposure to trauma
  adversely affects two key developmental processes, which are the growth of the
  brain (neurodevelopment) and the psychosocial development that is responsible
  for personality development, capacity for relationships, development of moral
  values and social conduct. Studies have shown that the more types of adverse
  childhood experiences a person has suffered, the higher their risk of a
  multitude of problems, including heart disease, depression, diabetes, obesity,
  being violent or experiencing violence, and suicide. According to the 2012
  Inter-agency Council on Child Abuse and Neglect report, SPA 6 and 8 are among
  those with the highest number of children referred to DCFS for abuse and
  neglect allegations. Attesting to the need for health and wellness activities
  is the fact that SPA 6 has the highest percentage in the County of children
  who eat unhealthy food and are obese and SPA 8 has the highest percentage of
  adults who are overweight. (Source: Los Angeles County Department of Public
  Health, Key Indicators of Health by Service Planning Area, 2012)
   
   Through a variety of thoughtfully coordinated mental health and wellness programs, the Richstone Healing and Wellness Center will address the consequences of abuse and trauma through a broad range of services for families exposed to, or affected by, physical, psychological or sexual abuse, neglect, and violence in the home or community. These comprehensive services include assessments; individual, family and group therapy; home visits; support groups and classes; and a myriad of health and wellness activities. Through these coordinated programs, the Center will help clients achieve their established treatment goals and will transition children and families out of crisis, down the path of healing and towards a goal of long-term stability, health, and productivity.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Funding to support the construction of the Healing and Wellness Center
  facility and sustain staffing is our largest anticipated challenge. To address
  this, we've devised a fundraising strategy that includes unrestricted funds
  raised through a capital campaign, earned revenue, foundation grants, and
  individual and corporate contributions. Funding from current government
  contracts will also be used to help support client services within the healing
  and wellness programs for those who meet contract criteria.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Every client will participate in a collaborative process with their therapist
  to establish appropriate service treatment goals that will be reviewed as a
  means of tracking progress. Overall outcomes and program success will be
  determined by the use of a quarterly summary of client progress toward
  treatment goals, administration of evidence-based practice tools adhering to
  program fidelity, client feedback and satisfaction forms, child abuse reports,
  teacher and parent feedback. Therapists will monitor each participant’s
  progress towards established treatment goals and capture anecdotal data on
  services provided. 
   
   Attendance at events, classes, and program activities will also be tracked.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Although there are agencies providing similar support services, our approach
  is unique in its comprehensive nature. We are treating not just the victims
  but their entire families. We are not providing just healing services but also
  transitional support to help client achieve long-term stability and success.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  While clinical services will be provided by Richstone staff, wellness
  components will be provided by specialists from collaborating organizations
  who are experts in areas including fitness, financial management, and
  nutrition. These community partners include the California Department of
  Public Health’s Nutrition Education and Obesity Prevention Branch, Spectrum
  Athletic Clubs, Growing Great, Kinecta Federal Credit Union, and the Jewish
  Vocational Center. Service providers will be culturally competent and able to
  meet the unique needs of our target population. Fees for services will be
  negotiated on a case-by-case basis dependent upon the scope of services
  provided.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  Total startup costs for the first year are estimated at $1,557,097, which
  includes the construction of the Healing and Wellness facility. We are
  currently pursuing support from several foundations and launching a strategic
  capital campaign to help cover the additional costs associated with the
  project.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  Administrative & Program Staff $895,779
   Building Construction $500,000
   Supplies & Materials $13,500
   Furnishings & Technology $63,000
   Staff Development/Training $14,000
   Operating Costs (insurance, utilities, etc) $70,818
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  When the project is successful and sustainable, we will explore the
  possibility of expanding services and/or replicating the project's programs at
  other venues in neighboring high need communities.

    answer: "Richstone provides services to children and families in its surrounding Hawthorne community as well as in neighboring high-need communities in Service Planning Areas (SPA) 6 and 8. Both of these areas are home to a large number of children and adults who have experienced violence and other traumatic experiences in the home and in the broader community. Exposure to trauma adversely affects two key developmental processes, which are the growth of the brain (neurodevelopment) and the psychosocial development that is responsible for personality development, capacity for relationships, development of moral values and social conduct. Studies have shown that the more types of adverse childhood experiences a person has suffered, the higher their risk of a multitude of problems, including  heart disease, depression, diabetes, obesity, being violent or experiencing violence, and suicide.  According to the 2012 Inter-agency Council on Child Abuse and Neglect report, SPA 6 and 8 are among those with the highest number of children referred to DCFS for abuse and neglect allegations. Attesting to the need for health and wellness activities is the fact that SPA 6 has the highest percentage in the County of children who eat unhealthy food and are obese and SPA 8 has the highest percentage of adults who are overweight. (Source: Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, Key Indicators of Health by Service Planning Area, 2012)\r\n\r\nThrough a variety of thoughtfully coordinated mental health and wellness programs, the Richstone Healing and Wellness Center will address the consequences of abuse and trauma through a broad range of services for families exposed to, or affected by, physical, psychological or sexual abuse, neglect, and violence in the home or community. These comprehensive services include assessments; individual, family and group therapy; home visits; support groups and classes; and a myriad of health and wellness activities. Through these coordinated programs, the Center will help clients achieve their established treatment goals and will transition children and families out of crisis, down the path of healing and towards a goal of long-term stability, health, and productivity."

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      Funding to support the construction of the Healing and Wellness Center
      facility and sustain staffing is our largest anticipated challenge. To
      address this, we've devised a fundraising strategy that includes
      unrestricted funds raised through a capital campaign, earned revenue,
      foundation grants, and individual and corporate contributions. Funding
      from current government contracts will also be used to help support client
      services within the healing and wellness programs for those who meet
      contract criteria.

    answer: "Every client will participate in a collaborative process with their therapist to establish appropriate service treatment goals that will be reviewed as a means of tracking progress. Overall outcomes and program success will be determined by the use of a quarterly summary of client progress toward treatment goals, administration of evidence-based practice tools adhering to program fidelity, client feedback and satisfaction forms, child abuse reports, teacher and parent feedback. Therapists will monitor each participant’s progress towards established treatment goals and capture anecdotal data on services provided. \r\n\r\nAttendance at events, classes, and program activities will also be tracked.

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      Although there are agencies providing similar support services, our
      approach is unique in its comprehensive nature. We are treating not just
      the victims but their entire families. We are not providing just healing
      services but also transitional support to help client achieve long-term
      stability and success.

      While clinical services will be provided by Richstone staff, wellness
      components will be provided by specialists from collaborating
      organizations who are experts in areas including fitness, financial
      management, and nutrition. These community partners include the California
      Department of Public Health’s Nutrition Education and Obesity Prevention
      Branch, Spectrum Athletic Clubs, Growing Great, Kinecta Federal Credit
      Union, and the Jewish Vocational Center. Service providers will be
