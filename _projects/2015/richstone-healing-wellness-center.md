  'DESCRIBE IN GREATER DETAIL HOW YOU WILL MAKE LA THE HEALTHIEST PLACE TO LIVE: ': "Richstone provides services to children and families in its surrounding Hawthorne community as well as in neighboring high-need communities in Service Planning Areas (SPA) 6 and 8. Both of these areas are home to a large number of children and adults who have experienced violence and other traumatic experiences in the home and in the broader community. Exposure to trauma adversely affects two key developmental processes, which are the growth of the brain (neurodevelopment) and the psychosocial development that is responsible for personality development, capacity for relationships, development of moral values and social conduct. Studies have shown that the more types of adverse childhood experiences a person has suffered, the higher their risk of a multitude of problems, including  heart disease, depression, diabetes, obesity, being violent or experiencing violence, and suicide.  According to the 2012 Inter-agency Council on Child Abuse and Neglect report, SPA 6 and 8 are among those with the highest number of children referred to DCFS for abuse and neglect allegations. Attesting to the need for health and wellness activities is the fact that SPA 6 has the highest percentage in the County of children who eat unhealthy food and are obese and SPA 8 has the highest percentage of adults who are overweight.

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    Funding to support the construction of the Healing and Wellness Center
    facility and sustain staffing is our largest anticipated challenge. To
    address this, we've devised a fundraising strategy that includes
    unrestricted funds raised through a capital campaign, earned revenue,
    foundation grants, and individual and corporate contributions. Funding from
    current government contracts will also be used to help support client
    services within the healing and wellness programs for those who meet
    contract criteria.  
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Every client will participate in a collaborative process with their therapist to establish appropriate service treatment goals that will be reviewed as a means of tracking progress. Overall outcomes and program success will be determined by the use of a quarterly summary of client progress toward treatment goals, administration of evidence-based practice tools adhering to program fidelity, client feedback and satisfaction forms, child abuse reports, teacher and parent feedback. Therapists will monitor each participant’s progress towards established treatment goals and capture anecdotal data on services provided. \r\n\r\nAttendance at events, classes, and program activities will also be tracked. "
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    Although there are agencies providing similar support services, our approach
    is unique in its comprehensive nature. We are treating not just the victims
    but their entire families. We are not providing just healing services but
    also transitional support to help client achieve long-term stability and
    success.
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    While clinical services will be provided by Richstone staff, wellness
    components will be provided by specialists from collaborating organizations
    who are experts in areas including fitness, financial management, and
    nutrition. These community partners include the California Department of
    Public Health’s Nutrition Education and Obesity Prevention Branch, Spectrum
    Athletic Clubs, Growing Great, Kinecta Federal Credit Union, and the Jewish
    Vocational Center. Service providers will be culturally competent and able
    to meet the unique needs of our target population. Fees for services will be
    negotiated on a case-by-case basis dependent upon the scope of services
    provided. 
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    Total startup costs for the first year are estimated at $1,557,097, which
    includes the construction of the Healing and Wellness facility.  We are
    currently pursuing support from several foundations and launching a
    strategic capital campaign to help cover the additional costs associated
    with the project.
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Administrative & Program Staff $895,779\r\nBuilding Construction $500,000\r\nSupplies & Materials $13,500\r\nFurnishings & Technology $63,000\r\nStaff Development/Training $14,000\r\nOperating Costs (insurance, utilities, etc) $70,818"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    When the project is successful and sustainable, we will explore the
    possibility of expanding services and/or replicating the project's programs
    at other venues in neighboring high need communities.
