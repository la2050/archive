  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: "We'll rent a commercial space & build infrastructure for The Partnership for Los Angeles’ Creative Education (PLACE), a collaboration between the nonprofits, DSTL Arts, Trade School Los Angeles, & Emerging Arts Leaders/Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nWith all 3 organizations sharing the space, we're committed to collaborating across all our programs to create a pipeline of arts mentorship & educational opportunities for creative, at-risk youth, emerging artists, & seasoned arts professionals, with various entry points for anyone from the ages of 16 to 116.\r\n\r\nThe centralized location will house DSTL Arts' programs, including their Arts Mentorship Program for at-risk youth ages 16–21, a new fiscal sponsorship program for individual artists, Art Block (a zine-making workshop series for youth ages 16–21) & Conchas y Café, an arts-literacy & creative writing workshop series for Spanish-speaking adults & caretakers of youth in DSTL Arts' programs.\r\n\r\nThe space will also host regular, free-to-low-cost educational & professional development workshops for adults ages 18 & over, conducted by Trade School LA volunteers & Emerging Arts Leaders/LA, ranging in subject matter from art appreciation & DIY crafts, to freelance creative business & arts administration. Trade School LA, through barter-based programs, offers pedagogical training to anyone interested in sharing skills through workshops, regardless of age, providing a low-stress environment for knowledge-sharing. Additionally, Emerging Arts Leaders/LA will coordinate its Protégé arts-professional mentorship program out of the space.\r\n\r\nWe'll rent a 1000–1500 square foot space within 6–8 months of funding, & purchase furniture & equipment to convert the space into a gallery & creative workspace for our co-working membership program, including internet, copy, print & phone service.\r\n\r\nWe'll also purchase volunteer management software for The PLACE. DSTL Arts will utilize up to 10 volunteer arts mentors & interns yearly in support of their Arts Mentorship Program, & Art Block & Conchas y Café creative writing programs. Trade School LA will use up to 75 volunteer instructors & interns yearly in support of their educational workshops. Emerging Arts Leaders/LA will use up to 40 volunteers & interns yearly in support of their Leadership Council, “Protégé” emerging arts-professional mentorship program, & professional development workshops. Our shared infrastructure will match skills & interests of all volunteers with the appropriate programs."

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "DSTL Arts, EAL/LA, & TSLA have identified 3 common challenges we currently face in offering our respective programs: 1) volunteer attrition, 2) participant attrition, & 3) decentralized, nomadic program structures.\r\n\r\nThese challenges stem from the lack of a dedicated, physical space where we can each coordinate our programs & conduct deeper community engagement. As such, our forming of The Partnership for Los Angeles' Creative Education is the solution for many challenges we individually face.\r\n\r\nPooling resources & jointly entering into a lease agreement for a commercial space will eliminate several problems we individually face with constantly traveling to conduct our programs. Logistically, we'll become more efficient with time & resources, utilizing a central, consistent space & programming pipeline to meet the needs of all participants & volunteers, including regular volunteer trainings, & collectively dedicating staff for inter-program support & scheduling."
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "We'll evaluate The Partnership for Los Angeles' Creative Education annually based on the following goals:\r\n\r\nDSTL Arts\r\n-recruit & train 5 volunteer arts mentors for cohort of 20 total Arts Mentorship Program students, ages 16–21\r\n-provide 1,500 hours of mentorship to at-risk youth, ages 16–21\r\n-60% of Arts Mentorship Program students will enroll in, or continue, post-HS degree/certificate programs, 30% will continue HS, graduate, or enter HS-equivalency programs\r\n-fiscally sponsor 5 emerging women and/or minority artists\r\n\r\nEAL/LA\r\n-pair 16 emerging arts-professionals (age 22 & over) with 16 seasoned arts admin through Protégé mentorship program\r\n-offer 12 professional development workshops & mixers\r\n-provide 20 professional development scholarships to emerging arts-professionals serving on Leadership Council\r\n\r\nTSLA\r\n-recruit & train 75 volunteer instructors\r\n-offer 120 barter-based educational classes, serving 1,000 participants\r\n\r\nThe PLACE\r\n-host 16 internships for all programs"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "The Partnership for Los Angeles' Creative Education is comprised of the 3, individual nonprofits: DSTL Arts, Emerging Arts Leaders/Los Angeles, & Trade School Los Angeles. As individual organizations, there do exist other programs & organizations that do similar, if not complementary work to ours. However, we know that as a united force, our partnership will drive the creation of new approaches to arts mentorship, creative education, & professional development for emerging & seasoned artists.\r\n\r\nFor example, DSTL Arts takes an approach to arts mentorships similar to Venice Arts or Las Fotos Project. Venice Arts provides mentorships focusing on photography & visual storytelling, where Las Fotos Project does the same for young Latinas, exclusively; but DSTL Arts provides mentorship to at-risk youth, ages 16–21, & teaches them to not only develop their artistic talents in creative writing, visual art & photography, but also adds work-readiness training & entrepreneurial skills to the mentorship program, something that not many other arts-education nonprofits do. Our focus is more on teaching transferable skills that will help youth succeed within the creative economy, & in life as a whole.\r\n\r\nEmerging Arts Leaders/LA is part of a network of organizations throughout the country that provides professional development opportunities for emerging arts professionals. As the exclusive Los Angeles chapter of the Americans for the Arts-backed initiative, EAL/LA shares only a few similarities with even less organizations & professional associations in LA, such as Arts For LA or the Young Nonprofit Professionals Network.\r\n\r\nTrade School LA is the most unique organization of our partnership. TSLA is also part of a larger, international cooperative of Trade School organizations, but in LA, the nearest complementary organization would be the informal association called the Time Bank. With a barter-based system for organizing & engaging in knowledge-sharing workshops, TSLA truly defies typical operating structures for nonprofit organizations.\r\n\r\nAs a collective, we are creating a pipeline of arts mentorship, education & professional development unlike anything ever seen in LA. By providing programming to individuals from the age of 16 & beyond, we truly believe that our Partnership for Los Angeles' Creative Education will excel in bringing diverse, creative individuals together for the betterment & economic empowerment of our creative community."
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "The Partnership for Los Angeles' Creative Education is headed by the nonprofit, DSTL Arts. As the leading force behind this partnership, DSTL Arts has strategically approached fellow nonprofits, Emerging Arts Leaders/Los Angeles & Trade School Los Angeles, in order to create a pipeline for arts mentorship, creative education & professional development for the creative community.\r\n\r\nDSTL Arts, the only nonprofit of the group currently holding a 501c3 certification, will act as fiscal receiver of grants & donations for The Partnership for Los Angeles' Creative Education. Emerging Arts Leaders/LA & Trade School LA will be \"contracted\" by DSTL Arts to provide professional development classes & workshops in the commercial space we will lease together. Additionally, EAL/LA & TSLA will aid in the maintenance of a co-working membership program that we'll offer on a sliding-cost-scale for emerging creatives, as well as with a robust volunteer recruitment & training program for all of our programs.\r\n\r\nGiven the initial cost of leasing & preparing a commercial space for occupancy, DSTL Arts will bear fiscal responsibility for start up costs & future maintenance of the space, thereby leaving a small portion of this grant to be dispersed to Trade School LA & Emerging Arts Leaders/LA for their services. However, other funding is being pursued to cover additional costs related to our programming.\r\n\r\nIn total, DSTL Arts is projected to receive $94,000 for start-up costs related to the leasing of our space, including the purchase of furniture, equipment, insurance & other unexpected costs. Emerging Arts Leader/LA will receive $1,000 for the provision of professional development workshops & mixers in our space. Trade School LA will receive $3,000 for the scheduling of educational workshops in our space & for recruitment & training of volunteers for our programs. All organizations will also receive administrative workspace & access to infrastructure for the execution of all our programs.\r\n\r\nEach organization will designate a board member, advisory board member, or staff member to be part of a steering committee that will provide governance to this partnership, while continuing to receive governance from their respective boards for their individual organizational & programmatic needs. New members to The Partnership for Los Angeles' Creative Education will be vetted through a rigorous application process to ensure the sustainability of the partnership & space."
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "The individual organizations that form The Partnership for Los Angeles’ Creative Education are working toward stabilizing their presence in Los Angeles, but with Emerging Arts Leaders/Los Angeles & Trade School Los Angeles being part of larger networks, there is already opportunity for scaling the success of The PLACE in other communities within Los Angeles County.\r\n\r\nFor example, Trade School LA is already expanding their service footprint by establishing a Trade School Long Beach sub-chapter. Trade School LA is coordinating with volunteer instructors in the Long Beach area now to bring barter-based educational workshops through the established Trade School LA sign-up infrastructure. With the establishing of The PLACE, we are bringing stability for Trade School LA to begin recruiting & on-boarding more volunteers while fundraising for their growing overhead costs.\r\n\r\nEmerging Arts Leaders/Los Angeles is the exclusive chapter of the Emerging Arts Leaders network in Los Angeles, but there already exists an Emerging Arts Leaders/Orange County, which could potentially work with The PLACE as we look to expand our partnership further south. It would not be difficult to connect with Emerging Arts Leaders/OC once The PLACE establishes a working model in central Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nDSTL Arts, after establishing a centralized location with The PLACE, is looking to raise funds for a Mobile Art Lab for their Arts Mentorship Program students who may not have the ability to frequently travel from South LA, or further inland, into Central LA. The idea is to provide a mobile, creative workspace for youth who don’t always have access to tools or space to create at home. With the ultimate goal of expansion, DSTL Arts is very open to establishing chapters in the South Bay area & the San Fernando & San Gabriel Valleys, especially galleries that will display student artwork & provide work-readiness classes in the arts.\r\n\r\nThe leadership of Trade School LA, Emerging Arts Leaders/LA & DSTL Arts are very committed to creating a pipeline of mentorship & education for creatives at all levels of their career. We are focused on establishing a mutually-supportive infrastructure now, that can eventually be expanded into other markets that will benefit from our pipeline structure. As long as we are able to collectively find funding to expand into other markets & establish centralized spaces, while hiring staff to coordinate our respective programs, we will scale the success of our proposal."

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  We'll rent a commercial space & build infrastructure for The Partnership for
  Los Angeles’ Creative Education (PLACE), a collaboration between the
  nonprofits, DSTL Arts, Trade School Los Angeles, & Emerging Arts Leaders/Los
  Angeles.
   
   With all 3 organizations sharing the space, we're committed to collaborating across all our programs to create a pipeline of arts mentorship & educational opportunities for creative, at-risk youth, emerging artists, & seasoned arts professionals, with various entry points for anyone from the ages of 16 to 116.
   
   The centralized location will house DSTL Arts' programs, including their Arts Mentorship Program for at-risk youth ages 16–21, a new fiscal sponsorship program for individual artists, Art Block (a zine-making workshop series for youth ages 16–21) & Conchas y Café, an arts-literacy & creative writing workshop series for Spanish-speaking adults & caretakers of youth in DSTL Arts' programs.
   
   The space will also host regular, free-to-low-cost educational & professional development workshops for adults ages 18 & over, conducted by Trade School LA volunteers & Emerging Arts Leaders/LA, ranging in subject matter from art appreciation & DIY crafts, to freelance creative business & arts administration. Trade School LA, through barter-based programs, offers pedagogical training to anyone interested in sharing skills through workshops, regardless of age, providing a low-stress environment for knowledge-sharing. Additionally, Emerging Arts Leaders/LA will coordinate its Protégé arts-professional mentorship program out of the space.
   
   We'll rent a 1000–1500 square foot space within 6–8 months of funding, & purchase furniture & equipment to convert the space into a gallery & creative workspace for our co-working membership program, including internet, copy, print & phone service.
   
   We'll also purchase volunteer management software for The PLACE. DSTL Arts will utilize up to 10 volunteer arts mentors & interns yearly in support of their Arts Mentorship Program, & Art Block & Conchas y Café creative writing programs. Trade School LA will use up to 75 volunteer instructors & interns yearly in support of their educational workshops. Emerging Arts Leaders/LA will use up to 40 volunteers & interns yearly in support of their Leadership Council, “Protégé” emerging arts-professional mentorship program, & professional development workshops. Our shared infrastructure will match skills & interests of all volunteers with the appropriate programs.

With the ultimate goal of expansion, DSTL Arts is very open to establishing chapters in the South Bay area & the San Fernando & San Gabriel Valleys, especially galleries that will display student artwork & provide work-readiness classes in the arts.
   
   The leadership of Trade School LA, Emerging Arts Leaders/LA & DSTL Arts are very committed to creating a pipeline of mentorship & education for creatives at all levels of their career. We are focused on establishing a mutually-supportive infrastructure now, that can eventually be expanded into other markets that will benefit from our pipeline structure. As long as we are able to collectively find funding to expand into other markets & establish centralized spaces, while hiring staff to coordinate our respective programs, we will scale the success of our proposal.
