  FREE LA High School is a unique education program in South Los Angeles that
  supports system-involved youth in obtaining high school diplomas. Our students
  are primarily youth of color who have been pushed out of traditional schools
  through suspensions, expulsions and/or lock-ups, and are left with few options
  to complete their degree. Social justice organizing is integrated into our
  curriculum in order to equip youth with the skills necessary to work towards
  more just education systems.

  FREE LA High School is a safe haven and alternative education program in South
  Los Angeles that supports system-involved youth, ages 16-24, in obtaining high
  school diplomas. The students we serve are primarily youth of color who are
  often unable to complete their high school education in a traditional school
  because they face systemic and everyday challenges such as increasing violence
  in their communities, unstable living conditions, and scarce resources after
  returning home from lock-up. 
   
   FREE LA’s core academic program includes English, Pre-Algebra and Algebra, and Life and Earth Science. At the heart of the program, however, is training and direct, experiential learning in social justice organizing and movement building. FREE LA’s teachers provide standards-based instruction on systems of oppression and strategies for dismantling racism, sexism, classism, heterosexism/homophobia, adultism, and religious fundamentalism. For example, Economics is taught through units on slavery/human trafficking, globalization, food justice and immigration. In addition, students are often provided opportunities to apply lessons learned in the classroom into real-life situations, including field trips to give testimony to elected officials about experiences in solitary confinement in detention.
   
   FREE LA High School also prepares youth for college. Staff organizes annual field trips to local community colleges, state universities and vocational schools in order to provide students with a vision of post-secondary education. Former students who have transitioned to college or vocational school regularly visit FREE LA classrooms to talk about their experiences and mentor current students. AmeriCorps VISTA volunteers assist students with college applications and submitting financial aid forms. College support begins when youth enroll in FREE LA High School and continues into the youth’s post-secondary career.
   
   We envision a 2050 in which all youth have the same resources, opportunities and experiences in our city’s education system. In the immediate future, we will continue to provide system-involved youth with the support they need to graduate from high school prepared for college and the training necessary to engage in social justice organizing, empowering them to challenge oppressive education and juvenile justice systems.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  YJC members, including FREE LA students, experience extreme levels of trauma –
  homicide, suicide (successful and attempts), assaults, substance abuse and
  police conflict – on a daily basis. In the last four years alone, the YJC has
  buried 51 youth and young adults that were victims of street or police
  violence. 
   
   Like other poor youth and youth of color, our students experience extreme levels of violence, discrimination and disrespect. Because the YJC does not have the resources to adequately support youth and their families through these challenges, we regularly watch youth and families endure extreme suffering with little relief. 
    
   As a response, we have integrated transformative justice into all our programs in an effort to ensure that the YJC does not rely on police and courts to maintain peace. This also allows us to reduce our families and communities reliance on suppression (law enforcement, courts, etc.) to solve conflicts and reduce violence in our homes and streets.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  The Youth Justice Coalition will evaluate the impact of FREE LA High School on
  the youth it serves by tracking quantitative and qualitative metrics.
  Quantitative metrics include enrollment, average daily attendance, classroom
  grades and standardized test scores. Qualitative metrics include levels of
  confidence and motivation to attend school and obtain a high school diploma.
  Metrics will be collected through record keeping as well as student interviews
  and classroom observations. As a result of attending FREE LA High School,
  system-impacted youth will graduate from high school prepared for college,
  engage in direct action organizing and social change work, and have decreased
  interaction with police, incarceration time and arrests.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  While there are many charter schools across Los Angeles County serving
  disadvantaged youth, FREE LA is the only one specifically serving
  system-impacted youth. YJC’s definition of system-impacted youth is a young
  person who has been suspended, expelled or pushed out of traditional school,
  has personal experience with incarceration and/or probation, and/or has a
  family member is involved in the justice system. 
   
   FREE LA High School is unique in that our program develops the leadership skills of its youth through workshops and trainings in transformative justice, social justice organizing within a school culture that is safe, healing, and supportive of system-involved youth. FREE LA students have developed a series of RESPECT Trainings, which are focused on implementing transformative justice policies and practices in schools and school districts. FREE LA students not only facilitate these trainings, but also adapt their curriculum and content based on feedback received. To date, Free LA youth have facilitated trainings to over 3,500 youth and adults on strategies for reducing violence, harm and conflict mediation, and healing from trauma.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  FREE LA High School operates under the supervision of our partner YouthBuild
  Charter School, which was founded to provide quality, continuation education
  to out-of-school youth - including those attending Job Corps and Conservation
  Corps – while meeting all state requirements for completion of state standards
  and passing the statewide (CAHSEE) high school exit exam. 
   
   In undertaking campaign work, YJC and FREE LA High School partners with various local, statewide and national advocacy groups. On the local level, the YJC is a member of Black Lives Matter, local Probation Camp Redesign Work Group, Stop LAPD Spying Coalition, LA Dignity in Schools Campaign, Brothers, Sons Selves and Coalition to End Sheriffs Violence. On the state level, the YJC is an active member of Youth Fair Sentencing Work Group, Californians United for a Responsible Budget, Alliance for Boys and Men of Color, Statewide Work Group to Fix School Discipline and California Alliance for Youth and Community Justice. On the national level, the YJC is a member of All of Us or None, Alliance for Educational Justice and National Juvenile Justice Network. The YJC also coordinates work groups, participates in task forces and serves on numerous advisory boards.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  The total estimated costs of running FREE LA High School for one year are
  $453,981. FREE LA High School will cover the balance through its contract with
  Youth Build Charter School (which covers approximately 60% of total operating
  costs) and additional fundraising from foundations and individuals.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  Personnel - $363,373
   School Lunch - $3,000
   Space - $61,608
   Supplies - 20,000
   Bus Passes - $6,000
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  As FREE LA High School continues to grow and gain more support, we plan to
  create more space within our program for system-involved youth who would
  otherwise have few or no options and resources to complete their high school
  degree. By continuing to increase our enrollment capacity, we hope to see
  district-wide increases in graduation and college matriculation rates as well
  as decreased youth involvement with law enforcement and the juvenile justice
  system.
