  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "CC aims to bring money, volunteers, and attention to local environmental projects by tapping into a large population who haven’t been major donors or activists. We’ll direct these new resources to innovative initiatives, especially those emerging from disadvantaged communities. The sense of hope and accomplishment that users gain will motivate them to persevere in the fight against climate change and environmental injustice.\r\n\r\nWe’ll evaluate our progress toward goals by tracking key metrics.\r\n\r\n1) Monthly # of people who are website visitors/users/donors\r\n2) Annual # of money, volunteer hours and social media impressions\r\n3) Proportion of donations to disadvantaged communities\r\n\r\nWithin a year of the full-platform’s public launch, we want to be bringing in at least 500 donors a month, with an average donation of $50. Within three years, we want to be at scale in L.A., with $2 million in annual donations from at least 15,000 users, and beginning to scale the platform to other cities."
