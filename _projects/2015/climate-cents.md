  'DESCRIBE IN GREATER DETAIL HOW YOU WILL MAKE LA THE HEALTHIEST PLACE TO LIVE: ': "The most measurable pay-off from Climate Cents is increased funding, volunteers and publicity for local environmental initiatives like tree planting, urban gardens, ocean revitalization, community green space creation, sustainable waste recycling, and solar panel installation that will make L.A. a healthier, more pleasant, and more connected place to live. These will contribute to a city in which people don’t face environmental health hazards, where they can breathe clean air, drink clean water, relax and exercise among ample greenery and in the oceans, and eat good local food. \r\n\r\nBut the truth is that no single project can make L.A. the healthiest place to live — it will take a collective effort. So Climate Cents works to improve L.A.’s environment and to counter climate change in ways that complement existing efforts. We amplify support for effective local initiatives and help them to more carefully measure, track, and broadcast their outcomes, supercharging the movement for a more livable city.\r\n\r\nL.A. has long been a divided and inequitable city, especially in terms of health, environment, and livability. What makes Climate Cents unique is its ability to catalyze a city-wide collaboration to tackle the problems we ultimately all share. We will drive funding from more affluent areas toward remedies for some of the city’s worst environmental hotspots. Angelenos will be able to invest in projects in their own neighborhoods and across town. The result will be a renewed sense of civic pride and purpose.\r\n\r\nNo place, especially L.A., will be able to make gains in public health and livability without tackling global warming. Rapid climate change has already begun to harm ecosystems globally. It’s contributing to rising sea levels, intensifying droughts, and melting snowpacks across California. In L.A., rising temperatures lead to negative health effects like heat stress and respiratory diseases.\r\n\r\nIt’s important to tackle this challenge locally. So many efforts to fight climate change are distant from people’s ordinary lives and will start working only over the long-term. Before policy reforms and technological transformation become a reality, we need to make incremental efforts that get regular people engaged. While there are programs that fight climate change, there’s been no effort that groups these efforts, develops a central hub to fund them and track progress in reducing carbon emissions. That’s why we created Climate Cents."

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "Climate Cents’ success depends on breaking through the “chatter” and the innumerable distractions, digital and otherwise, that pull people’s attention in many different places all at once.\r\n\r\nTo do that, we need to make the Climate Cents user experience so compelling that people return to it frequently and tell all their friends about it.\r\n\r\nWe’ve implemented a platform prototype, which is easy to use and visually elegant. We’ve taking user experience feedback into account as we design the next iteration of the website and email / social media notification features. \r\n\r\nFor our marketing strategy, we’ve developed “use cases” for several target demographics. Tactics include earned media through press contacts, digital marketing campaigns, and community organizing, where we’re strong thanks to our leadership’s civic involvement. We’ll experiment to determine which yield the greatest ROI. We'll recruit a volunteer corps to run digital campaigns and help organize in-person outreach."
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "CC aims to bring money, volunteers, and attention to local environmental projects by tapping into a large population who haven’t been major donors or activists. We’ll direct these new resources to innovative initiatives, especially those emerging from disadvantaged communities. The sense of hope and accomplishment that users gain will motivate them to persevere in the fight against climate change and environmental injustice.\r\n\r\nWe’ll evaluate our progress toward goals by tracking key metrics.\r\n\r\n1) Monthly # of people who are website visitors/users/donors\r\n2) Annual # of money, volunteer hours and social media impressions\r\n3) Proportion of donations to disadvantaged communities\r\n\r\nWithin a year of the full-platform’s public launch, we want to be bringing in at least 500 donors a month, with an average donation of $50. Within three years, we want to be at scale in L.A., with $2 million in annual donations from at least 15,000 users, and beginning to scale the platform to other cities."
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "Climate Cents is uniquely positioned at the intersection of online crowdfunding sites and local environmental nonprofits. \r\n\r\nWe have a complementary relationship with nonprofits in Los Angeles that are doing on-the-ground work to improve the environment. We collaborate with them, supercharging their impact through data transparency, public awareness, and crowd-sourced funding and volunteers. Our goal is improve and expand their work, bringing in previously untapped resources, not competing. Our relationship to climate advocacy groups such as NRDC, NextGen Climate, and Climate Resolve is also complementary.  We have friendly relationships with them and the ED of Climate Resolve serves on our Advisory Board.\r\n\r\nAmong crowdfunding platforms, Climate Cents is exceptional in its local-to-local model, its climate-exclusive focus, and the sense of tangible impact and instant gratification provided by the stream of personalized metrics and beautiful media that all donors receive. Our environmental emphasis sets us apart from DonorsChoose.org, which raises money for K-12 schools. Our climate and local-to-local emphasis distinguish us from environmental sites like World Wildlife Fund and the Rainforest Foundation, which are international in scope. Civic crowdfunding platforms like Ioby, which emphasize support for local projects, are probably the most similar to Climate Cents.  But Climate Cents’ tighter focus makes it easier to understand. Its simplicity is a virtue, according to user feedback. And the stream of personalized metrics and beautiful media uniquely provides a jolt of instant gratification through a sense of tangible positive impact. It’s gratifying to do your part to save the world and then see the results immediately, in your own city, to boot. Only Climate Cents makes it possible to see how many tons of carbon dioxide you’re reducing, the number of trees you’ve planted, the kilowatts of electricity you’ve generated from solar panels. This is the kind of tailored, immediate feedback that Angelenos expect now and which fits with the digital experiences they enjoy through on-demand platforms like Uber and Spotify.\r\n\r\nFinally, our leadership is deeply grounded in L.A.’s local communities which is a major advantage, because it’s clear that lesson of philanthropy that people individuals they know and trust, rather than causes in the abstract. We will do in-person, community organizing-style outreach in addition to digital marketing."
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "Climate Cents’ success is inextricably intertwined with the relationships we are forging with trusted local nonprofits like GRID Alternatives, the Bay Foundation, and Isidore Recycling as well as several groups that are bringing trees, gardens and green space to underserved neighborhoods. Our goal is to amplify their work, supercharging their impact with additional funding, volunteers, and publicity. Most of these groups are anchored in local communities, especially those most affected by climate change. GRID trains people from disadvantaged populations in solar panel installations through work on projects that serve low-income communities. Isidore employs formerly incarcerated individuals. Our gardening partnernships empower low-income families to grow their own food in the most sustainable, climate-friendly way possible.\r\n\r\nHowever, our LA 2050 proposal is dedicated exclusively to the process of finishing the build-out of the Climate Cents platform and putting on a powerful public launch and marketing campaign to bring in platform users. Our organizational partners will benefit indirectly from the $100,000 as ordinary Angelenos begin to crowdfund their work in the upcoming year and beyond. \r\n\r\nA LA 2050 grant to Climate Cents will have a major multiplier effect. The $100,000 for finishing and launching the platform will help bring far more resources to worthwhile local causes. In particular, Climate Cents will provide the kind of nimble resources that can catalyze the growth of grassroots projects, fostering ingenuity among impacted communities, and positioning them to secure support from larger funding programs. How? Because Climate Cents is for the average person who wants to save the word, locally, but who doesn’t know where to get started and doesn’t necessarily have much time or money to donate. Climate Cents bring new resources to the cause by tapping into populations who haven’t been hardcore activists or donors: 20-something digital natives; 30-something professionals who want to make a difference, but don’t have time for due diligence; 40-something parents looking for a simple tool to crowdfund projects down the block. These are people who have largely been disengaged from the city’s civic and environmental challenges. \r\n\r\nThe Climate Cents platform will make it easy and exciting for tens of thousands of Angelenos to support local projects that fight climate change and make L.A. a better place, especially for its most disadvantaged communities."
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "Climate Cents is designed to scale up and then become self-sustaining. As a digital platform, the cost of every additional user is small. And as we grow, we plan to take a small cut of crowdfunding revenue to ensure our financial sustainability. Our plan anticipates that we’ll be at scale in L.A., with 25,000 regular users, within four years, and near financial self-sufficiency. We’ll then start preparing for expansion of the local-to-local model to other cities. The marginal costs of expansion will be low – we can use the underlying technology and marketing campaigns we’ve honed in L.A. \r\n\r\nThe proof of our potential is that in less than 6 months and with less than $20,000, we transformed CC from an idea on paper to a website that's already crowdfunding projects. In that time, we vetted partners and researched the science of GHG reduction for each project; mapped outreach strategies; built a platform prototype; initiated a “beta test” with fifty users and gathered extensive feedback to design the platform’s next iteration.\r\n\t\r\nThe next iteration will build on the prototype’s success to create the kind of visually elegant, easy-to-use, and emotionally compelling experience that keeps users returning frequently and telling their friends about it. We’re building in more advanced social media features, crowdfunding deadline notifications, and gamification elements. Social sharing will be baked into the platform. When you sign up, you’ll be prompted to share this fact and the carbon reduction you’re making possible on Facebook and Twitter. Giving to projects will make you look good personally and motivate your friends to take action. This positive feedback feature is crucial to the success of Climate Cents – people will respond once they see the good their efforts are producing, and it will make them feel like they can achieve something real, if we all do our part.\r\n\r\nInitial research suggests that there’s a large population of people who would be interested in a platform like Climate Cents. People care about climate change, but they feel overwhelmed by the enormity of the problem and too busy to figure out the best way to make a difference. If they learn about Climate Cents we’re confident they’ll use it to take action. \r\n\t\r\nAfter the platform’s launch, we’ll execute a multi-pronged outreach strategy that involves community organizing, guerilla marketing, digital marketing, and earned media. We'll evaluate the ROI for each tactic, adjusting as necessary."
