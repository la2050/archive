  In a divided, distracted, disconnected city, Climate Cents brings people
  together by showcasing local environmental initiatives, and making it easy to
  get involved. When you donate your money or time, you’ll instantly receive the
  gratification of knowing the difference you’re making – a stream of
  personalized metrics like CO2 reductions, plus inspiring photos and data
  visualizations. It’s simple to share these on social media, motivate your
  friends to take action and maximize your impact.
