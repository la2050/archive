Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "MDLT will utilize qualitative and quantitative measures to evaluate La Paletera enterprise and the effectiveness of the small business Paletera as it develops in time. Data will be used to duplicate La Paletera business as the project grows. Daily sales by Paleteras will be documented and tracked. Feedback will be solicited via social media and on the spot conversation of buyer preferences and requests. Feedback will also be solicited from Paleteras regarding public comments, and impressions.\r\nPaleteras will serve as positive role model for their families and neighboring friends and serve as links to anyone who is interested in learning about starting a small enterprise. This information will be tracked through pre and post surveys and assessments. \r\n\r\nAn important measure of success will be how this learning experience encourages paleteras to engage with other people in the community, their fellow paleteras, and other businesses within the community.\r\n"
