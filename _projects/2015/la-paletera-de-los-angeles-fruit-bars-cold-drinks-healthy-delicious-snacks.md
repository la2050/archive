project_summary: >-
  La Paletera is up scaling the current “paleta” vendor model by selling healthy
  frozen fruit bars produced with sustainable business practices. The fruit bars
  and other healthy snacks will be sold from a colorfully designed solar powered
  cart. The frozen ice pop stick will be etched with environmental friendly
  messages in various languages. The objective of La Paletera is to become a
  micro-enterprise venture that will create sustainable jobs to the entry level
  workforce for women.

  MDLT is poised to launch La Paletera de Los Angeles in the summer of 2016, a
  social micro-enterprise spinning off the rich food diversity found all over
  neighborhoods in Los Angeles. La Paletera aims to reclaim a Mexican tradition
  of healthy and nutritious food offerings in the form of frozen fruit bars and
  natural fruit flavored waters. The model provides a creative entrepreneurial
  platform for women to develop healthy “paleta” and “aguas frescas” recipes by
  drawing from their culinary repertoires brought from their hometowns in Latin
  America and incorporate knowledge of the best health food trends in Los
  Angeles. The idea is to encourage women to innovate by intersecting the
  traditional with the new and create recipes that contain high nutritional
  values that pack a solid dose of vitamins and minerals in one serving.
   
   Due to the high level of obesity in children in the Los Angeles County (23%) the Angelinos are becoming more focused on healthy living and lifestyles. La Paletera reflects a delicious healthy snack in an affordable alternative. La Paletera is a clear example that healthy and delicious can be available at a reasonable price. 
   
   We are not try to become the next designer but to take back our culture and the traditional way that paletas used to be made. This means no short-cuts using food coloring, sugar and artificial flavors. Only the freshest fruits, vegetables and water.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  We have known since the beginning that vending is not allowed in many places
  and our plan is to work in those jurisdictions where cart vending is legal. We
  have developed contacts and relationships with numerous jurisdictions
  including the City of Culver City and California State Parks where we have the
  opportunity to become a vendor. Both venues will be considered for our launch.
   Another major challenge is the safety and security for the “paleteras”. During our field research, the current “paleta” vendors shared frightening incidents of being “shaken down” by gang members or other intimidating people for their daily earnings. Currently this is a cash business and the money is readily available since many vendors just put the cash in their pockets.
   We will be installing a secured mechanism where cash will be deposited within the cart and plan to use devices such as the square to have the ability to take credit cards. Safety policies and procedures will be of the Paletera training.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  MDLT will utilize qualitative and quantitative measures to evaluate La
  Paletera enterprise and the effectiveness of the small business Paletera as it
  develops in time. Data will be used to duplicate La Paletera business as the
  project grows. Daily sales by Paleteras will be documented and tracked.
  Feedback will be solicited via social media and on the spot conversation of
  buyer preferences and requests. Feedback will also be solicited from Paleteras
  regarding public comments, and impressions.
   Paleteras will serve as positive role model for their families and neighboring friends and serve as links to anyone who is interested in learning about starting a small enterprise. This information will be tracked through pre and post surveys and assessments. 
   
   An important measure of success will be how this learning experience encourages paleteras to engage with other people in the community, their fellow paleteras, and other businesses within the community.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  At the time, there is no healthy option as street vendors. La Paletera is
  comprised of a recruitment and training program; upgraded bicycle propelled
  vending carts (“Paleta-Mobiles”) with support equipment and transportation
  vehicles; a frozen goods making facility to supply La Paletera vendors; and
  micro-lending opportunities for low-income participants. We define success as
  the emergence of “Paleta-Mobiles” with vendors offering high quality fruit
  bars, refreshments, and other healthy offerings at beach boardwalks, selected
  regional parks in the region and other appropriate outdoor entertainment
  spaces. The vending carts and products are intended to be presented for their
  value in promoting healthy food choices, with environmentally responsible food
  handling and packaging practices. Environmental tips will be etched on the
  Popsicle sticks and anti-litter messaging will be included in the
  environmental-friendly packaging.
   
   The vision behind La Paletera fuses major demographic, economic, environmental, and health trends in a manner that reaches beyond the elite appeal of the healthy foods movement. This vision further reinforces community needs and values at all economic levels and ethnic groups through its product selection, ecological ethics and new product mobility.
   Mujeres de La Tierra is a Los Angeles based non-profit environmental organization that has positioned itself as a catalyst in new approaches addressing quality of life beginning with women and their families.
   
   Our field work over the years has clearly indicated that we cannot separate the conversation of healing “La Madre Tierra” with the economic realities of everyday survival they both go hand-in hand.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  We have learned that our work is enhanced and strengthened when we engage and
  involve other non-profits, community organizations, neighborhood groups,
  community stakeholders and leaders. This effort will be no different. We have
  been planning La Paletera for over 2 years and have worked and will continue
  to partner with:
   • Anahuak Youth Sports Association 
   • Los Angeles River Corporation 
   • East Los Angeles Community Corporation 
   • Exposition Center 
   • Supervisor Mark Ridley Thomas’ Office 
   • California State Parks 
   • Local Neighborhood Councils 
   • National Park Service 
   • Mountains and Recreation Conservation Authority 
   • Los Angeles Trade Technical College 
   • County Department of Public Health 
   • Baldwin Hills Conservancy and 
   • City of Culver City 
   • Mexican Consulate
   
   Since the collaboration of the previous mentioned organization are mainly targeted in non-monetary resources, but as a collaboration to facilitate the workspace and development of La Paletera the LA2050 Challenge Grant will designated to the initial investment of the project fund. 
   
   Partnerships with Calo Youth Center to build our Paleta Mobile, a Solar-powered Tricycle and Dreamhaus a young urban artistic non-profit focused on youth in Southern Los Angeles.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  The first phase of La Paletera has an initial budget of $150,000.00. The
  $50,000.00 additional costs will be covered mainly by donation to the
  organization, sponsorship to the project and funds gathered in our annual
  fundraising benefit.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  Resources  Est. Cost
   Rent of Kitchen space  $30,000.00 
   Paleta Mobile Manufacturing $30,000.00

How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  By measuring the efectiveness of the small business using qualitative and
  quantitative measures to evaluate La Paletera enterprise. Data will be used to
  duplicate La Paletera business as the project grows. Daily sales by Paleteras
  will be documented and tracked. Feedback will be solicited via social media
  and on the spot conversation of buyer preferences and requests. Feedback will
  also be solicited from Paleteras regarding public comments, and impressions.
