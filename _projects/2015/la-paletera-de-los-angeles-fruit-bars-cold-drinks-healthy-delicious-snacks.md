  'DESCRIBE IN GREATER DETAIL HOW YOU WILL MAKE LA THE HEALTHIEST PLACE TO LIVE: ': "MDLT is poised to launch La Paletera de Los Angeles in the summer of 2016, a social micro-enterprise spinning off the rich food diversity found all over neighborhoods in Los Angeles. La Paletera aims to reclaim a Mexican tradition of healthy and nutritious food offerings in the form of frozen fruit bars and natural fruit flavored waters. The model provides a creative entrepreneurial platform for women to develop healthy “paleta” and “aguas frescas” recipes by drawing from their culinary repertoires brought from their hometowns in Latin America and incorporate knowledge of the best health food trends in Los Angeles. The idea is to encourage women to innovate by intersecting the traditional with the new and create recipes that contain high nutritional values that pack a solid dose of vitamins and minerals in one serving.\r\n\r\nDue to the high level of obesity in children in the Los Angeles County (23%) the Angelinos are becoming more focused on healthy living and lifestyles. La Paletera reflects a delicious healthy snack in an affordable alternative. La Paletera is a clear example that healthy and delicious can be available at a reasonable price. \r\n\r\nWe are not try to become the next designer but to take back our culture and the traditional way that paletas used to be made. This means no short-cuts using food coloring, sugar and artificial flavors. Only the freshest fruits, vegetables and water. "

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "We have known since the beginning that vending is not allowed in many places and our plan is to work in those jurisdictions where cart vending is legal. We have developed contacts and relationships with numerous jurisdictions including the City of Culver City and California State Parks where we have the opportunity to become a vendor. Both venues will be considered for our launch.\r\nAnother major challenge is the safety and security for the “paleteras”. During our field research, the current “paleta” vendors shared frightening incidents of being “shaken down” by gang members or other intimidating people for their daily earnings. Currently this is a cash business and the money is readily available since many vendors just put the cash in their pockets.\r\nWe will be installing a secured mechanism where cash will be deposited within the cart and plan to use devices such as the square to have the ability to take credit cards. Safety policies and procedures will be of the Paletera training. "
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "MDLT will utilize qualitative and quantitative measures to evaluate La Paletera enterprise and the effectiveness of the small business Paletera as it develops in time. Data will be used to duplicate La Paletera business as the project grows. Daily sales by Paleteras will be documented and tracked. Feedback will be solicited via social media and on the spot conversation of buyer preferences and requests. Feedback will also be solicited from Paleteras regarding public comments, and impressions.\r\nPaleteras will serve as positive role model for their families and neighboring friends and serve as links to anyone who is interested in learning about starting a small enterprise. This information will be tracked through pre and post surveys and assessments. \r\n\r\nAn important measure of success will be how this learning experience encourages paleteras to engage with other people in the community, their fellow paleteras, and other businesses within the community.\r\n"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "At the time, there is no healthy option as street vendors. La Paletera is comprised of a recruitment and training program; upgraded bicycle propelled vending carts (“Paleta-Mobiles”) with support equipment and transportation vehicles; a frozen goods making facility to supply La Paletera vendors; and micro-lending opportunities for low-income participants. We define success as the emergence of “Paleta-Mobiles” with vendors offering high quality fruit bars, refreshments, and other healthy offerings at beach boardwalks, selected regional parks in the region and other appropriate outdoor entertainment spaces. The vending carts and products are intended to be presented for their value in promoting healthy food choices, with environmentally responsible food handling and packaging practices. Environmental tips will be etched on the Popsicle sticks and anti-litter messaging will be included in the environmental-friendly packaging.\r\n\r\nThe vision behind La Paletera fuses major demographic, economic, environmental, and health trends in a manner that reaches beyond the elite appeal of the healthy foods movement. This vision further reinforces community needs and values at all economic levels and ethnic groups through its product selection, ecological ethics and new product mobility.\r\nMujeres de La Tierra is a Los Angeles based non-profit environmental organization that has positioned itself as a catalyst in new approaches addressing quality of life beginning with women and their families.\r\n\r\nOur field work over the years has clearly indicated that we cannot separate the conversation of healing “La Madre Tierra” with the economic realities of everyday survival they both go hand-in hand.\r\n"
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "We have learned that our work is enhanced and strengthened when we engage and involve other non-profits, community organizations, neighborhood groups, community stakeholders and leaders. This effort will be no different.
