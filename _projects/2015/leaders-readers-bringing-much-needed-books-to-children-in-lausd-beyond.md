  M+B’s LEADERS+READERS program is designed to encourage student volunteers in
  the Los Angeles community to organize book drives benefiting another Los
  Angeles based “sister” school. The goal of every Leaders + Readers book drive
  is to flood underserved Los Angeles schools with the books needed to support
  learning and academic excellence AND allow students to gain experience with
  leadership and community service. L+R is leveraging our community’s resources
  to fill the budget gap that LAUSD faces.

  We at Milk + Bookies believe the sustainability of a literate community
  depends on the accessibility of books - and underprivileged boys and girls in
  Los Angeles do not have the books they need to thrive. Yet if children of
  relative means were taught to recycle surplus books in their homes, all
  schools in Los Angeles - and by extension, their students - would have the
  titles so desperately needed to inspire and engage. Enter, Milk + Bookies
  Leaders + Readers.
   
   Leaders + Readers is a service-learning, book drive program that joins two divergent Los Angeles student communities and results in thousands of books placed into classroom libraries at recipient schools – those most in need of grade and literacy-level appropriate reading material – making L.A. the best place to learn.
   
   Each book drive includes four steps, with Leaders + Readers staff working with student volunteers at L.A. area elementary schools to:
   
   STEP 1: Coordinate the book drives that are run by the student volunteers at donor schools. Leaders + Readers inspires creative marketing and teamwork, culminating in weeklong, all-school book drives.
   
   STEP 2: Sort donated books for quality and reading level, then pack them for delivery. As part of this process, student volunteers write and respond to letters from students at recipient school who anxiously await delivery.
   
   STEP 3: Bring books to the recipient schools. This is an extraordinarily meaningful part of the process for all participants, as students from the schools donating books (generally from upper grades) meet with their buddies at the recipient schools (usually first grade students) to share a snack and a story.
   
   STEP 4: Reflect – post-delivery – on the giving experience with students who organized the drives. For recipient schools, thousands of books are distributed to classroom libraries, the school library, and in some cases, at pop-up “Book Fairs” that allow kids in need to take home books of their own.
   
   This “book flood” presents a proven, win-win strategy. It improves literacy by creating sizable in-class libraries and providing low-income students with easily accessible collections. At the same time, student volunteers apply their collective energy and enthusiasm towards helping less fortunate kids expand their thinking, engage their imaginations and succeed. Whether students are giving or receiving, Leaders + Readers changes their lives, all the while dramatically upgrading the quality of education in L.A.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Numbers present our greatest obstacle. The average student/teacher ratio in
  LAUSD is 30:1. In some areas, the ratio is double that. What this means is
  that teachers are often too overtasked to participate in programs, like the
  book drives offered by Leaders + Readers. LAUSD’s dwindling budget makes this
  difficulty even greater, with teachers being asked to provide crucial
  materials for their students out of their own pockets. In response to these
  classroom realities, we have streamlined our program so that teachers have all
  of the assistance they need for their students to participate in the Leaders +
  Readers curriculum. We handle all of the logistics and gather all of the
  necessary materials to help bring our valuable program to students without
  overwhelming teachers or taxing school budgets.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Milk+Bookies recognizes the importance of evaluation in gauging the
  sustainability of our Leaders+Readers program. To that end, we shall continue
  to measure the impact of our work – and the lasting effect that our book
  drives have on student education – by focusing on particular metrics. 
   
   For schools participating in our service-learning programs, forms will be completed by teachers, surveys conducted, and student volunteers interviewed to determine (1) when in the school year book drives have been most successful, (2) the number of books collected (per classroom and in total), and (3) the process by which schools have become involved with Leaders + Readers. 
   
   We will solicit experiential feedback from teachers, students and administrators. Recipient schools will complete questionnaires about the process, and the reactions of children receiving books will be similarly recorded. The information gleaned will be used to encourage other schools to participate going forward.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  In early 2015, Milk + Bookies absorbed the book drive program previously
  operated by BookEnds and formed Leaders + Readers. Our program now represents
  the only one of its kind in Los Angeles, the metropolitan area having the
  highest illiteracy rate in the United States. Upon absorbing BookEnds, Milk +
  Bookies organized Leaders + Readers to improve the financial stability of the
  book drive program and to realize a more significant long-term impact.
   
   What makes the Leaders + Readers program unique is its commitment to inspire a generation of boys and girls to become engaged citizens by connecting economically diverse communities and encouraging these children to take a stand to solve the literacy problem plaguing our schools. The stark reality is that LAUSD has more than 225,000 elementary students under Title 1. It is the objective of Milk + Bookies, through Leaders + Readers, to avail these youngsters – who would otherwise be at an extreme educational disadvantage – of a brighter future. In the process, children on the other end of the spectrum – those of relative means – are instilled with the core value of purpose and introduced to the power of giving and the joy of impacting positive change for the greater good.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Grant awards will not be shared with third-party partners or collaborators.
  While Leaders + Readers is supported by Annie’s Homegrown, which provides
  snack packs for the children at our book deliveries, Annie’s receives no
  financial compensation. To be clear, Leaders + Readers is administered by Milk
  + Bookies, a non-profit 501(c)(3) corporation that consists of a small, vital
  and committed staff of three full-time employees. Supporting this team are a
  group of two-to-three student interns, a five-member Board of Directors, and a
  crew of volunteers provided by EarthAngels.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  The Leaders + Readers program budget for 2015-2016 is $125,000. This amount
  covers ALL of the operational costs associated with running the Leaders +
  Readers programs. To cover the $25,000 shortfall, we plan to leverage our
  relationships with various corporate and philanthropic partners to secure
  small grants. Milk + Bookies also organizes fundraisers, one of which took
  place in early August and garnered $5,000 to support the Leaders + Readers
  program.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
  To place this response in context, understand that Leaders + Readers strives
  to convert every $1 of program expense into $8 worth of books. We sampled the
  value of more than 200 donated books, comparing their value to the current
  listings of used books (those of similar title and quality) for sale on
  Amazon.com. On average, each book collected by Leaders + Readers has a value
  of $8.33. With a goal to raise over 100,000 books during the 2015-2016 school
  year, the Leaders + Readers program seeks to amass over $800,000 worth of
  books on a $125,000 budget. That is a 640% return on investment.
   
   Contemplating an award of $100,000, our budget will be as follows:
   
   Expenses:
    
   Salary and Payroll: $65,000
   
   Rent and Storage:  $16,500
   
   Program Supplies: $10,000
   
   Transportation:  $4,000
   
   Administrative:  $4,500
   
   TOTAL  $100,000
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Milk+Bookies has over ten years of experience in inspiring “future
  philanthropists” and spreading the love of reading. We have seen the success
  of our program expand all over the country, with hosted events occurring in
  over 500 cities and books distributed to more than 540 underprivileged
  children’s groups nationwide. Being a Los Angeles-based organization, we have
  seen up close the extent of L.A.’s literacy problem and are uniquely
  positioned to focus our efforts locally to optimally manage the Leaders +
  Readers program.
   
   In terms of scaling the program, that process is already underway at Milk+Bookies. Book drives are taking place; we are aware of the materials required; we have forged relationships that will carry us forward into future school years; and we have the information and know-how necessary to implement this project in a much larger way. Fact is, in the second half of the 2014-2015 school year, Leaders + Readers raised over 58,000 books and impacted 10,000 students. With the grant money, we will be able to double our already impressive efforts and reach our goal of raising 100,000 books and positively influencing 20,000 students in the coming school year.
   
   Children are entitled to learn to their greatest potential, but this cannot be achieved without reading competency. Such competency is impossible without access to books, which – by definition – are fundamental to the development of reading. However, the stark reality is that students from underserved communities are most affected by a scarcity of books; in Los Angeles, these are predominantly children from low-income, minority backgrounds. Consider the following: in the LAUSD, the average book to student ratio is 2:1 or 3:1; the national average is 22:1. Incredibly, 7,000,000 books are needed just to bring Los Angeles schools up to the national average. Bare and outdated libraries with little to no governmental support critically handicap our students and are leading to lower test scores, lower rates of graduation, and poor literacy overall.
   
   Once Leaders+Readers is appropriately scaled, the LAUSD statistics are expected to reflect the following historical data:
    
   • 95% of teachers report an increase in student reading after receiving donated books;
   
   • Students with access to a variety of reading material have higher than average test scores; and
   
   • Narrowing the “achievement gap” leads to lower truancy rates and increases in confidence and academic achievement.
