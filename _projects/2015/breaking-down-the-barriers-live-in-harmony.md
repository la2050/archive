  We propose to provide workshops in communication, leadership and mediation
  skills to small business owners. Often, small businesses are in need of
  structural and formation support, but have no budget to access these services.
  With the support of this grant, we will make these services available to small
  businesses ($100,000 - $500,000 in annual revenues) with a focus on minority,
  women-owned and vet-owned businesses.
