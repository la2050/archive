  Believing that college access and success is the best path to
  self-sufficiency, United Friends of the Children has created an 11-year
  educational support continuum that helps foster youth graduate from high
  school, aspire to and attain college acceptance, and earn their Bachelors
  degree. 100% of those in our Readiness program 4 years or more graduate HS,
  with more than 50% matriculating directly to 4-yr. schools; 70% of those in
  our College Sponsorship program earn a Bachelors within 5 years.

  UFC has created an 11-year education support continuum that follows foster
  youth from the seventh grade through the completion of a Bachelor’s degree.
  UFC’s College Readiness (CRP) and College Sponsorship (CSP) programs work
  harmoniously to create this pipeline for success. 
   
   The goal of the CRP is to help foster youth graduate from high school ready to succeed at a 4-year college or university. The CRP supports students from 7th through 12th grades. College Counselors meet one-on-one with each student in their homes and maintain frequent contact with students via telephone and email. The content of these meetings is driven by both the student’s needs and the counselor’s recommendations. Counselors serve as the main conduit for delivering a range of program content to CRP students. Acknowledging the crucial role caregivers have in helping maintain stability for students, UFC offers training in communication, conflict resolution, and other subjects designed to help them cope during a challenging developmental stage in the lives of all youth. 
   
   UFC also uses monthly Saturday workshops and college tours, facilitated by CRP College Counselors, to deliver program content, and encourage social interaction and the development of a college-bound culture among participants. Through these various activities, participation in the program helps students to earn their high-school diploma, graduate four-year-college eligible, apply to and attend college. We will serve 500 youth in the CRP in the coming year. 
   
   The College Sponsorship Program is a commitment of personal and financial support for up to 5 years to foster youth attending 4-year institutions. In addition to a $15,000/ five-year scholarship, each youth is paired one-on-one with a College Counselor. Counselors serve as the key source of support, guidance and as a resource throughout a student’s college experience. The program also includes paid internships, enrichment activities and post-graduation planning. By keeping youth involved, engaged, and interested in their education through close, mentoring relationships with UFC counselors, the CSP is increasing college graduation rates for foster youth.
   
   In ever increasing numbers, youth are graduating from high school through the CRP and attending universities through the CSP. In 2015, 25 seniors participating in the CRP joined the latest cohort in the CSP. In total, more than 200 students will participate in the CSP.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  The most significant challenge that we face long-term is one that, in fact,
  attests to the growth and success of our program. Each year, more and more
  youth are completing our College Readiness Program, graduating high school,
  applying and gaining admission to four year colleges and universities. This
  success presents us with a challenge to expand our Sponsorship program for
  college youth even were we to no longer accept applicants to this program who
  had not participated in our middle and high school programs, which we are not,
  frankly, convinced that we should do. Our strategy for overcoming this
  challenge is to increase resources for the sponsorship program, which is
  addressed further in our response to the scaling question below.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Thanks to the generous support of the William & Flora Hewlett Foundation, UFC
  is in the first phase of work that will result in an impact evaluation of our
  programs by an independent party. The overarching aim of this evaluation is to
  assess the effectiveness of UFC’s programs in improving outcomes for both
  current and former foster youth. In addition, we plan to study the impact of
  UFC’s relationship-based approach to serving youth. 
   
   UFC has been utilizing Social Solutions’ Efforts to Outcomes (ETO) database since 2009. As of January 2015, we have implemented redesigned “Touchpoints” – the interfaces that program staff uses to input data – for all UFC programs, and we are currently refining the process of data collection and reporting. UFC Counselors are responsible for entering data on all their interactions with the youth they serve. Review of the data is the role of our Outcomes & Evaluation Director, who we hired in June to oversee the entire process.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  While there are certainly other organizations working to support educational
  achievement by foster youth (whether as a distinct population or as part of a
  broader effort of support for at-risk youth) UFC’s initiatives are unique in
  our exclusive focus on LA County Foster Youth, and most importantly, in our
  approach. All of UFC’s work is based on four basic principles: (1) developing
  trusting relationships with youth, (2) high expectations for youth
  achievement, (3) removing barriers to progress, and (4) consistent long-term
  commitment and support. 
   
   UFC’s education programs are unique in the application of these principles to the educational challenges facing foster youth through the creation of an educational support continuum that can last as long as 11 years. We encourage youth to join our Readiness program in the 7th grade to gain the full benefit of our program, though some to enter as late as the 9th grade. Our experience shows that for youth who persist in the program for four years or more:
   
   • 100% graduate high school
   • 60% graduate four-year-college-eligible; and
   • 50% matriculate directly to four-year institutions
   
   Among the 40 students admitted to our College Sponsorship Program in 2015, were all 25 who completed the CRP and moved on to a four-year institution of higher education. (the remainder are LA County Foster Youth who applied directly to the CSP after completing high school without participating in the CRP). As the number of youth completing the CRP continues to grow (annual cohorts have grown each year since the program’s inception), increasingly those participating in the CSP will be completing an 11-year relationship with UFC. While we are proud of the achievement of our CSP scholars (<60% earning a bachelors degree within five years) we are especially encouraged by the success of those participating in this 11-year continuum. For the class of 2011, 71% are on track to graduate within five years, and for the classes of 2012 and 2013, 100% are on track to do so.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  One of UFC’s greatest strengths is our partnerships and service linkage with
  other organizations. Due to the frequency and intimacy of our contact with
  youth we serve and when applicable, their caregivers, UFC is in a unique
  position to assess the particular gaps in services and/or needs of individual
  foster youth. Through our decades of experience serving youth and working with
  other service providers, both public and private, UFC is able to connect youth
  with trusted, high quality services, including:
   
   • UCLA Connecting Communities – supports participation of CRP youth in CODE to College (3 day/2 night UCLA program for rising 9th graders and alumni)
   • Fostering Horizons – helps our students access funding for private schools and assists with school-related funding needs for our students attending charter and private schools.
   • CASA – provides office space for the CRP Outreach and Recruitment Coordinator for recruitment efforts within Edelman Courthouse
   • Public Counsel – provides staff training and legal guidance for UFC
   • Green Dot (Locke Family of Schools) – recruitment, classroom space for workshops, office space for counselors during school day, access to students during school day
   • Paramount Unified School District (PUSD) – supports recruitment, classroom space for workshops, access to students during school day, provides a laptop to UFC College Counselor working with PUSD students
   • University of Southern California (USC) – classroom and computer lab space for workshops, venue for annual college fair.
   
   Each of our partnership agreements call for self-funding by each participating organization. Because of the significant investment (>$3 million annually) that UFC makes in the proposed programs, all funding received will support UFC.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  The total budget for UFC’s education programs described in the present
  proposal is $3,218,062 for the 2015-16 fiscal year (ending June 30). To date,
  we have approximately $1.25 million in funding committed, with more than $2
  million in additional requests pending or in preparation. Other funding
  required for this core initiative of the organization will be provided through
  unrestricted resources.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
  Funding received will be allocated among some of the most critical elements of
  the budget, including:
   
   Counselor salaries and benefits: $50,000
   Participant transportation for workshops and other events: $20,000
   Tutoring: $20,000
   
   The final $10,000 will be allocated to the essential indirect expenses without which no program would be possible.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  UFC has ambitious long-term growth plans for its education programs, and there
  is certainly no lack of foster youth who would benefit from program expansion.
  We have held preliminary talks with a number of agencies (DCFS, school
  districts) exploring opportunities for program expansion, which could help us
  to scale the programs further should funding become available. To this end, we
  have been in discussion with a number of funders about supporting program
  growth, and launched a new initiatives campaign to secure additional
  individual and corporate support for these programs. Should funding become
  available through these efforts, we are poised to scale up to achieve growth
  (as we have done with our supportive housing program in 2015, which has
  achieved <40% growth in the current year).
   
   Meanwhile, we expect that the external evaluation of our program that is currently underway will help us to validate our relationship-based service model, and identify opportunities to improve our program delivery, so that not only can we scale the program locally, but encourage its replication in communities nationwide.
