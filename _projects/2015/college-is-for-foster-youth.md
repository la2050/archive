  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "UFC has created an 11-year education support continuum that follows foster youth from the seventh grade through the completion of a Bachelor’s degree. UFC’s College Readiness (CRP) and College Sponsorship (CSP) programs work harmoniously to create this pipeline for success.  \r\n\r\nThe goal of the CRP is to help foster youth graduate from high school ready to succeed at a 4-year college or university.  The CRP supports students from 7th through 12th grades.  College Counselors meet one-on-one with each student in their homes and maintain frequent contact with students via telephone and email. The content of these meetings is driven by both the student’s needs and the counselor’s recommendations.  Counselors serve as the main conduit for delivering a range of program content to CRP students. Acknowledging the crucial role caregivers have in helping maintain stability for students, UFC offers training in communication, conflict resolution, and other subjects designed to help them cope during a challenging developmental stage in the lives of all youth. \r\n\r\nUFC also uses monthly Saturday workshops and college tours, facilitated by CRP College Counselors, to deliver program content, and encourage social interaction and the development of a college-bound culture among participants. Through these various activities, participation in the program helps students to earn their high-school diploma, graduate four-year-college eligible, apply to and attend college. We will serve 500 youth in the CRP in the coming year.  \r\n\r\nThe College Sponsorship Program is a commitment of personal and financial support for up to 5 years to foster youth attending 4-year institutions.  In addition to a $15,000/ five-year scholarship, each youth is paired one-on-one with a College Counselor.  Counselors serve as the key source of support, guidance and as a resource throughout a student’s college experience.  The program also includes paid internships, enrichment activities and post-graduation planning.  By keeping youth involved, engaged, and interested in their education through close, mentoring relationships with UFC counselors, the CSP is increasing college graduation rates for foster youth.\r\n\r\nIn ever increasing numbers, youth are graduating from high school through the CRP and attending universities through the CSP.  In 2015, 25 seniors participating in the CRP joined the latest cohort in the CSP.  In total, more than 200 students will participate in the CSP.  \r\n"

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    The most significant challenge that we face long-term is one that, in fact,
    attests to the growth and success of our program.  Each year, more and more
    youth are completing our College Readiness Program, graduating high school,
    applying and gaining admission to four year colleges and universities.  This
    success presents us with a challenge to expand our Sponsorship program for
    college youth even were we to no longer accept applicants to this program
    who had not participated in our middle and high school programs, which we
    are not, frankly, convinced that we should do.  Our strategy for overcoming
    this challenge is to increase resources for the sponsorship program, which
    is addressed further in our response to the scaling question below.
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Thanks to the generous support of the William & Flora Hewlett Foundation, UFC is in the first phase of work that will result in an impact evaluation of our programs by an independent party. The overarching aim of this evaluation is to assess the effectiveness of UFC’s programs in improving outcomes for both current and former foster youth. In addition, we plan to study the impact of UFC’s relationship-based approach to serving youth.  \r\n\r\nUFC has been utilizing Social Solutions’ Efforts to Outcomes (ETO) database since 2009. As of January 2015, we have implemented redesigned “Touchpoints” – the interfaces that program staff uses to input data – for all UFC programs, and we are currently refining the process of data collection and reporting. UFC Counselors are responsible for entering data on all their interactions with the youth they serve.  Review of the data is the role of our Outcomes & Evaluation Director, who we hired in June to oversee the entire process. \r\n"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "While there are certainly other organizations working to support educational achievement by foster youth (whether as a distinct population or as part of a broader effort of support for at-risk youth) UFC’s initiatives are unique in our exclusive focus on LA County Foster Youth, and most importantly, in our approach.  All of UFC’s work is based on four basic principles: (1) developing trusting relationships with youth, (2) high expectations for youth achievement, (3) removing barriers to progress, and (4) consistent long-term commitment and support.  \r\n\r\nUFC’s education programs are unique in the application of these principles to the educational challenges facing foster youth through the creation of an educational support continuum that can last as long as 11 years.  We encourage youth to join our Readiness program in the 7th grade to gain the full benefit of our program, though some to enter as late as the 9th grade.  Our experience shows that for youth who persist in the program for four years or more:\r\n\r\n•\t100% graduate high school\r\n•\t60% graduate four-year-college-eligible; and\r\n•\t50% matriculate directly to four-year institutions\r\n\r\nAmong the 40 students admitted to our College Sponsorship Program in 2015, were all 25 who completed the CRP and moved on to a four-year institution of higher education.  (the remainder are LA County Foster Youth who applied directly to the CSP after completing high school without participating in the CRP).  As the number of youth completing the CRP continues to grow (annual cohorts have grown each year since the program’s inception), increasingly those participating in the CSP will be completing an 11-year relationship with UFC.  While we are proud of the achievement of our CSP scholars (<60% earning a bachelors degree within five years) we are especially encouraged by the success of those participating in this 11-year continuum.  For the class of 2011, 71% are on track to graduate within five years, and for the classes of 2012 and 2013, 100% are on track to do so.  \r\n"
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "One of UFC’s greatest strengths is our partnerships and service linkage with other organizations.  Due to the frequency and intimacy of our contact with youth we serve and when applicable, their caregivers, UFC is in a unique position to assess the particular gaps in services and/or needs of individual foster youth.  Through our decades of experience serving youth and working with other service providers, both public and private, UFC is able to connect youth with trusted, high quality services, including:\r\n\r\n•\tUCLA Connecting Communities – supports participation of CRP youth in CODE to College (3 day/2 night UCLA program for rising 9th graders and alumni)\r\n•\tFostering Horizons – helps our students access funding for private schools and assists with school-related funding needs for our students attending charter and private schools.\r\n•\tCASA – provides office space for the CRP Outreach and Recruitment Coordinator for recruitment efforts within Edelman Courthouse\r\n•\tPublic Counsel – provides staff training and legal guidance for UFC\r\n•\tGreen Dot (Locke Family of Schools) – recruitment, classroom space for workshops, office space for counselors during school day, access to students during school day\r\n•\tParamount Unified School District (PUSD) – supports recruitment, classroom space for workshops, access to students during school day, provides a laptop to UFC College Counselor working with PUSD students\r\n•\tUniversity of Southern California (USC) –  classroom and computer lab space for workshops, venue for annual college fair.\r\n\r\nEach of our partnership agreements call for self-funding by each participating organization.  Because of the significant investment (>$3 million annually) that UFC makes in the proposed programs, all funding received will support UFC.\r\n"
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    The total budget for UFC’s education programs described in the present
    proposal is $3,218,062 for the 2015-16 fiscal year (ending June 30).  To
    date, we have approximately $1.25 million in funding committed, with more
    than $2 million in additional requests pending or in preparation.  Other
    funding required for this core initiative of the organization will be
    provided through unrestricted resources.
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Funding received will be allocated among some of the most critical elements of the budget, including:\r\n\r\nCounselor salaries and benefits: $50,000\r\nParticipant transportation for workshops and other events: $20,000\r\nTutoring: $20,000\r\n\r\nThe final $10,000 will be allocated to the essential indirect expenses without which no program would be possible.\r\n"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "UFC has ambitious long-term growth plans for its education programs, and there is certainly no lack of foster youth who would benefit from program expansion.  We have held preliminary talks with a number of agencies (DCFS, school districts) exploring opportunities for program expansion, which could help us to scale the programs further should funding become available.  To this end, we have been in discussion with a number of funders about supporting program growth, and launched a new initiatives campaign to secure additional individual and corporate support for these programs.  Should funding become available through these efforts, we are poised to scale up to achieve growth (as we have done with our supportive housing program in 2015, which has achieved <40% growth in the current year).\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, we expect that the external evaluation of our program that is currently underway will help us to validate our relationship-based service model, and identify opportunities to improve our program delivery, so that not only can we scale the program locally, but encourage its replication in communities nationwide. \r\n"
