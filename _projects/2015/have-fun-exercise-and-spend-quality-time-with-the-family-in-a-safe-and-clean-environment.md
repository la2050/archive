  We want to create a place that kids can play and learn all in the same
  environment. Parents can feel confident that their children will exercise and
  have fun while still keeping up with school work. Kids in a society that are
  stuck on technology can come and play and run around like kids used to.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  We have been growing our presence within the community for the last 3 years
  and have been implementing programs and fundraisers for supporting causes. We
  understand that schools are in limited supply of funds for staffing and we
  would like to become an alternative for kids to come and do their homework in
  a safe environment with helpers and computers to do research and practice any
  area of subjects with the Khan Academy online. Then once all subjects are
  completed they would be in a safe and supervised play are with jumpers,
  slides, obstacle courses and table games to exercise and have fun while
  de-stressing from a long day of school and studying. 
   We would also like to add enrichment classes for toddlers and infants including Mommy & Me, art, and music programs to increase development while playing and developing motor skills. 
   We would be providing more services for the community to come and feel safe and have fun while playing together For instance, providing free play times every other weekend to promote health and the importance of spending time with your children. The more the children spend with a child the better they develop both mentally and physically.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  One challenge is getting the schools to come on board with the program without
  feeling obligated or feeling we are taking their funding away from them. To
  overcome this would be to create a plan for them to utilize our location for
  their students when there is a need and allow their staff to come in for
  teaching sessions if needed with all the IT resources available here. Another
  obstacle would be to show the community that this program is beneficial to
  their kids. Many people in this community are not used to change and could
  reject the idea. I would talk to the City Council members to implement a city
  wide plan for healthy kids with fun days and events that implement our
  location's services to allow the community to see what the program could do
  for their children as well as for them. The play area allows for adults to
  play with their children and keep them healthy as well.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Evaluations will be based on attendance and community involvement. With the
  city wide events and people signing up for information and programs we will
  see where we can grow and where more funds can be allocated if needed.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There is a family center providing services for children in community for a
  fee depending on income, but there is no place that could combine the fun and
  health aspect together with the learning combined. We can use the reward of
  playtime when they finish their work and assignments. This also allows for
  more time the parents can spend quality time with the children during those
  busy weeks.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': We do not have any partners at this time.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 â€“ how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  With all the resources and construction, the costs will be close to the
  $100,000. If the project goes over we will be reaching out to local
  organizations to help sponsor more events to bring more people in. We want to
  involve the community as much as possible to help create a safe place for all
  kids to come and play and learn.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  Construction costs to create a learning center - $35,000
   Computers and internet - $25,000
   Furniture - $5,000
   Marketing and Campaigns - $10,000
   Non-Profit corporation status and legal fees - $2,500
   New Play equipment for toddler classes - $7,500
   Community sponsored events to build awareness at schools - $10,000
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  If we can increase the awareness of people and expand the reach to surrounding
  cities with class enrollment and visibility we would could see that the
  proposal is working. We want this to be the main center that people can come
  to be safe and get out of the scorching heat or out of the rain and still have
  fun! We don't hold limits on fun, and if we can continue to grow in the
  community and provide free events for all families of all ages to be in a
  community together that is what is the purpose. We want to keep expanding our
  programs and if we grow enough we would open other locations in the LA area to
  incorporate these programs and more. The sky is the limit!
