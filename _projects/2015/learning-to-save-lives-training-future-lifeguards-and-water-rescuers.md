Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: >-
  Our Program recognizes that youth instruction requires more than classroom
  activity or simple repetition of tasks.  Youth instruction requires respect
  for the student and a holistic approach that seeks to create a stronger,
  wiser, more tolerant person.  That vision must extend to the role of the
  individual in his or her community beyond the time in the learning
  environment.  This program provides opportunity to use paddle boards, beaches
  and the fellowship of the lifeguarding community in that learning
  environment.   That’s a home field advantage we can use to build better youth,
  better communities, and a better City.  
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Our work will be evaluated based on the success of the participants. RAP instructors create a curriculum prior to the beginning of the program based on the United States Lifesaving Association, which is the governing body for all open water programs/agencies.\r\n\r\nRAP's program is divided into four age groups:  9-11/12-13/14-15/16-17.  Staff set the same goals for all the different age groups. For instance, during the first year, the goals set for the younger group is to ensure water confidence in the surf and open water environment. By the end of the summer, all junior guards are to be confident in the following: Open water swim in ocean/lakes, Long distance swim and run, Run/swim/run time trials, Basic CPR-First Aid-swim rescues, Competitiveness at meets with other open water agencies.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate design for the junior lifeguards besides life skills and conditioning is to also be a feeder into RAP's Lifeguard program.  Many generations of our lifeguards began as Junior Lifeguards."

  - Money (financial capital)
