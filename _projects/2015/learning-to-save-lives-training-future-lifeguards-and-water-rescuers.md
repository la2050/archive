  Geared for youth ages 9-17, the Open Water Junior Lifeguard Program operates
  during the summer at two open water locations within the City. Taught by
  certified lifeguards, our Program is  competitive and rigorous, providing
  instruction in physical conditioning, competition skills, and the use of
  professional lifesaving equipment.  Our Program is designed to educate and
  impassion youth to appreciate and respect the marine environment and introduce
  youth to a career choice in water safety.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  I would like to create KIPP, a Kids Indoor Play Park for all young children
  (baby, infant, toddler) to participate in and develop social and physical
  motor skills, both individually and with each other. Many outdoor playgrounds
  aren't designed for the younger age groups, but KIPP's will be created just
  for them, a place where parents and caretakers can feel secure in knowing
  their children are in a good environment. The equipment will be similar to an
  indoor children's gym, with soft mats, tumbling shapes, and age-appropriate
  apparatuses that are both colorful and engaging. The equipment can be
  portable, allowing for easy set-up and clean-up at a multi-use facility so as
  not to interfere with current programming. KIPP's will be offered at numerous
  City of LA parks inside the recreation facilities. Participation for the
  children will be either free or low cost so as to encourage and include as
  many children in the community as possible. This type of programming will
  offer networking and social interfacing among the children and between
  parents/caretakers. It will also create a connection between
  parents/caretakers and park staff, which may then lead to ongoing
  participation in other park programs in the future. By developing the
  relationship between the park and community, the City can learn about its
  residents and better serve the public.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  I anticipate encountering the challenge of working through the City's approval
  process for obtaining/purchasing the items needed for KIPP, as well as, any
  approval needed to host such program at the desired parks. The City has
  policies for vendors that make using City funds difficult, at times. If the
  funds are "donated" into the City's general account, then I will have to
  patiently work through the purchasing process. If the funds can be awarded and
  the items paid for directly from the source, then it will be easier and
  quicker to obtain the items needed. I will take the initiative to propose KIPP
  to the park supervisors, and then to the park commission, as needed. I will
  also be willing do research in order to to train park staff on proper usage of
  the equipment to ensure safety and on programming ideas to design a variety of
  activities that will benefit the children and get the most use of KIPP
  (classes, workshops, games, etc).
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  I will choose a pilot park, or parks, to survey to see which one(s) have a
  need for this type of programming. After selecting the parks and implementing
  the program I plan to conduct biweekly/monthly evaluations on the program with
  feedback from park staff, program participants, and non-participants who
  frequent the park. I'll also observe the activity to review firsthand how the
  KIPP is utilized and received by both children and parents/caretakers. I'll
  see what's liked by the children and what other ideas they would like to see
  at the KIPP. I will make note of any safety hazards and make sure they are
  dealt with in a timely manner. I'll also see how participation varies when the
  program is offered at no expense verses a nominal fee.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Yes, there are other organizations that provide this type of activity.
  However, they are private, for-profit entities (like Gymboree) that aren't
  readily accessible to the communities throughout the City of LA. What's unique
  about my proposed approach is my ability to initiate this type of program
  within the City's Department of Recreation and Parks and offer it on a more
  widespread scale for free, or a much lower fee than the other businesses. I am
  currently a Facility Director employed with the City of Los Angeles who
  recently had a baby, so I have both the connection within the City, as well
  as, a direct need and interest in such program on a personal level...which
  will keep me engaged in this endeavor.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  I am currently involved with the Playa Vista Moms Group (PVMG) in which I am
  co-chair of events. This group provides resources and connections to moms
  living in Playa Vista. I am also involved with Women In Leisure Services
  (WILS), a professional organization that connects women working in the
  recreation field to each other for resources, guidance, and networking
  purposes. Both clubs are non-profit organizations that I can utilize to aid in
  the production and promotion of the KIPP. I'm also a member of Alpha Phi
  Fraternity in which I can connect to chapters at various universities in Los
  Angeles to seek out college women studying related majors that may want to
  assist with the research and production of the KIPP. I anticipate that both
  PVMG and WILS will receive about $2,000 each for their part in the project and
  Alpha Phi receiving about $3000 for their contribution to the project. I
  anticipate need the bulk of the grant money to purchase equipment and any
  other start up costs for the project (like staff fees).
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  I think this project will cost the full $100,000. This amount will include the
  planning, implementation, managing, and evaluation of the project. It will
  also include City costs to support such a program as long as it can before it
  can be left up to each park to find funding to self-sustain the program.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  The estimated budget for this project is as follows: 
   
   $2000 = Playa Vista Moms Group
   $2000 = Women In Leisure Services
   $3000 = Alpha Phi Fraternity
   $43,000 = Staff Fees
   $40,000 = Equipment Fees
   $10,000 = Miscellaneous Fees (research, potential partners, cleaning fees, permit fees, unforeseen costs)
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  I plan to review all forms of evaluation and personally involve my friends,
  family and myself with the project. In working with the City of LA's
  Department of Recreation and Parks I hope to gain their support and implement
  the project at as many parks as possible. By adopting my idea, the City of LA
  can then budget for this program in the future. Kids Indoor Play Parks will
  fill the void left by the City of LA when they had to terminate their licensed
  preschool programs. Additionally, KIPP will fulfill the need for programming
  for babies, infants, and toddlers that the City of LA does not currently
  provide.

    Our Program recognizes that youth instruction requires more than classroom
    activity or simple repetition of tasks.  Youth instruction requires respect
    for the student and a holistic approach that seeks to create a stronger,
    wiser, more tolerant person.  That vision must extend to the role of the
    individual in his or her community beyond the time in the learning
    environment.  This program provides opportunity to use paddle boards,
    beaches and the fellowship of the lifeguarding community in that learning
    environment.   That’s a home field advantage we can use to build better
    youth, better communities, and a better City.  
  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "We've encountered challenges due to the distance between Hansen Dam and our other location, Cabrillo Beach.  Hansen Dam offers a large recreation lake that well prepares the youth to become an Open Water Junior Lifeguard.  However, it is not the same as ocean training.  To remedy this challenge, we believe a field trip once a week to the beach would help the Hansen Dam participants adapt to the ocean environment. An additional benefit allows these participants a competitive balance in regional competitions having greater exposure and training in ocean conditions during the program.\r\nAt the end of each Program, the youth are more fit, have increased problem solving and social skills, and a greater sense of self. With this grant, the City could offer program scholarships to those families that would financially not be able to participate in the Open Water Junior Lifeguard program, thereby helping their children succeed not only in the Program and future employment, but also in life.  "
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Our work will be evaluated based on the success of the participants. RAP instructors create a curriculum prior to the beginning of the program based on the United States Lifesaving Association, which is the governing body for all open water programs/agencies.\r\n\r\nRAP's program is divided into four age groups:  9-11/12-13/14-15/16-17.  Staff set the same goals for all the different age groups. For instance, during the first year, the goals set for the younger group is to ensure water confidence in the surf and open water environment. By the end of the summer, all junior guards are to be confident in the following: Open water swim in ocean/lakes, Long distance swim and run, Run/swim/run time trials, Basic CPR-First Aid-swim rescues, Competitiveness at meets with other open water agencies.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate design for the junior lifeguards besides life skills and conditioning is to also be a feeder into RAP's Lifeguard program.  Many generations of our lifeguards began as Junior Lifeguards."
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "There are indeed other organizations with similar programs, largely municipal and county-based Junior Lifeguard programs. The County of Los Angeles sponsors a Junior Lifeguard program, while several coastal communities, including Redondo Beach and Huntington Beach, do the same.  The uniqueness of the City of Los Angeles program is that it endeavors to be inclusive to inland residents, rather than relying on a base of beach-community residents, while still providing exposure to open water (ocean) skills and experiences.  \r\nThe proposal to deliberately incorporate a social component is another uniqueness, resulting from the diversity of the urban experiences that defines our user base.\r\n"

  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    The cost of the overall program is estimated at $99,708.91.  Receiving a
    grant to fund RAP’s Summer 2016 Open Water Junior Lifeguard Program will
    allow for professional Lifeguard training, resources, field trips to
    Catalina Island and other environmental refuges, and fund one year’s United
    States Lifesaving Association (USLA) membership fees for each participant. 
    The budget also includes additional field trips to the beach for the Hansen
    Dam participants allowing more exposure to the ocean waters and its
    environment.  For the first year, scholarships will be available for youth
    drawn from challenging social-economic areas.

  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    The focus would be to scale the impacts of a successful program, rather than
    the size of the program itself, by creating stronger, healthier individuals
    that would in turn infiltrate those newly adopted values into their own
    communities.  Having learned the benefits of physical conditioning, the
    strategy of networking and team problem solving, and perhaps some specific
    employment skills, these program participants then become mentors by example
    to their friends and neighbors.

      Our Program recognizes that youth instruction requires more than classroom
      activity or simple repetition of tasks.  Youth instruction requires
      respect for the student and a holistic approach that seeks to create a
      stronger, wiser, more tolerant person.  That vision must extend to the
      role of the individual in his or her community beyond the time in the
      learning environment.  This program provides opportunity to use paddle
      boards, beaches and the fellowship of the lifeguarding community in that
      learning environment.   That’s a home field advantage we can use to build
      better youth, better communities, and a better City.

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "We've encountered challenges due to the distance between Hansen Dam and our other location, Cabrillo Beach.  Hansen Dam offers a large recreation lake that well prepares the youth to become an Open Water Junior Lifeguard.  However, it is not the same as ocean training.  To remedy this challenge, we believe a field trip once a week to the beach would help the Hansen Dam participants adapt to the ocean environment. An additional benefit allows these participants a competitive balance in regional competitions having greater exposure and training in ocean conditions during the program.\r\nAt the end of each Program, the youth are more fit, have increased problem solving and social skills, and a greater sense of self. With this grant, the City could offer program scholarships to those families that would financially not be able to participate in the Open Water Junior Lifeguard program, thereby helping their children succeed not only in the Program and future employment, but also in life.

  - name: Please explain how you will evaluate your work.
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Our work will be evaluated based on the success of the participants. RAP instructors create a curriculum prior to the beginning of the program based on the United States Lifesaving Association, which is the governing body for all open water programs/agencies.\r\n\r\nRAP's program is divided into four age groups:  9-11/12-13/14-15/16-17.  Staff set the same goals for all the different age groups. For instance, during the first year, the goals set for the younger group is to ensure water confidence in the surf and open water environment. By the end of the summer, all junior guards are to be confident in the following: Open water swim in ocean/lakes, Long distance swim and run, Run/swim/run time trials, Basic CPR-First Aid-swim rescues, Competitiveness at meets with other open water agencies.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate design for the junior lifeguards besides life skills and conditioning is to also be a feeder into RAP's Lifeguard program.  Many generations of our lifeguards began as Junior Lifeguards."

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "There are indeed other organizations with similar programs, largely municipal and county-based Junior Lifeguard programs. The County of Los Angeles sponsors a Junior Lifeguard program, while several coastal communities, including Redondo Beach and Huntington Beach, do the same.  The uniqueness of the City of Los Angeles program is that it endeavors to be inclusive to inland residents, rather than relying on a base of beach-community residents, while still providing exposure to open water (ocean) skills and experiences.  \r\nThe proposal to deliberately incorporate a social component is another uniqueness, resulting from the diversity of the urban experiences that defines our user base.\r\n"

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      The cost of the overall program is estimated at $99,708.91.  Receiving a
      grant to fund RAP’s Summer 2016 Open Water Junior Lifeguard Program will
      allow for professional Lifeguard training, resources, field trips to
      Catalina Island and other environmental refuges, and fund one year’s
      United States Lifesaving Association (USLA) membership fees for each
      participant.  The budget also includes additional field trips to the beach
      for the Hansen Dam participants allowing more exposure to the ocean waters
      and its environment.  For the first year, scholarships will be available
      for youth drawn from challenging social-economic areas.

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      The focus would be to scale the impacts of a successful program, rather
      than the size of the program itself, by creating stronger, healthier
      individuals that would in turn infiltrate those newly adopted values into
      their own communities.  Having learned the benefits of physical
      conditioning, the strategy of networking and team problem solving, and
      perhaps some specific employment skills, these program participants then
      become mentors by example to their friends and neighbors.
