  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "The three strategies highlighted in this project to \"CONNECT” South LA residents to increased mobility through (a) free or reduced-cost transit ridership for co-enrolled high school students ad college students (b) educational technology innovations through the SLATE-Z Virtual Learning Academy, and (c) educational advocacy/civic engagement of parents and residents. \r\n\r\nA frequent barrier to high school students and recent graduates taking advantage of higher education opportunities is related to the cost of transportation.  Although students ride at a discounted rate, this is still perceived as a barrier for some.  Provide low cost of free transit passes or vouchers will increase the ability to connect high school with the college.  In addition, the LATTC SLATE-Z Virtual Learning Academy will be created with these funds, which will CONNECT the region's high school and college and high schools virtually through the development of an online learning community where open and proprietary educational resources will be shared, including adaptive learning solutions for basic skills.  These programs are \"smart systems\" which adapt the online learning to the specific needs of the users.   Communication between and within the 11 LAUSD SLATE -Z high schools will CONNECT these schools, teachers, students and parents and foster a culture of learning that will enhance educational outcomes in South LA.   Parents will be engaged and CONNECTED through virtual and in-person community events around educational policy and SLATE-Z will employ civic engagement strategies that will increase their knowledge of and participation in educational plans and policies.  Engaging the community around issues such as the Common Core and LCAP planning and strategies.  As a result of this connection and the involvement of governmental agencies in SLATE-Z, the government will be more responsive to the needs of South LA.  "

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    The major challenge is the effective coordination of SLATE-Z considering the
    sheer volume of partners across South LA.  We have already started to
    address this by developing a shared vision among partners, identifying key
    goals, and utilizing workgroups over the past 18 months.  We will address
    this challenge further, going forward, by designating a Senior Project
    Manager and Assistant Project Manager to provide efficient and streamlined
    facilitation of SLATE-Z partner activities. LATTC will provide
    executive-level leadership to oversee SLATE-Z as a whole, and will work with
    the partners to develop a governance process.
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Two entities at USC have been engaged in this work and will assist in the development and measurement of outcomes to evaluate SLATE-Z community-based programs and initiatives.  The Program for Environmental and Regional Equity (PERE) at USC conducts research and facilitates discussions on issues of regional inclusion and social movement building and will be engaged in the development of evaluation tools for SLATE Z initiatives.   \r\nHoused at the University of Southern California’s Rossier School of Education, the Center for Urban Education (CUE) is committed to using data, process and bench-marking tools, to help two- and four-year colleges measure equity gaps and outcomes.  CUE has been engaged with SLATE and will continue to assist in developing metrics and analyzing key process and outcome data related to educational outcomes.  "
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    There is no larger collective impact strategy being implemented in Los
    Angeles at this time.  SLATE-Z involves over 60 agencies, all working
    together toward the common goal of revitalization of South LA.  SLATE-Z
    leaders identified three major goals and nine sub-goals, all designed to
    revitalize the community and address the identified needs and illuminate a
    comprehensive strategy that intersects jobs, workforce, transit mobility,
    education and community health & wellness.  The unique nature of LATTC’s
    SLATE-Z is in the sheer number of invested organizations, including
    community organizations; early, primary and secondary education;
    governmental/public agencies and elected leaders; and business and industry
    partners.  The strategy employed by SLATE-Z is one the reflects this goal -
    connection.  The choice to make this is a "transit" empowerment zone was a
    deliberate decision and the SLATE-Z geographical area served is aligned with
    the major transit lines running to, from and through South LA.  CONNECTING
    the strength and capacity of the these diverse organizations capitalizes on
    the existing energy in the community and through these connections, a
    stronger collective impact strategy emerges.
