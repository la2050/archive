  LATTC’s SLATE-Z is a complex strategy that intersects jobs, workforce,
  education, safety, affordable housing, healthy communities, & business
  development to tackle an urban center with one of the nation’s highest rates
  of poverty. Within this broad context, the focus of this proposal is to
  “CONNECT” South LA residents to increased mobility through (a) free or
  reduced-cost transit ridership (b) educational technology innovations and (c)
  educational advocacy/civic engagement.

  The three strategies highlighted in this project to "CONNECT” South LA
  residents to increased mobility through (a) free or reduced-cost transit
  ridership for co-enrolled high school students ad college students (b)
  educational technology innovations through the SLATE-Z Virtual Learning
  Academy, and (c) educational advocacy/civic engagement of parents and
  residents. 
   
   A frequent barrier to high school students and recent graduates taking advantage of higher education opportunities is related to the cost of transportation. Although students ride at a discounted rate, this is still perceived as a barrier for some. Provide low cost of free transit passes or vouchers will increase the ability to connect high school with the college. In addition, the LATTC SLATE-Z Virtual Learning Academy will be created with these funds, which will CONNECT the region's high school and college and high schools virtually through the development of an online learning community where open and proprietary educational resources will be shared, including adaptive learning solutions for basic skills. These programs are "smart systems" which adapt the online learning to the specific needs of the users. Communication between and within the 11 LAUSD SLATE -Z high schools will CONNECT these schools, teachers, students and parents and foster a culture of learning that will enhance educational outcomes in South LA. Parents will be engaged and CONNECTED through virtual and in-person community events around educational policy and SLATE-Z will employ civic engagement strategies that will increase their knowledge of and participation in educational plans and policies. Engaging the community around issues such as the Common Core and LCAP planning and strategies. As a result of this connection and the involvement of governmental agencies in SLATE-Z, the government will be more responsive to the needs of South LA.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  The major challenge is the effective coordination of SLATE-Z considering the
  sheer volume of partners across South LA. We have already started to address
  this by developing a shared vision among partners, identifying key goals, and
  utilizing workgroups over the past 18 months. We will address this challenge
  further, going forward, by designating a Senior Project Manager and Assistant
  Project Manager to provide efficient and streamlined facilitation of SLATE-Z
  partner activities. LATTC will provide executive-level leadership to oversee
  SLATE-Z as a whole, and will work with the partners to develop a governance
  process.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Two entities at USC have been engaged in this work and will assist in the
  development and measurement of outcomes to evaluate SLATE-Z community-based
  programs and initiatives. The Program for Environmental and Regional Equity
  (PERE) at USC conducts research and facilitates discussions on issues of
  regional inclusion and social movement building and will be engaged in the
  development of evaluation tools for SLATE Z initiatives. 
   Housed at the University of Southern California’s Rossier School of Education, the Center for Urban Education (CUE) is committed to using data, process and bench-marking tools, to help two- and four-year colleges measure equity gaps and outcomes. CUE has been engaged with SLATE and will continue to assist in developing metrics and analyzing key process and outcome data related to educational outcomes.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There is no larger collective impact strategy being implemented in Los Angeles
  at this time. SLATE-Z involves over 60 agencies, all working together toward
  the common goal of revitalization of South LA. SLATE-Z leaders identified
  three major goals and nine sub-goals, all designed to revitalize the community
  and address the identified needs and illuminate a comprehensive strategy that
  intersects jobs, workforce, transit mobility, education and community health &
  wellness. The unique nature of LATTC’s SLATE-Z is in the sheer number of
  invested organizations, including community organizations; early, primary and
  secondary education; governmental/public agencies and elected leaders; and
  business and industry partners. The strategy employed by SLATE-Z is one the
  reflects this goal - connection. The choice to make this is a "transit"
  empowerment zone was a deliberate decision and the SLATE-Z geographical area
  served is aligned with the major transit lines running to, from and through
  South LA. CONNECTING the strength and capacity of the these diverse
  organizations capitalizes on the existing energy in the community and through
  these connections, a stronger collective impact strategy emerges.

  implement the aspect of the project each will lead on behalf of SLATE-Z.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  The project described within this application is likely within the proposed
  budget. SLATE-Z actively engages in grant-seeking to fund the infrastructure
  and projects identified by its partners that are aligned with the SLATE-Z
  goals and subgoals.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
  Free/reduced-fee transit passes for SLATE-Z high school students co-enrolled
  in higher education: $40,000
   Educational technology innovations including adaptive learning solutions, online textbooks and other learning technology: $40,000
   Coordination of project: $20,000 (subcontracts) (Senior Project Manager @ LA’s Promise, Assistant Project Manager @ CRCD)
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  As stated above, SLATE-Z is developed as a collective impact strategy that
  will be sustained in the region through the strength of the partner agencies
  and grants. SLATE-Z is seeking the designation of the South LA Region as a HUD
  Promise Zone, which will increase opportunities for funding and parntership.
