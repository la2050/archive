title: 'Colossi: Crowd Gaming'
project_summary: >-
  We will increase attendance to major league sporting events by bringing in our
  technology which allows everyone old and young to come together and play a
  game. By having them actively participate where normally they would just watch
  some static content, we increase the chance they will come back and bring
  others.

    We will increase attendance to major league sporting events by bringing in
    our technology which allows everyone old and young to come together and play
    a game. By having them actively participate where normally they would just
    watch some static content, we increase the chance they will come back and
    bring others.  
  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to play.: "We will create incredible interactive experiences that will bring together crowds, of anywhere from 2 to 20000 people, of all ages, races, and gender. By utilizing the universal power of play, we will engage Los Angeles sports fans in a truly unique way, giving them an experience they will never have had elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWe will then utilize the engagement to increase attendance rates at Major League Sports events by having our games only at sports events and by working with Los Angeles teams specifically to brand them. "
  How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
    - Money (financial capital)
    - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
    - 'Technical infrastructure (computers, etc.)'
    - Network/relationship support
  How do you plan to use these resources to make change?:
    - Implement a pilot or new project
    - Expand a pilot or a program
  Where will you be working?:
    - 'Large Sports Venues, LA County'
  How will your proposal improve the following “Play” metrics?:
    - Attendance at major league sporting events
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    We will evaluate our work through numbers like the number of venues we're
    in, and how many people are playing in those venues. The most important
    metric would be the growth rate of total participation; essentially how many
    more people have played a game this week versus last week.  If that number
    continues to increase at a steady rate, we'll know we are on the right
    track.

  We will create incredible interactive experiences that will bring together
  crowds, of anywhere from 2 to 20000 people, of all ages, races, and gender. By
  utilizing the universal power of play, we will engage Los Angeles sports fans
  in a truly unique way, giving them an experience they will never have had
  elsewhere.
   
   We will then utilize the engagement to increase attendance rates at Major League Sports events by having our games only at sports events and by working with Los Angeles teams specifically to brand them.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  One of the major barriers we anticipate is a technological one. What we do
  relies heavily on the internet and wifi capabilities of whatever venue we're
  at. So what happens when its not great, but 10000 people want to play a game
  together?
   
   There are several ways for us to overcome that obstacle. On one hand, we can (and are) literally count bytes in the information we send across the internet, limiting it only to what's necessary. On the other hand, we can work with venues directly and either work with them to improve their infrastructure, or implement our own local networks that people can connect up to and play.

  people have played a game this week versus last week. If that number continues
  to increase at a steady rate, we'll know we are on the right track.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There are a couple other organizations working in the same general area as us:
  Timeplay and Audience Entertainment. However, they are not entering or
  prepared to enter the major league sports space, and take on crowds of 1000 -
  10000+ like we are. In addition, unlike them, we realize that the individual
  experience is key to making this work and thus strive to make that the best
  possible experience we can.
   
   Other competition includes the things sports venues are already doing to get people engaged. However, pretty much all of them are limited in their interactivity or participation levels and fall flat.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': n/a
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Once we're in one sports venue, we'll continue to spread to the others fairly
  easily due to their competitive nature.
   In time, we would spread to locations outside of LA county and improve the rest of California as well. 
   
   In addition, we will continue our outreach to local schools, partnering with them to do fundraisers and such, both small scale and at the large sports events. 
   Eventually, we would work to make all of LA more and more interactive.
