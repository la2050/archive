title: 'Colossi: Crowd Gaming'
project_summary: >-
  We will increase attendance to major league sporting events by bringing in our
  technology which allows everyone old and young to come together and play a
  game. By having them actively participate where normally they would just watch
  some static content, we increase the chance they will come back and bring
  others.

'In one to three sentences, please describe your proposal.': >-
  We will increase attendance to major league sporting events by bringing in our
  technology which allows everyone old and young to come together and play a
  game. By having them actively participate where normally they would just watch
  some static content, we increase the chance they will come back and bring
  others.  
Where will you be working?:
  - 'Large Sports Venues, LA County'
How do you plan to use these resources to make change?:
  - Implement a pilot or new project
  - Expand a pilot or a program
How will your proposal improve the following “Play” metrics?:
  - Attendance at major league sporting events
Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to play.: "We will create incredible interactive experiences that will bring together crowds, of anywhere from 2 to 20000 people, of all ages, races, and gender. By utilizing the universal power of play, we will engage Los Angeles sports fans in a truly unique way, giving them an experience they will never have had elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWe will then utilize the engagement to increase attendance rates at Major League Sports events by having our games only at sports events and by working with Los Angeles teams specifically to brand them. "
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We will evaluate our work through numbers like the number of venues we're in,
  and how many people are playing in those venues. The most important metric
  would be the growth rate of total participation; essentially how many more
  people have played a game this week versus last week.  If that number
  continues to increase at a steady rate, we'll know we are on the right track. 
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
  - Money (financial capital)
  - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
  - 'Technical infrastructure (computers, etc.)'
  - Network/relationship support
