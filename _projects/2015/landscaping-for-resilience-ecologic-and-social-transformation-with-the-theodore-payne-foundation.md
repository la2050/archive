  Landscaping for Resilience brings people together to change their
  neighborhoods through installing and maintaining public native plant gardens.
  People connect over their shared desire for pubic green space and a richer and
  more rewarding urban environment. LFR provides environmental and social
  benefits, demonstrating how communities, government agencies, and non-profits
  can work together to enhance green space and create skill sets for positive
  environmental change within Los Angeles County.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Landscaping for Resilience (LFR), winner of the LA County Board of
  Supervisor's 2015 Green Leadership Award, is TPF’s proven model for connecting
  LA residents through environmental action. 
   
   In LFR, TPF partners with volunteer groups, neighborhood councils, and others seeking to convert the landscaping of public spaces in their community to native, drought-tolerant plants. The community groups coordinate volunteers, identify a public site to transform, work with their Neighborhood Council to secure support, and assume long-term maintenance of the site. 
   
   TPF designs the site plan and brings together the community for information sessions about the new landscape and its benefits. TPF directs the volunteers in site preparation and leads them in the installation of the new landscape. The impact is immediately evident: sterile, resource-intensive and/or stressed-looking landscapes are transformed by cooperative action into sustainable ones that celebrate the authentic, natural beauty of the region while serving as neighborhood focal points. Subsequent maintenance workshops teach water-saving irrigation practices, mulching, and weed abatement. All that’s required of the community is enthusiasm, shovels, physical labor (exercise!), and a desire to increase one’s knowledge and enhance one’s community. 
   
   LFR will engage 2,000 residents as volunteers to create and maintain eight public gardens. Volunteers will include adults, high school students, and families who set a very public example of what organized volunteers can accomplish. Regular volunteer maintenance days will ensure that neighbors have continuing opportunities for positive interaction and connection through social media. Much of the project coordination will occur through social media connecting residents with a project- and neighborhood-based network.
   
   LFR will connect neighbors across generations by bringing them together to discuss and create public works. During project conceptualization, design, construction, and throughout maintenance, LFR creates a series of authentic opportunities for public gatherings. The new gardens, generated and maintained by public demand, will serve as focal points for adults to interact with their neighbors, forging cross-generational connections as they share skills and experiences. 
   
   If these projects are located near transit stations, the gardens will increase ridership (as envisioned in the First Last Mile Strategic Plan and Metro Green Place plan).
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  To complete eight projects within one year is a challenge, especially given
  the seasonal nature of native plant horticulture. Gardens installed in the
  fall or early winter benefit from natural cycles to get them established.
  During other seasons, gardeners must provide enough irrigation to encourage
  the new root growth naturally triggered by winter rains. Careful timing is
  essential for LFR to succeed. While TPF has already been contacted by two
  neighborhood groups who want take part, we need to let others know about the
  opportunity. Using social media and blogs, we will get the word out quickly so
  we can lay the ground work for fall installation. During spring we will select
  partners. Summer will be for education, planning, site preparation, volunteer
  coordination, and securing government support. Fall will be planting season
  across the County, with eight native plant gardens going in within a period of
  twelve weeks. Concentrated effort will forge concentrated connections.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  TPF will evaluate the success of LFR on the number of volunteers engaged in
  educational and work activities, the number of hours volunteers contribute,
  the level of support from Neighborhood Councils, the number of gardens created
  through LA2050 and planned for the future, the number of (newly created) #LFR
  tweets and Facebook posts, and the amount of traditional media coverage. If
  timing allows and all the sites can be dedicated on the same weekend, we will
  implement a communications plan that crosses media platforms. 
   
   Water saving is another evaluation method. Given that California native plants use one-third the water (and less energy for transporting and treating that water), it makes sense to landscape native. Landscaping matters because urban areas consume ~20% of California’s water, and ~50% of that water is for outdoor use. We will track water use at the native plants gardens.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Community gardening projects are a growing presence in Los Angeles. While the
  bulk of community-based gardening focuses on food production, the drought has
  encouraged people to consider water conservation as a compatible landscaping
  goal. Several organizations promote landscaping with the primary goal of water
  conservation or increasing the number of trees in urban settings. As a
  secondary interest, they incorporate some native plants into their plans.
   
   What is unique about TPF’s project is both TPF’s depth of expertize in native plant horticulture and our goal of disseminating skills for replication. TPF exists to continue the work of Theodore Payne, a pioneering proponent of California native plants and a nurseryman who introduced more than 400 types of natives into cultivation. TPF continues the practice started in 1906 of growing and promoting California native plants for conservation and beauty and for more than 50 years, TPF has been training people how to grow natives in Los Angeles. We have the experience, materials, and skills to create successful public gardens. 
   
   In keeping with the gardening principle that sharing creates more for all, LFR is designed to encourage community volunteerism and public engagement, and impart the sustainable skills needed for partner organizations to continue creating public and private native plant landscapes after the LA2050 project is over. LFR does not position TPF at the center of the project, but as the coach. TPF works with neighborhood groups to achieve their goals and to ensure that the projects will have long-term success but it will be their success. TPF firmly believes that Los Angeles needs more native plants so we need more native plant gardeners. Through LFR, Angelinos will work together to transform the landscape of Los Angeles for our sustainable future.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  While each site is different, past LFR projects can serve as a guide to
  partners. Partnering with Green Space Los Feliz, United States Postal Service,
  Silver Lake Gardening Club, Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Park,
  Silver Lake Neighborhood Council, and Los Angeles Police Department, LFR has
  transformed the landscaping at the Los Feliz Post Office, Silver Lake Meadow,
  and Topanga LAPD Station. At each site volunteers attended presentations about
  native plants, installed the new landscape, and now regularly maintain it.
  Success has bred requests from other groups, such as Mid-town NoHo and Valley
  Glen Neighborhood Councils, for native landscaping in other public spaces, and
  native gardens are now more prevalent in the surrounding communities. Through
  LA2050, TPF will work with neighborhood groups to develop eight public gardens
  in Los Angeles County.
   
   Each community partner organization will receive approximately $5,900 in direct service and materials including irrigation supplies, plants, and labor to clear the site and install the irrigation. TPF will supply an additional $5,800 of educational programming, site plan creation, coordination, and advise on project coordination.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  The total for developing and installing eight new native plant gardens comes
  to $108,100. Community groups will be encouraged to apply to their
  Neighborhood Councils for small grants to cover extra expenses. We anticipate
  that each group will secure $1,000 in support from their Neighborhood Council.
   
   TPF will also contribute in-kind staff support on how to implement the projects, make connections with neighborhood groups, and training in native plant horticulture. TPF will supply plants at the member discount price for this project.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
  Roughly half of the budget will provide dedicated staffing. The other half
  will cover materials and labor.
   
   $46,800 for a full-time LFR manager to recruit, train, and coach the community groups and well as contract for labor and buy irrigation materials (if needed). This person’s benefits are calculated at 25%.
   
   Each site will have the following estimated expenses totaling $5,900 (specific requirements will vary by site):
    $2,500 for irrigation and training materials
    $2,900 for labor for removal of existing plants and irrigation installation covers a crew of four people for six 8-hour days at $15/hour
    $500 for 50 plants at $9 each
    $50 for 90 miles travel to visit sites multiple times
   
   $94,000 in direct costs for eight projects
   $14,100 in indirect costs at 15% (administration, computer, etc.)
   
   $108,100 in total costs
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  One of the real beauties of Landscaping for Resilience is that it can become
  self-replicating. For example, Green Space Los Feliz was one of TPF's partners
  in creating a native plant landscape at the Los Feliz post office. Once that
  group gained skills in horticulture and working together, they went on to work
  with a local fire station to develop and maintain a garden at their site. 
   
   The goals of the program are to raise awareness among Angelinos of the control they have over their environment, what options they have for exerting that control, how to organize for change, and how to develop sustainable and retainable skills
