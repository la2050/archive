  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "Through dance, youth learn skills that can to be applied and will result in successful school, employment, & life experiences.  Dance provides experiences in teamwork, as well as, independent thinking; develops time management skills, as well as, recognition and respect for rules; develops communication, social skills, and offers insight into other cultures; improves pride in quality and overall follow through;  increases self-esteem and confidence; provides a creative outlet for expression; develops creative thinking and problem solving skills; strengthens the ability to listen, learn quickly, and apply skills; improves capability of working under pressure; develops a goal-oriented approach to work; builds discipline, leadership skills, motivation, commitment, and dedication, as well as follow directions successfully.\r\n\r\nThrough the implementation of this program we plan to fulfill three main goals.  Goal 1:  Increase the youth opportunity for fundamental dance training in an economically disadvantaged community within the City of Los Angeles, for individuals already interested and committed to dance on a weekly basis, thus helping a new generation of dancers develop and take their dance to the next level of interest and training. Goal 2:  Educate youth and their families in dance appreciation, dance history, stretching and strengthening, and healthy behaviors and nutrition in an effort to build better dancers and dance audiences. Goal 3:  Train young adults to be instructors at a professional level to ensure the sustainability of this program after the grant period is complete. \r\n\r\nDancers learn more about dance and as a result increase their life skills; families learn more about the dance world, its career and college opportunities, and how to support their young dancers; and young adult dancers learn to teach in a professional environment and develop both a resume and the beginnings of a career.  In all three areas, we are laying the foundation for a career in dance and at the very least teaching transferable skills to enable success no matter the path chosen."

  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "At the start of the program, parents & students will be asked to complete a survey to evaluate expectations, current views of dance and dance training, as well as personal dance identity. Additionally, to create a measurable mechanism to detect a shift in the way parents and students view dance & their involvement after the completion of the nine month program, another survey will be given one week prior to the end of the programs to be collected on or before the last program date.  These surveys will be created by RAP’s Partnership Division and given to the center Director-in-Charge (DIC) to facilitate and coordinate the on-site completion. \r\n\r\nIn an effort to track student/parent commitment, weekly reports will be completed by the centers to collect registration numbers, attendance, & the overall instructor observations of class progress.  Monthly on-site performance evaluations will also be conducted to assess the effectiveness of the program goals, objectives, & outcomes.\r\n"
