  LA Dance Immersion connects the arts, specifically dance, with communities
  through an intensive program that increases youth opportunity for fundamental
  dance training in economically disadvantaged communities, educates youth &
  their families in dance appreciation, dance history, stretching and
  strengthening, & healthy behaviors & nutrition, and trains young adults to be
  instructors at a professional level to ensure sustainability of this program
  after the grant period is complete.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  I would like to create KIPP, a Kids Indoor Play Park for all young children
  (baby, infant, toddler) to participate in and develop social and physical
  motor skills, both individually and with each other. Many outdoor playgrounds
  aren't designed for the younger age groups, but KIPP's will be created just
  for them, a place where parents and caretakers can feel secure in knowing
  their children are in a good environment. The equipment will be similar to an
  indoor children's gym, with soft mats, tumbling shapes, and age-appropriate
  apparatuses that are both colorful and engaging. The equipment can be
  portable, allowing for easy set-up and clean-up at a multi-use facility so as
  not to interfere with current programming. KIPP's will be offered at numerous
  City of LA parks inside the recreation facilities. Participation for the
  children will be either free or low cost so as to encourage and include as
  many children in the community as possible. This type of programming will
  offer networking and social interfacing among the children and between
  parents/caretakers. It will also create a connection between
  parents/caretakers and park staff, which may then lead to ongoing
  participation in other park programs in the future. By developing the
  relationship between the park and community, the City can learn about its
  residents and better serve the public.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  I anticipate encountering the challenge of working through the City's approval
  process for obtaining/purchasing the items needed for KIPP, as well as, any
  approval needed to host such program at the desired parks. The City has
  policies for vendors that make using City funds difficult, at times. If the
  funds are "donated" into the City's general account, then I will have to
  patiently work through the purchasing process. If the funds can be awarded and
  the items paid for directly from the source, then it will be easier and
  quicker to obtain the items needed. I will take the initiative to propose KIPP
  to the park supervisors, and then to the park commission, as needed. I will
  also be willing do research in order to to train park staff on proper usage of
  the equipment to ensure safety and on programming ideas to design a variety of
  activities that will benefit the children and get the most use of KIPP
  (classes, workshops, games, etc).
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  I will choose a pilot park, or parks, to survey to see which one(s) have a
  need for this type of programming. After selecting the parks and implementing
  the program I plan to conduct biweekly/monthly evaluations on the program with
  feedback from park staff, program participants, and non-participants who
  frequent the park. I'll also observe the activity to review firsthand how the
  KIPP is utilized and received by both children and parents/caretakers. I'll
  see what's liked by the children and what other ideas they would like to see
  at the KIPP. I will make note of any safety hazards and make sure they are
  dealt with in a timely manner. I'll also see how participation varies when the
  program is offered at no expense verses a nominal fee.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Yes, there are other organizations that provide this type of activity.
  However, they are private, for-profit entities (like Gymboree) that aren't
  readily accessible to the communities throughout the City of LA. What's unique
  about my proposed approach is my ability to initiate this type of program
  within the City's Department of Recreation and Parks and offer it on a more
  widespread scale for free, or a much lower fee than the other businesses. I am
  currently a Facility Director employed with the City of Los Angeles who
  recently had a baby, so I have both the connection within the City, as well
  as, a direct need and interest in such program on a personal level...which
  will keep me engaged in this endeavor.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  I am currently involved with the Playa Vista Moms Group (PVMG) in which I am
  co-chair of events. This group provides resources and connections to moms
  living in Playa Vista. I am also involved with Women In Leisure Services
  (WILS), a professional organization that connects women working in the
  recreation field to each other for resources, guidance, and networking
  purposes. Both clubs are non-profit organizations that I can utilize to aid in
  the production and promotion of the KIPP. I'm also a member of Alpha Phi
  Fraternity in which I can connect to chapters at various universities in Los
  Angeles to seek out college women studying related majors that may want to
  assist with the research and production of the KIPP. I anticipate that both
  PVMG and WILS will receive about $2,000 each for their part in the project and
  Alpha Phi receiving about $3000 for their contribution to the project. I
  anticipate need the bulk of the grant money to purchase equipment and any
  other start up costs for the project (like staff fees).
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  I think this project will cost the full $100,000. This amount will include the
  planning, implementation, managing, and evaluation of the project. It will
  also include City costs to support such a program as long as it can before it
  can be left up to each park to find funding to self-sustain the program.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  The estimated budget for this project is as follows: 
   
   $2000 = Playa Vista Moms Group
   $2000 = Women In Leisure Services
   $3000 = Alpha Phi Fraternity
   $43,000 = Staff Fees
   $40,000 = Equipment Fees
   $10,000 = Miscellaneous Fees (research, potential partners, cleaning fees, permit fees, unforeseen costs)
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  I plan to review all forms of evaluation and personally involve my friends,
  family and myself with the project. In working with the City of LA's
  Department of Recreation and Parks I hope to gain their support and implement
  the project at as many parks as possible. By adopting my idea, the City of LA
  can then budget for this program in the future. Kids Indoor Play Parks will
  fill the void left by the City of LA when they had to terminate their licensed
  preschool programs. Additionally, KIPP will fulfill the need for programming
  for babies, infants, and toddlers that the City of LA does not currently
  provide.

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "Through dance, youth learn skills that can to be applied and will result in successful school, employment, & life experiences.  Dance provides experiences in teamwork, as well as, independent thinking; develops time management skills, as well as, recognition and respect for rules; develops communication, social skills, and offers insight into other cultures; improves pride in quality and overall follow through;  increases self-esteem and confidence; provides a creative outlet for expression; develops creative thinking and problem solving skills; strengthens the ability to listen, learn quickly, and apply skills; improves capability of working under pressure; develops a goal-oriented approach to work; builds discipline, leadership skills, motivation, commitment, and dedication, as well as follow directions successfully.\r\n\r\nThrough the implementation of this program we plan to fulfill three main goals.  Goal 1:  Increase the youth opportunity for fundamental dance training in an economically disadvantaged community within the City of Los Angeles, for individuals already interested and committed to dance on a weekly basis, thus helping a new generation of dancers develop and take their dance to the next level of interest and training. Goal 2:  Educate youth and their families in dance appreciation, dance history, stretching and strengthening, and healthy behaviors and nutrition in an effort to build better dancers and dance audiences. Goal 3:  Train young adults to be instructors at a professional level to ensure the sustainability of this program after the grant period is complete. \r\n\r\nDancers learn more about dance and as a result increase their life skills; families learn more about the dance world, its career and college opportunities, and how to support their young dancers; and young adult dancers learn to teach in a professional environment and develop both a resume and the beginnings of a career.  In all three areas, we are laying the foundation for a career in dance and at the very least teaching transferable skills to enable success no matter the path chosen."
  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "The biggest challenge of this program is ensuring that pre-professional dance training in economically challenged areas will continue even after grant funding has been fulfilled.  This obstacle is the inspiration for the Instructor-in-Training Program component of this project.\r\n\r\nFor each site, three young adult dancers, ages 17.5 to 23 years, will be accepted and paid for their participation in one hundred eighty-nine hours of training over a nine month period.  They will participate in all master classes and act as assistant teachers in all the dance instruction classes.  In addition, these trainees will attend all dance education Instructor-in-Training Workshops which will in turn be preparation for these individuals to teach/lead the parent workshops and dance education youth classes for the Summer Intensive program.  The goal of this component of the project is to broaden & diversify the dance program by supporting young adult employment while also creating a dance education hub."
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "At the start of the program, parents & students will be asked to complete a survey to evaluate expectations, current views of dance and dance training, as well as personal dance identity. Additionally, to create a measurable mechanism to detect a shift in the way parents and students view dance & their involvement after the completion of the nine month program, another survey will be given one week prior to the end of the programs to be collected on or before the last program date.  These surveys will be created by RAP’s Partnership Division and given to the center Director-in-Charge (DIC) to facilitate and coordinate the on-site completion. \r\n\r\nIn an effort to track student/parent commitment, weekly reports will be completed by the centers to collect registration numbers, attendance, & the overall instructor observations of class progress.  Monthly on-site performance evaluations will also be conducted to assess the effectiveness of the program goals, objectives, & outcomes.\r\n"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "The typical route for early dance training is to enroll at a studio where classes are $10-$15 each and participation is three to five times weekly.  However, for Angelinos in low income and working class communities, this opportunity is not available due to a lack of monetary resources.  Although there are affordable alternatives, such as recreation centers, the instructor expertise and limited variety of dance forms do not allow for the same opportunities and training as a studio situation would.  Additionally there are exceptional nonprofit dance companies that often use community outreach programming to help bridge the gap, but in Los Angeles geographic constraints and the limited number of programs make this a rare opportunity, unlike in a city such as New York or San Francisco.  This L.A. Dance Immersion program would transform the youth dancer dabbling in dance training and give that young dancer opportunity to develop as an individual dancer in a variety of styles.  It will also grow the center’s dance program and the overall dance education and support of families in a community low on cultural resources. \r\n\r\nThis grant could provide a unique opportunity through municipal government to reach, educate, and develop dance in communities only partially engaged in the dance world.  RAP desires to offer exceptional dance opportunities to our communities and currently lacks the funding to allocate towards such a specific goal under the cumbersome burden of supporting failing infrastructure, paying for employee benefits and utilities, and operating on today’s limited budget for such an expansive amount of facilities and programs.\r\n\r\nIt is RAP’s ambition to create an innovative model for dance education within a government context in order to develop a greater appreciation for the Arts in our great City, and better serve Los Angeles.  Once this model is proven, RAP anticipates an effort to develop multiple relationships with both nonprofit and foundations based organizations to replicate this type of programming at other sites in order to increase opportunities of dance training and as a result, for professional dance and dancers in Los Angeles. \r\n"
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "Although the long term goal is to involve nonprofit dance companies to work in collaboration on the execution of this program, due to the economy and the struggle of many dance based nonprofits, we anticipate their involvement will be in dance instructor time rather than in dollars.\r\n\r\nAll of the funds awarded will be used for dance instructor wages, with a small amount allotted to dance studio improvements."
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': "Each site will cost $15,065 to facilitate 40 street dance, contemporary, and/or ballet classes, plus 6 master classes during a six month period followed by a seven week summer intensive program offering 35 dance classes and 35 master classes.  Additionally, that same funding will support an Instructor-in-Training (IIT) Program for three young adults offering one hundred eighty-nine hours of paid training, seven dance education workshops for IIT participants, and seven parent education workshops.\r\n\r\nIf awarded $100,000, the LA Dance Immersion program would be able to facilitate this pilot program for at least six economically challenged communities throughout Los Angeles."
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Six Month Training Component of the Youth Program\r\n40 hours of Street Dance, Contemporary &/or Ballet Instruction @ $50/hour = $2,000.00, plus\r\n6 hours of Master Classes in Street Dance, Contemporary, Ballet, & World Dance @ $125/hour - $750.00\r\n\r\nSummer Intensive Training Component of the Youth Program\r\n35 hours of Street Dance, Contemporary &/or Ballet Instruction @ $50/hour = $1,750.00, plus\r\n35 Master Classes in Street Dance, Contemporary, Ballet, World Dance, and Acro/Lifts @ $125/hour - $4,375.00\r\n\r\nDance Education Component of the Program $6,190.00\r\n\r\n6 sites x $15,065 each = $90,390.00\r\nStudio Improvements = $9,610.00\r\n\r\n"

    answer: "Through dance, youth learn skills that can to be applied and will result in successful school, employment, & life experiences.  Dance provides experiences in teamwork, as well as, independent thinking; develops time management skills, as well as, recognition and respect for rules; develops communication, social skills, and offers insight into other cultures; improves pride in quality and overall follow through;  increases self-esteem and confidence; provides a creative outlet for expression; develops creative thinking and problem solving skills; strengthens the ability to listen, learn quickly, and apply skills; improves capability of working under pressure; develops a goal-oriented approach to work; builds discipline, leadership skills, motivation, commitment, and dedication, as well as follow directions successfully.\r\n\r\nThrough the implementation of this program we plan to fulfill three main goals.  Goal 1:  Increase the youth opportunity for fundamental dance training in an economically disadvantaged community within the City of Los Angeles, for individuals already interested and committed to dance on a weekly basis, thus helping a new generation of dancers develop and take their dance to the next level of interest and training. Goal 2:  Educate youth and their families in dance appreciation, dance history, stretching and strengthening, and healthy behaviors and nutrition in an effort to build better dancers and dance audiences. Goal 3:  Train young adults to be instructors at a professional level to ensure the sustainability of this program after the grant period is complete. \r\n\r\nDancers learn more about dance and as a result increase their life skills; families learn more about the dance world, its career and college opportunities, and how to support their young dancers; and young adult dancers learn to teach in a professional environment and develop both a resume and the beginnings of a career.  In all three areas, we are laying the foundation for a career in dance and at the very least teaching transferable skills to enable success no matter the path chosen."

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "The biggest challenge of this program is ensuring that pre-professional dance training in economically challenged areas will continue even after grant funding has been fulfilled.  This obstacle is the inspiration for the Instructor-in-Training Program component of this project.\r\n\r\nFor each site, three young adult dancers, ages 17.5 to 23 years, will be accepted and paid for their participation in one hundred eighty-nine hours of training over a nine month period.  They will participate in all master classes and act as assistant teachers in all the dance instruction classes.  In addition, these trainees will attend all dance education Instructor-in-Training Workshops which will in turn be preparation for these individuals to teach/lead the parent workshops and dance education youth classes for the Summer Intensive program.  The goal of this component of the project is to broaden & diversify the dance program by supporting young adult employment while also creating a dance education hub."
  - name: Please explain how you will evaluate your work.
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "At the start of the program, parents & students will be asked to complete a survey to evaluate expectations, current views of dance and dance training, as well as personal dance identity. Additionally, to create a measurable mechanism to detect a shift in the way parents and students view dance & their involvement after the completion of the nine month program, another survey will be given one week prior to the end of the programs to be collected on or before the last program date.  These surveys will be created by RAP’s Partnership Division and given to the center Director-in-Charge (DIC) to facilitate and coordinate the on-site completion. \r\n\r\nIn an effort to track student/parent commitment, weekly reports will be completed by the centers to collect registration numbers, attendance, & the overall instructor observations of class progress.  Monthly on-site performance evaluations will also be conducted to assess the effectiveness of the program goals, objectives, & outcomes.\r\n"

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "The typical route for early dance training is to enroll at a studio where classes are $10-$15 each and participation is three to five times weekly.  However, for Angelinos in low income and working class communities, this opportunity is not available due to a lack of monetary resources.  Although there are affordable alternatives, such as recreation centers, the instructor expertise and limited variety of dance forms do not allow for the same opportunities and training as a studio situation would.  Additionally there are exceptional nonprofit dance companies that often use community outreach programming to help bridge the gap, but in Los Angeles geographic constraints and the limited number of programs make this a rare opportunity, unlike in a city such as New York or San Francisco.  This L.A. Dance Immersion program would transform the youth dancer dabbling in dance training and give that young dancer opportunity to develop as an individual dancer in a variety of styles.  It will also grow the center’s dance program and the overall dance education and support of families in a community low on cultural resources. \r\n\r\nThis grant could provide a unique opportunity through municipal government to reach, educate, and develop dance in communities only partially engaged in the dance world.  RAP desires to offer exceptional dance opportunities to our communities and currently lacks the funding to allocate towards such a specific goal under the cumbersome burden of supporting failing infrastructure, paying for employee benefits and utilities, and operating on today’s limited budget for such an expansive amount of facilities and programs.\r\n\r\nIt is RAP’s ambition to create an innovative model for dance education within a government context in order to develop a greater appreciation for the Arts in our great City, and better serve Los Angeles.  Once this model is proven, RAP anticipates an effort to develop multiple relationships with both nonprofit and foundations based organizations to replicate this type of programming at other sites in order to increase opportunities of dance training and as a result, for professional dance and dancers in Los Angeles. \r\n"

      Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on
      this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner
      receive?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Although the long term goal is to involve nonprofit dance companies to work in collaboration on the execution of this program, due to the economy and the struggle of many dance based nonprofits, we anticipate their involvement will be in dance instructor time rather than in dollars.\r\n\r\nAll of the funds awarded will be used for dance instructor wages, with a small amount allotted to dance studio improvements."

      How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you
      cover the additional costs?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Each site will cost $15,065 to facilitate 40 street dance, contemporary, and/or ballet classes, plus 6 master classes during a six month period followed by a seven week summer intensive program offering 35 dance classes and 35 master classes.  Additionally, that same funding will support an Instructor-in-Training (IIT) Program for three young adults offering one hundred eighty-nine hours of paid training, seven dance education workshops for IIT participants, and seven parent education workshops.\r\n\r\nIf awarded $100,000, the LA Dance Immersion program would be able to facilitate this pilot program for at least six economically challenged communities throughout Los Angeles."
