  According the world, we are in a drought, a drought that still manages for 23
  gallons of water to dampen the soul of one almond tree. We, the Angelinos
  could create side walk gardens and fruit hanging over passes the whole city
  wide. All it would take is the gradual replacement of sidewalk lawns and the
  slow loving replacement of lets say half of the trees that do not bare fruit
  or other commonly used raw materials; in essence lets create a city where
  everything is being put to its highest call.
