  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "Celebrating seven years in LA, Reading Partners looks forward to continuing to empower local communities to invest in the education of our youth by extending our proven early literacy intervention program to substantially more students throughout the county. We envision that all children will have the necessary literacy skills they need by fourth grade to achieve their fullest potential by leveraging the capacity of communities to close the achievement gap for struggling readers. To move toward this goal, we have two primary objectives:\r\n\r\n1. We will serve a much larger proportion of children in our current service areas. This school year, we have already increased participant density by expanding from eight to ten schools and serving 575 youth—a 25% increase in school partnerships from 2014-15.\r\n\r\n2. We will begin a strategic, major expansion of services set over the next two years. This will include identifying a new community where we will serve an additional four to six schools and 250-360 students, doubling our reach from 500 to 1,000 children by 2017.\r\n\r\nTo ensure LA is the best place to learn, Reading Partners will continue to mobilize local schools, districts, and communities to catalyze change and become advocates for educational opportunities in their neighborhoods. We intentionally partner with Title I schools with a high percentage of low-income students where tailored intervention resources are in short supply despite students’ high needs. With a structured, research-based curriculum that requires no prior experience, we transform any volunteer into a high-quality instructor, enabling us to reach hundreds more children and increase the capacity of public schools. Our efforts also focus on young K-4 students early in their school careers to maximize the amount of instruction they receive before their achievement gap widens, ensuring that as many students possible are reaching proficiency by fourth grade.\r\n\r\nWith 49% of low-income fourth graders reading below grade-level in LA County, thousands of children are at-risk of losing out on a more prosperous future that a strong education enables, and strong reading skills are especially important for children growing up in low-income communities where academic success is a critical pathway out of poverty. We are proud of our innovative and proven program model that harnesses the power of community service to provide an effective, affordable, and community-driven solution to the literacy crisis."

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    Since our program heavily relies on volunteers to provide one-on-one
    services, we anticipate that volunteer recruitment will be our biggest
    challenge as we can only enroll as many students as we have volunteers. Due
    to the sheer magnitude and geographical scope of our expansion, building a
    sustainable and reliable volunteer base is a top priority. To offset
    individual volunteer retention rates, last year, we implemented a new focus
    on building community partnerships with businesses, community organizations,
    and educational institutions that can be renewed every year. By emphasizing
    organization-level relationships as a dominant source of volunteers, we are
    confident that we can secure the volunteer base necessary to support our
    growth. Due in large part to these efforts, from 2013-14 to 2014-15, we
    increased volunteer recruitment by 34%. We hope to continue on this
    trajectory moving forward as we project needing roughly 1,300 volunteers to
    sustain an enrollment goal of 1,000 students.
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    Data collection and analysis is a core feature of Reading Partners’ program.
    To thoroughly evaluate students’ skills, we gather three sources of data.
    First, we collect results from research-based, elementary literacy
    assessment tools–STAR Early Literacy and STAR Early Reading. Both
    assessments provide growth targets for students that correspond to
    grade-level benchmarks. Our programmatic targets are also based on students’
    reaching benchmarks tied to grade-level expectations. Second, we collect
    state standardized test scores and school-based evaluations to give us a
    more comprehensive picture of how students are doing relative to state
    English Language Arts standards. Finally, we gather impact data on
    improvements in students’ reading, self-confidence, and classroom
    participation through twice-annual teacher, principal, and tutor surveys.
    Together, these assessments enable us to benchmark students’ reading at
    enrollment, progress monitor and course-correct, and record overall growth.
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "Reading Partners is the only nationally scaled program in the country with the complete package of in-school, one-on-one literacy instruction by volunteers who are trained and supported by staff. At each school, we transform a dedicated classroom into a comprehensive Reading Center and recruit and train 40-100 volunteers. Student-tutor pairs work together for 45 minutes twice a week, following an individualized reading plan tailored to each student’s particular needs. To execute this plan, tutors use Reading Partners’ curriculum; a series of research-based, structured lesson plans that progress from phonics instruction for earlier readers to comprehension strategy for more advanced students. Students are assessed four times per year to monitor their progress toward pre-established achievement goals and to help advise tutors on how to best support their students. With close oversight and assistance from senior staff, a trained AmeriCorps member is stationed at each site to provide coaching to volunteers and serve as a liaison to teachers and school staff. A Program Manager supervises a portfolio of reading centers and ensures consistent results and program fidelity. \r\n\r\nCompared to other organizations that focus on individual or group read-a-louds, Reading Partners concentrates on tangible skill development and improves students' mastery of both the concrete and abstract skills necessary to be a confident, independent reader. Reading Partners’ students aren’t just exposed to literacy; they practice it. Accordingly, our program generates real changes in student achievement that are measurable and tracked over time in partnership with our schools.\r\n\r\nIn March 2015, Reading Partners received the results of a multiyear, rigorous study conducted by MDRC, the nation’s leading education research firm. The study confirmed that our program model utilizing community volunteers is effective and produces a positive and statistically significant impact on students’ reading proficiency. In addition, program fidelity also remained consistent among sites across multiple regions, confirming that our program is also effective at scale. Lastly, because Reading Partners is able to provide one-on-one services to students, we are a resource multiplier for public schools. For every dollar invested, we are able to double the resources available to students by leveraging community resources, indicating that Reading Partners is a cost-effective option for under-resourced schools."
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "Reading Partners serves ten Title I elementary schools in Los Angeles County located in Pasadena, Mid-City Los Angeles, Santa Monica, and Lawndale. We currently have strong relationships with both Lawndale and Pasadena School Districts, including a five-year partnership with the Pasadena Unified, where we have agreed to triple our impact in the district by increasing the number of students served from 163 in 2013-14 to over 500 students and from three to ten schools by 2018-19. In addition, we have ongoing partnerships with community-based organizations and businesses that generously provide volunteers to support our programming, including Cal State LA, City National Bank, LA RSVP, LA Works, and Manhattan Beach Community Church to name a few.\r\n\r\nAs we begin outreach to prospective school, district, and community partners, we look to find another neighborhood to replicate the tremendous successes we’ve had in Pasadena. In addition to a strong partnership with the school district, Reading Partners has wonderful relationships with community organizations throughout the city such as the Pasadena Community Foundation, Pasadena Educational Foundation, and Pasadena City College that is able to provide the trifecta of financial, programmatic, and volunteer support to simultaneously sustain our current program and allow for growth.\r\n\r\nThough Reading Partners will provide our full scope of services at all of our school partners, the $100,000 grant would be used as seed money for capacity building and programmatic operations at each new school site. To help support a new site, Reading Partners requires partner schools and districts to invest in our program through fee for service. Fee for service revenue accounts for 13% of our total regional program budget and guarantees a diverse portfolio of private and public investors. Fee for service not only allows Reading Partners to better leverage philanthropic dollars to serve more schools, but also ensures school partners are invested in the success of our program."
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': "In a spring 2015 planning session, it was identified that capacity building was necessary in three key areas: community engagement, program development, and board development and revenue generation. Because the magnitude of this expansion requires considerable financial and human capital, we have increased the number of personnel and resources dedicated to volunteer recruitment, school district partnerships, and fundraising, which are all existing costs in our current 2015-16 budget.\r\n\r\nTo effectively double the number of students Reading Partners serves in Los Angeles moving forward, we anticipate needing an additional $300,000. A substantial part of this cost includes additional program staff to manage the portfolio of new sites, AmeriCorps Site Coordinators to staff each Reading Center, and an additional AmeriCorps Volunteer Coordinator to support volunteer recruitment and retention. Other direct costs associated with open a new Reading Center includes classroom supplies such as paper, pens, markers, and teaching supplies at roughly $250 per center; four complete sets of Reading Partners’ 148-level curriculum and 400-500 grade-level appropriate books per center at roughly $5,500 per school; as well as laptops for each of our new staff members at approximately $1,000 each. Lastly, with a significant influx of in volunteers to serve 1,000 students, the we anticipate the associated costs of our community engagement program to also increase, including additional reimbursements for tutor background checks, additional fees for conference and volunteer fair attendance, as well as more robust tutor appreciation events and additional marketing materials.\r\n\r\nTo cover these costs, Reading Partners will receive funding from AmeriCorps to support a portion of each of the Site and Volunteer Coordinators’ stipends. Fee for service revenue also typically covers roughly 20% of the start-up costs of opening a new Reading Center at each school, such as program supplies and curriculum. Lastly, we will pursue diverse funding strategies to increase private philanthropy to underwrite the remaining additional costs. We are beginning this work in our current 2015-16 fiscal year, and have hired a full-time Development Manager charged with securing and increasing private revenue for program operations in the region."
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "If awarded, Reading Partners anticipates using the $100,000 LA2050 prize toward the following start-up costs to begin program implementation at the new school sites:\r\n\r\nEXPENSES:\r\nProgram Associate salary: $40,000\r\nVolunteer Coordinator benefits not covered by AmeriCorps: $10,000\r\nSite Coordinator benefits not covered by AmeriCorps (4 positions at $10,000 each): $40,000\r\nProgram Supplies: $1,000\r\nCurriculum: $5,000\r\nTechnology (4 laptops at $1,000 each): $4,000\r\nTOTAL EXPENSES: $100,000\r\nLA2050 Requested Support: $100,000\r\n\r\nAll expenditures listed above are entirely new costs associated with the second phase of our expansion plan and do not currently exist within our 2015-16 Los Angeles program budget."
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "Over the next ten years, Reading Partners’ organizational strategic plan is focused on increasing fourth grade national literacy achievement for low-income students by scaling and innovating our proven intervention program across the country. Los Angeles’ current expansion is essential to this growth. On a local level, we intend to replicate the success of our program in the Pasadena area, where strategic community and district-level relationships have critically affected the sustainability and growth of our program. By fall/winter 2015, we expect to have identified potential school and district partnerships in order to begin negotiations in spring 2016 for a summer 2016 launch date. \r\n\r\nAs we scale, our guiding principal is to create the highest-level of impact for as many students as possible. Testament to the value and impact of Reading Partners in LA, in 2014-15, 88% of students increased their rates of literacy learning while enrolled in our program, and on average, students more than doubled their rate of learning for every month enrolled in Reading Partners. In addition, 100% of principals at our partner schools reported improved reading progress school-wide and felt Reading Partners was a valuable asset to their schools. Our corps of Los Angeles-based volunteer tutors also gave nearly 15,000 hours of their time to support student literacy. Beyond just their time, our tutors also shared their energy, positivity, and belief in the importance of public education. Eighty-two percent of tutors reported they are more interested in public education due to their service with Reading Partners, and 76% reported that their experience with the organization strengthened their belief that not only teachers, but all citizens, can directly impact educational outcomes for children. \r\n\r\nHaving began at a single elementary school in 1999, today, Reading Partners is in 13 regions across the United States, directly serving more than 9,200 students in 180 schools with the support of more than 15,000 volunteers. By building on our current successes, we aspire to dramatically expand our impact, and ultimately have a positive effect on reading proficiency nationwide. At Reading Partners, we believe that literacy unlocks opportunity, and every child deserves to learn this fundamental skill that affords them the opportunity to comprehend, engage, and change the world around them. We look forward to advancing this critical work both here at home in Los Angeles and beyond."

  the number of personnel and resources dedicated to volunteer recruitment,
  school district partnerships, and fundraising, which are all existing costs in
  our current 2015-16 budget.
   
   To effectively double the number of students Reading Partners serves in Los Angeles moving forward, we anticipate needing an additional $300,000. A substantial part of this cost includes additional program staff to manage the portfolio of new sites, AmeriCorps Site Coordinators to staff each Reading Center, and an additional AmeriCorps Volunteer Coordinator to support volunteer recruitment and retention. Other direct costs associated with open a new Reading Center includes classroom supplies such as paper, pens, markers, and teaching supplies at roughly $250 per center; four complete sets of Reading Partners’ 148-level curriculum and 400-500 grade-level appropriate books per center at roughly $5,500 per school; as well as laptops for each of our new staff members at approximately $1,000 each. Lastly, with a significant influx of in volunteers to serve 1,000 students, the we anticipate the associated costs of our community engagement program to also increase, including additional reimbursements for tutor background checks, additional fees for conference and volunteer fair attendance, as well as more robust tutor appreciation events and additional marketing materials.
   
   To cover these costs, Reading Partners will receive funding from AmeriCorps to support a portion of each of the Site and Volunteer Coordinators’ stipends. Fee for service revenue also typically covers roughly 20% of the start-up costs of opening a new Reading Center at each school, such as program supplies and curriculum. Lastly, we will pursue diverse funding strategies to increase private philanthropy to underwrite the remaining additional costs. We are beginning this work in our current 2015-16 fiscal year, and have hired a full-time Development Manager charged with securing and increasing private revenue for program operations in the region.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
  If awarded, Reading Partners anticipates using the $100,000 LA2050 prize
  toward the following start-up costs to begin program implementation at the new
  school sites:
   
   EXPENSES:
   Program Associate salary: $40,000
   Volunteer Coordinator benefits not covered by AmeriCorps: $10,000
   Site Coordinator benefits not covered by AmeriCorps (4 positions at $10,000 each): $40,000
   Program Supplies: $1,000
   Curriculum: $5,000
   Technology (4 laptops at $1,000 each): $4,000
   TOTAL EXPENSES: $100,000
   LA2050 Requested Support: $100,000
   
   All expenditures listed above are entirely new costs associated with the second phase of our expansion plan and do not currently exist within our 2015-16 Los Angeles program budget.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Over the next ten years, Reading Partners’ organizational strategic plan is
  focused on increasing fourth grade national literacy achievement for
  low-income students by scaling and innovating our proven intervention program
  across the country. Los Angeles’ current expansion is essential to this
  growth. On a local level, we intend to replicate the success of our program in
  the Pasadena area, where strategic community and district-level relationships
  have critically affected the sustainability and growth of our program. By
  fall/winter 2015, we expect to have identified potential school and district
  partnerships in order to begin negotiations in spring 2016 for a summer 2016
  launch date. 
   
   As we scale, our guiding principal is to create the highest-level of impact for as many students as possible. Testament to the value and impact of Reading Partners in LA, in 2014-15, 88% of students increased their rates of literacy learning while enrolled in our program, and on average, students more than doubled their rate of learning for every month enrolled in Reading Partners. In addition, 100% of principals at our partner schools reported improved reading progress school-wide and felt Reading Partners was a valuable asset to their schools. Our corps of Los Angeles-based volunteer tutors also gave nearly 15,000 hours of their time to support student literacy. Beyond just their time, our tutors also shared their energy, positivity, and belief in the importance of public education. Eighty-two percent of tutors reported they are more interested in public education due to their service with Reading Partners, and 76% reported that their experience with the organization strengthened their belief that not only teachers, but all citizens, can directly impact educational outcomes for children. 
   
   Having began at a single elementary school in 1999, today, Reading Partners is in 13 regions across the United States, directly serving more than 9,200 students in 180 schools with the support of more than 15,000 volunteers. By building on our current successes, we aspire to dramatically expand our impact, and ultimately have a positive effect on reading proficiency nationwide. At Reading Partners, we believe that literacy unlocks opportunity, and every child deserves to learn this fundamental skill that affords them the opportunity to comprehend, engage, and change the world around them. We look forward to advancing this critical work both here at home in Los Angeles and beyond.

    answer: "Celebrating seven years in LA, Reading Partners looks forward to continuing to empower local communities to invest in the education of our youth by extending our proven early literacy intervention program to substantially more students throughout the county. We envision that all children will have the necessary literacy skills they need by fourth grade to achieve their fullest potential by leveraging the capacity of communities to close the achievement gap for struggling readers. To move toward this goal, we have two primary objectives:\r\n\r\n1. We will serve a much larger proportion of children in our current service areas. This school year, we have already increased participant density by expanding from eight to ten schools and serving 575 youth—a 25% increase in school partnerships from 2014-15.\r\n\r\n2. We will begin a strategic, major expansion of services set over the next two years. This will include identifying a new community where we will serve an additional four to six schools and 250-360 students, doubling our reach from 500 to 1,000 children by 2017.\r\n\r\nTo ensure LA is the best place to learn, Reading Partners will continue to mobilize local schools, districts, and communities to catalyze change and become advocates for educational opportunities in their neighborhoods. We intentionally partner with Title I schools with a high percentage of low-income students where tailored intervention resources are in short supply despite students’ high needs. With a structured, research-based curriculum that requires no prior experience, we transform any volunteer into a high-quality instructor, enabling us to reach hundreds more children and increase the capacity of public schools. Our efforts also focus on young K-4 students early in their school careers to maximize the amount of instruction they receive before their achievement gap widens, ensuring that as many students possible are reaching proficiency by fourth grade.\r\n\r\nWith 49% of low-income fourth graders reading below grade-level in LA County, thousands of children are at-risk of losing out on a more prosperous future that a strong education enables, and strong reading skills are especially important for children growing up in low-income communities where academic success is a critical pathway out of poverty. We are proud of our innovative and proven program model that harnesses the power of community service to provide an effective, affordable, and community-driven solution to the literacy crisis."

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      Since our program heavily relies on volunteers to provide one-on-one
      services, we anticipate that volunteer recruitment will be our biggest
      challenge as we can only enroll as many students as we have volunteers.
      Due to the sheer magnitude and geographical scope of our expansion,
      building a sustainable and reliable volunteer base is a top priority. To
      offset individual volunteer retention rates, last year, we implemented a
      new focus on building community partnerships with businesses, community
      organizations, and educational institutions that can be renewed every
      year. By emphasizing organization-level relationships as a dominant source
      of volunteers, we are confident that we can secure the volunteer base
      necessary to support our growth. Due in large part to these efforts, from
      2013-14 to 2014-15, we increased volunteer recruitment by 34%. We hope to
      continue on this trajectory moving forward as we project needing roughly
      1,300 volunteers to sustain an enrollment goal of 1,000 students.

      Data collection and analysis is a core feature of Reading Partners’
      program. To thoroughly evaluate students’ skills, we gather three sources
      of data. First, we collect results from research-based, elementary
      literacy assessment tools–STAR Early Literacy and STAR Early Reading. Both
      assessments provide growth targets for students that correspond to
      grade-level benchmarks. Our programmatic targets are also based on
      students’ reaching benchmarks tied to grade-level expectations. Second, we
      collect state standardized test scores and school-based evaluations to
      give us a more comprehensive picture of how students are doing relative to
      state English Language Arts standards. Finally, we gather impact data on
      improvements in students’ reading, self-confidence, and classroom
      participation through twice-annual teacher, principal, and tutor surveys.
      Together, these assessments enable us to benchmark students’ reading at
      enrollment, progress monitor and course-correct, and record overall
      growth.

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Reading Partners is the only nationally scaled program in the country with the complete package of in-school, one-on-one literacy instruction by volunteers who are trained and supported by staff. At each school, we transform a dedicated classroom into a comprehensive Reading Center and recruit and train 40-100 volunteers. Student-tutor pairs work together for 45 minutes twice a week, following an individualized reading plan tailored to each student’s particular needs. To execute this plan, tutors use Reading Partners’ curriculum; a series of research-based, structured lesson plans that progress from phonics instruction for earlier readers to comprehension strategy for more advanced students. Students are assessed four times per year to monitor their progress toward pre-established achievement goals and to help advise tutors on how to best support their students. With close oversight and assistance from senior staff, a trained AmeriCorps member is stationed at each site to provide coaching to volunteers and serve as a liaison to teachers and school staff. A Program Manager supervises a portfolio of reading centers and ensures consistent results and program fidelity. \r\n\r\nCompared to other organizations that focus on individual or group read-a-louds, Reading Partners concentrates on tangible skill development and improves students' mastery of both the concrete and abstract skills necessary to be a confident, independent reader. Reading Partners’ students aren’t just exposed to literacy; they practice it. Accordingly, our program generates real changes in student achievement that are measurable and tracked over time in partnership with our schools.\r\n\r\nIn March 2015, Reading Partners received the results of a multiyear, rigorous study conducted by MDRC, the nation’s leading education research firm. The study confirmed that our program model utilizing community volunteers is effective and produces a positive and statistically significant impact on students’ reading proficiency. In addition, program fidelity also remained consistent among sites across multiple regions, confirming that our program is also effective at scale. Lastly, because Reading Partners is able to provide one-on-one services to students, we are a resource multiplier for public schools. For every dollar invested, we are able to double the resources available to students by leveraging community resources, indicating that Reading Partners is a cost-effective option for under-resourced schools."

      this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner
      receive?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Reading Partners serves ten Title I elementary schools in Los Angeles County located in Pasadena, Mid-City Los Angeles, Santa Monica, and Lawndale. We currently have strong relationships with both Lawndale and Pasadena School Districts, including a five-year partnership with the Pasadena Unified, where we have agreed to triple our impact in the district by increasing the number of students served from 163 in 2013-14 to over 500 students and from three to ten schools by 2018-19. In addition, we have ongoing partnerships with community-based organizations and businesses that generously provide volunteers to support our programming, including Cal State LA, City National Bank, LA RSVP, LA Works, and Manhattan Beach Community Church to name a few.\r\n\r\nAs we begin outreach to prospective school, district, and community partners, we look to find another neighborhood to replicate the tremendous successes we’ve had in Pasadena. In addition to a strong partnership with the school district, Reading Partners has wonderful relationships with community organizations throughout the city such as the Pasadena Community Foundation, Pasadena Educational Foundation, and Pasadena City College that is able to provide the trifecta of financial, programmatic, and volunteer support to simultaneously sustain our current program and allow for growth.\r\n\r\nThough Reading Partners will provide our full scope of services at all of our school partners, the $100,000 grant would be used as seed money for capacity building and programmatic operations at each new school site. To help support a new site, Reading Partners requires partner schools and districts to invest in our program through fee for service. Fee for service revenue accounts for 13% of our total regional program budget and guarantees a diverse portfolio of private and public investors. Fee for service not only allows Reading Partners to better leverage philanthropic dollars to serve more schools, but also ensures school partners are invested in the success of our program."

      How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you
      cover the additional costs?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "In a spring 2015 planning session, it was identified that capacity building was necessary in three key areas: community engagement, program development, and board development and revenue generation. Because the magnitude of this expansion requires considerable financial and human capital, we have increased the number of personnel and resources dedicated to volunteer recruitment, school district partnerships, and fundraising, which are all existing costs in our current 2015-16 budget.\r\n\r\nTo effectively double the number of students Reading Partners serves in Los Angeles moving forward, we anticipate needing an additional $300,000. A substantial part of this cost includes additional program staff to manage the portfolio of new sites, AmeriCorps Site Coordinators to staff each Reading Center, and an additional AmeriCorps Volunteer Coordinator to support volunteer recruitment and retention. Other direct costs associated with open a new Reading Center includes classroom supplies such as paper, pens, markers, and teaching supplies at roughly $250 per center; four complete sets of Reading Partners’ 148-level curriculum and 400-500 grade-level appropriate books per center at roughly $5,500 per school; as well as laptops for each of our new staff members at approximately $1,000 each. Lastly, with a significant influx of in volunteers to serve 1,000 students, the we anticipate the associated costs of our community engagement program to also increase, including additional reimbursements for tutor background checks, additional fees for conference and volunteer fair attendance, as well as more robust tutor appreciation events and additional marketing materials.\r\n\r\nTo cover these costs, Reading Partners will receive funding from AmeriCorps to support a portion of each of the Site and Volunteer Coordinators’ stipends. Fee for service revenue also typically covers roughly 20% of the start-up costs of opening a new Reading Center at each school, such as program supplies and curriculum. Lastly, we will pursue diverse funding strategies to increase private philanthropy to underwrite the remaining additional costs. We are beginning this work in our current 2015-16 fiscal year, and have hired a full-time Development Manager charged with securing and increasing private revenue for program operations in the region."

    explanation: ''
    answer: "Over the next ten years, Reading Partners’ organizational strategic plan is focused on increasing fourth grade national literacy achievement for low-income students by scaling and innovating our proven intervention program across the country. Los Angeles’ current expansion is essential to this growth. On a local level, we intend to replicate the success of our program in the Pasadena area, where strategic community and district-level relationships have critically affected the sustainability and growth of our program. By fall/winter 2015, we expect to have identified potential school and district partnerships in order to begin negotiations in spring 2016 for a summer 2016 launch date. \r\n\r\nAs we scale, our guiding principal is to create the highest-level of impact for as many students as possible. Testament to the value and impact of Reading Partners in LA, in 2014-15, 88% of students increased their rates of literacy learning while enrolled in our program, and on average, students more than doubled their rate of learning for every month enrolled in Reading Partners. In addition, 100% of principals at our partner schools reported improved reading progress school-wide and felt Reading Partners was a valuable asset to their schools. Our corps of Los Angeles-based volunteer tutors also gave nearly 15,000 hours of their time to support student literacy. Beyond just their time, our tutors also shared their energy, positivity, and belief in the importance of public education. Eighty-two percent of tutors reported they are more interested in public education due to their service with Reading Partners, and 76% reported that their experience with the organization strengthened their belief that not only teachers, but all citizens, can directly impact educational outcomes for children. \r\n\r\nHaving began at a single elementary school in 1999, today, Reading Partners is in 13 regions across the United States, directly serving more than 9,200 students in 180 schools with the support of more than 15,000 volunteers. By building on our current successes, we aspire to dramatically expand our impact, and ultimately have a positive effect on reading proficiency nationwide. At Reading Partners, we believe that literacy unlocks opportunity, and every child deserves to learn this fundamental skill that affords them the opportunity to comprehend, engage, and change the world around them. We look forward to advancing this critical work both here at home in Los Angeles and beyond."
