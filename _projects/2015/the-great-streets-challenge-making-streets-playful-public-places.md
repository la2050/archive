project_summary: >-
  The Great Streets Challenge will temporarily transform five main streets into
  vibrant, healthy, playful public spaces. Community based organizations will
  design and lead projects through a comprehensive outreach process that will
  culminate in a physical demonstration of an innovative street design. This
  process fundamentally disrupts traditional planning and capital development by
  empowering local communities to re-imagine their front yards – city streets –
  and then demand permanent change.
