title: 'The Great Streets Challenge: Making Streets Playful Public Places'
project_summary: >-
  The Great Streets Challenge will temporarily transform five main streets into
  vibrant, healthy, playful public spaces. Community based organizations will
  design and lead projects through a comprehensive outreach process that will
  culminate in a physical demonstration of an innovative street design. This
  process fundamentally disrupts traditional planning and capital development by
  empowering local communities to re-imagine their front yards – city streets –
  and then demand permanent change.

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to play.: "The Great Streets Challenge will improve Los Angeles’ access to public spaces by temporarily transforming five streets into playful public spaces.\r\n\r\nLos Angeles has over 7,500 miles of streets in the city. It is physically our largest public asset. For decades, we have used our streets for largely one purpose: to facilitate the movement of vehicles. Consider that only half of Angelenos live within walking distance of a park, but that almost all Angelenos have access to an arterial corridor in their neighborhood. Why can’t our streets serve as parks? Imagine, instead of building streets for cars, we turned some streets into places where people could play, gather and actively enjoy their neighborhood. We believe that our streets are the answer to our lack of convenient access to open space.\r\n\r\nThe goal of our campaign will be to educate community members on the long-term possibilities of streets as public spaces, while also building low-cost improvements that can transform the street in the short-term. We will use the principles of tactical urbanism to demonstrate how simple, low-cost improvements can transform a street into a place for play, exercise, and comfort.\r\n\r\nOur campaign has four objectives:\r\n\r\nEngaging community members that have traditionally been excluded from the planning process: We will increase our outreach impact by partnering with groups embedded in the community through traditional and non-traditional efforts. Bringing demonstrations onto the street will improve the number and diversity of those involved. \r\n\r\nUsing a data-driven approach to help understand the needs of communities: Our process will be focused on measurable outcomes. Building off current street benchmarking activities, we will use our community partnerships to collect information on how streets are currently being used and how we can make streets safer, more enjoyable public spaces.\r\n\r\nTemporarily building improvements in the street: During a weekend, communities could demonstrate anything from protected bike lanes for safer and more fun travel, to bus stops that have swings built into them. This has two benefits: educating community members about the benefits of streets as public spaces, while immediately improving access to open space.\r\n\r\nUsing community engagement, data collection and a temporary build, we will inform investments that the city can pursue for permanent projects."

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "Challenge 1: Educating community partners and stakeholders on the benefits and strategies of tactical urbanism.\r\n\r\nStrategy 1: We will provide stewardship and guidance from both the Great Streets studio and our existing network of experts. We will host technical workshops with experts from across the country. We also have secured a technical assistance grant from the Southern California Association of Governments to assist on tactical urbanism projects.\r\n\r\nChallenge 2: Turning short-term demonstrations into permanent infrastructure. \r\n\r\nStrategy 2: We are an integral part of the Office of Mayor Eric Garcetti. Executive Directive 1 gives us the power to coordinate departmental services to prioritize projects. We have found that engaging all stakeholders, including city bureaucrats, is fundamental to ensuring that short-term projects become permanent. "
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Our goal is to increase access to healthy, safe, playful public spaces. Our success will be in how many people participate in designing spaces in their communities, how many people learn about the benefits of streets as public spaces, and how many people enjoy their time in these spaces. \r\n\r\nSuccess will also be reflected in how many short-term projects we can transform into permanent improvements. We must be able to use our communities’ recommendations for permanent infrastructure. Year over year, we will measure our success by collecting data related to:\r\n•\tIncreased Economic Activity\r\n•\tImproved Access and Mobility\r\n•\tEnhanced Neighborhood Character\r\n•\tGreater Community Engagement\r\n•\tImproved Environmental Resilience\r\n•\tSafer and More Secure Communities\r\n•\tImproved Health Outcomes\r\n\r\nPlease see attached spreadsheet for a full list of metrics we will collect to measure success. \r\n"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "We are uniquely positioned in the Chief Executive Office of Los Angeles – the Office of Mayor Eric Garcetti – and can establish and build one vision for our streets and our community.\r\n\r\nWe recognize the emergence and popularity of similar community-led, tactical urbanism style events taking place around the country and in Los Angeles. Organizations in all sectors are beginning to see the benefits of these low resource, high impact projects. The below organizations are all involved in similar work individually.\r\n \r\nIoby and other crowdfunding sites are developing unique tools are to empower low-income neighborhoods, increase civic engagement and create a stronger link between funding sources and projects that need them most. With over $2,000,000 raised and 597 projects successfully funded to-date, ioby has an expertise raising funds for community driven projects.  \r\n\r\nNon-profit organizations like LA Mas, Kounkuey Design Initiative and Better Block all have experience in with similar tactical urbanism projects in local communities. These types of organizations are excellent at empowering local stakeholders, doing meaning community outreach and combining their skills with those of the community they’re serving. \r\n\r\nGovernment agencies like the Department of City Planning (DCP) and LA Department of Transportation (LADOT) are working on similar projects such as the People St and Play Street. \r\n\r\nGreat Streets realizes the value that each of these organizations offers and would seek to partner with each (see section below). Because of this, we have the capacity to change the policy direction of our city departments, the planning process our city uses to engage Angelenos, and the allocation of city funds for permanent improvements.\r\n"
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "Community leadership is our most important objective. We will award five different community-based partners to lead project development. We will use our 2015 Great Streets Challenge Grant framework to select local partners that will conduct participatory planning, project management and data collection. This model has proven successful for eight existing community projects (see attached work examples). We are confident that this will amplify the impact of the LA2050 grant.\r\n\r\nTo deepen community participation and leadership, we will engage a crowd-funding platform, like ioby. During the first round of Challenge Grants this year, our eight community partners raised over $95,000 in six weeks from over 500 donors on ioby. Based on past experience, fifty-two percent of donors ultimately volunteer for the campaign to which they donated. We aim to raise additional funds for our projects, while also building community support and a strong volunteer base. These organizations typically require a stipend to provide technical assistance, which we will factor into our budget.\r\n\r\nBuilding off of the engagement process, we will demonstrate the community’s vision for a re-imagined street. We will partner with organizations like LA Más to use temporary materials to design and build each demonstration project. These firms typically require a budget to cover material costs and staff time.\r\n\r\nWe will also work with LADOT, DCP, the Department of Public Works, the Department of Cultural Affairs, and other relevant city departments to ensure that each temporary demonstration leads to permanent change. When projects have been completed, city departments will pursue capital resources to permanently construct projects. We will use the LA2050 grant to pilot a new method for advanced community planning. However, no LA2050 grant dollars will be used for city departments to pursue capital improvement funds.\r\n\r\nImportantly, no portion of this budget will be allocated to our office. All of the funds will go to community-based organizations and technical partners to re-imagine streets as public spaces. \r\n"
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    From experience, each demonstration project costs between $30,000 - $40,000
    to conduct community outreach, collect data, and secure materials for a
    temporary build. Because we propose five separate demonstration projects, we
    can save on material costs and outreach, bringing costs down to an estimated
    $30,000 per project. The total cost of implementation will be $150,000. We
    will cover additional costs through crowd-funding. Crowd-funding
    accomplishes two goals: gap-financing project costs and building capacity in
    local communities.

  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "The Great Streets Challenge will improve Los Angeles County’s access to public spaces by creating a framework for how municipal agencies transform streets into safe, clean, playful, open spaces.\r\n\r\nTo establish our framework, our goal is to use these pilots to inform long-term, actionable change on our streets. This process will then inform a “Do it Yourself” Great Streets Toolkit, which we are currently working on with LA City Planning. We will turn this toolkit into an actual tool, which will be taken and used in neighborhoods across Los Angeles County. We will host workshops, advise neighborhood organizations, and empower all communities to transform their local main streets into public spaces with the help of this tool. When we empower communities to create change through low-cost interventions themselves, and then pass this knowledge onto other communities, we can rapidly transform access to open space across the county.\r\n\r\nOur office is also working on a FY17 budget item for street improvements that have overwhelming community support. This will be a dedicated fund for permanent improvements in the public right of way, to which communities can apply. Instead of the city setting aside funds for capital projects and then spending time and money on an outreach process, this will allocate funds only to communities that have already demonstrated support. \r\n\r\nOne main concern with this process is equity.  Some communities may not be organized enough to apply for funding. So to ensure that funds are distributed equitably, we will use our 2015 Challenge Grant model to vet applications. Our model focused less on the technical aspects of applications and more on the capacity of the applicant to engage other residents and partner with the city. We will also prioritize park poor areas, and will provide technical and capacity assistance for the applicants who qualify.\r\n\r\nThrough working with community partnerships to re-imagine our city streets, we can provide access for all LA County residents to playful, vibrant open spaces. \r\n"
