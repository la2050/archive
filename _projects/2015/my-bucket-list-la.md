  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "LA is one of the most diverse cities in the world with over 40 languages spoken.  Many communities, however,  remain somewhat isolated, either in what is culturally familiar to them, what is accessible to them in terms of transportation, or based on any number of demographic factors.  Our vision is to partner with neighborhood councils, local organizations, local colleges, and corporate human resources departments, to connect people to everything that is Los Angeles.  We want people to experience the texture and various aspects of the city so that they can have a deeper connection, to walk away from these events having learned something new and calling LA “my city.”  My Bucket List LA will incorporate volunteerism, local restaurants, events, and  cultural/historical activities, while facilitating social connection across professional, racial, ethnic, and socio-economic lines.  We will tap into the existing cultural richness and natural diversity of our city to help expand participants’ overall experience as Angelenos.  We believe the structure of these events would provide exposure to social issues, more awareness and understanding of those issues, and further civic engagement.\r\n"
