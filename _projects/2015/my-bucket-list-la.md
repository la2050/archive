  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "LA is one of the most diverse cities in the world with over 40 languages spoken.  Many communities, however,  remain somewhat isolated, either in what is culturally familiar to them, what is accessible to them in terms of transportation, or based on any number of demographic factors.  Our vision is to partner with neighborhood councils, local organizations, local colleges, and corporate human resources departments, to connect people to everything that is Los Angeles.  We want people to experience the texture and various aspects of the city so that they can have a deeper connection, to walk away from these events having learned something new and calling LA “my city.”  My Bucket List LA will incorporate volunteerism, local restaurants, events, and  cultural/historical activities, while facilitating social connection across professional, racial, ethnic, and socio-economic lines.  We will tap into the existing cultural richness and natural diversity of our city to help expand participants’ overall experience as Angelenos.  We believe the structure of these events would provide exposure to social issues, more awareness and understanding of those issues, and further civic engagement.\r\n"

    - Percentage of Angelenos that volunteer informally (Dream Metric)
    - Total number of local social media friends and connections (Dream Metric)
    - Attendance at public/open streets gatherings (Dream Metric)
  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "One major barrier or challenge will be bridging the gap between simply participating in the event, as opposed to connecting, forming long lasting relationships and establishing continued participation in the community.  Our name itself includes the structural aim of our project: Bucket List.  The fundamental idea of a bucket list is repeated interaction, crossing off more that you’ve seen and done.  In attending multiple events through My Bucket List LA, people will come, volunteer, play, eat, and ultimately connect with familiar faces, while exploring new pockets of the city. \r\n"
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    We plan to evaluate with feedback from participating individuals and
    organizations.  Surveys and feedback will provide us with concrete
    information to improve our programs and ways to move forward with growth.
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "There are several organizations who work on pieces of our project, including LA Works (Volunteer), Meet Up (Social), and Eventbrite (Social, Cultural, Historical).  Our approach is unique because it’s the integration and curation of all these aspects, while targeting particular populations and groups for these interactions.  The bucket list is a goal-oriented project that creates incentive for participants to remain engaged over the long term.\r\n"
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "We will partner with neighborhood councils and the organizations we set up volunteer events with.  Our goal includes learning about the organizations, their missions, people they serve, and their place in the overall community of LA.  If awarded the grant, funds would be budgeted to maximize the impact of the program.  Seeking additional funds from partner organizations will allow us to leverage LA2050 funding to maximize the reach of the program.  \r\n"
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    This program would be scalable. The amount we spend could grow or decrease
    dependent on how much we have to spend.  As noted above, additional funds
    raised from participating companies and organizations will allow us to
    maximize the reach of the program. 
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Fixed Cost: \r\nAdministrative Support - 10 hours a week $20/hr for a year ($10,000)\r\nSample Budget for an Event for 30 participants:\r\nCraft Supplies - 250\r\nFood - 600 (Can be defrayed by program participants and participating restaurants)\r\nTransportation (BUS) - 500\r\nKayaking - 1500\r\nPromotional Supplies - 250\r\nOperational Support - 500\r\nTotal:  $3600\r\n\r\nMultiple events would be planned and implemented over the course of the year.  \r\n"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "By tapping into the existing network of volunteer events, restaurants and activities around Los Angeles, scaling up will require strong partnerships.  We would partner with large corporations for large scale promotion, awareness, and sponsorships for employees or events.  We would also partner with volunteer organizations and non-profits to build strong relationships for future, continued and potentially regular volunteerism or events.  We would need to create a marketing plan to utilize social media, other digital and viral modes of promotion, establish city wide awareness and any other Public Relations need.  Additionally, if scaling up, we would need an operational team or administrative staff to plan and execute the events.  With continued growth we would build a platform to track the events, a bucket list app that includes social sharing as we continue to trek through the digital and social media world.  It would be incredible to then see a project like this grow into other cities.  \r\n"

    answer: "We will partner with neighborhood councils and the organizations we set up volunteer events with.  Our goal includes learning about the organizations, their missions, people they serve, and their place in the overall community of LA.  If awarded the grant, funds would be budgeted to maximize the impact of the program.  Seeking additional funds from partner organizations will allow us to leverage LA2050 funding to maximize the reach of the program.  \r\n"

  - name: How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "By tapping into the existing network of volunteer events, restaurants and activities around Los Angeles, scaling up will require strong partnerships.  We would partner with large corporations for large scale promotion, awareness, and sponsorships for employees or events.  We would also partner with volunteer organizations and non-profits to build strong relationships for future, continued and potentially regular volunteerism or events.  We would need to create a marketing plan to utilize social media, other digital and viral modes of promotion, establish city wide awareness and any other Public Relations need.  Additionally, if scaling up, we would need an operational team or administrative staff to plan and execute the events.  With continued growth we would build a platform to track the events, a bucket list app that includes social sharing as we continue to trek through the digital and social media world.  It would be incredible to then see a project like this grow into other cities.  \r\n"
