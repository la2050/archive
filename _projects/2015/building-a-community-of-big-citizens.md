title: Building a community of Big Citizens
project_summary: >-
  We are working with a diverse group of young people from across Los Angeles
  who have talents, ideas, and energy that are waiting to be activated. We
  empower these youth to take action on issues in their community that are
  important to them. This proposal supports the expansion of our reach and
  impact in 2016, as we increase the size of our middle school program from 75
  to 100 youth and launch our high school program with 75 youth.

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "Big Citizen HUB, a project of Community Partners, brings together youth from different neighborhoods, providing a common culture with which to relate, common experience with which to connect, opportunity for dialogue that explores differences in experience and perspective – all while learning important life skills and leadership skills that are necessary for success in school and the workforce. This type of opportunity currently does not exist in our city, where young people can come together from all over and meet new people through positive experiences.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the success of our program is based on partnerships with organizations that serve and address our most pressing community issues. In our first program year we engaged with 32 external partners across Los Angeles. Aside from learning from, serving with, and connecting on the issues these organizations address, there is one very important outcome that we expect to see over time from this type of engagement: Adults begin to see youth as thoughtful, engaged, and valued participants in our communities. In turn, this change in perception allows youth to gain motivation to succeed in school, participate in their community, and feel optimistic about the future. \r\n\r\nAs Big Citizens grow and mature they’ll become voters, business leaders, social entrepreneurs, public officials, teachers, and parents. They’ll support public transportation, utilize social media in new and powerful ways, and will regularly connect with others outside of their neighborhood. Big Citizen HUB will be the best place for youth in Los Angeles to learn about issues that affect our local and global communities, to practice the skills needed to solve problems, and to connect with and feel comfortable with people of different backgrounds.\r\n"

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "We recognize that the logistics involved with bringing together young people from many neighborhoods can be challenging, especially when many of them are at an age that they are unable to drive themselves. Our strategy for doing this successfully is the following: \r\n1. We communicate thoroughly with parents during the application process so that our Big Citizens’ families support their participation. \r\n2. Our daily meeting space is located in downtown Los Angeles in Pershing Square, accessible by public transit. \r\n3. For our youth who cannot take public transit or don’t have a family member who can drive them each Saturday, we work to arrange carpooling within our Big Citizen community.\r\n"
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    In our first year of implementation we measured the experience of Big
    Citizens through mid-year and end-of-year surveys to identify participant
    assets and growth areas and program efficacy. We also used surveys to
    understand the experience of our team leaders, community partners, and
    parents. We’ve been fortunate to receive in-kind evaluation support from a
    team of graduate students of Positive Developmental Psychology at Claremont
    Graduate University School of Social Science, Policy and Evaluation. This
    team has chosen Big Citizen HUB to help focus our outcomes and evaluate our
    program in our second year of implementation. We are working with this team
    on recommended evaluation techniques, but expect some to remain consistent
    with our first year of evaluation. We expect our outcomes in 2016 to include
    increased ability to work on teams, increased ability to relate to peers of
    different backgrounds, increased self-confidence, and increased
    life-satisfaction and positive emotions.
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    There are many leadership programs in Los Angeles that operate out of
    thriving recreation centers, however these efforts are mostly place-based
    and reach only specific pockets of the LA area. There are strong college
    bound programs that engage youth from around the city, however those
    organizations are focused on academics and college-bound culture. There are
    schools that engage students in impressive social entrepreneurial
    experiences and service learning, however they are run solely within their
    student body. What is unique about Big Citizen HUB is that we build leaders
    and active citizens through diversity and collective effort from multiple
    neighborhoods around Los Angeles with a focus on values, dialogue and
    defining the spaces in-between one another.  We utilize the expertise of
    local organizations that work to address pressing social issues by providing
    our youth with immersive exploration opportunities to see what these
    organizations do on a daily basis. 
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    While we do not have any official partners for LA2050, the grant award will
    allow us to collaborate with 40+ community organizations in 2016.
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    This project totals just under $493,000 in estimated expenses. We plan to
    cover additional costs through a combination of individual contributions,
    foundation and corporate grants, and special events. In addition, we are
    launching a second crowdfunding campaign in October 2015. Our first campaign
    raised $25,000 and we expect to see similar success this year. The goal will
    be to gain excitement and support around the launch our high school
    program. 
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "The $100,000 grant award will be used to increase the size of our middle school program (adding 25 youth) and launching the high school program with 75 youth. Below is the detailed budget needed to increase our impact in 2016:\r\nTeam Leaders (18) = $12,960\r\nProgram Day Supplies = $3751\r\nService Day Supplies = $4,500\r\nPublic Transit = $6,300\r\nPrinting & Postage = $2,851\r\nHealthy Lunches = $12,600\r\nProgram Space Rental - $6,250\r\nProgram Staff (2) - $41,788\r\nAdministration & Operations - $9,000\r\n"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    Big Citizen HUB is structured as a pipeline program for civic engagement. In
    2015 we launched with 75 middle school youth. This proposal will support
    growth of our middle school program to 100 youth and the launch of our high
    school program with 75 youth. In 2018 we plan to launch the elementary
    program, completing our goal of serving youth ages 8 and older, including
    our 19-26 year old team leaders. In our first five years of operation we
    anticipate 1300 youth will have participated in Big Citizen HUB in Los
    Angeles alone. At that point, we expect to explore expanding our reach to
    other cities.
