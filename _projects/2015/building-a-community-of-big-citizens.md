project_summary: >-
  We are working with a diverse group of young people from across Los Angeles
  who have talents, ideas, and energy that are waiting to be activated. We
  empower these youth to take action on issues in their community that are
  important to them. This proposal supports the expansion of our reach and
  impact in 2016, as we increase the size of our middle school program from 75
  to 100 youth and launch our high school program with 75 youth.
