  Green Commuter emphasizes sustainability and maximizing the efficiency of the
  existing transportation network at a human scale. This proposal expands the
  upcoming launch of our pilot programs offering complete car sharing and
  vanpooling services using the latest technology and zero-emission vehicles
  (ZEVs) to facilitate travel across the greater LA area. We offer the most
  comprehensive program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and traffic
  congestion, all while reducing commuting costs.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Green Commuter will make LA the best place to connect by offering a tool to
  help LA residents, commuters, and visitors get from one place to another in an
  environmentally-friendly, convenient, affordable, and innovative way.
    
   Current vanpool commuters only use their vans between 10 to 15 hours per week (an average of a 1 to 1.5 hour commute each way for five days). With only 6-9% of usage during any point of a given week, the van stays unused for the remaining 91-94% of time. In order to address this deficiency and maximize utilization and efficiency of the vehicles, Green Commuter has developed a new model that will use the vanpool vehicle, when it is not commuting people to and from work, as a public car share vehicle or to replace an employer or municipality’s fleet vehicle. The goal is for the synergy between all systems to dramatically increase the benefits of their stand-alone schemes.
    
   The synergistic model couples zero-emission vehicles with ride sharing and car sharing, offering one of the most comprehensive programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and traffic congestion while simultaneously reducing the commuting costs of its members. Currently, the only vehicle to meet the needs of this innovate model is the all-electric Tesla Model X. A 7-passenger utility vehicle, the Model X offers the essential battery capacity for the long-range driving needed to allow for car sharing, vanpooling, and fleet replacement on a daily basis.
    
   Green Commuter plans to launch in early 2016 and a grant from LA 2050 would help expand our first pilot program in order to reach more people. As an LA2050 report noted, “People live where they do because they want to get a quality education, a good job, an affordable home, and maintain (or build new) social ties. Transportation helps accomplish these goals.” Green Commuter’s goal builds on all these objectives to make sure that transportation is affordable, green, and convenient. In many instances, people have limited access to public transportation and, without a service like Green Commuter, would have no mobility options or otherwise be restricted to the costs associated with using a single vehicle. Therefore, Green Commuter’s innovative strategy will help reduce single occupancy vehicle use in Los Angeles and, in turn, help mitigate traffic and air pollution.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  One of Green Commuter’s challenges is to make sure that charging
  infrastructure is available to support its all-electric fleet. Green
  Commuter’s system is dependent on accessing charging stations, either at the
  origin or destination point. Even though there are new charging stations
  installed on a daily basis, more are needed as ZEVs on the road keep
  increasing. Current subsidies and legislation are encouraging the installation
  of charging stations and, as the infrastructure keeps expanding, the issue
  will disappear.
    
   Green Commuter will continue to work with its partners to navigate important government, utility, and other incentives available towards EV charging stations. Additionally, the full breadth of EV charging options, from different charge levels to leasing or owning stations, will allow Green Commuter and its partner entities to find a solution that fits best with their needs.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Green Commuter’s success will be measured primarily by the deployment of its
  all-electric, zero-emission fleet, but also by its ability to meet its goals
  to alleviate traffic, mitigate air pollution, and reduce the cost of
  commuting.
    
   Vanpooling is the most affordable way to commute and Green Commuter will offer its vanpool services at a monthly cost that is less than what other current vanpool providers charge. Additionally, car sharing also helps improve mobility options, particularly for disadvantaged communities. Every all-electric vanpool avoids, on average, the emission of 39 MTCO2 per year and every car share removes 9-13 vehicles from the road. Therefore, utilization of Green Commuter’s model will quantifiably reduce commuting costs for its riders, help improve air quality, and remove vehicles from the road. Green Commuter will collect and monitor data from each of its vehicles to both evaluate and demonstrates its ongoing impact.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Companies with whom Green Commuter competes are Zipcar, Cars2Go, Enterprise
  CarShare, vRide, Uber, and Lyft. However, these companies do not offer
  combined ride sharing and car sharing services like Green Commuter, often
  requiring members to use multiple services or own a personal vehicle to meet
  the full range of their travel needs. The integrated car sharing and
  vanpooling service will give members the convenience of having multiple
  mobility options within a single service. Further, Green Commuter has a
  competitive advantage because of its electrified fleet. Electric zero-emission
  vehicles enable Green Commuter to leverage local, regional, state and federal
  tax credits and subsidies reducing end-user costs, providing additional
  revenue, and mitigating risks to investors.
   
   Green Commuter has also created systems, such as custom software solutions and mobile applications, to assure that the vanpool, fleet replacement, and car share systems can work seamlessly in tandem, especially when either origin or destination points are located within the Los Angeles area, therefore offering car sharing services around the clock. Other notable car share providers offer services that are limited by vehicle availability, range (in the case of electric vehicles) and capacity. The Tesla Model X, with its seven-passenger seating and approximate 250-mile range, allows Green Commuter to execute an innovative model unlike existing transportation options - a system that goes beyond conventional vanpool and car share platforms to integrate with current and future transportation initiatives focused on multi-modal travel, regional interconnectivity, and pollution mitigation.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Green Commuter does not have specific partners for this grant and, if awarded,
  the full grant award amount will go solely to Green Commuter. However, more
  generally, collaboration is at the center of all of Green Commuter’s work.
  Green Commuter works closely with non-profit, governmental, university, and
  for-profit partners to achieve it mission of alleviating traffic, mitigating
  air pollution, and reducing the cost of commuting in Los Angeles and beyond,
  and to help many of its partners achieve their own sustainability goals. For
  example, Green Commuter recently partnered with L.A. County on an Air
  Resources Board Targeted Car Sharing Pilot Program grant, an effort that drew
  support from the Southern California Association of Governments, UC Berkeley’s
  Transportation Sustainability Research Center, California State Senators Carol
  Liu and Kevin de Leon, the California Energy Commission-designated Advanced
  Transportation Center of Southern California, the Fresno Council of
  Governments, Fresno County Rural Transit Agency, Fresno State University, Los
  Angeles County Economic Development Corporation (LAEDC), and the San Joaquin
  Valley Air Pollution Control District, among others.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  Green Commuter has an ambitious goal of putting 9,000 vanpools on the road in
  Southern California in the next five years, an objective that would remove
  103,500 single occupancy vehicles from the road and avoid almost one million
  metric tons of CO2 Emissions. Such a goal, however, will only be possible with
  the backing and leverage of a coalition of support extending from governmental
  and political leaders, subsidies, grants, and conventional financing. Green
  Commuter has a robust research and development team that actively partners
  with different entities to apply for various grants and subsidies. In
  partnership with FCRTA, a Fresno based transit agency, for example, Green
  Commuter has already been awarded funding from the Department of
  Transportation/Caltrans.
    
   For the initial pilot program, however, Green Commuter plans to put 100 vehicles on the road in Los Angeles in early 2016. In order to purchase the vehicles for the pilot, as well as cover outreach, education, marketing, and operational costs, such a program will cost approximately $8,000,000. Green Commuter is a privately-held, minority-woman-owned benefit corporation incorporated in the State of California in 2014. As a start-up, Green Commuter is currently self-funded and in the process of receiving conventional financing to cover these costs. In addition, Green Commuter plans to continue to apply for grants and subsidies, both solely and in partnership with many of the government and non-profit collaborators it is partnering with. It is also in the process of launching a crowdfunding campaign and has had multiple investors express interest in investing in the company.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  a. Outreach and Education (25% - $25,000)
   A crucial component of a successful pilot project is a targeted outreach campaign that focuses on the education of employees and the greater public on vanpooling and car sharing, and marketing these alternative transportation methods and their benefits. A portion of the requested funds will go towards agency fees ($20,000) for production and media costs, including billboard production, radio production, printing, and digital advertising, as well as some in-house marketing efforts administrative costs ($5,000). 
    
   b. Operations (75% - $75,000)
   Seventy-five percent of requested funds will be directed towards the operation of the service by Green Commuter. These funds will be directed towards the following items: Administration/Supplies/Services ($6,2500), Maintenance and Roadside Assistance Costs ($6,000), Software development support costs ($10,250), Green Commuter Salaries and Benefits ($22,500), and Insurance ($30,000).
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Green Commuter plans to launch the service in the first quarter of 2016 by
  generating demand prior to deployment through pre-registration and executed
  service agreements for vanpooling, car sharing and fleet replacement by large
  employer centers, employees, universities, and individuals. By working with
  various entities across the city to introduce the pilot program, Green
  Commuter can tailor its model to meet the unique needs of a company’s systems
  and future initiatives. For example, employees at large employment centers and
  university faculty/staff at locations that have elected to implement Green
  Commuter’s car sharing service during the day can use the vehicles to grab
  lunch, run errands on breaks and go to offsite meetings. For other employers
  and local municipalities, there is a need to reduce costs for fleet
  maintenance. Leasing a fleet is more affordable for many employers who save on
  insurance, registration, maintenance, repairs, depreciation and fuel by using
  Green Commuter’s services. Regardless of the need, Green Commuter plans to
  introduce its model with an initial five to ten vehicles at each company,
  serving a diverse group of companies throughout the Los Angeles area. Green
  Commuter expects to launch the service with 100 total vehicles and forecasts
  the fleet to grow to 1,000 vehicles by the end of 2017. As other vehicles come
  to market that meet the range and passenger capacity criteria for the
  company’s model, Green Commuter intends to diversify its fleet.
