project_summary: >-
  We want to create safer neighborhoods and stronger communities by giving
  locals the opportunity to use art to “repair” public intersections in their
  neighborhoods. A technique pioneered by the City Repair Project in Portland,
  intersection repair is a tested, cost-effective way to turn regular streets
  into places for people, making them safer and uniting neighbors through a
  common sense of ownership of and pride in their neighborhood.
