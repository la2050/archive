  We want to create safer neighborhoods and stronger communities by giving
  locals the opportunity to use art to “repair” public intersections in their
  neighborhoods. A technique pioneered by the City Repair Project in Portland,
  intersection repair is a tested, cost-effective way to turn regular streets
  into places for people, making them safer and uniting neighbors through a
  common sense of ownership of and pride in their neighborhood.

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to play.: "Streets in Los Angeles were designed with cars in mind, and because of that, they’re not a welcoming place for people to linger and play. We don’t have the same opportunity here to gather and play in the streets that other cities have, and because of that, we face significant barriers to important social functions like meeting new friends, hosting group activities, and forming close bonds with neighbors. This project will foster safer, stronger communities by encouraging neighborhood residents to work together to design and implement “intersection repair.”\r\n\r\nIntersection repair is a simple and fun technique that consists of collectively painting graphics, murals, and other public art in residential intersections. It’s relatively inexpensive, and has been shown to reduce crime, improve traffic safety, and strengthen the sense of community and communication amongst neighbors.\r\n"
  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "The most obvious hurdle will be getting the majority of people in a neighborhood to agree to altering their street. In order to grease the wheels, we plan to use an online voting system to choose our initial locations democratically, which will allow communities that really want to participate to come to us rather than us trying to force the project on a community that doesn’t want it.\r\n\r\nWorking with the city to get this type of project approved may also present a challenge, however, opt-in participation will eliminate most public opposition and give us a clear path to implementation. Progressive city council members like Jose Huizar’s office have expressed interest in such a project, and we’re confident we’d be able to work productively with local government to bring this project across the finish line.\r\n"
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Since the goal of this project is to strengthen community by encouraging residents to enjoy public streets in their neighborhoods, one of the best success metrics is simply the number of people active on a street throughout the day. Conveniently, New York company Placemeter recently released a technology that makes it easy to use streaming video to count pedestrian activity with 95% accuracy (manual pedestrian counts are usually only 75% accurate!). We’ve spoken with Placemeter about using their technology to gauge our success, and they agreed to work with us on an initial implementation.\r\n\r\nThroughout the life of the project, we will take measures to ensure that this type of data collection is a top priority. All data collected will be made available publicly, and we will use it ourselves to ensure that each implementation is as effective and successful as possible."
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "The City Repair Project in Portland pioneered this technique during the mid 90’s and has gotten significant recognition from the livable cities movement for it. 75% of survey respondents who live near the intersection of the first implementation reported experiencing increased communication amongst neighbors, decreased traffic speeds, and decreased crime. Books like Mike Lydon’s Tactical Urbanism praise intersection repair as a great way to create safer, more livable streets, and Mark Lakeman is regarded as something of a hero for championing the idea.\r\n\r\nIn Los Angeles, LADOT currently runs a program called People Street which fosters the creation of pedestrian-only plazas, parklets, and and bike corrals. These projects are complimentary, however, since the features are for pedestrians only and require expressly taking space away from vehicles, they are not easily created, and some residents are not in favor of them. Furthermore, the cost of creating and maintaining a pedestrian plaza is not justifiable in many smaller neighborhoods, despite the fact that those neighborhoods would greatly benefit from having them.\r\n\r\nThough we don’t like to think of creating livable streets as a competitive practice, we are unique in the way we plan to use programmatic data to maximize our success and the success of the project. This type of project has not been done before in Los Angeles, and coming into the scene with a project that is both informed by and even better than what has already been done in Portland will be a good source of publicity for Los Angeles as a player in the livable streets movement.\r\n\r\nAnd most importantly, given the density of incredibly talented artists living in Los Angeles, I'm confident the artwork we produce will blow away everyone elses!"
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "Primary execution will be handled jointly by:\r\n- Stephen Corwin on behalf of Compiler LA (www.compiler.la)\r\n- Daveed Kapoor on behalf of Utopiad (utopiad.org)\r\n\r\nDaveed and Stephen will have equal authority over the use of the $100,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nSecondary partners:\r\nMike Kang of Redcar LTD\r\nMike is the owner of a collection of properties at 837 N Spring St, located immediately adjacent to the Gold Line Chinatown Station. He reached out to Daveed in 2014 looking to take steps toward transforming a portion of the area below the subway station into a plaza. Though he is not currently ready to execute a full, LADOT People Street Plaza, Mike feels that this type of treatment is a great first step toward making his properties better places for people, and is interested in partnering.\r\n\r\nLA Walks / Elysian 2050\r\nIn addition to this project, Daveed is spearheading a project of his own called Elysian Park Connections, which is developing creative ways to reconnect Elysian Park to its surrounding neighborhoods. One of the ideas coming out of that project is to create a walking route between Downtown LA and Dodger Stadium (it’s only one mile!) in order to encourage fans to try alternatives to driving into Elysian Park.\r\n\r\nTo compliment that idea, we have discussed partnering with LA Walks, a local organization that promotes walking in Los Angeles, in order to create a pseudo-official, pre-game walk to Dodger Stadium which would meet at a plaza created by this project. Ideally, this plaza would be the one created via the above partnership with Mike Kang due to the fact that it will be so close to the Gold Line Station, but any area in China Town would be suitable."
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    Depending on the cost of success on initial implementations, $100,000 could
    pay for anywhere between 6 and 20 repaired intersections across the city. As
    the material costs for this project are minimal, it’s extremely unlikely
    that this project will go over budget. Furthermore, if the project proves to
    be a success, we intend to continue to fund additional implementations via
    crowdfunding.
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "$10,000 - Project Development - Development / implementation of an outreach plan and campaign to determine location and extent of implementation\r\n\r\n$5,000 - Data Analysis - Reporting of metrics\r\n\r\n$500 - Promotional materials\r\n\r\n$800 - $1900 Each implementation\r\n    --- Paint - between $200 - $800 for a standard 44 foot wide intersection, depending on the type of paint used\r\n    --- Hardware needed to measure pedestrian activity - ~$600 per intersection\r\n    --- Ongoing service fee for use of pedestrian counting software $0 - $500 / month\r\n\r\n$5,000 - $10,000 - Staff time for continuing outreach, iteration, and shepherding of additional implementations."

  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "In the near term, all of our plazas will contain easily accessible information (both online and off) encouraging people to get involved and bring similar treatments to their own communities. We will partner with existing organizations such as LACBC, LA Walks, CicLAvia, Frogspot, and LA Más to develop a mailing list and curate an ecosystem of dialog with interested people.\r\n\r\nSimilar to what was done in Portland, we want to create a formalized process within the city so that neighborhoods across Los Angeles can initiate their own implementations and strengthen community in their neighborhoods. We’ll use the compelling data we collect to present the increased traffic safety, decreased crime, and increased pedestrian activity to the city, and work with local council members to make intersection repair fast and easy for any communities that want to try it."

      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "The most obvious hurdle will be getting the majority of people in a neighborhood to agree to altering their street. In order to grease the wheels, we plan to use an online voting system to choose our initial locations democratically, which will allow communities that really want to participate to come to us rather than us trying to force the project on a community that doesn’t want it.\r\n\r\nWorking with the city to get this type of project approved may also present a challenge, however, opt-in participation will eliminate most public opposition and give us a clear path to implementation. Progressive city council members like Jose Huizar’s office have expressed interest in such a project, and we’re confident we’d be able to work productively with local government to bring this project across the finish line.\r\n"

    answer: "Since the goal of this project is to strengthen community by encouraging residents to enjoy public streets in their neighborhoods, one of the best success metrics is simply the number of people active on a street throughout the day. Conveniently, New York company Placemeter recently released a technology that makes it easy to use streaming video to count pedestrian activity with 95% accuracy (manual pedestrian counts are usually only 75% accurate!). We’ve spoken with Placemeter about using their technology to gauge our success, and they agreed to work with us on an initial implementation.\r\n\r\nThroughout the life of the project, we will take measures to ensure that this type of data collection is a top priority. All data collected will be made available publicly, and we will use it ourselves to ensure that each implementation is as effective and successful as possible."

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "The City Repair Project in Portland pioneered this technique during the mid 90’s and has gotten significant recognition from the livable cities movement for it. 75% of survey respondents who live near the intersection of the first implementation reported experiencing increased communication amongst neighbors, decreased traffic speeds, and decreased crime. Books like Mike Lydon’s Tactical Urbanism praise intersection repair as a great way to create safer, more livable streets, and Mark Lakeman is regarded as something of a hero for championing the idea.\r\n\r\nIn Los Angeles, LADOT currently runs a program called People Street which fosters the creation of pedestrian-only plazas, parklets, and and bike corrals. These projects are complimentary, however, since the features are for pedestrians only and require expressly taking space away from vehicles, they are not easily created, and some residents are not in favor of them. Furthermore, the cost of creating and maintaining a pedestrian plaza is not justifiable in many smaller neighborhoods, despite the fact that those neighborhoods would greatly benefit from having them.\r\n\r\nThough we don’t like to think of creating livable streets as a competitive practice, we are unique in the way we plan to use programmatic data to maximize our success and the success of the project. This type of project has not been done before in Los Angeles, and coming into the scene with a project that is both informed by and even better than what has already been done in Portland will be a good source of publicity for Los Angeles as a player in the livable streets movement.\r\n\r\nAnd most importantly, given the density of incredibly talented artists living in Los Angeles, I'm confident the artwork we produce will blow away everyone elses!"

      Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on
      this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner
      receive?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Primary execution will be handled jointly by:\r\n- Stephen Corwin on behalf of Compiler LA (www.compiler.la)\r\n- Daveed Kapoor on behalf of Utopiad (utopiad.org)\r\n\r\nDaveed and Stephen will have equal authority over the use of the $100,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nSecondary partners:\r\nMike Kang of Redcar LTD\r\nMike is the owner of a collection of properties at 837 N Spring St, located immediately adjacent to the Gold Line Chinatown Station. He reached out to Daveed in 2014 looking to take steps toward transforming a portion of the area below the subway station into a plaza. Though he is not currently ready to execute a full, LADOT People Street Plaza, Mike feels that this type of treatment is a great first step toward making his properties better places for people, and is interested in partnering.\r\n\r\nLA Walks / Elysian 2050\r\nIn addition to this project, Daveed is spearheading a project of his own called Elysian Park Connections, which is developing creative ways to reconnect Elysian Park to its surrounding neighborhoods. One of the ideas coming out of that project is to create a walking route between Downtown LA and Dodger Stadium (it’s only one mile!) in order to encourage fans to try alternatives to driving into Elysian Park.\r\n\r\nTo compliment that idea, we have discussed partnering with LA Walks, a local organization that promotes walking in Los Angeles, in order to create a pseudo-official, pre-game walk to Dodger Stadium which would meet at a plaza created by this project. Ideally, this plaza would be the one created via the above partnership with Mike Kang due to the fact that it will be so close to the Gold Line Station, but any area in China Town would be suitable."

      How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you
      cover the additional costs?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      Depending on the cost of success on initial implementations, $100,000
      could pay for anywhere between 6 and 20 repaired intersections across the
      city. As the material costs for this project are minimal, it’s extremely
      unlikely that this project will go over budget. Furthermore, if the
      project proves to be a success, we intend to continue to fund additional
      implementations via crowdfunding.

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "In the near term, all of our plazas will contain easily accessible information (both online and off) encouraging people to get involved and bring similar treatments to their own communities. We will partner with existing organizations such as LACBC, LA Walks, CicLAvia, Frogspot, and LA Más to develop a mailing list and curate an ecosystem of dialog with interested people.\r\n\r\nSimilar to what was done in Portland, we want to create a formalized process within the city so that neighborhoods across Los Angeles can initiate their own implementations and strengthen community in their neighborhoods. We’ll use the compelling data we collect to present the increased traffic safety, decreased crime, and increased pedestrian activity to the city, and work with local council members to make intersection repair fast and easy for any communities that want to try it."
