'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  EARN’s vision for a healthier Los Angeles begins with building economic
  self-sufficiency and resiliency. Los Angeles residents face numerous financial
  challenges due to unstable incomes, poor credit history, and lack of access to
  savings. Despite their best efforts many families are struggling to get by. 
   
   Research shows that in the event of job loss, working class families have enough cash on-hand to survive just nine days of expenses. Without a savings safety net, nearly half of American households are just one paycheck away from financial disaster. Our research found that nearly 90% of families want to save, but most are not saving and don’t know how to begin. 
   
   EARN’s solution to this problem is to foster a lifelong savings habit that creates financial security and capital for residents of Los Angeles. Saving improves economic resiliency, allowing individuals to weather financial storms and invest in long-term dreams, such as getting an education or buying a home. The Pew Charitable Trust found that regularly saving is one of the three predictors of people achieving mobility out of the bottom 20% of the economy. 
   
   In partnership with the Magnolia Place Community Initiative, EARN will expand our online, matched savings program to provide Los Angeles families with the opportunity to start saving. EARN’s program promotes economic resiliency by teaching and incentivizing people to save and invest in themselves and their families. The program is simple. Clients link their own savings account to our online platform, set a personal savings goal, make deposits, and earn rewards. The program tracks behavior and rewards users for making $20 minimum deposits over consecutive months. 
   
   Our research shows that after program completion, 85% of participants are living within their means and 92% are prepared to handle financial emergencies (compared to only 42% prior to program enrollment). Additionally, 83% of our clients continue to save after incentives end, leading to increased economic opportunities for themselves and their families in the long-term. 
   
   EARN’s online savings program has the potential to be used by all qualified residents of Los Angeles who are making less than 80% of the Area Median Income, which is $68,300 for a family of four. During the grant period we propose to enroll at least 300 households. By 2050, Los Angeles will be a healthier place to live because all residents will have the savings to handle financial volatility.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  EARN attributes our previous success to our clients promoting and recommending
  EARN through their own personal networks (which speaks to the quality of our
  programs). As EARN expands beyond the San Francisco Bay Area and scales the
  number of people served by our savings program, our main challenge lies in
  recruiting new clients. To overcome this obstacle we are actively forming
  partnerships with Los Angeles based organizations to reach low-income
  Angelenos. We have already begun working with Magnolia Place Community
  Initiatives and related organizations to enroll their clients in EARN’s
  savings program with great success. EARN is also in the process of creating a
  comprehensive marketing campaign to increase awareness of our organization and
  to drive program sign-ups.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  EARN rigorously evaluates our savings products; over the course of the program
  we track our client’s financial security and spending and saving behaviors.
  Our ultimate goal is to improve economic self-sufficiency by helping our
  clients build savings. Therefore, we also evaluate our work by the impact it
  has on financial behavior in the long-term. Key indicators we assess are if
  program users: 
   
   o Demonstrate a regular pattern of saving and reach their savings goals.
   o Continue saving 6 months to a year after the program ends using a.) either a mainstream savings product or b.) an EARN goal-based account. 
   o Show an improvement in psychosocial behavior towards saving. For example: Being more prepared for financial emergencies and reporting more self-efficacy regarding their financial future. 
   
   Our goals are for: 
   o 300 LA households will enroll and deposit at least $20 a month.
   o 85% of participants will complete the program and 70% will consistently reach their monthly deposit goal.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  EARN is the only organization in the United States focused on building savings
  habits via a laddered online approach. Our market research revealed that one
  of the largest unmet needs for the low-income population was a basic,
  short-term savings product that focused on cultivating a saving pattern. We
  found that nearly 90% of families want to save, but most are not saving and
  don't know how to begin. EARN’s new online savings program was created to fill
  this gap by reaching underbanked individuals and guiding them through the
  savings process in order to build short-term savings. 
   
   We set accessible savings goals and program lengths to reach people who have never saved before. Many traditional savings organizations require participants to set aside large sums of money ($1,000+) over several years without making a withdrawal, and the funds saved can only be used for a specific asset. These large savings goals and the long length of the program were barriers for enrollment and scalability, leaving many households underserved. EARN is unique because we work to create a habit of saving, starting with smaller dollar amount for emergencies. Our clients identify the greatest value of the program to be their own changed behavior and attitudes about finance, leading us to believe that they will be able to continue saving for larger goals.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  The $100,000 grant award will be utilized by EARN to expand our existing
  partnership with the Magnolia Place Community Initiative. The initiative
  brings together over seventy organizations that achieve and sustain community
  health in the neighborhoods within the five hundred blocks of the Magnolia
  Catchment Area of Los Angeles. EARN collaborates with several of these
  organizations including LIFT LA, CABO (Center for Asset Building
  Opportunities) and JF LA to bring savings to their constituents. 
   
   EARN will use the grant award to enroll an additional 300 Los Angeles households in our savings program. EARN covers the complete cost of the program, which includes full customer service for users, marketing and outreach support, matched monetary rewards, and reporting and evaluation for partner organizations. Meanwhile, partner organizations are responsible for promoting the savings program to their clients. Partnerships are mutually beneficial because EARN reaches more underserved, underbanked households while partner organizations expand the services they deliver.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  EARN is dedicated to scaling impact through the use of technology. We have
  brought our savings programs online and are equipped to respond to the unique
  and varied needs of traditionally underserved individuals anywhere in the
  nation. The EARN savings program was specifically developed to focus on the
  transformative habit of saving, while being extremely cost efficient and
  highly scalable. By leveraging technology and using behavior-based rewards and
  incentives, our program has the potential to build a habit of saving in
  thousands of households in the United States. 
   
   The potential market for our savings program is huge. Almost half of Americans (40%) – 126 million people – are living on the edge of financial collapse with almost no savings. EARN intends to reach these individuals through direct marketing and by pursuing strategic partnerships with other organizations to offer EARN’s program to their low-income employees and clients. EARN has already established partnerships with twenty organizations, including four in Los Angeles. We are also pursuing sustainable earned revenue streams for businesses that want to offer the program as a benefit for their low to moderate income workers, allowing EARN to reach even more people. We currently have eight customers providing employees access to the EARN savings program. 
    
   Beyond this, EARN is working to scale the impact that our program can have on people’s lives. We are building out a comprehensive suite of savings products that our clients can use to reach more ambitious savings goals. After successfully saving for emergencies our clients will be able to start saving for their children’s education, a home, or even their own retirement. All new products will be based upon our existing technology infrastructure, powered by Intuit and Amazon Web Services. 
   
   EARN believes that providing the tools to save is one of the most effective ways to ensure resiliency and social-economic opportunity in our communities. We are determined to scale our success to reach people across America.
