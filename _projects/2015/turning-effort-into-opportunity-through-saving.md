How will your proposal improve the following “Live” metrics?:
  - Number of households below the self-sufficiency index
  - Percentage of LA communities that are resilient (Dream Metric)
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "EARN rigorously evaluates our savings products; over the course of the program we track our client’s financial security and spending and saving behaviors. Our ultimate goal is to improve economic self-sufficiency by helping our clients build savings. Therefore, we also evaluate our work by the impact it has on financial behavior in the long-term. Key indicators we assess are if program users: \r\n\r\no Demonstrate a regular pattern of saving and reach their savings goals.\r\no Continue saving 6 months to a year after the program ends using a.) either a mainstream savings product or b.) an EARN goal-based account. \r\no Show an improvement in psychosocial behavior towards saving. For example: Being more prepared for financial emergencies and reporting more self-efficacy regarding their financial future. \r\n\r\nOur goals are for: \r\no 300 LA households will enroll and deposit at least $20 a month.\r\no 85% of participants will complete the program and 70% will consistently reach their monthly deposit goal.\r\n"
