  Young Ethnographers: fostering youth development through the Promise Zone
  Survey
project_summary: >-
  The Los Angeles Promise Zone Initiative led by Mayor Eric Garcetti’s Office
  tests innovative ideas for neighborhood revitalization. This project will make
  LA the “best place to connect” by providing Promise Zone youth with a summer
  job as Young Ethnographers.  Over the course of 8 weeks next summer, they will
  engage their neighbors in an assessment of quality of life to guide
  decision-making within local government and measure how the Promise Zone is
  improving lives.

Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "The Los Angeles Promise Zone initiative led by the Mayor’s office tests innovative ideas for neighborhood revitalization. We connect sectors that typically work in silos, including education, housing, safety, economic development, and civic engagement. As such, it is the perfect vehicle to make LA the best place to connect. How? By engaging neighborhood youth as “Young Ethnographers” trained in civic engagement, community research and social justice. The Promise Zone Young Ethnographers will have leadership roles in connecting their neighbors, peers, and families with city government, while helping local government become more responsive to community hopes, dreams, and needs. \r\n\r\nThe Los Angeles Promise Zone (LAPZ) in Central Los Angeles is rich in cultural assets, but faces challenges related to urban poverty. Promise Zone communities include Hollywood, East Hollywood, Thai Town, Little Armenia, Koreatown and Pico Union/Westlake. 35% of LAPZ residents live in poverty, so these neighborhoods face related challenges like low educational attainment and high crime. At the same time, they offer a wealth of culture and history, with residents eager to contribute to their community’s transformation.\r\n\r\nThe LAPZ will make LA the best place to connect by providing Promise Zone youth with a summer job as Young Ethnographers to engage their neighbors in an assessment of quality of life to guide decision-making within local government and measure how the Promise Zone is improving lives. Young Ethnographers will collect first-hand accounts from PZ residents, businesses, and community leaders to prioritize their needs. They will connect residents with local government and promote a space for dialogue and participatory planning efforts to support the revitalization of the Promise Zone. \r\n\r\nWe will incorporate youth empowerment by introducing the cultural and political significance of the PZ’s diverse neighborhoods to our Young Ethnographers. By working in and learning more about the neighborhoods in which they live, each participant builds a layer of professional and personal investment. Youth that participate in this program are scholars, scientists, artists, athletes and activists in their own respect - full of untapped potential. LA2050 will unleash this potential by connecting youth to community-based work that will create long-term policy and advocacy solutions for our great city. "
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "LAPZ has designed the following project goals and outcomes to guide evaluation. These ensure we meet our overarching goal of connecting residents to local government to increase government responsiveness to community needs.\r\n \r\nProject Goals:\r\nCreate a Promise Zone leadership development and civic engagement program \r\nAssess residents’ attitudes about quality of life in their neighborhood and identify neighborhood needs\r\nDevelop policy and program recommendations for local government to implement\r\nDevelop a multi-lingual survey instrument and playbook used by communities across the region\r\n\r\nProject Outcomes:\r\nA high quality, unique summer training and employment experience for 29 young PZ residents\r\nA successful survey administration effort yielding at least 1,800  surveys\r\nA policy and program recommendation report based on the resident survey\r\nA replicable survey instrument\r\nA playbook of community development and youth empowerment best practices and strategies \r\n"
