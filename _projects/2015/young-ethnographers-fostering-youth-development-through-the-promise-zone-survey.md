  The Los Angeles Promise Zone Initiative led by Mayor Eric Garcetti’s Office
  tests innovative ideas for neighborhood revitalization. This project will make
  LA the “best place to connect” by providing Promise Zone youth with a summer
  job as Young Ethnographers. Over the course of 8 weeks next summer, they will
  engage their neighbors in an assessment of quality of life to guide
  decision-making within local government and measure how the Promise Zone is
  improving lives.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  The Los Angeles Promise Zone initiative led by the Mayor’s office tests
  innovative ideas for neighborhood revitalization. We connect sectors that
  typically work in silos, including education, housing, safety, economic
  development, and civic engagement. As such, it is the perfect vehicle to make
  LA the best place to connect. How? By engaging neighborhood youth as “Young
  Ethnographers” trained in civic engagement, community research and social
  justice. The Promise Zone Young Ethnographers will have leadership roles in
  connecting their neighbors, peers, and families with city government, while
  helping local government become more responsive to community hopes, dreams,
  and needs. 
   
   The Los Angeles Promise Zone (LAPZ) in Central Los Angeles is rich in cultural assets, but faces challenges related to urban poverty. Promise Zone communities include Hollywood, East Hollywood, Thai Town, Little Armenia, Koreatown and Pico Union/Westlake. 35% of LAPZ residents live in poverty, so these neighborhoods face related challenges like low educational attainment and high crime. At the same time, they offer a wealth of culture and history, with residents eager to contribute to their community’s transformation.
   
   The LAPZ will make LA the best place to connect by providing Promise Zone youth with a summer job as Young Ethnographers to engage their neighbors in an assessment of quality of life to guide decision-making within local government and measure how the Promise Zone is improving lives. Young Ethnographers will collect first-hand accounts from PZ residents, businesses, and community leaders to prioritize their needs. They will connect residents with local government and promote a space for dialogue and participatory planning efforts to support the revitalization of the Promise Zone. 
   
   We will incorporate youth empowerment by introducing the cultural and political significance of the PZ’s diverse neighborhoods to our Young Ethnographers. By working in and learning more about the neighborhoods in which they live, each participant builds a layer of professional and personal investment. Youth that participate in this program are scholars, scientists, artists, athletes and activists in their own respect - full of untapped potential. LA2050 will unleash this potential by connecting youth to community-based work that will create long-term policy and advocacy solutions for our great city.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  The Promise Zone encompasses many neighborhoods rich in racial, cultural and
  linguistic diversity. As LA2050’s research shows, 57% of LA residents speak
  languages other than English, more than double the figure for our nation as a
  whole. Our community survey is meant to be inclusive of and accessible to all
  Promise Zone residents regardless of primary language spoken, and we recognize
  that conducting surveys in English, Spanish, Thai, Korean and Armenian may
  prove to be a challenge. However, we hope to overcome this challenge by
  relying on our extensive Promise Zone partnership of 50+ multi-cultural
  organizations, service providers, and community leaders that are already
  affiliated with Promise Zone work. We will both rely on this network of
  partners and strategically hire youth from these cultures to accommodate our
  diverse neighborhoods and linguistic needs.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  LAPZ has designed the following project goals and outcomes to guide
  evaluation. These ensure we meet our overarching goal of connecting residents
  to local government to increase government responsiveness to community needs.
    
   Project Goals:
   Create a Promise Zone leadership development and civic engagement program 
   Assess residents’ attitudes about quality of life in their neighborhood and identify neighborhood needs
   Develop policy and program recommendations for local government to implement
   Develop a multi-lingual survey instrument and playbook used by communities across the region
   
   Project Outcomes:
   A high quality, unique summer training and employment experience for 29 young PZ residents
   A successful survey administration effort yielding at least 1,800 surveys
   A policy and program recommendation report based on the resident survey
   A replicable survey instrument
   A playbook of community development and youth empowerment best practices and strategies
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Survey administration is one of the most common forms of collecting
  information, but direct, face-to-face survey administration is not used as
  frequently, because it is labor intensive. The irony is that from a civic
  engagement perspective, nothing beats neighbors talking to neighbors about
  what their concerns and aspirations are. This is one way that our project is
  unique compared to other neighborhood assessments. Our work will build on the
  foundation laid by several earlier efforts, such as the Northeast LA
  Riverfront Collaborative (2014), Watts Community Studio (2013), and Hollywood
  Community Studio (2009-2012). While each of these earlier efforts engaged
  youth in survey administration to some degree, our project is unique in
  several ways.
   
   “Young Ethnographers” will be a key element of Promise Zone Partnership activities in 2016. The Promise Zone is President Obama’s signature anti-poverty initiative to transform neighborhoods and LA was selected as one of the first five Promise Zones in the entire country. It offers extensive public and private partnerships and serves as a platform to scale successful models like Youth Ethnographers, not only throughout the City but also nationally. 
   
   Young Ethnographers is framework for empowering youth to connect with their neighbors, and for communities to connect to local government. The project is designed to be an 8-week summer institute of 25 hours of training in civic engagement, and 95 hours of paid work experience. They will learn to engage their neighbors in survey administration, and will then gain valuable skills in data preparation and analysis, leading to a tangible quality of life report to guide policymakers in prioritizing community needs. Throughout 8 weeks, the Young Ethnographers will develop college and career skills like critical thinking, communication, and research. Another unique feature of our project is that we will place Young Ethnographers in their own neighborhood for Promise Zone surveys so it is truly connecting neighbors with neighbors.
   
   Young Ethnographers will be led by a Principal Investigator, a PhD student from a program such as the Sol Price Center for Social Innovation at USC. The Promise Zone team of five AmeriCorps VISTAs will support the project, and we will recruit five college students to serve as “team captains” and mentors to the Young Ethnographers.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  The Promise Zone Partnership includes over 50 public and private sector
  agencies and organizations working in concert to build healthy neighborhoods
  and empower families in a federally designated zone within Central Los
  Angeles. The City of Los Angeles is the lead agency that oversees the
  initiative with the Youth Policy Institute as our lead implementation partner.
  One of the principal aims of the initiative is to break down silos between
  city departments and between service providers in the Promise Zone in order to
  work collaboratively to achieve Promise Zone Goals. To this end, we will
  engage multiple City departments, including Economic and Workforce Development
  Department, Recreation and Parks, and the Library system. In addition, the
  members of the PZ Partnership also lend support, such as our network of
  nonprofit service providers, LAPZ High School Principals, affordable housing
  developers and faith-based organizations. These partners will help ensure
  Young Ethnographers access a broad swath of Promise Zone residents, while also
  teaching Ethnographers about the rich history and culture of Promise Zone
  neighborhoods. 
   
   We will use the City’s existing Summer Youth Employment program as the administrative framework for the Young Ethnographers project. Our PZ partners, such as the Youth Policy Institute (YPI), Heart of Los Angeles, Artworx, Bresee Foundation, and Hollywood Boys and Girls Club, among others, as well as high school teachers and principals will help identify young leaders who would benefit from, and appreciate the unique training and work experience offered by this project. City facilities, like libraries and Recreation Centers will act as project hubs in the field during the survey administration period.
   
   The grant award will be invested entirely in the human capital that is needed to mount a successful youth empowerment and grassroots survey administration project. More than half will be invested in our youth survey teams; the balance supporting technical, research and writing support.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  Young Ethnographers has been designed to ensure that the entire grant award is
  dedicated to summer youth development/resident survey administration
  activities. Ongoing administrative and project management costs of
  approximately $22,000 will be absorbed by the project sponsor, the Mayor’s
  Office. Leveraging scarce city and federal resources with this private sector
  investment, we can accomplish bold innovation in the City’s engagement and
  responsiveness to residents needs and concerns.
   
   LA2050 support is critical to this effort. While the Promise Zone comes with national recognition, it does not come with any direct funding. The lack of resources makes it extremely difficult to implement youth empowerment projects or to engage residents in a community assessment. This assessment is key in connecting local government to residents, and ensuring policymakers are responsive to community dreams and needs.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  We propose the following budget for the LA2050 challenge grant award:
   
   A principal investigator to supervise survey administration, analysis and documentation - $15,000
   
   Five team captains, local college students, to act as team leaders for the survey effort - $15,000
   
   24 junior and senior high school students (summer youth employment program participants) - $48,000
   
   Gear and Provisions, such as tee-shirts, water, snacks, clipboards, paper, etc. - $1,000
   
   Report production - $4,000
   
   Playbook, funding for professional writing, graphic design - $15,000
   
   Contingency, in the event of unforeseen expenses - $2,000
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  The success of the Young Ethnographers project will be scaled in two ways. As
  a nationally recognized initiative, the Promise Zone offers a platform to
  share best practices throughout the City and across the country. Our hope is
  that Promise Zones throughout the US, as well as other communities, can take
  our model of youth civic engagement and empowerment to address the critical
  need to better connect residents to local government. We will share the survey
  instrument, training manuals and other materials, and overall framework on the
  Promise Zone website so this model can be scaled.
    
   Ultimately, LAPZ takes a multi-cultural and holistic approach in connecting LA’s most disconnected youth through a place-based approach that will be further supported by the very data that our Young Ethnographers help to collect. Youth recruited for these positions will be largely high school juniors and seniors, including homeless, foster, and/or juvenile justice-involved youth. Providing access to employment opportunities like these is a critical first step in a young person’s journey towards long-term financial empowerment and stability. 
   
   Youth who participate in this program are scholars, scientists, artists, athletes and activists in their own respect -- full of untapped potential. Funding from LA2050 will allow us to unleash this potential by connecting youth to meaningful community-based work that will create long-term policy and advocacy solutions for our great city. The efforts of Young Ethnographers will be scaled as policymakers use their assessment results and solutions to guide decision making. 
   The project will be further scaled as we send our Young Ethnographers off to college and careers, with the hope that they can apply what they learned over the course of this project. 
   
   Our proposal envisions the survey component to be a key deliverable in the form of a multi-lingual playbook that outlines strategies and best practices for community development that can be scaled and deployed to other regions of LA County. Identifying the Promise Zone’s next generation of leaders and change agents and delivering the promise of a Los Angeles as a functioning, well-run city that works with and for all Angelenos.
