title: Every Kid in a Park in Los Angeles
project_summary: >-
  Every Kid in a Park Los Angeles will provide transportation grants to local
  partners to bring at least 8,000 fourth-grade students from Los Angeles to
  nearby national parks. The project will focus particularly on underserved
  students from federally designated Title I schools. The initiative also
  includes pre- and post-visit educational opportunities. Providing greater
  access to parks and connecting diverse youth to new recreational and
  educational opportunities are major program goals.

Where will you be working?:
  - County of Los Angeles
  - LAUSD
How do you plan to use these resources to make change?:
  - Implement a pilot or new project
How will your proposal improve the following “Play” metrics?:
  - Access to open space and park facilities
Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to play.: "The Every Kid in a Park Initiative in Los Angeles will make LA the best place to play by providing at least 8,000 fourth graders in Los Angeles with meaningful experiences in local national parks. The project will serve local students, particularly from federally designated Title I schools. These students are often the least likely to have an opportunity to visit national parks and benefit from their recreational resources on their own. We believe transportation grants are one of the best ways to ensure that underserved kids and their families can enjoy recreational and educational activities in our national parks.\r\n\r\n"
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "The National Park Service uses formative and summative evaluation in its education and youth programs, and will adaptively manage Every Kid in a Park as the initiative gets under way. Every Kid in a Park in Los Angeles will benefit from broader evaluation conducted by the NPF and NPS. The evaluation strategy will:\r\n•\tIdentify a baseline of our target audiences (youth, families, and teachers) perceptions, attitudes and use of NPS and its resources; those of overall park audiences; and those of the nation (looking at similar programs and resources for relevant lessons learned). \r\n•\tInform the decision-making processes of program managers and administrators regarding the development, implementation, adaptation and improvement of the program. \r\n•\tProvide accountability and document the value and results of the program to stakeholders.\r\n"
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
  - Money (financial capital)
  - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
  - Community outreach
