  Working in Boyle Heights, Watts, & Inglewood, IHADLA strives to break the
  cycle of poverty by sponsoring entire grade levels of 3rd graders from
  under-performing schools in low-income areas, providing them with the only
  long-term, comprehensive program of its kind in Los Angeles. For 10 years,
  “Dreamers” attend our in-school, after-school & summer programs that prepare
  them for academic & emotional success; each student is eligible for an $8,000
  scholarship from us upon completing high school.

  Currently working with 65 third graders in Boyle Heights, 70 sixth graders in
  Watts, 120 ninth and tenth graders in Inglewood, and continuing to provide
  scholarships for 114 recent college graduates in Boyle Heights, IHADLA
  specifically chooses different program sites throughout Los Angeles so that we
  make the most impact possible across the county. By providing IHADLA’s unique
  programming to those children with the greatest needs, we are dramatically
  increasing their opportunity to succeed. Our Dreamers already contend with
  substandard living conditions, nutrition, and educational facilities, and
  IHADLA aims to fill these gaps and beyond with the understanding that a better
  life for these children means a better life for us all. It is our hope that,
  with the support of our comprehensive long-term program, our Dreamers will be
  able to raise not only themselves, but also their families, out of the cycle
  of poverty in which they have been living. 
   
   High school dropouts are found to be four times more likely to be unemployed, three and a half times more likely to be arrested, and more than eight times as likely to go to prison as their peers who complete their education. The higher graduation rates, increased opportunities and healthier lifestyles that IHADLA is working to provide these young people mean that they are less likely to dropout and rely upon the public welfare system. By beginning to work with a group of at-risk young people when they are in the third grade, and staying with those same students all the way through high school graduation and into college, IHADLA has a profound impact as they foster a college-going mind-set and a desire to dream big from a young age. This impact is evidenced by the fact that our most recent graduates, high school class of 2013, had graduation rates a full 25% higher than their LAUSD peers!
   
   Most of all, by supporting IHADLA, citizens of Los Angeles are making an investment in the future of Los Angeles county. The future innovators of science, technology, social science, etc. are standing before us in Boyle Heights, Watts, and Inglewood. They have extraordinary potential. However, most of their parents never finished high school, and even fewer still know what it’s like to earn above the poverty line. Who, if not IHADLA, will lead these children towards their dreams? To turn our backs on them would be to turn our backs on our own community, our economy, and a better future for all Los Angelinos.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  This year brings the challenge of transitioning for all of our students. Our
  oldest Dreamers in Boyle Heights are navigating college while our Dreamers in
  Inglewood are starting high school and learning to balance academics,
  extra-curriculars, and college prep. In Watts, our Dreamers are beginning
  middle school, experiencing the hormonal changes of adolescence that often
  bring mood swings, social hardships , and mental health issues. Our newest 3rd
  grade Dreamers in Boyle Heights have just begun with us, and we are evaluating
  them for academic levels and mental health –we have identified numerous
  students high on the depression index and at least 15 students with a learning
  disability. To help our Dreamers through these difficult times, we are working
  to implement additional learning time and academic partners. We are also
  looking to increase mental health services, including partnering with
  counseling centers and employing our first full time MSW to be an advocate for
  Dreamers.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  To ensure we are providing the most valuable support to our Dreamers, we
  employ a professional outside evaluator, Dr. Beth Manke of CSU Long Beach, to
  conduct evaluations every year, with a major evaluation every two to three
  years. These evaluations track statistics on our Dreamers’ grades, attendance,
  involvement in crime and drugs, pregnancies, mental health and familial
  discord.
   
   Our Program Coordinators (PC’s) also play a vital role in evaluation, as they continuously monitor academic performance through report cards, assignment completion, test scores, and teacher relationships. All Program Coordinators also complete Monthly Reports that detail activities of the previous month, tracking achievements and areas of needed improvement to ensure the effectiveness of the program. Each summer, Program Coordinators also conduct a home visit with each Dreamer and their family to assess any needs or concerns, using a case management approach to ensure Dreamers are always fully supported.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There are many organizations in Los Angeles that provide after school programs
  and academic assistance. However, we at IHADLA consider ourselves to be
  unique, with no direct competition, because we offer the only long-term
  “whole-child” program for underserved youth in Los Angeles. By “whole-child”
  we mean that while we are an educational charity at our core, we believe that
  no child can achieve success if there are deeper issues, or existing
  circumstances beyond their control. As such, we not only support our Dreamers
  academically, but we are also bringing them cultural, socio-emotional, and
  career preparedness services, working to ensure that all aspects of the child
  and his/her life are nurtured. All of our services are provided 100% free of
  charge to our Dreamers and their families.
    
   Some of our students come from abusive homes, some have witnessed murder, some have already lost the only people they loved – and though they may be surviving, they are struggling for answers, and for guidance. The reality is that if IHADLA is able to intervene while these children are young, the chance to change their outlook on life and raise their awareness of opportunities available to them increases exponentially. Simply providing homework help is not enough, helping different children every year does not ensure change, and picking out the most gifted children is simply unfair. The entire group of children needs to be case-managed and encouraged, and they all need to know that they have a positive influence that they can always go to for support and guidance.
   
   To build trust is the ultimate challenge and cannot be achieved without daily interaction and guidance. Consistency is a luxury that most of our Dreamers have not experienced. That is why IHADLA must be long-term and diverse in its programming, and must be focused on all Dreamers completing high school and earning a college degree. We are creating real and permanent change in the most disadvantaged communities. While we see test improvements, lowering of depression scores, and other positive results over the life of our program, our work with these at-risk youth is not complete until they have gone on to college, having benefited from more than ten years with our program. There is no other organization that so comprehensively prepares its students for higher education and for raising themselves and their communities out of poverty.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  In order to provide the most effective programming, IHADLA partners with
  numerous community organizations in order to offer the highest level of
  service. While this grant is not being written in conjunction with another
  organization specifically, many of our partnerships do come at a cost to us.
  The following are our main partners this year. 
   - The Partnership for Los Angeles Schools, one of the largest urban turnaround programs in the country, who we first worked with at 99th Street Elementary in Watts. After seeing the impact achieved by working with Partnership, we made every effort to work with them going forward, and chose Sunrise Elementary in Boyle Heights (a Partnership school) for our newest program.
   - Common Threads, an after-school cooking program that teaches skills and empowers children to make healthy choices.
   - Girls on the Run, a non-profit dedicated to teaching girls life skills and self-confidence, culminating in a 5k race for all participants. This costs us $1,100/year at our Boyle Heights site, and is being provided at no cost in Watts thanks to funding received by Girls on the Run that they have graciously utilized with us.
   - Many of our Dreamers struggle with mental health, and so we contract with Amanacer Counseling and the Maple Center, who work with families and Dreamers referred to them by IHADLA. The Maple Center also provides training for IHADLA staff. While there is no cost to families, and working with Amanacer is free to us, the cost to work with and refer to the Maple Center is $25,000 a year.
   - We work with two USC MSW interns who support our Dreamers with socio-emotional development, and this is the first year we are blessed to have a full time MSW as our new Program Manager. We contract a USC Social Work professor at $9,000/year to oversee/train all three individuals.
   - We are incredibly fortunate to receive numerous Human Development Department students from CSU Long Beach as interns who help with data work, tutoring and other office and program tasks.
   - Through a relationship with one of our Board members, we are lucky to have numerous FBI agents and staff as mentors for our Dreamers.
   - Originally developed in Israel, the Perach program pairs a Dreamer with a university student for a program of tutoring and mentoring. There is no cost this year as are piloting the program with one mentor who is one of our MSW interns, but we are hoping to expand the program next year, which would cost $3,000 per year per mentor.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  We currently have five active programs running in the greater Los Angeles
  area. These include our newest program of 65 3rd graders at Sunrise Elementary
  School in Boyle Heights; 70 6th graders who begun with us at 99th Street
  Elementary School in Watts in the 3rd grade; 120 9th and 10th graders in
  Inglewood who are from two programs we sponsored in back to back years at
  Daniel Freeman Elementary School when they were respectively in the 1st grade;
  and 114 recent high school graduates who began with us in the 3rd grade at
  Murchison Elementary School in Boyle Heights and who we continue to support
  through scholarships. The cost to us to run all three of these programs for
  this year will be $691,988 – this does not include the cost of our Executive
  Office or Fundraising.
   
   In order to cover the costs of the additional $591,988, we will seek and renew funding from existing annual and multi-year foundation, individual and corporate donors, expanding our funding pipeline to include additional organizations and individuals. Diligent stewardship, creative cultivation and a strong marketing and social media presence will all assist us in reaching our goal. In addition, we will continue to hold a series of events, including our annual fundraiser, the Dreamer Dinner, which in addition to raising money through sponsorship and ticket sales, has proven to be an excellent way to cultivate new individual donors, paving the way for future donations. We will also hold a series of smaller fundraisers such as cultivation lunches, bingo nights, raffles, and holiday parties. Alongside our Executive Office staff, we are blessed with a strong board who will also assist with fundraising efforts including cultivation and contribution. 
   
   Also, due to the long-term nature of our programs, and the fact that the organization used to be a sponsorship model (something we shifted away from four years ago), we fundraised upfront and have investments for our two programs in Inglewood and our program in Watts. We are running down the restricted balances on these investments while continuing the fundraising needed to complete the ten year commitment we made to these programs and students. While we have large funding needs for all of our current programs, we are especially seeking funding for our newest program at Sunrise Elementary, as we have the greatest commitment to them, having pledged to work with them and support them through their 2025 high school graduation and on into college.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
  We would use this funding for all direct program expenses for our current
  programs this year, which would help immensely in getting us to our goal of
  funding a new program every other year.
   - $17,281 in program supplies
   - $23,550 in travel (i.e. transportation for field trips/college visits)
   - $10,370 in meals/food (this is healthy snacks for Dreamers every day, as well as breakfast/lunch for high school Dreamers at Saturday Academy & food on field trips)
   This totals $51,201, leaving a remainder of $48,799, which we would put towards salaries of direct program staff (6 full time Program Coordinators & 4 part time Program Assistants). Their salaries total $358,164, meaning that this gracious donation would allow us to fund just over 13% of their salaries. We see this to be a program cost, as they are our program – they are teachers, mentors, case managers, confidantes, & pillars of strength for our Dreamers for over 10 years, & they are the reason that our program is so effective.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Now in our 29th year of operation in the Los Angeles area, we have a
  successful track record of affecting change & making a positive impact. Of our
  most recent graduating class (Boyle Heights, class of 2013), 86% of our
  Dreamers graduated from high school, & of that, 96% went on to some form of
  higher education. This rate is approximately 25% higher than the average for
  LAUSD. It is our goal to be able to have this same impact, if not greater, on
  all of our current and future classes of Dreamers.
   
   By consistently increasing the classes we are able to sponsor, we also aim to make a sustainable impact on Los Angeles as a whole. We have seen first hand the positive effect one Dreamer can have on those around them, & so although we directly support hundreds of Dreamers, we indirectly support hundreds more who benefit from the effects of our program. Parents are able to attend workshops on financial planning & on how to support their children academically. Siblings & other students are always invited to join events & programs as space becomes available. The futures of many are altered for the better as Dreamers’ siblings & friends begin to see college as a real option after looking to our Dreamers as models.
   
   Having shifted approximately three years ago from a sponsorship model in which a major donor or private foundation typically would agree upfront to fund an entire program, we are now focused, as mentioned above, on a more traditional fundraising model across multiple income streams. As we build our fundraising strength, it is our goal to be able to offer our unique, comprehensive, invaluable programming to more & more students each year. With this in mind, we have a strategic goal of being able to sponsor a new class of third graders every other year, working in community clusters in an effort to bring about the most positive change possible. To this effect, we hope, in the near future, to be able to establish a resource center from which we could conduct all of our programming.
   
   We aim to achieve this growth by focusing on growing our fundraising & income as well as by increasing the community partners with whom we are able to work. By growing our marketing & brand awareness, ramping up our online presence, and making ourselves known throughout LA county, we hope to increase the number of people & organizations desiring to work with us in helping to make dreams come true as we aim to raise the disadvantaged youth we serve out of poverty.
