  LA Connects bridges the gap between allowing non-profits as well as companies
  search for like-minded volunteers, opportunities for giving, events and
  corporate matching fund opportunities. LA has one of the richest corporate
  volunteer communities in America. LA Connects taps into this vein by allowing
  both the non-profit community and corporate volunteering and community giving
  departments the experience of searching opportunities and events that match
  both of their specific needs.
