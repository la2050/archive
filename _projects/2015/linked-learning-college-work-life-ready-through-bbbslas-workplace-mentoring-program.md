  In a world that is becoming increasingly automated & online, one of the most
  radical & innovative things you can do is to return to the basics to unleash
  the potential in real human to human interaction. Most people can identify an
  adult from their childhood who served as their guide and "showed us the ropes"
  - a mentor. BBBSLA wants to connect our city's vulnerable youth to qualified
  mentors through our programs, which have been proven to measurably improve
  learning and academic outcomes.

  In 2014, BBBSLA achieved a 96% high school graduation rate and 94% of
  graduates are college bound in a cohort that is 100% youth of color from some
  of LA's most under-resourced regions. We know that nothing can serve as a
  substitute for the transformative impact of one-to-one mentoring in the life
  of a young Angeleno whose potential can be activated by a caring mentor.
   
   Ensuring the continued success of our youth depends increasingly on the availability of "linked learning" opportunities, which is education that encourages academic success while introducing work-based learning to help youth envision a school-to-career pipeline. BBBSLA's Workplace Mentoring Program links high school juniors and seniors to mentors in some of LA's most influential corporations. Students are transported from their high school's to their Workplace Program Sites to participate in a two hour session that begins with a facilitated session led by our BBBSLA team focused on college and career readiness, as well as life skills learning, and concludes with one-to-one time with their mentors. The program is more than a "career exploration day" as it spans an entire school year. 
   
   BBBSLA's Workplace Mentoring Program transforms our city into a "learning lab" for youth curated by professionals who want to help our young Angelenos see their own potential as well as the potential in our city. In this way, learning happens while helping Angelenos connect more deeply to each other and to where we work and live.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  BBBSLA is committed to ensuring that all youth have the opportunity to reach
  their full potential in life through mentoring, yet as our culture continues
  to move toward more digital and online administered learning and content, it
  can sometimes be difficult to make a case for the value of one-to-one,
  in-person mentoring. Despite this challenge, the results speak for themselves:
  for the past 4 years, BBBSLA has achieved a 95% high school graduation rate.
  This year, knowing that 94% of our graduates are college bound has revitalized
  our resolve and belief that mentoring is a proven strategy for achieving
  positive learning outcomes. 
   
   However, we know we can't do this alone. Partnerships are key in connecting our youth to the linked learning and mentoring opportunities that result in such dramatically positive and inspiring outcomes. BBBSLA will utilize the LA2050 Challenge to expand the ability for more youth to participate in our Workplace Programs with firms in key, high growth sectors
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  As the only national youth mentoring program with evidence-based outcomes, Big
  Brothers Big Sisters measures the impact for the majority of the Little
  Brothers and Little Sisters we serve through our Youth Outcomes Survey (YOS).
  Careful analysis of the survey results allows the agency to be accountable for
  each youth we serve and nurture their success. During the length of a match,
  our case management team utilizes the Strength of Relationship (SOR) survey to
  evaluate the development of the relationship between the Big and Little.
   
   Additionally, BBBSLA is currently tracking high school graduation rates and college admissions rates, which are broken down to detailed demographic information, including by each Service Planning Area (SPA) in Los Angeles County. This data allows us to see where we are having the most impact. In 2014, the largest share of our college bound students came from South Los Angeles and South Bay regions (SPA 6 & 8).
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  While there are numerous mentoring organizations, BBBSLA has served Los
  Angeles County since 1955 through our unique, professionally-supported
  mentoring programs and we continue to serve 1,500 youth and families annually
  - that's 1,500 young Angeleno's being connected to 1,500 caring, adult
  volunteers who are serving as their mentors. For 60 years, BBBSLA has
  continued to evolve our programs through innovative, forward-thinking
  strategies, such as our Workplace Mentoring Program, while maintaining our
  adherence to our time-honored one-to-one, in-person mentoring model, which has
  proven to be effective in not only helping youth achieve positive learning
  outcomes, but also support their psychosocial development in ways that
  measurably increase their self-confidence, educational aspirations, and their
  ability to achieve their goals of higher education or obtaining gainful
  employment. 
   
   We are currently working with CBS, Sony Pictures Entertainment, NFL Network, Union Bank, and Price Waterhouse Coopers, whose employees have experienced the impact this program has in the lives of youth and on their workplace as a way to tangibly see the power of partnerships, mentoring, and corporate social responsibility.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Our goal is to establish two new Workplace Mentoring Program sites, which cost
  $25,000 per site to open and operate for an academic year to serve up to 30
  youth and 30 adult volunteers per site. The partners will not directly receive
  funds, rather that funds will be used to operate our Workplace Mentoring
  Programs at their facilities.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 â€“ how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  Our goal is to open two new Workplace Mentoring Sites, which will cost $25,000
  per site that together will serve up to 60 new Workplace Mentoring matches.
  The remaining $50,000 will be used to provide the following services:
   1. College advising workshops & college campus visits for the Workplace Mentoring Program for up to 150 students.
   2. Case management support for the duration of their participation in the program, which is most often two years until they graduate high school and through college matriculation.
   3. Partnership cultivation to reach out to schools in LA's under-resourced regions to identify youth to participate in the program.
   
   Additional costs will be covered through corporate and foundation grants.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  $25,000 (1 of 2) New Workplace Mentoring Program Sites*
   $25,000 (2 of 2) New Workplace Mentoring Program Sites*
   $15,000 (3) College Advising Workshops for up to 200 youth
   $5,000 College campus visits for up to 200 youth (Logistics, supervision, transportation)
   
   *Includes on-site staff support; facilitation of on-site sessions; transportation of youth to and from work site, and supplies.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  For 60 years, BBBSLA has been growing our reach in Los Angeles and our goal is
  to increase the number of Workplace Mentoring Program sites throughout Los
  Angeles in key, high-growth sectors over the next decade. While we currently
  have 5 Workplace Mentoring Program sites, a LA2015 grant will help us grow to
  7 and in following years, we hope to continue adding to the number of program
  sites so that eventually, we will have every major LA-based company and
  industry represented. The goal of our LA2050 submission is to kickstart our
  growth so we can continue to scale the impact of our program to help make this
  unique, proven effective linked learning program to more of LA's youth.
