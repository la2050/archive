Where will you be working?:
  - County of Los Angeles
  - City of Los Angeles
  - Santa Clarita Valley
How do you plan to use these resources to make change?:
  - Engage residents and stakeholders
  - Implement a pilot or new project
  - Expand a pilot or a program
  - Mobilize for systems change
  - Advocate with policymakers and leaders
How will your proposal improve the following “Play” metrics?:
  - Access to open space and park facilities
  - Per capita crime rates
  - Percentage of residents that feel safe in their neighborhoods
  - Residents within 1⁄4 mile of a park (Dream Metric)
  - Number of residents with easy access to a “vibrant” park (Dream Metric)
  - Number of parks with intergenerational play opportunities (Dream Metric)
  - Number (and quality) of informal spaces for play (Dream Metric)
Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to play.: "What we can do to make LA the best place to play is provide a space and materials where people can vibrantly engage in play that stretches their abilities, gives them exercise, challenges their problem-solving skills, and encourages socialization.  \r\n\r\nAdventure Play is different than typical play spaces and activities because it is totally open-ended, player-led, multifaceted, believes in the concept of play-workers to support kids with or without parental supervision, and is adaptive to any culture and community.  One of the best things about adventure play is that it is ever evolving to the needs of the participants, as projects are created and destroyed, as materials come and go within the landscape, and interests and focus change.  \r\n\r\nWe will help kids get out of the home and back into the parks and playgrounds by giving them time and materials to explore their areas and meet and connect with neighbors.  It will help foster community by getting families and neighbors together creating safer neighborhoods for kids and adults alike.  The more people playing outdoors the safer it is.  \r\n\r\n\r\nOur play-work education program will continually support free play and its benefits by outfitting others with the ability to facilitate more free-play events in numerous communities and homes in L.A. County with the goal of improving the quality of life through play for all.  Adventure play supports implementing and engaging neighborhoods to claim spaces to play in which may be otherwise unused.  Many pop-up adventure playgrounds can restore empty or vacant lots into vibrant play spaces just by adding kids, loose parts and cardboard boxes.\r\n\r\nIn addition, our outreach for play will continue to look for places where we can help facilitate and expand play opportunities in LA County.  Our philosophy is that play is a human right, a social issue rather than only a parenting one.\r\n\r\nWith the support of this grant, the start-up of Eureka Villa will give LA County claim to the 7th Adventure Playground in the United States. Eureka Villa will also be one of the only locations in the US to develop regular play-work training program which will produce individuals skilled in the psychology of play and further the reach of our mission to make open-ended play a priority in children's lives.  At this point such programs exist primarily in Europe.  Eureka Villa will serve as a hub for play-work training in the western hemisphere.\r\n"
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Many of our goals will move forward at their own unique pace and we plan to implement a series of \"follow-ups\" to the areas we focus on increasing play space and camaraderie.  Due to our focus of supporting communities to develop their own play spaces organically we want to make sure we are not just passing through but a constant source of support for the communities to sustain a safer and playable neighborhood.\r\n\r\nBi-weekly team meetings:  Both our pop-ups and Adventure Playground teams will meet to discuss observations on how to best solve problems and make changes to our sites both temporary and permanent.  Discussion, observation, and reflection are essential to connect with each other and the playground participants in a meaningful assessment of their play needs."
