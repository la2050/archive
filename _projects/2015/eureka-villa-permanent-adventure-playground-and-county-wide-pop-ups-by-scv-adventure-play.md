project_summary: >-
  SCV Adventure Play is teaming up with Pop-up Adventure Play of the UK who will
  send an official play-worker to expand our pop-up adventure playgrounds into
  low income communities throughout LA County and help these areas cultivate
  their own play culture and spaces.  It will also further develop "Eureka
  Villa" a permanent adventure playground in Northern LA County as a destination
  for young people to play on a beautiful 2 acre wild space and serve as a
  training ground for future play-workers. 
Please specify below: Santa Clarita Valley
category: play
'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  What we can do to make LA the best place to play is provide a space and
  materials where people can vibrantly engage in play that stretches their
  abilities, gives them exercise, challenges their problem-solving skills, and
  encourages socialization. 
   
   Adventure Play is different than typical play spaces and activities because it is totally open-ended, player-led, multifaceted, believes in the concept of play-workers to support kids with or without parental supervision, and is adaptive to any culture and community. One of the best things about adventure play is that it is ever evolving to the needs of the participants, as projects are created and destroyed, as materials come and go within the landscape, and interests and focus change. 
   
   We will help kids get out of the home and back into the parks and playgrounds by giving them time and materials to explore their areas and meet and connect with neighbors. It will help foster community by getting families and neighbors together creating safer neighborhoods for kids and adults alike. The more people playing outdoors the safer it is. 
   
   
   Our play-work education program will continually support free play and its benefits by outfitting others with the ability to facilitate more free-play events in numerous communities and homes in L.A. County with the goal of improving the quality of life through play for all. Adventure play supports implementing and engaging neighborhoods to claim spaces to play in which may be otherwise unused. Many pop-up adventure playgrounds can restore empty or vacant lots into vibrant play spaces just by adding kids, loose parts and cardboard boxes.
   
   In addition, our outreach for play will continue to look for places where we can help facilitate and expand play opportunities in LA County. Our philosophy is that play is a human right, a social issue rather than only a parenting one.
   
   With the support of this grant, the start-up of Eureka Villa will give LA County claim to the 7th Adventure Playground in the United States. Eureka Villa will also be one of the only locations in the US to develop regular play-work training program which will produce individuals skilled in the psychology of play and further the reach of our mission to make open-ended play a priority in children's lives. At this point such programs exist primarily in Europe. Eureka Villa will serve as a hub for play-work training in the western hemisphere.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Offering Low or No-Cost Play Opportunities: We believe play is a human right.
  We do not think that money should decide who gets to join in on the fun, and
  we are committed to making sure poverty cannot dictate the well-being of our
  community. To appease this, we will need to operate on flow of income which
  may be little or infrequent and managed through a series of fundraisers, grant
  proposals, charity, and donations of time, materials, and other support. We
  will continue to build a strong community that can creatively navigate the ups
  and downs of capital, work with volunteers, and re-use loose parts as often as
  possible.
   
   Transportation to Eureka Villa: Because Val Verde is removed from the hustle and bustle it will be a big task to organize the transportation of non-locals to our site. To overcome this we hope to start locally and offer free visit days to all with hopes that as we grow we can begin solidifying field trip opportunities for schools throughout LA County.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Many of our goals will move forward at their own unique pace and we plan to
  implement a series of "follow-ups" to the areas we focus on increasing play
  space and camaraderie. Due to our focus of supporting communities to develop
  their own play spaces organically we want to make sure we are not just passing
  through but a constant source of support for the communities to sustain a
  safer and playable neighborhood.
   
   Bi-weekly team meetings: Both our pop-ups and Adventure Playground teams will meet to discuss observations on how to best solve problems and make changes to our sites both temporary and permanent. Discussion, observation, and reflection are essential to connect with each other and the playground participants in a meaningful assessment of their play needs.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Locally, there is to our knowledge only one other Adventure Playground in the
  LA area, and that is in Huntington Beach. It is operated on a seasonal basis,
  and is a low-cost park. One major difference from Huntington park is that we
  are committed to being open as often as possible year round. We also want to
  focus on the needs of our specific neighborhood, and offer after school
  programs and workshops to allow for maximum usage of the space. Huntington
  Beach has little to no online presence or outreach either, whereas we plan to
  replicate more permanent spaces for play and long term local community
  relationships and educational opportunities. 
   
   Conversely, there are also portable organizations such as Side Street Projects (headquarters in Pasadena), who offer woodworking and other arts-related classes that can be done out of their bus in any neighborhood. They are also multi-generational, and we admire much of what they have done. Our pop-ups are less concerned with class-type learning and are more about providing a safe space where play is unrestricted and allowed to move at the speed and motivations of the participants. It is also a good time to illustrate to parents and others how free play can change the act of playing, by letting them focus on their projects and collaborations with no formal teaching. 
   
   Then there are other community arts organizations like our frequent collaborators The ArTree (headquarters in Valencia), an arts center that teaches classes on crafts, painting, sculpture, etc. to children. We differ from them because our method is not of a product-based instructional program, but totally focused on process, stress relief, and informal learning. The ArTree has a similar goal of inviting children to express themselves and offer inspiration through art but we take a different avenue to avoid pre-empting children of what they are expected to make and how they should make it. We also plan to offer our services not only to children but also adults in settings where they can be separate and or combined. With that though, our differences and common goals with the ArtTree allow our two groups to collaborate very fluidly, as they recognize the importance of play for children (and adults) and the creative problem solving encouraged through making and experimenting.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Our main collaborator with this project is Pop-up Adventure Play as part of
  their "Play Ranger" program where they send a qualified play-worker to
  impoverished areas to help bring play back into communities. Pop-up Adventure
  Play also has developed a play-work course which will be strongly utilized for
  our play-work training program. 
   
   We are also a founding member of the American Adventure Playground Association which is connecting Adventure Playgrounds across the US and have tremendous support and resources from those in various stages and types of adventure playgrounds, including permanent and traveling.
   
   We are already developing various workshops and collaborations with the nearest K-12 School, Santa Clarita Valley International. We have just finished our second year working with the City of Santa Clarita doing monthly pop-ups at their Thursdays on Main events. We have also held regular events at the local Earth Day Festivals, Day of the Child Festival put on by the College of the Canyons, and are continuously working with local arts organizations such as the ArtTree, SpotLight Arts, and Parenting groups. 
   
   We have collaborated with LA Parks and Recreation on the local level with great enthusiasm for future events. We also plan to identify operational areas to further expand possible partnering with the Parks and Recreation Department, Fish and Wildlife, Park Rangers, Child Life Agencies, and The Alliance for Childhood. 
   
   Funding from this grant will be used primarily for facilitation of our efforts and staffing. There will be cross-over with Pop-up Adventure Play for administering a play-work training program via staffing, communication, and on the ground development.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  Our project cost will greatly depend on the travel, size and duration of our
  events. Our pop-up model has little material cost (mostly duct tape) making
  its main expense staff salary. On average, we expect our two full-time
  play-workers to work around 40 hours a week training, facilitating 2 to 3
  pop-ups in LA County and 1 to 2 days of open play at Eureka Villa. This rounds
  out to about $4,000 per play-worker per month and $96,000.00 a year all
  together. 
   
   Other major costs include for the pop-ups; gas and a pop-up play trailer or vehicle, and insurance. These costs will range between $17,000 and $29,000. 
   
   Eureka Villa main costs include evaluating the 118 trees on the property, storage for the materials, portable toilet systems and a few supplemental materials which will need to be new and not used. We estimate it ranging between $5,000 and $17,000.
   
   We plan to focus much of the LA 2050 Grant funds toward non-salary expenses and those specific to pop-up outreach. For these expenses we are working with Pop-up Adventure Play for a bid on a Kellogg grant focusing on impoverished areas of the world. The Kellogg will also cover the costs of the assistant play-workers salary.

How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: |-
  We feel we have met our goals if the following is true: 
   
   If the communities we visit are still enjoying their public spaces this time next year. 
   
   If Eureka Villa is regularly opening its gates to the public and holding play sessions. 
   
   If kids are socially connecting with each other as well as neighbors in the community.
   
   If we are able to educate and or train other individuals for implementing open ended and or loose parts play.
   
   If families have found a new love in playing together.
   
   If a culture of respecting our young people's rights to play has been nourished.
   
   We continue to develop and support Los Angeles communities to become safer and more connected.

  - name: Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to play.
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "What we can do to make LA the best place to play is provide a space and materials where people can vibrantly engage in play that stretches their abilities, gives them exercise, challenges their problem-solving skills, and encourages socialization.  \r\n\r\nAdventure Play is different than typical play spaces and activities because it is totally open-ended, player-led, multifaceted, believes in the concept of play-workers to support kids with or without parental supervision, and is adaptive to any culture and community.  One of the best things about adventure play is that it is ever evolving to the needs of the participants, as projects are created and destroyed, as materials come and go within the landscape, and interests and focus change.  \r\n\r\nWe will help kids get out of the home and back into the parks and playgrounds by giving them time and materials to explore their areas and meet and connect with neighbors.  It will help foster community by getting families and neighbors together creating safer neighborhoods for kids and adults alike.  The more people playing outdoors the safer it is.  \r\n\r\n\r\nOur play-work education program will continually support free play and its benefits by outfitting others with the ability to facilitate more free-play events in numerous communities and homes in L.A. County with the goal of improving the quality of life through play for all.  Adventure play supports implementing and engaging neighborhoods to claim spaces to play in which may be otherwise unused.  Many pop-up adventure playgrounds can restore empty or vacant lots into vibrant play spaces just by adding kids, loose parts and cardboard boxes.\r\n\r\nIn addition, our outreach for play will continue to look for places where we can help facilitate and expand play opportunities in LA County.  Our philosophy is that play is a human right, a social issue rather than only a parenting one.\r\n\r\nWith the support of this grant, the start-up of Eureka Villa will give LA County claim to the 7th Adventure Playground in the United States. Eureka Villa will also be one of the only locations in the US to develop regular play-work training program which will produce individuals skilled in the psychology of play and further the reach of our mission to make open-ended play a priority in children's lives.  At this point such programs exist primarily in Europe.  Eureka Villa will serve as a hub for play-work training in the western hemisphere.\r\n"

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Offering Low or No-Cost Play Opportunities:  We believe play is a human right.  We do not think that money should decide who gets to join in on the fun, and we are committed to making sure poverty cannot dictate the well-being of our community.  To appease this, we will need to operate on flow of income which may be little or infrequent and managed through a series of fundraisers, grant proposals, charity, and donations of time, materials, and other support.  We will continue to build a strong community that can creatively navigate the ups and downs of capital, work with volunteers, and re-use loose parts as often as possible.\r\n\r\nTransportation to Eureka Villa:  Because Val Verde is removed from the hustle and bustle it will be a big task to organize the transportation of non-locals to our site.  To overcome this we hope to start locally and offer free visit days to all with hopes that as we grow we can begin solidifying field trip opportunities for schools throughout LA County."
  - name: Please explain how you will evaluate your work.
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Many of our goals will move forward at their own unique pace and we plan to implement a series of \"follow-ups\" to the areas we focus on increasing play space and camaraderie.  Due to our focus of supporting communities to develop their own play spaces organically we want to make sure we are not just passing through but a constant source of support for the communities to sustain a safer and playable neighborhood.\r\n\r\nBi-weekly team meetings:  Both our pop-ups and Adventure Playground teams will meet to discuss observations on how to best solve problems and make changes to our sites both temporary and permanent.  Discussion, observation, and reflection are essential to connect with each other and the playground participants in a meaningful assessment of their play needs."
  - name: >-
      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Locally, there is to our knowledge only one other Adventure Playground in the LA area, and that is in Huntington Beach.  It is operated on a seasonal basis, and is a low-cost park.  One major difference from Huntington park is that we are committed to being open as often as possible year round.  We also want to focus on the needs of our specific neighborhood, and offer after school programs and workshops to allow for maximum usage of the space.  Huntington Beach has little to no online presence or outreach either, whereas we plan to replicate more permanent spaces for play and long term local community relationships and educational opportunities.  \r\n\r\nConversely, there are also portable organizations such as Side Street Projects (headquarters in Pasadena), who offer woodworking and other arts-related classes that can be done out of their bus in any neighborhood.  They are also multi-generational, and we admire much of what they have done.  Our pop-ups are less concerned with class-type learning and are more about providing a safe space where play is unrestricted and allowed to move at the speed and motivations of the participants.  It is also a good time to illustrate to parents and others how free play can change the act of playing, by letting them focus on their projects and collaborations with no formal teaching.  \r\n\r\nThen there are other community arts organizations like our frequent collaborators The ArTree (headquarters in Valencia), an arts center that teaches classes on crafts, painting, sculpture, etc. to children.  We differ from them because our method is not of a product-based instructional program, but totally focused on process, stress relief, and informal learning.  The ArTree has a similar goal of inviting children to express themselves and offer inspiration through art but we take a different avenue to avoid pre-empting children of what they are expected to make and how they should make it.  We also plan to offer our services not only to children but also adults in settings where they can be separate and or combined.  With that though, our differences and common goals with the ArtTree allow our two groups to collaborate very fluidly, as they recognize the importance of play for children (and adults) and the creative problem solving encouraged through making and experimenting."

      Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on
      this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner
      receive?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Our main collaborator with this project is Pop-up Adventure Play as part of their \"Play Ranger\" program where they send a qualified play-worker to impoverished areas to help bring play back into communities.  Pop-up Adventure Play also has developed a play-work course which will be strongly utilized for our play-work training program.  \r\n\r\nWe are also a founding member of the American Adventure Playground Association which is connecting Adventure Playgrounds across the US and have tremendous support and resources from those in various stages and types of adventure playgrounds, including permanent and traveling.\r\n\r\nWe are already developing various workshops and collaborations with the nearest K-12 School, Santa Clarita Valley International.  We have just finished our second year working with the City of Santa Clarita doing monthly pop-ups at their Thursdays on Main events.  We have also held regular events at the local Earth Day Festivals, Day of the Child Festival put on by the College of the Canyons, and are continuously working with local arts organizations such as the ArtTree, SpotLight Arts, and Parenting groups.   \r\n\r\nWe have collaborated with LA Parks and Recreation on the local level with great enthusiasm for future events.  We also plan to identify operational areas to further expand possible partnering with the Parks and Recreation Department, Fish and Wildlife, Park Rangers, Child Life Agencies, and The Alliance for Childhood.  \r\n\r\nFunding from this grant will be used primarily for facilitation of our efforts and staffing.  There will be cross-over with Pop-up Adventure Play for administering a play-work training program via staffing, communication, and on the ground development."

      How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you
      cover the additional costs?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Our project cost will greatly depend on the travel, size and duration of our events.  Our pop-up model has little material cost (mostly duct tape) making its main expense staff salary.  On average, we expect our two full-time play-workers to work around 40 hours a week training, facilitating 2 to 3 pop-ups in LA County and 1 to 2 days of open play at Eureka Villa.  This rounds out to about $4,000 per play-worker per month and $96,000.00 a year all together.  \r\n\r\nOther major costs include for the pop-ups; gas and a pop-up play trailer or vehicle, and insurance.  These costs will range between $17,000 and $29,000.  \r\n\r\nEureka Villa main costs include evaluating the 118 trees on the property, storage for the materials, portable toilet systems and a few supplemental materials which will need to be new and not used.  We estimate it ranging between $5,000 and $17,000.\r\n\r\nWe plan to focus much of the LA 2050 Grant funds toward non-salary expenses and those specific to pop-up outreach.  For these expenses we are working with Pop-up Adventure Play for a bid on a Kellogg grant focusing on impoverished areas of the world.  The Kellogg will also cover the costs of the assistant play-workers salary.\r\n"
