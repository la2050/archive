  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "Through an innovative literacy program building on successes showing young people motivated by creative expression through script writing, Entertainment Industries Council (EIC) will address LA2050 Learn goal through the launch of Generation Next in high schools in L.A.\r\n \r\nEIC team will adapt its Generation Next college film school program for L.A. high schools. To provide added value, we will bring Writers Guild screenwriters and tech experts into select classrooms to teach about script writing, mentor them on literacy and conversational skills through writing dialog, and through a common theme in the scripts, focus their attention on how exciting science, tech and engineering fields are, and their importance to our daily lives. We will build writing skills while instilling a love of writing movies and TV shows like the ones they watch. There is no better place to be when it comes to screenwriting than L.A.\r\n \r\nStudents will then be invited to submit ideas for scripts featuring 1 or more key characters who are a scientist, engineer or technologist. A panel of writers and scientists will select at least one submitted project in each class to be developed by that student into a script. Each will be assigned an expert in the field to be portrayed and a professional writer to be a creative mentor through EIC’s relationship with the WGA Foundation. Finished scripts will compete for a cash prize that will be awarded at EIC’s annual SET Awards. The process of creation at the idea submission stage and at the script writing stage will not only nurture writing skills but also encourage an appreciation and love for the science, engineering and tech fields.\r\n \r\nResearch has shown that the bulk of future job growth will be in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM), making it vital that young people develop an excitement and interest in studies and careers in these fields. Unlike other literacy programs, students learn the key area of conversational English through dialog writing. Mentors will encourage students to stretch vocabulary skills and explore new ways to write. By focusing on a scientist, engineer and/or technologist, students will write dialogue for character from different backgrounds (since these will be schools struggling w/ performance), encouraging new language skills."

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    The major challenge will be getting teachers to agree to allow EIC to
    conduct the program in their classrooms. There are already many needs and
    goals competing for class time between core curricula lessons and
    standardized testing preparations. How does one ensure that this program
    will be how a teacher chooses to utilize valuable class time? One provides
    an incentive. In addition to providing the seminar and the opportunity for
    their students to win a cash prize, each teacher that follows through on
    conducting the program will receive a $500 gift card that can be used to
    purchase supplies for their classroom.
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Evaluation will include:\r\n-\tTracking the number of students reached in the 10 classrooms in which seminars are conducted.\r\n-\tTracking the number of script idea submissions from those 10 classrooms.\r\n-\tGrading the writing ability of participating students based on an existing school paper before the program and based on the script they write during the program, and comparing the grades.\r\n-\tStudent evaluations conducted by mentors of the students they worked with.\r\n-\tIdentifying any change in the number of participants planning to go to college before and after the program.\r\n-\tClass grade improvements for participating students as reported by teachers.\r\n-\tClassroom attitude improvements for participating students as reported by teachers.\r\n"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "There are organizations doing similar work to other EIC activities, but none of them do work similar to the Generation Next program. For example, Hollywood, Health and Society provides tech assistance to entertainment creators through a service patterned after EIC’s First Draft program but are not involved in classroom education. There are many STEM Education initiatives focused on encouraging students to develop science-related projects (robotics teams, science project fairs, etc.), but these do not use script writing to excite and instill interest in these topics. There are other organizations that focus on building literacy and writing skills in the classroom, however they do not use screenwriting as their written form.\r\n\r\nEIC is the only organization hailing from the entertainment industry itself that is involved in STEM Education on a substantive, ongoing and long-term basis. Existing EIC activities related to these topic areas include the annual SET Awards to honor TV and movies that have the potential to inspire young people to pursue studies and careers in these fields, and the First Draft technical resource service that provides access to scientists, engineers and technologists for entertainment creators to lend authenticity to their productions. EICnetwork.tv, the organization’s internet outlet, has a Science, Engineering and Technology channel that plays host to videos that promote STEM fields and STEM Education.\r\n\r\nYoung people experience more movies and TV than books during their formative years. They are therefore more likely to develop a love of writing by writing scripts rather than term papers, short stories or poetry.  EIC, through its partnership with the WGA Foundation, is the only organization that already has a program to help teach screenwriting that is readily adaptable, leading to a love of writing.\r\n\r\nBy adapting EIC’s existing Generation Next program for high school with a focus on the STEM fields, EIC can bring its successful process of teaching writing while using creativity to learn about health and social issues to bear upon STEM Education – an essential if L.A. is to remain competitive in the future economy. EIC will provide a unique program that will help to make Los Angeles both the best place to LEARN, by using professional writers who reside and work in close proximity, and the best place to CREATE because the environment that supports and employs screenwriters is right in our own backyard.\r\n"
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    EIC will partner with the WGA Foundation of the Writers Guild of America
    West. The WGA Foundation will work with EIC to help secure members of the
    Guild to support the program with volunteer time as judges, classroom
    speakers and creative mentors, and to promote the program to their members.
    The Foundation will receive $10,000 to cover its expense of labor and other
    costs to assist with the program. This will ensure that the screenwriters
    participating in this educational program are of the highest professional
    caliber – individuals who bring a wealth of real world experience in their
    craft to the process.
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': "To conduct the program will require $100,000. This initial investment will go heavily toward labor hours for developing the curriculum and materials, recruiting speakers for classroom seminars, engaging the appropriate school systems and schools to get permission to conduct the program, reaching out to and recruiting teachers to participate, and lining up judges, mentors and experts to participate in the Fellowship aspects of the program. The program will be piloted in 10 classrooms initially.\r\n\r\nOther direct costs will include: a seminar leader for the 10 classroom sessions, a subcontract with the WGA Foundation of the Writers Guild of America West to assist with writer volunteer recruitment and promotion, web site updates and materials design, gift cards to participating teachers for the purposes of classroom supplies, cash prizes for the student winner and runner-up, and basic operating costs for the project such as copying/printing, local mileage and parking for meetings and conducting seminars, telephone calls, office supplies, and postage and other deliveries.\r\n\r\nAfter a successful 10-room launch, with materials already developed, EIC will seek out additional funding to replicate the program and expand the number of classrooms in which it is conducted. The cost of conducting the ongoing program once launched will be significantly reduced because it will draw upon volunteer time from STEM field experts and members of the entertainment industry as speakers, judges, technical advisors and creative mentors.\r\n"
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Salaries (Project Director, Project Manager & Administrative Support): $46,850\r\n\r\nSeminar Leader (10 seminars x $500): $5,000\r\n\r\nWGA Foundation Subcontract: $10,000\r\n\r\nClassroom Supply Gift Cards (10 x $500): $5,000\r\n\r\nStudent Cash Prizes (winner, runner-up): $4,000\r\n\r\nCopying/Printing (Flyers, Packets): $1,000\r\n\r\nWebsite (Developing landing page, pages for downloading products): $2,000\r\n\r\nDesign (E-Newsletter and Outreach, Creation of Documents/Webinar): $2,000\r\n\r\nTelephone: $1,500\r\n\r\nOffice Supplies (Flash Drives, pens, materials for packets, etc.): $2,385\r\n\r\nPostage/Deliveries (items to high schools, mentors, judges): $700\r\n\r\nLocal Travel (mileage, parking): $800\r\n\r\nG&A: $18,765\r\n\r\nTOTAL: $100,000"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    We will scale the success of the proposal by measuring what proportion of
    students in each classroom at the grade level selected are becoming more
    proficient readers as the year progresses and comparing this to the students
    in other classrooms at that grade level at the same school who do not
    participate in the program.  Specifically, vocabulary and other indicators
    of literacy on standardized tests pre and post the program will be used to
    ascertain impact.  Outcomes can be used to develop a larger scale program
    for High Schools throughout Los Angeles, with the increased size dependent
    on podcasts and Skype modes of communication to allow for mentorship of many
    students.
