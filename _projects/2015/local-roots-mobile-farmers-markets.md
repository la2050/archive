title: Local Roots Mobile Farmers Markets
project_summary: >-
  We will use a mobile trailer to encase a solar powered controlled environment
  farm to create a “Mobile Market” capable of growing and distributing
  high-quality local produce to residents of low-income neighborhoods Los
  Angeles. This Mobile Market will be the first in a fleet focused on educating
  the public about healthy eating, eradicating food deserts, combating obesity,
  and providing increased healthy food access in low-income neighborhoods.

Where will you be working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - South LA
  - South Bay
  - County of Los Angeles
  - City of Los Angeles
  - LAUSD
How do you plan to use these resources to make change?:
  - Engage residents and stakeholders
  - Implement a pilot or new project
  - Advocate with policymakers and leaders
How will your proposal improve the following “Live” metrics?:
  - Access to healthy food
  - Obesity rates
  - Prevalence of adverse childhood experiences (Dream Metric)
  - Percentage of LA communities that are resilient (Dream Metric)
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Our primary metric for social impact will be measuring the number of pounds of produce distributed into food deserts throughout LA County. We will consider ourselves successful if we can distribute 20,000lbs of sustainable, locally-grown produce into LA food deserts during our first year of the Mobile Market program.\r\n \r\nSecond, we will quantify the green collar jobs we create and the tax dollars we return to LA County. We believe each Mobile Market will create one full-time job, two part-time jobs and a host of volunteer opportunities. Our staff will engage in community garden and educational outreach projects to teach children the merits of sustainable farming techniques and encourage nutritious eating habits. We hope to track the career paths of any students we inspire to a future in farming.\r\n \r\nFinally, we will use surveys to measure changes in public sentiment around indoor farming, the advantages of eating local, and the importance of fruits and vegetables in our daily diet."
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
  - Money (financial capital)
  - Volunteers/staff (human capital)
  - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
  - 'Infrastructure (building/space/vehicles, etc.)'
  - Education/training
