project_summary: >-
  We will use a mobile trailer to encase a solar powered controlled environment
  farm to create a “Mobile Market” capable of growing and distributing
  high-quality local produce to residents of low-income neighborhoods Los
  Angeles. This Mobile Market will be the first in a fleet focused on educating
  the public about healthy eating, eradicating food deserts, combating obesity,
  and providing increased healthy food access in low-income neighborhoods.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Local Roots’ Mission is to provide everyone access to fresh, healthy, and
  affordable locally-grown produce! We’ve spent the past two years designing and
  building cutting-edge vertical farms capable of growing produce 100x more
  efficiently than outdoor farms. In our LA-County headquarters, we grow
  top-quality produce 365 days per year using 90% less water than conventional
  farming and without ever using pesticides or herbicides.
    
   We believe access to sustainably-grown local produce should be universal, and we know that with the right technology and partnerships we can make it happen.
    
   So we want to take our farms out of the warehouse and onto the streets! We propose building our farms inside truck trailers designed to meet the unique needs of our Los Angeles communities. These Mobile Markets will make it possible to cultivate fresh produce right here in LA and deliver it directly to the low-income communities that need it the most.
    
   Each Mobile Market will be comprised of a 20’ solar-powered trailer capable of growing 500lbs of produce each week. This produce will be combined with produce donations from other local farmers and retailers to provide a consistent source of high-quality food into food deserts—areas without access to affordable, nutritious food that see higher rates of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Each day the Mobile Market will make regularly scheduled stops at low-income, food insecure communities and offer sustainably-grown local produce at affordable prices. The Mobile Market would accept all forms of payment including food assistance benefits.
    
   We envision our Mobile Markets becoming a focal point of the community, easily integrating where communities already gather such as recreational centers, schools, and/or existing markets.
    
   In addition, we see the Mobile Markets as an opportunity to provide educational resources on urban agriculture and sustainable vertical farming. Classroom visits from local schools would be welcome! And the Mobile Market would be a walk-in experience for all customers. We not only want to provide access to fresh produce, but also educate the public on how to prepare and cook delicious, healthy meals.
    
   By 2050, we believe sustainable vertical farms will be everywhere. Vacant lots will be transformed into living farms, abandoned buildings will be repurposed to create green-collar jobs in our communities, and our Mobile Market fleet will provide equal food access to all parts of the city!
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  We anticipate that zoning and permitting will be the most time intensive
  barrier to overcome – as a Mobile Market falls somewhere on the spectrum
  between a farm, a food truck, and a ‘visitors center.’ Our strategy to
  overcome this obstacle is first to partition the interior of the Mobile Market
  to clearly separate the ‘educational area’ (complete with videos on
  sustainable farming, a demonstrative crop and hydroponic system, etc.) from
  the ‘commercial farm’ portion. Second, we will work with the City of Los
  Angeles, the Department of Public Health, and California Department of Food &
  Agriculture to ensure we have their full support throughout the design and
  manufacturing process. Third, we will apply our current farm operating
  procedures to secure Good Agricultural Practice certifications and comply with
  the Food Safety Modernization Act. This will ensure our food safety is
  top-notch and we meet all regulatory standards for growing and distributing
  fresh produce.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Our primary metric for social impact will be measuring the number of pounds of
  produce distributed into food deserts throughout LA County. We will consider
  ourselves successful if we can distribute 20,000lbs of sustainable,
  locally-grown produce into LA food deserts during our first year of the Mobile
  Market program.
    
   Second, we will quantify the green collar jobs we create and the tax dollars we return to LA County. We believe each Mobile Market will create one full-time job, two part-time jobs and a host of volunteer opportunities. Our staff will engage in community garden and educational outreach projects to teach children the merits of sustainable farming techniques and encourage nutritious eating habits. We hope to track the career paths of any students we inspire to a future in farming.
    
   Finally, we will use surveys to measure changes in public sentiment around indoor farming, the advantages of eating local, and the importance of fruits and vegetables in our daily diet.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  To our knowledge, there are no organizations in LA with a Mobile Market that
  distributes sustainably-grown local produce to low-income communities. We
  instead look to examples such as the Arcadia Center for Sustainable Food &
  Agriculture in Washington DC as a self-sustaining mobile farmers market
  program focused on food access, education, and community engagement. As such,
  we know that similar models can be successful… and we won’t have any direct
  competition in LA.
    
   Our approach is novel in that our cutting-edge indoor farming technologies offer us a unique ability to place a farm on wheels and literally drive a farm into areas of LA that are not traditionally exposed to farms or an abundance of healthy foods. We enable consumers to connect directly with their food by seeing and experiencing sustainable agriculture first-hand. Further, the Mobile Markets eliminate all middlemen between ourselves and our consumers, enabling us to price our produce more affordably than retail stores and traditional farmers markets.
    
   We view our proposed Project as complementary to the many organizations in Los Angeles that share in our Mission and Vision.
    
   Ron Finley, the well-respected “Gangsta Gardener” of LA, has created an incredible community of urban gardeners and increased city-wide awareness about how underutilized land can be redeveloped to provide nourishment. We believe we can continue his work by further promoting the importance of urban agriculture.
    
   Farmscape helps design and build urban farm plots for LA County residents. They too do tremendous work growing and selling high quality fruits and vegetables hyper-locally, and we believe our Mobile Markets might be a great way to help them distribute their harvests.
    
   Food Forward rescues fresh local produce that would otherwise go to waste, connecting this abundance with people in need, and inspiring others to do the same. They recover excess fruits and vegetables, donating 100% to local direct-service agencies who feed LA’s most vulnerable. We believe our Mobile Markets could help to distribute their collected produce directly into food deserts.
    
   Finally, we have incredible respect for Robert Egger and his Team at L.A. Kitchen. We believe that their mantra of decreasing food waste while increasing community health and employment aligns perfectly with our vision. We would like to aid his efforts in job creation, food collection, and distribution of quality food products in Greater Los Angeles.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  We are portfolio members of the Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator (LACI). The
  shared incubator space and access to resources has already helped us expand
  our core business by innovating new controlled environment agriculture
  technologies. We are excited to use the lab equipment and prototyping tools in
  the soon-to-open La Kretz Innovation Campus, as these new facilities will
  expedite our Mobile Market design and manufacturing process. Because we are
  already a LACI portfolio company, no part of the grant funds will be required
  by LACI to formalize their support.
    
   We believe the LA Food Policy Council (LAFPC) could be an incredible partner for us in this endeavor. The LAFPC has set objectives to create a thriving good food economy for everyone, strengthened agricultural and environmental stewardship throughout the region, and better health and wellbeing of residents. The Mobile Market concept hits on all three of these objectives, so we believe we can leverage our technology to realize their Vision. We anticipate acquiring their full support as we roll the program out – perhaps helping us connect with local restaurateurs and providing us with additional public relations exposure to get our message out. We do not believe any part of the grant funds will need to be provided to the LAFPC.
    
   We anticipate that clearing regulatory hurdles to accept Food Stamps and other food assistance programs may also be time intensive. It is our intention to partner with California Certified Farmers Markets and the California Department of Social Services to preemptively ensure we have the infrastructure necessary to accept Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits.
    
   The other committed partners and collaborators on this Project are the same suppliers and manufacturers we use to build our current indoor farming facilities. All funds distributed to our manufacturers are outlined in the Project Budget below.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  We have no doubts that we can economically grow, source and distribute
  affordable locally-grown produce through our Mobile Markets. We have already
  demonstrated the economics in our non-mobile farms and believe that the
  manufacturing, farming, and distribution expertise we have developed will
  carry over exactly.
    
   We believe that this Project will cost approximately $98,900 to implement. Please see below for a detailed Project Budget and explanation of costs. The nice part about this Project is that we have great flexibility in design and build-out of the Mobile Market. If we determine that we underestimated our design and construction costs, we have the ability to modify the farm build-out and supplement production with additional produce sourced from other local farmers, retailers, and philanthropic partners.
    
   This Mobile Market will be the first of many! So it is very important that we stay on budget and prove it can operate at breakeven.
   
   We believe that each Mobile Market will be economically self-sustaining after its initial construction and promotion. For this reason, costs of goods sold (such as input costs for growing produce and gas for driving the Mobile Market) have been omitted.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
  Based on our previous experience designing, building, and operating
  controlled-environment farms, we believe the following accurately represents
  the budget required to implement this project.

How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  We see this Mobile Market as the first in a large fleet! Our Vision is to
  scale this to over 100 vehicles in LA County by 2050. The purpose of this
  project will be to demonstrate economic feasibility, work out operational
  hiccups, and show that the program can be self-sustaining. Once we have a
  proven model for combating food deserts, we will approach the City of Los
  Angeles, foundations such as the Goldhirsh Foundation, and other Impact
  Investors for further capital investments required to grow a fleet. As the
  Mobile Markets develop a track record of positive, predictable cash flows and
  proven payback periods, we believe we can also access debt financing to
  further scale the Mobile Market fleet. We also anticipate future opportunities
  to help other entrepreneurs and/or foundations leverage our farming
  technologies to replicate the model more quickly than we ourselves can scale.

    answer: "Local Roots’ Mission is to provide everyone access to fresh, healthy, and affordable locally-grown produce! We’ve spent the past two years designing and building cutting-edge vertical farms capable of growing produce 100x more efficiently than outdoor farms. In our LA-County headquarters, we grow top-quality produce 365 days per year using 90% less water than conventional farming and without ever using pesticides or herbicides.\r\n \r\nWe believe access to sustainably-grown local produce should be universal, and we know that with the right technology and partnerships we can make it happen.\r\n \r\nSo we want to take our farms out of the warehouse and onto the streets! We propose building our farms inside truck trailers designed to meet the unique needs of our Los Angeles communities. These Mobile Markets will make it possible to cultivate fresh produce right here in LA and deliver it directly to the low-income communities that need it the most.\r\n \r\nEach Mobile Market will be comprised of a 20’ solar-powered trailer capable of growing 500lbs of produce each week. This produce will be combined with produce donations from other local farmers and retailers to provide a consistent source of high-quality food into food deserts—areas without access to affordable, nutritious food that see higher rates of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Each day the Mobile Market will make regularly scheduled stops at low-income, food insecure communities and offer sustainably-grown local produce at affordable prices. The Mobile Market would accept all forms of payment including food assistance benefits.\r\n \r\nWe envision our Mobile Markets becoming a focal point of the community, easily integrating where communities already gather such as recreational centers, schools, and/or existing markets.\r\n \r\nIn addition, we see the Mobile Markets as an opportunity to provide educational resources on urban agriculture and sustainable vertical farming. Classroom visits from local schools would be welcome! And the Mobile Market would be a walk-in experience for all customers. We not only want to provide access to fresh produce, but also educate the public on how to prepare and cook delicious, healthy meals.\r\n \r\nBy 2050, we believe sustainable vertical farms will be everywhere. Vacant lots will be transformed into living farms, abandoned buildings will be repurposed to create green-collar jobs in our communities, and our Mobile Market fleet will provide equal food access to all parts of the city!"

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      We anticipate that zoning and permitting will be the most time intensive
      barrier to overcome – as a Mobile Market falls somewhere on the spectrum
      between a farm, a food truck, and a ‘visitors center.’ Our strategy to
      overcome this obstacle is first to partition the interior of the Mobile
      Market to clearly separate the ‘educational area’ (complete with videos on
      sustainable farming, a demonstrative crop and hydroponic system, etc.)
      from the ‘commercial farm’ portion. Second, we will work with the City of
      Los Angeles, the Department of Public Health, and California Department of
      Food & Agriculture to ensure we have their full support throughout the
      design and manufacturing process. Third, we will apply our current farm
      operating procedures to secure Good Agricultural Practice certifications
      and comply with the Food Safety Modernization Act. This will ensure our
      food safety is top-notch and we meet all regulatory standards for growing
      and distributing fresh produce.
  - name: Please explain how you will evaluate your work.
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Our primary metric for social impact will be measuring the number of pounds of produce distributed into food deserts throughout LA County. We will consider ourselves successful if we can distribute 20,000lbs of sustainable, locally-grown produce into LA food deserts during our first year of the Mobile Market program.\r\n \r\nSecond, we will quantify the green collar jobs we create and the tax dollars we return to LA County. We believe each Mobile Market will create one full-time job, two part-time jobs and a host of volunteer opportunities. Our staff will engage in community garden and educational outreach projects to teach children the merits of sustainable farming techniques and encourage nutritious eating habits. We hope to track the career paths of any students we inspire to a future in farming.\r\n \r\nFinally, we will use surveys to measure changes in public sentiment around indoor farming, the advantages of eating local, and the importance of fruits and vegetables in our daily diet."

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "To our knowledge, there are no organizations in LA with a Mobile Market that distributes sustainably-grown local produce to low-income communities. We instead look to examples such as the Arcadia Center for Sustainable Food & Agriculture in Washington DC as a self-sustaining mobile farmers market program focused on food access, education, and community engagement. As such, we know that similar models can be successful… and we won’t have any direct competition in LA.\r\n \r\nOur approach is novel in that our cutting-edge indoor farming technologies offer us a unique ability to place a farm on wheels and literally drive a farm into areas of LA that are not traditionally exposed to farms or an abundance of healthy foods. We enable consumers to connect directly with their food by seeing and experiencing sustainable agriculture first-hand. Further, the Mobile Markets eliminate all middlemen between ourselves and our consumers, enabling us to price our produce more affordably than retail stores and traditional farmers markets.\r\n \r\nWe view our proposed Project as complementary to the many organizations in Los Angeles that share in our Mission and Vision.\r\n \r\nRon Finley, the well-respected “Gangsta Gardener” of LA, has created an incredible community of urban gardeners and increased city-wide awareness about how underutilized land can be redeveloped to provide nourishment. We believe we can continue his work by further promoting the importance of urban agriculture.\r\n \r\nFarmscape helps design and build urban farm plots for LA County residents. They too do tremendous work growing and selling high quality fruits and vegetables hyper-locally, and we believe our Mobile Markets might be a great way to help them distribute their harvests.\r\n \r\nFood Forward rescues fresh local produce that would otherwise go to waste, connecting this abundance with people in need, and inspiring others to do the same. They recover excess fruits and vegetables, donating 100% to local direct-service agencies who feed LA’s most vulnerable. We believe our Mobile Markets could help to distribute their collected produce directly into food deserts.\r\n \r\nFinally, we have incredible respect for Robert Egger and his Team at L.A. Kitchen. We believe that their mantra of decreasing food waste while increasing community health and employment aligns perfectly with our vision. We would like to aid his efforts in job creation, food collection, and distribution of quality food products in Greater Los Angeles."

      Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on
      this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner
      receive?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "We are portfolio members of the Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator (LACI). The shared incubator space and access to resources has already helped us expand our core business by innovating new controlled environment agriculture technologies. We are excited to use the lab equipment and prototyping tools in the soon-to-open La Kretz Innovation Campus, as these new facilities will expedite our Mobile Market design and manufacturing process. Because we are already a LACI portfolio company, no part of the grant funds will be required by LACI to formalize their support.\r\n \r\nWe believe the LA Food Policy Council (LAFPC) could be an incredible partner for us in this endeavor. The LAFPC has set objectives to create a thriving good food economy for everyone, strengthened agricultural and environmental stewardship throughout the region, and better health and wellbeing of residents. The Mobile Market concept hits on all three of these objectives, so we believe we can leverage our technology to realize their Vision. We anticipate acquiring their full support as we roll the program out – perhaps helping us connect with local restaurateurs and providing us with additional public relations exposure to get our message out. We do not believe any part of the grant funds will need to be provided to the LAFPC.\r\n \r\nWe anticipate that clearing regulatory hurdles to accept Food Stamps and other food assistance programs may also be time intensive. It is our intention to partner with California Certified Farmers Markets and the California Department of Social Services to preemptively ensure we have the infrastructure necessary to accept Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits.\r\n \r\nThe other committed partners and collaborators on this Project are the same suppliers and manufacturers we use to build our current indoor farming facilities. All funds distributed to our manufacturers are outlined in the Project Budget below."

      How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you
      cover the additional costs?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "We have no doubts that we can economically grow, source and distribute affordable locally-grown produce through our Mobile Markets. We have already demonstrated the economics in our non-mobile farms and believe that the manufacturing, farming, and distribution expertise we have developed will carry over exactly.\r\n \r\nWe believe that this Project will cost approximately $98,900 to implement. Please see below for a detailed Project Budget and explanation of costs. The nice part about this Project is that we have great flexibility in design and build-out of the Mobile Market. If we determine that we underestimated our design and construction costs, we have the ability to modify the farm build-out and supplement production with additional produce sourced from other local farmers, retailers, and philanthropic partners.\r\n \r\nThis Mobile Market will be the first of many! So it is very important that we stay on budget and prove it can operate at breakeven.\r\n\r\nWe believe that each Mobile Market will be economically self-sustaining after its initial construction and promotion. For this reason, costs of goods sold (such as input costs for growing produce and gas for driving the Mobile Market) have been omitted."

      We see this Mobile Market as the first in a large fleet! Our Vision is to
      scale this to over 100 vehicles in LA County by 2050. The purpose of this
      project will be to demonstrate economic feasibility, work out operational
      hiccups, and show that the program can be self-sustaining. Once we have a
      proven model for combating food deserts, we will approach the City of Los
      Angeles, foundations such as the Goldhirsh Foundation, and other Impact
      Investors for further capital investments required to grow a fleet. As the
      Mobile Markets develop a track record of positive, predictable cash flows
      and proven payback periods, we believe we can also access debt financing
      to further scale the Mobile Market fleet. We also anticipate future
      opportunities to help other entrepreneurs and/or foundations leverage our
      farming technologies to replicate the model more quickly than we ourselves
      can scale.
