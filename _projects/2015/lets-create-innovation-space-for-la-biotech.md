    Lab Launch’s mission is to enable the scientists and entrepreneurs of Los
    Angeles to develop their ideas in affordable, high-quality lab facilities,
    with access to services and a supportive innovation community to accelerate
    their success.
  'In one to three sentences, please describe your proposal.': "Our goal, and our vision for the Los Angeles of 2050 is a vibrant network of affordable, accessible biotech incubators across the LA metro region, where life science innovators from any background can access the facilities and equipment they need to move their ideas forward. \r\n\r\nAt LabLaunch-Monrovia, we will provide high-quality laboratory space, state-of-the-art shared equipment, and a supportive innovation community, giving biotech startups a place to take root in Los Angeles."
  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: "Los Angeles is home to several world-class research universities, and thousands of talented young scientists. However, there is little entry-level business incubation space for biotech startups, and the few incubator facilities that exist for more mature, growth-stage companies are consistently at or near full capacity. As a result, many scientists and inventors from Los Angeles are moving to other areas that are perceived as more supportive, such as San Francisco and San Diego, to start their biotech businesses.\r\n\r\nLife science technologies are predicted to be among the leading growth industries of the 21st Century. Innovations in healthcare are leading the way to future generations of drugs and healthcare products that will treat illnesses earlier and more effectively, prolonging and increasing the quality of human health. New advances in bioenergy and biosynthesis promise to allow our society to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels by producing energy, pharmaceuticals, and other products without relying on chemical feedstocks. Biotechnology represents the best technological hope we have to effectively feed the 7 billion-plus people on Earth, and the larger generations to come. Los Angeles is also home to leaders in the new commercial space age – if they are to be successful in creating long-term human occupation of outer space, they will need many new life science technologies to be developed to keep humans fed, healthy, and safe for long periods away from the Earth.\r\n\r\nCreating an open, affordable space in Los Angeles for life science startups, along with business support and access to investors and advisors, is essential to reverse the current trend of young companies moving to San Francisco or San Diego to found their businesses. Our facility at LabLaunch-Monrovia will allow research discoveries from Los Angeles’ universities to stay in LA, grow into successful businesses, employ staff from the LA area, and lay down a strong foundation for the economy of the 21st Century. \r\n\r\nBy 2050, some of the early startups that were supported by our incubator will have grown into large, successful businesses, employing thousands of people across Los Angeles. The founders of these successful companies will become the next generation of investors, as they use the profits from their success to invest capital into new innovations. Through this new community, we will be able to anchor a self-perpetuating cycle of success and innovation in biotechnology for LA."

  Los Angeles is home to several world-class research universities, and
  thousands of talented young scientists. However, there is little entry-level
  business incubation space for biotech startups, and the few incubator
  facilities that exist for more mature, growth-stage companies are consistently
  at or near full capacity. As a result, many scientists and inventors from Los
  Angeles are moving to other areas that are perceived as more supportive, such
  as San Francisco and San Diego, to start their biotech businesses.
   
   Life science technologies are predicted to be among the leading growth industries of the 21st Century. Innovations in healthcare are leading the way to future generations of drugs and healthcare products that will treat illnesses earlier and more effectively, prolonging and increasing the quality of human health. New advances in bioenergy and biosynthesis promise to allow our society to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels by producing energy, pharmaceuticals, and other products without relying on chemical feedstocks. Biotechnology represents the best technological hope we have to effectively feed the 7 billion-plus people on Earth, and the larger generations to come. Los Angeles is also home to leaders in the new commercial space age – if they are to be successful in creating long-term human occupation of outer space, they will need many new life science technologies to be developed to keep humans fed, healthy, and safe for long periods away from the Earth.
   
   Creating an open, affordable space in Los Angeles for life science startups, along with business support and access to investors and advisors, is essential to reverse the current trend of young companies moving to San Francisco or San Diego to found their businesses. Our facility at LabLaunch-Monrovia will allow research discoveries from Los Angeles’ universities to stay in LA, grow into successful businesses, employ staff from the LA area, and lay down a strong foundation for the economy of the 21st Century. 
   
   By 2050, some of the early startups that were supported by our incubator will have grown into large, successful businesses, employing thousands of people across Los Angeles. The founders of these successful companies will become the next generation of investors, as they use the profits from their success to invest capital into new innovations. Through this new community, we will be able to anchor a self-perpetuating cycle of success and innovation in biotechnology for LA.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  A common roadblock to all business incubators is how the incubator can be
  self-sustaining, while offering high-level services to its residents.
  Businesses that have been successful in this space have overcome two key
  barriers: acquiring support from local government and developing strong links
  to an active investment community. 
   
   We plan to address both of these issues directly: building on our collaboration with the City of Monrovia, we will work with local cities and the County of Los Angeles to identify potential sites for incubator facilities and resolve any issues with zoning and construction that are necessary to this endeavor. We will work to identify areas of mutual interest with cities that prioritize high-tech business development. With our local partners, we will build a community of investors to support startups at LabLaunch-Monrovia. We will also investigate opportunities to partner with venture capital to accelerate the growth of our startup residents.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Our mission is focused on creating an environment that will foster the
  creation of high-growth startup businesses. Our metrics of success will
  therefore be focused on the number and success of our startup tenants, and the
  number of jobs they create in Los Angeles.
   Specifically, we aim to collect and measure the following metrics to evaluate our success:
   
   -Number of startups launched
   -Number of LA area jobs created by a) our facility b) our tenant startups
   -Total private investment in a) our facility b) our tenant startups
   -Total public funding (i.e. state/federal research grants) in a) our facility b) our tenant startups
   -Public valuation of companies that have graduated from our incubator
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  An early-stage biotech incubator would be a unique asset in Los Angeles.
  Similar entities already exist in the San Francisco Bay Area (QB3, Berkeley
  BioLabs, CounterCulture Labs, BioCurious) and San Diego (Bio,Tech and Beyond,
  J-Labs).
   
   In the LA area, we have one active incubator in Pasadena (Pasadena Bioscience Collaborative) that caters to growth-stage startups (i.e. companies that already have significant funding). Additionally, Pasadena Bioscience Collaborative is near capacity, so they have limited space to serve new startups. We are also working with LA Biohackers, a citizen science group. LA Biohackers maintains a small coworking lab in DTLA, but does not have the facilities necessary to commercialize their innovations. A facility such as we are proposing would be necessary for their members to take the next step in turning a discovery into a product that investors would be willing to help develop.
   
   A biotech incubator that focuses on early-stage companies, with coworking space and shared equipment, fills a gap that exists between the work of academic and citizen scientists in LA, and the availability of space and funding to commercialize their ideas.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  The following groups/businesses are confirmed as partners in this project and
  have committed to provide no cost advice and support for our efforts as
  follows:
   
   City of Monrovia - We recently agreed to a partnership with the City of Monrovia, whereby LabLaunch-Monrovia will create an internship program to allow advanced high school students the opportunity to experience life in a real biotech business environment and develop practical skills early on in their careers. Additionally, we will be organizing “Monrovia Biotech Day” to promote biotech advancement to the broader community of the San Gabriel Valley and encourage more innovators to turn their ideas into new products and technologies.
   
   MADIAtech - MADIA Tech Launch is a career, company, and industry incubator, established as a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation and providing educational services to the region's technical, scientific, and industrial workforce. This region includes Monrovia, Arcadia, Duarte, Irwindale, Azusa, and surrounding areas. They offer educational programs including, but not limited to, entrepreneurship, business finance and operations, and technology development and commercialization.
   
   Southern California Biomedical Council (SoCalBio) – This trade association for life sciences in Southern California will provide the startups launched through our incubator with access to investors and professional services. Their regular investor events will provide a venue for our resident companies to pitch their businesses, raise capital, and network with other industry professionals. The development of an incubator with coworking and open meeting space will provide groups such as SoCalBio with a dedicated place to hold meetings and events for the biotech industry and its investors.
   
   Pasadena Bioscience Collaborative – This life science incubator in Pasadena currently supports 18 companies. Their constituency and goals are sufficiently different from ours that the two organizations benefit, rather than compete with one another. The PBC will offer experienced advice about running a life science incubator and access to an existing base of investors and supporters of the life sciences industry from the San Gabriel Valley. Our project will be mutually beneficial by expanding available space for startups, providing a link between the LA Basin and San Gabriel Valley biotech communities, and enhancing the connections between innovators and investors across the LA region.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Our vision for 2050 is a vibrant network of affordable, accessible biotech
  incubators across the LA region, where life science innovators from any
  background can access the facilities and equipment they need to move their
  ideas forward. 
   
   LabLaunch-Monrovia represents the prototypical example of the support we plan to build for the biotech innovators of Los Angeles. Following completion of LabLaunch-Monrovia, we plan to create another 4-5 similar facilities, serving areas across LA County to ensure that all life science entrepreneurs have an affordable and accessible place to start their business. In partnership with the cities and County of Los Angeles, as well as our private sector partners, we will identify suitable locations and create facilities tailored to the needs and existing assets of the local areas.
   
   Once businesses have found a place to start up and develop their technologies through a Lab Launch incubator, they will soon need both larger facilities to accommodate their continued growth, as well as funding to commercialize and scale their products. With our partners in the public and private sectors, we intend to create a network of innovation spaces that will serve growing biotech companies until they are successful enough to become stand-alone operations. Examples include scalable facilities where growing companies can rent individual research and development suites, as well as facilities to accommodate commercial business acceleration programs that can help move startups to the marketplace more efficiently. Additionally, we will partner with investors and venture capital to create dedicated biotech investment fund opportunities that will provide financial support to promising startups that use our facilities. 
   
   We believe that the path to a prosperous and thriving economy for the 21st Century is through supporting innovative new businesses that will create the technologies of tomorrow. By enabling these groundbreaking companies to start up, grow and thrive here, they will in turn create thousands of quality jobs across the region, supporting a thriving middle class for the Los Angeles area of 2050.
