title: Turning Out Voters Through Local Relationships
project_summary: >-
  LA will not solve its problem of racial inequity without greater civic
  participation. Voter turnout is at a historic low, and LA Voice has a plan to
  turn that around. Barriers to voting can be overcome by leaders from diverse
  faith backgrounds investing in local relationships to increase participation.
  When LA Voice leaders turn out all 40,000 people represented by our 36 diverse
  congregations-- AND their neighbors--it will shift the electorate towards a
  more representative, inclusive county.

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "Los Angeles remains segregated not just geographically, but by civic participation. We have one of the lowest voter turnout rates in the country. The most recent local election in May of 2015 saw an abysmal 8% turnout, and turnout in low-income communities and communities of color was even lower. But LA Voice has a plan to bring people together across race, class, and faith to reverse LA’s low voter turnout-- not just in this election, but for years to come. \r\nThe traditional voter turnout tactics used by most campaigns don’t work in low income communities and communities of color. What does work is local, trusted community leaders working to turn out their neighbors. To build a truly representative LA electorate, we need to “meet people where they are”, and for these communities that often means their church, mosque, or synagogue. LA Voice, with our 36 member congregations representing 40,000 families in LA County, is uniquely poised to turn out votes for the Fall 2016 elections. In 2014, LA Voice trained over 500 volunteer leaders to talk to 36,081 low-propensity voters, mostly voters of color, and our contacted voters voted at a 7% higher rate than the County average; now, we have a plan that will engage even more leaders to turn out even more voters in a more strategic way.\r\nOur plan is based on three principles:\r\nLeader ownership: LA Voice leaders, not staff, will own this work. Leaders will commit to registering and turning out their congregations plus 5-7 precincts in the vicinity, guaranteeing that every eligible voter will be contacted by a trusted local leader. Leaders will turn out their congregations through non-partisan preaching and teaching about voter engagement, voter registration drives, and phone banking congregational members. Then they’ll turn out their neighborhoods by hosting voter registration house parties, running targeted voter registration phone banking and canvassing, and canvassing at community events. \r\nStarting early: We’re developing our teams now, not waiting until just before the election. This guarantees that we’re building a sustainable movement that can transform the electorate long term. \r\nTransformational relationships: A simple, transactional message won’t increase voter turnout in lasting way. We are asking people to vote as part of a larger strategy to transform LA into a more just, equitable place to live, and to keep working alongside each other year after year, not just during the election.

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    One major challenge for our work is engaging people who cannot vote;
    undocumented individuals and formerly incarcerated community members still
    on parole or probation. Not only do these community members feel excluded
    from the process, but there are many assumptions and fears regarding
    participation. We will address this by training leaders to understand how
    their voices can and do matter-- in fact, participating in voter turnout is
    a way to ask your community to vote in solidarity with those who cannot. 
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    Evaluation is a key component of our voter turnout work. By tracking all
    data in the Voter Activation Network and analyzing what worked best in our
    2012 and 2014 campaigns, we were able to develop our plan for the current
    election cycle. We will partner with PICO National Network to conduct
    research and identify best practices for our voter turnout work. We will
    look at the effectiveness of our work over the past two election cycles by
    tracking our contact rates with community members and comparing them to
    actual voter turnout. We will evaluate the effectiveness of different forms
    of contacts (phone banking compared to in-person, etc) in order to
    continually improve. We are also part of a learning community of
    organizations in LA and the state that constantly evaluates best practices
    and the effectiveness of new technology.
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "There are other organizations doing voter turnout work, but none with our unique, congregation-based, multi-racial, multi-neighborhood approach. Our work will complement the turnout work being done by other great organizations, by ensuring that voters are reached by local leaders developing transformational relationships in addition to more traditional voter turnout contacts. \r\n\r\nOur approach is unique in that we already have the relationships, leadership development capacity, and trust in our target communities that will allow us to transform the electorate. There are no other organizations working out of congregations that can build bridges across race, faith and class in the same way that LA Voice does. "
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': N/A
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    This project will cost us approximately $150,000. In order to transform the
    electorate in the way we’re envisioning, we will need to assign a full-time
    Community Organizer to the work, and also hire a part-time person to handle
    the logistics and data entry needs involved with the campaign. We are
    pursuing Foundation funding sources to cover the additional costs, and will
    also cover some expenses out of our General Operating Support funds,
    congregational membership dues and individual donations. This work is so
    important to our vision of a fair and just Los Angeles that we will find a
    way to do it with whatever funds and capacity are necessary. 
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Staff\r\nFull-time Community Organizer: $45,000\r\nPart-time staff person ($15/hr for 20 hrs/week): $14, 400\r\nBenefits: $17,820\r\nTotal staff: 77,220\r\n\r\nProgram Expenses\r\nPrinting: $2000\r\nMaterials purchase for actions, meetings and canvassing: $11,280\r\nTravel: $5000\r\nOffice supplies: $1500\r\nMailing/postage/delivery: $1000\r\nTelephone: $2000\r\nTotal program expenses: $22,780\r\n\r\nTotal: $100,000"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    Completion of this voter turnout campaign will build infrastructure that
    will allow us to continue our voter turnout work on an increasing scale each
    election cycle. Our local leaders will be even more prepared to train new
    leaders and turn out their communities, and we will be able to expand our
    congregational leadership base to increase our geographic reach.
