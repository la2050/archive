title: Turning Out Voters Through Local Relationships

project_summary: >-
  LA will not solve its problem of racial inequity without greater civic
  participation. Voter turnout is at a historic low, and LA Voice has a plan to
  turn that around. Barriers to voting can be overcome by leaders from diverse
  faith backgrounds investing in local relationships to increase participation.
  When LA Voice leaders turn out all 40,000 people represented by our 36 diverse
  congregations-- AND their neighbors--it will shift the electorate towards a
  more representative, inclusive county.
