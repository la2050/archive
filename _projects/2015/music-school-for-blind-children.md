title: Music School for Blind Children
project_summary: >-
  We've recently opened a larger location in Los Angeles because there are so
  many blind students looking for a place to learn to become musicians. We need
  money to help with student tuition, musical instruments and teacher salary.
  The students also want to start dancing! So, we're trying to purchase shoes &
  clothes for them.

    The kids would LOVE a machine called a Braillenote. It allows them to create
    documents and write music. They're very expensive and having those would be
    amazing.

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    Money has always been our one major barrier. We need money to cover the
    costs of tuition for students who can't afford to attend AMB. We also need
    to provide many kids with their own instruments so they can practice at
    home. Music has changed these blind kids life! Once they learn a little,
    they want to go far and not stop. We had to close down for 2 months last
    spring because we couldn't afford to keep our doors open. It was devastating
    to the kids & their families. We have an incredible team of teachers,
    parents & supporters, but that isn't always enough.
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    We're able to see a difference immediately at AMB. We now have 6 new
    students who are already thriving and playing solos on guitar & piano. Maybe
    blind children are shy and reserved and afraid to be extroverted. Within 3
    weeks of coming to AMB, they're singing their hearts out, doing new
    choreography and asking their parents for their own instruments. We also
    have students who, because of their musical talent, have gone on to play in
    public and even sing at National baseball games! You can see so many videos
    on youtube of the joy they're bringing to LA!
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    There is no place in the world like AMB. We teach each student One on One
    and attend to all their musical needs. There are blind choral groups in LA
    that are wonderful and the Braille institute, but nothing like what we do at
    the Academy. We push our students to excel beyond their disability. We
    challenge them to learn new music and we give them a stage on which they can
    show LA who they are. We've been featured on numerous news programs and Josh
    Groban's foundation Find Your Light awarded us a small grant last spring to
    re-open our doors for the summer. Josh, an LA native, saw a video of one of
    our 5 year old students singing and fell in love. Our approach is very
    personal with each student and also very professional. We see this kids as
    musicians, and not 'blind children.' They feel that and gain a confidence
    that stays with them forever.
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    We have recently opened a 2nd location in Whittier because we have many
    students in Orange County that can't make it to Reseda. We would love to use
    some of the money to help that location stay open. Every week we hear from
    new perspective students who want to come learn music at AMB. We'd also use
    the money to continue to bring music around LA from our students. We've sung
    for events at the Lions Club, at Churches & Synagogues and next month at the
    Moss Theater on October 18th! We also want to record a CD of all the
    students and use it as a way to raise awareness of the blind and share their
    incredible music with the world. But basically, the grant money will allow
    AMB to keep its doors open to its current students for 2 years! 
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': "At AMB we take it month by month and having this kind of money would mean we could breath and know we'd be open for almost 2 years! The kids would all get their own guitars!! \r\nHowever, we apply for other grants weekly and have been having some good luck. \r\nJosh Groban's FIND YOUR LIGHT Foundation gave us $10,000 last spring for us to stay open through the summer. We're always looking for more angels like that."
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "15,000: Office Manager (1250/month for 12 months)\r\n•\r\n12,000: Assistant Director (1000/month for 12 months)\r\n•\r\n  8,400: Outreach Coordinator (700/month for 12 months)\r\n•\r\n  5,875: Sup1 ($125/week for 47 weeks)\r\n \r\n27,000: AMB-LA, 8 teachers ($1250/wk for 47 wks)\r\n•\r\nLunches for Teachers \r\n($370/yr per teacher)\r\n6,000\r\nAMB Merchandise\r\n 3,000\r\nTeaching Aids/Supplies\r\n 2,000\r\nTheatre Rentals\r\n 4,200\r\nInsurance\r\n 2,000\r\nInstrument Equipment\r\n 4,000\r\nPrinting\r\n    600\r\n2 Holiday Performances\r\n 1,400\r\nTax Preparation\r\n    400\r\nTelephone\r\n 1,600\r\nCTEBVI Conference\r\n    300\r\nPayPal & Bank Fees\r\n    500\r\nPostage\r\n    250\r\nTOTAL EXPENSES\r\n   $90,525"
