title: Music School for Blind Children
project_summary: >-
  We've recently opened a larger location in Los Angeles because there are so
  many blind students looking for a place to learn to become musicians. We need
  money to help with student tuition, musical instruments and teacher salary.
  The students also want to start dancing! So, we're trying to purchase shoes &
  clothes for them.

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to play.: >-
    The students from AMB will be performing at many events around LA bringing
    awareness to the blind community and opening hearts. We're already packing
    houses in Santa Monica and most recently at summer music festivals.

    - Volunteers/staff (human capital)

  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    We're able to see a difference immediately at AMB. We now have 6 new
    students who are already thriving and playing solos on guitar & piano. Maybe
    blind children are shy and reserved and afraid to be extroverted. Within 3
    weeks of coming to AMB, they're singing their hearts out, doing new
    choreography and asking their parents for their own instruments. We also
    have students who, because of their musical talent, have gone on to play in
    public and even sing at National baseball games! You can see so many videos
    on youtube of the joy they're bringing to LA!
