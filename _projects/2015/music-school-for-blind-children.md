title: Music School for Blind Children
project_summary: >-
  We've recently opened a larger location in Los Angeles because there are so
  many blind students looking for a place to learn to become musicians. We need
  money to help with student tuition, musical instruments and teacher salary.
  The students also want to start dancing! So, we're trying to purchase shoes &
  clothes for them.

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to play.: >-
    The students from AMB will be performing at many events around LA bringing
    awareness to the blind community and opening hearts. We're already packing
    houses in Santa Monica and most recently at summer music festivals.
  How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
    - Money (financial capital)
    - Volunteers/staff (human capital)
    - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
    - 'Infrastructure (building/space/vehicles, etc.)'
    - Education/training
    - 'Technical infrastructure (computers, etc.)'
    - Community outreach
    - Network/relationship support
    - Quality improvement research
  How do you plan to use these resources to make change?:
    - Expand a pilot or a program
    - 'Cover costs of musical instruments, student tuition and Braille machines'
  Where will you be working?:
    - San Fernando Valley
    - County of Los Angeles
    - 'The Learning Center (TLC) In Reseda, CA'
  How will your proposal improve the following “Play” metrics?:
    - Number of children enrolled in afterschool programs
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    We're able to see a difference immediately at AMB. We now have 6 new
    students who are already thriving and playing solos on guitar & piano. Maybe
    blind children are shy and reserved and afraid to be extroverted. Within 3
    weeks of coming to AMB, they're singing their hearts out, doing new
    choreography and asking their parents for their own instruments. We also
    have students who, because of their musical talent, have gone on to play in
    public and even sing at National baseball games! You can see so many videos
    on youtube of the joy they're bringing to LA!

Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Money has always been our one major barrier. We need money to cover the costs
  of tuition for students who can't afford to attend AMB. We also need to
  provide many kids with their own instruments so they can practice at home.
  Music has changed these blind kids life! Once they learn a little, they want
  to go far and not stop. We had to close down for 2 months last spring because
  we couldn't afford to keep our doors open. It was devastating to the kids &
  their families. We have an incredible team of teachers, parents & supporters,
  but that isn't always enough.

Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There is no place in the world like AMB. We teach each student One on One and
  attend to all their musical needs. There are blind choral groups in LA that
  are wonderful and the Braille institute, but nothing like what we do at the
  Academy. We push our students to excel beyond their disability. We challenge
  them to learn new music and we give them a stage on which they can show LA who
  they are. We've been featured on numerous news programs and Josh Groban's
  foundation Find Your Light awarded us a small grant last spring to re-open our
  doors for the summer. Josh, an LA native, saw a video of one of our 5 year old
  students singing and fell in love. Our approach is very personal with each
  student and also very professional. We see this kids as musicians, and not
  'blind children.' They feel that and gain a confidence that stays with them
  forever.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  We have recently opened a 2nd location in Whittier because we have many
  students in Orange County that can't make it to Reseda. We would love to use
  some of the money to help that location stay open. Every week we hear from new
  perspective students who want to come learn music at AMB. We'd also use the
  money to continue to bring music around LA from our students. We've sung for
  events at the Lions Club, at Churches & Synagogues and next month at the Moss
  Theater on October 18th! We also want to record a CD of all the students and
  use it as a way to raise awareness of the blind and share their incredible
  music with the world. But basically, the grant money will allow AMB to keep
  its doors open to its current students for 2 years!
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  The success of this proposal will be seen on the faces of over 30 blind
  children in LA. We will capture these smiles & voices and show LA and the
  world that music can truly changes lives.
