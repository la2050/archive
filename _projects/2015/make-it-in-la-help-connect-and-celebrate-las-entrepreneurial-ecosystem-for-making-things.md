  Everyone knows LA is a center for design, culture, and tech -- but did you
  know it’s also the largest manufacturing hub in the country? Preliminary
  results of a forthcoming study have found that LA manufacturing opportunities
  are growing, but companies need help connecting to LA’s complex supplier
  network, accessing capital, and navigating government. Make it in LA is

Preliminary results of a forthcoming study of 1,600 LA County companies have found that LA manufacturing is growing, and there is interest in growing local sourcing and engaging with startups. But companies face significant challenges, including accessing capital, connecting to LA’s complex supplier network, and navigating government. \r\nMake it in LA is a new public-private partnership that will pilot efforts to grow the ecosystem of making things. The first initiative will strengthen the networks between manufacturers in the LA area and potential customers, with a special focus on startups. We will put companies on a technology platform to connect contract manufacturers and customers and enable them to better develop and respond to RFPs, and help promote LA companies with national directories. Events will engage the community, connect companies to potential sources of capital, and raise awareness of the LA manufacturing ecosystem. Make it in LA will help startups and established firms succeed in the design and manufacturing ecosystem of LA. "
  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    The LA ecosystem is very large and complex, so it is challenging to reach
    and connect the players. We’ve mitigated this by starting with a
    comprehensive survey of companies in LA County. We’ll start with 300-500
    contract manufacturers and suppliers, and use a combination of technology,
    hands-on efforts, and events to deliver a high-touch approach and scale to
    more companies over time. We won’t limit our efforts to any particular
    industry, but we might pick one or two industries to focus on first, such as
    machining or food and beverage. We will start by reaching out through our
    and our partners’ networks and through the respondents of our survey that
    opted in for future outreach. So far open and click-through rates on our
    emails are more than double the industry average, indicating there is great
    engagement and interest in our initial efforts.
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    Our ultimate goal is to grow high quality creative and manufacturing jobs
    across the whole LA region. We will measure intermediate metrics such as
    growth in contracts, engagement of companies (startups, designers,
    manufacturers, and suppliers), and qualitative feedback from participating
    companies.
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    The Urban Manufacturing Alliance is an organization that helps promote urban
    manufacturing efforts in areas such as branding, workforce development, and
    land use. The UMA is a fantastic collaborator, and in fact we are co-hosting
    an Urban Manufacturing Summit with them on October 26th (which became
    oversubscribed within a week it was announced!) We will work closely with
    organizations like the CMTC and Syncfab who work with local manufacturers to
    promote and support production in Southern California. Other cities have
    been developing their own regional manufacturing efforts, such as SF Made,
    and we are working closely with them to learn best practices and apply it to
    the larger and more complex ecosystem of LA.
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    We are in discussions with emerging technology platforms that will be able
    to include LA companies at low cost in their platform to connect LA
    suppliers and buyers. We are budgeting $20,000 to dedicate to this piece of
    the project.
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    Ideally we will raise an additional $50,000 to extend this pilot to 18
    months, giving us runway to prove out the concept. We have half a dozen
    partners that are already working with us on our efforts and we will solicit
    their support first. We also believe that events will provide ample
    opportunities for sponsorship.
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "$60,000 – program coordinator for marketing, event coordination, and participant outreach\r\n$20,000 – technology platform\r\n$10,000 – event budget (to be supplemented by sponsorship and partner funding)\r\n$10,000 – travel budget\r\n"

    Once the technology and the model is proven with 300-500 companies, we will
    be able to reach out to the broader audience of companies across more
    industries. We will work with partners to identify opportunities to connect
    diverse players across different industries and geographies.

      fact we are co-hosting an Urban Manufacturing Summit with them on October
      26th (which became oversubscribed within a week it was announced!) We will
      work closely with organizations like the CMTC and Syncfab who work with
      local manufacturers to promote and support production in Southern
      California. Other cities have been developing their own regional
      manufacturing efforts, such as SF Made, and we are working closely with
      them to learn best practices and apply it to the larger and more complex
      ecosystem of LA.

      of the project.

      Ideally we will raise an additional $50,000 to extend this pilot to 18
      months, giving us runway to prove out the concept. We have half a dozen
      partners that are already working with us on our efforts and we will
      solicit their support first. We also believe that events will provide
      ample opportunities for sponsorship.
