  Make it in LA – help connect and celebrate LA’s entrepreneurial ecosystem for
  making things
project_summary: >-
  Everyone knows LA is a center for design, culture, and tech -- but did you
  know it’s also the largest manufacturing hub in the country? Preliminary
  results of a forthcoming study have found that LA manufacturing opportunities
  are growing, but companies need help connecting to LA’s complex supplier
  network, accessing capital, and navigating government. Make it in LA is
  piloting an effort to help startups and growing companies connect and succeed
  in the design and manufacturing ecosystem of LA.

Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: "Los Angeles is the largest manufacturing center in the country, in diverse industries ranging from food and fashion to aerospace and electronics. Preliminary results of a forthcoming study of 1,600 LA County companies have found that LA manufacturing is growing, and there is interest in growing local sourcing and engaging with startups. But companies face significant challenges, including accessing capital, connecting to LA’s complex supplier network, and navigating government. \r\nMake it in LA is a new public-private partnership that will pilot efforts to grow the ecosystem of making things. The first initiative will strengthen the networks between manufacturers in the LA area and potential customers, with a special focus on startups. We will put companies on a technology platform to connect contract manufacturers and customers and enable them to better develop and respond to RFPs, and help promote LA companies with national directories. Events will engage the community, connect companies to potential sources of capital, and raise awareness of the LA manufacturing ecosystem. Make it in LA will help startups and established firms succeed in the design and manufacturing ecosystem of LA. "
