  Everyone knows LA is a center for design, culture, and tech -- but did you
  know it’s also the largest manufacturing hub in the country? Preliminary
  results of a forthcoming study have found that LA manufacturing opportunities
  are growing, but companies need help connecting to LA’s complex supplier
  network, accessing capital, and navigating government. Make it in LA is
  piloting an effort to help startups and growing companies connect and succeed
  in the design and manufacturing ecosystem of LA.
