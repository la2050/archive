title: KIPP (Kids Indoor Play Park)
project_summary: >-
  I would like to see indoor play parks at various parks throughout the City of
  LA.  The play parks would be designed for children that are baby, infant, and
  toddler ages and would provide a safe, indoor environment as a relief from
  outdoor factors (weather, transients, etc).  Portable play equipment and mats
  would provide appropriate levels of play for smaller children to express
  themselves and play physically while protecting them from their surroundings
  and allowing for easy clean-up.

    I would like to create KIPP, a Kids Indoor Play Park for all young children
    (baby, infant, toddler) to participate in and develop social and physical
    motor skills, both individually and with each other.  Many outdoor
    playgrounds aren't designed for the younger age groups, but KIPP's will be
    created just for them, a place where parents and caretakers can feel secure
    in knowing their children are in a good environment.  The equipment will be
    similar to an indoor children's gym, with soft mats, tumbling shapes, and
    age-appropriate apparatuses that are both colorful and engaging.  The
    equipment can be portable, allowing for easy set-up and clean-up at a
    multi-use facility so as not to interfere with current programming.  KIPP's
    will be offered at numerous City of LA parks inside the recreation
    facilities.  Participation for the children will be either free or low cost
    so as to encourage and include as many children in the community as
    possible.  This type of programming will offer networking and social
    interfacing among the children and between parents/caretakers.  It will also
    create a connection between parents/caretakers and park staff, which may
    then lead to ongoing participation in other park programs in the future.  By
    developing the relationship between the park and community, the City can
    learn about its residents and better serve the public.

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    I anticipate encountering the challenge of working through the City's
    approval process for obtaining/purchasing the items needed for KIPP, as well
    as, any approval needed to host such program at the desired parks.  The City
    has policies for vendors that make using City funds difficult, at times.  If
    the funds are "donated" into the City's general account, then I will have to
    patiently work through the purchasing process.  If the funds can be awarded
    and the items paid for directly from the source, then it will be easier and
    quicker to obtain the items needed.  I will take the initiative to propose
    KIPP to the park supervisors, and then to the park commission, as needed.  I
    will also be willing do research in order to to train park staff on proper
    usage of the equipment to ensure safety and on programming ideas to design a
    variety of activities that will benefit the children and get the most use of
    KIPP (classes, workshops, games, etc). 
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    I will choose a pilot park, or parks, to survey to see which one(s) have a
    need for this type of programming.  After selecting the parks and
    implementing the program I plan to conduct biweekly/monthly evaluations on
    the program with feedback from park staff, program participants, and
    non-participants who frequent the park.  I'll also observe the activity to
    review firsthand how the KIPP is utilized and received by both children and
    parents/caretakers.  I'll see what's liked by the children and what other
    ideas they would like to see at the KIPP.  I will make note of any safety
    hazards and make sure they are dealt with in a timely manner.  I'll also see
    how participation varies when the program is offered at no expense verses a
    nominal fee.
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    Yes, there are other organizations that provide this type of activity. 
    However, they are private, for-profit entities (like Gymboree) that aren't
    readily accessible to the communities throughout the City of LA.  What's
    unique about my proposed approach is my ability to initiate this type of
    program within the City's Department of Recreation and Parks and offer it on
    a more widespread scale for free, or a much lower fee than the other
    businesses.  I am currently a Facility Director employed with the City of
    Los Angeles who recently had a baby, so I have both the connection within
    the City, as well as, a direct need and interest in such program on a
    personal level...which will keep me engaged in this endeavor.
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    I am currently involved with the Playa Vista Moms Group (PVMG) in which I am
    co-chair of events.  This group provides resources and connections to moms
    living in Playa Vista.  I am also involved with Women In Leisure Services
    (WILS), a professional organization that connects women working in the
    recreation field to each other for resources, guidance, and networking
    purposes.  Both clubs are non-profit organizations that I can utilize to aid
    in the production and promotion of the KIPP.  I'm also a member of Alpha Phi
    Fraternity in which I can connect to chapters at various universities in Los
    Angeles to seek out college women studying related majors that may want to
    assist with the research and production of the KIPP.  I anticipate that both
    PVMG and WILS will receive about $2,000 each for their part in the project
    and Alpha Phi receiving about $3000 for their contribution to the project. 
    I anticipate need the bulk of the grant money to purchase equipment and any
    other start up costs for the project (like staff fees).
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    I think this project will cost the full $100,000.  This amount will include
    the planning, implementation, managing, and evaluation of the project.  It
    will also include City costs to support such a program as long as it can
    before it can be left up to each park to find funding to self-sustain the
    program.
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "The estimated budget for this project is as follows: \r\n\r\n$2000 = Playa Vista Moms Group\r\n$2000 = Women In Leisure Services\r\n$3000 = Alpha Phi Fraternity\r\n$43,000 = Staff Fees\r\n$40,000 = Equipment Fees\r\n$10,000 = Miscellaneous Fees (research, potential partners, cleaning fees, permit fees, unforeseen costs)"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    I plan to review all forms of evaluation and personally involve my friends,
    family and myself with the project.  In working with the City of LA's
    Department of Recreation and Parks I hope to gain their support and
    implement the project at as many parks as possible.  By adopting my idea,
    the City of LA can then budget for this program in the future.  Kids Indoor
    Play Parks will fill the void left by the City of LA when they had to
    terminate their licensed preschool programs.  Additionally, KIPP will
    fulfill the need for programming for babies, infants, and toddlers that the
    City of LA does not currently provide.
