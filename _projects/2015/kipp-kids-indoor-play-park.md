title: KIPP (Kids Indoor Play Park)
project_summary: >-
  I would like to see indoor play parks at various parks throughout the City of
  LA.  The play parks would be designed for children that are baby, infant, and
  toddler ages and would provide a safe, indoor environment as a relief from
  outdoor factors (weather, transients, etc).  Portable play equipment and mats
  would provide appropriate levels of play for smaller children to express
  themselves and play physically while protecting them from their surroundings
  and allowing for easy clean-up.

Where will you be working?:
  - City of Los Angeles
  - Poinsettia Recreation Center
How do you plan to use these resources to make change?:
  - Implement a pilot or new project
  - >-
    Offer free/low cost programming for young children where licensed child care
    and preschool programs were terminated.
How will your proposal improve the following “Play” metrics?:
  - Access to open space and park facilities
  - Percentage of residents that feel safe in their neighborhoods
  - Residents within 1⁄4 mile of a park (Dream Metric)
  - Number of residents with easy access to a “vibrant” park (Dream Metric)
  - Number of parks with intergenerational play opportunities (Dream Metric)
  - Number (and quality) of informal spaces for play (Dream Metric)
Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to play.: >-
  I would like to create KIPP, a Kids Indoor Play Park for all young children
  (baby, infant, toddler) to participate in and develop social and physical
  motor skills, both individually and with each other.  Many outdoor playgrounds
  aren't designed for the younger age groups, but KIPP's will be created just
  for them, a place where parents and caretakers can feel secure in knowing
  their children are in a good environment.  The equipment will be similar to an
  indoor children's gym, with soft mats, tumbling shapes, and age-appropriate
  apparatuses that are both colorful and engaging.  The equipment can be
  portable, allowing for easy set-up and clean-up at a multi-use facility so as
  not to interfere with current programming.  KIPP's will be offered at numerous
  City of LA parks inside the recreation facilities.  Participation for the
  children will be either free or low cost so as to encourage and include as
  many children in the community as possible.  This type of programming will
  offer networking and social interfacing among the children and between
  parents/caretakers.  It will also create a connection between
  parents/caretakers and park staff, which may then lead to ongoing
  participation in other park programs in the future.  By developing the
  relationship between the park and community, the City can learn about its
  residents and better serve the public. 
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  I will choose a pilot park, or parks, to survey to see which one(s) have a
  need for this type of programming.  After selecting the parks and implementing
  the program I plan to conduct biweekly/monthly evaluations on the program with
  feedback from park staff, program participants, and non-participants who
  frequent the park.  I'll also observe the activity to review firsthand how the
  KIPP is utilized and received by both children and parents/caretakers.  I'll
  see what's liked by the children and what other ideas they would like to see
  at the KIPP.  I will make note of any safety hazards and make sure they are
  dealt with in a timely manner.  I'll also see how participation varies when
  the program is offered at no expense verses a nominal fee.
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
  - Money (financial capital)
  - Volunteers/staff (human capital)
  - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
  - Education/training
  - Community outreach
  - Network/relationship support
  - Quality improvement research
