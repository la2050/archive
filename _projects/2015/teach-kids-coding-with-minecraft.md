  How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
    - Money (financial capital)
    - Volunteers/staff (human capital)
    - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
    - 'Technical infrastructure (computers, etc.)'
    - Community outreach
    - Network/relationship support
  How do you plan to use these resources to make change?:
    - Engage residents and stakeholders
    - Implement a pilot or new project
  Where will you be working?:
    - Central LA
    - East LA
    - South LA
    - County of Los Angeles
    - City of Los Angeles
    - LAUSD
    - Afterschool Programs
  How will your proposal improve the following “Learn” metrics?:
    - Youth unemployment and underemployment
    - >-
      Student education pipeline (an integrated network of pre-schools, K-12
      institutions, and higher education systems that prepares students for
      seamless transitions between high school, higher ed
    - Truancy rates in elementary and middle schools (Dream Metric)
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    We use a number of metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the camp. One
    measure is engagement: are kids actively engaged in our coding challenges;
    do they log in to our servers whenever possible? Another measure is a sense
    of belonging: do kids feel part of a community to which they are actively
    contributing and in which they are recognized as an important participant? A
    third measure relates to the mapping of our curriculum to the Next
    Generation Science Standards. Based on these specific learning outcomes, our
    coding challenges serve as performance-based assessments measuring the
    extent to which a kid has learned a particular coding skill or set of
    skills. We also gather daily data from our counselors on their interactions
    with the kids, noting learning challenges and successes and capturing
    information on how kids are doing with each of the different coding
    challenges. Counselor data is summarized and reviewed daily so that
    modifications to the curriculum can be made as needed.

  Often described as virtual Legos, Minecraft has been embraced by progressive
  educators as a learner-centered environment for developing problem-solving,
  creative, technical, and coding skills. Minecraft thus represents a unique
  opportunity to scale a gateway to STEAM-related interests, identities, and
  skills that can be implemented across a student education pipeline. This
  project leverages Minecraft to 1) bring more kids into coding and technically
  sophisticated forms of gaming, and 2) sharpen our understanding of the
  relational and cultural supports kids need to develop STEAM interests as they
  move from K-12 institutions to higher education systems.
    
   Relative to our proposal, while Minecraft gives kids a foot in the door, they need support to engage technically sophisticated aspects of Minecraft and fully develop STEAM interests. Prior research indicates that in order to engage in technical gaming interests kids need two supports: 1) peers and mentors they identify with, and 2) projects that engage their identities and interests. Our coding camp would offer these supports, both through the peer-based multiplayer environment in which the camp takes place, as well as via the curriculum itself.
   
   In addition, because Minecraft is deeply engaging as a learning environment, kids want to learn and have opportunities to cultivate positive attitudes toward learning. We know from research that attitudes toward learning play an important role in a child’s willingness to stay in school. It is our hope that by helping kids to develop positive attitudes toward learning, we can impact truancy rates in schools.
   
   And, because our camp model employs high school and college-aged counselors we are also working to reduce youth underemployment and unemployment.
   
   Lastly, we will be partnering with after-school organizations to deliver the camps, which will include professional development for their staff so they can repeat the camps independently.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  The greatest difficulty we anticipate is bridging the gap between
  Minecraft-savvy kids and Minecraft-wary adults. Millions of kids are obsessed
  with Minecraft, but many parents and other adults are confused about what
  happens in the game and what effect it may have on kids. Our coding curriculum
  makes STEAM learning outcomes apparent to adults, because they can see them
  writing code to solve in-game design challenges. Via the college-age mentors
  that kids have a chance to interact with and learn from, kids and parents
  experience a pathway of coding expertise that leads, in many cases, to
  computer science-based degrees. In addition, the curriculum itself includes an
  introduction to Minecraft basic gameplay, facilitated for the parents by their
  child.

  made as needed.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There are currently two form of coding camps available in Los Angeles. These
  are: fully-featured, robust multi-session experiences held by for-profits such
  as iD Tech Camps, UCode, Planet Bravo, and CodeRev kids. At a cost of
  $550-$1700 a week, these camps are not accessible to many Angelenos. The
  second kind are free programs, which are typically one-off workshops or have
  limited seats because they are sponsored or run by a nonprofit.
   
   LA Makerspace is one of these nonprofits. We have experience in offering workshops in neighborhoods around LA County via our partnership with the Los Angeles Public Library (LAPL) system. Our workshops in Minecraft are multi-session, but spaces are limited by the funding available for LAPL. Partnering with Connected Camps to hold 200 hours of coding instruction remotely, for free, overcomes many of these obstacles. Particularly, through our partnership with afterschool programs, it empowers non-educator, non-Minecraft experts who work with LA’s underserved youth, to offer the camps for free again and again.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  LA Makerspace will be partnering with Connected Camps, a benefit corporation.
  Connected Camps was co-founded by LA Makerspace’s founder, technologist and
  entrepreneur Tara Tiger Brown; with Mimi Ito, Professor in Residence and
  MacArthur Foundation Chair in Digital Media and Learning at UC Irvine,
  Research Director of the Digital Media and Learning Research Hub, and Chair of
  the Connected Learning Research Network; and Katie Salen, game designer and
  force behind the creation of Institute of Play and its partner school Quest to
  Learn. 
   
   LA Makerspace - $70,000
   Connected Camps - $30,000
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Ability to scale is built in to the basic premise of the proposal. With years
  of experience and a hotline to the network of connected learning proponents
  nationwide, the curriculum will be made in a collaborative process with
  representatives from end user groups, integrating feedback as we proceed with
  development. We will be partnering with after-school organizations to deliver
  the camps, which will include professional development for their staff so they
  can repeat the camps independently. Additionally, through our partnership with
  Connected Camps we have another opportunity to scale. Connected Camps offers
  year-round learning experiences in Minecraft where kids log-in from home, and
  the curriculum that is developed as part of this proposal could be easily
  integrated into their core model. Last summer, they served 2,000 kids and have
  plans to double this number next summer.
