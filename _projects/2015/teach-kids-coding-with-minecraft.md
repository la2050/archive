title: Teach Kids Coding with Minecraft
project_summary: "LA Makerspace will partner with LA-based benefit corporation Connected Camps to create free coding camps with a common core-aligned curriculum, leveraging Minecraft, the wildly popular computer game, to teach kids to build, design, and code. Open source, free, and tailored to after-school educators, youth organization staff, parents and those without education backgrounds, the camps will enable people in underserved communities all over LA to use Minecraft to develop STEAM skills in youth. \r\n"

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "Often described as virtual Legos, Minecraft has been embraced by progressive educators as a learner-centered environment for developing problem-solving, creative, technical, and coding skills. Minecraft thus represents a unique opportunity to scale a gateway to STEAM-related interests, identities, and skills that can be implemented across a student education pipeline. This project leverages Minecraft to 1) bring more kids into coding and technically sophisticated forms of gaming, and 2) sharpen our understanding of the relational and cultural supports kids need to develop STEAM interests as they move from K-12 institutions to higher education systems.\r\n \r\nRelative to our proposal, while Minecraft gives kids a foot in the door, they need support to engage technically sophisticated aspects of Minecraft and fully develop STEAM interests. Prior research indicates that in order to engage in technical gaming interests kids need two supports: 1) peers and mentors they identify with, and 2) projects that engage their identities and interests. Our coding camp would offer these supports, both through the peer-based multiplayer environment in which the camp takes place, as well as via the curriculum itself.\r\n\r\nIn addition, because Minecraft is deeply engaging as a learning environment, kids want to learn and have opportunities to cultivate positive attitudes toward learning. We know from research that attitudes toward learning play an important role in a child’s willingness to stay in school. It is our hope that by helping kids to develop positive attitudes toward learning, we can impact truancy rates in schools.\r\n\r\nAnd, because our camp model employs high school and college-aged counselors we are also working to reduce youth underemployment and unemployment.\r\n\r\nLastly, we will be partnering with after-school organizations to deliver the camps, which will include professional development for their staff so they can repeat the camps independently."

  How will your proposal improve the following “Learn” metrics?:
    - Youth unemployment and underemployment
    - >-
      Student education pipeline (an integrated network of pre-schools, K-12
      institutions, and higher education systems that prepares students for
      seamless transitions between high school, higher ed
    - Truancy rates in elementary and middle schools (Dream Metric)
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    We use a number of metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the camp. One
    measure is engagement: are kids actively engaged in our coding challenges;
    do they log in to our servers whenever possible? Another measure is a sense
    of belonging: do kids feel part of a community to which they are actively
    contributing and in which they are recognized as an important participant? A
    third measure relates to the mapping of our curriculum to the Next
    Generation Science Standards. Based on these specific learning outcomes, our
    coding challenges serve as performance-based assessments measuring the
    extent to which a kid has learned a particular coding skill or set of
    skills. We also gather daily data from our counselors on their interactions
    with the kids, noting learning challenges and successes and capturing
    information on how kids are doing with each of the different coding
    challenges. Counselor data is summarized and reviewed daily so that
    modifications to the curriculum can be made as needed.
