  LA Makerspace will partner with LA-based benefit corporation Connected Camps
  to create free coding camps with a common core-aligned curriculum, leveraging
  Minecraft, the wildly popular computer game, to teach kids to build, design,
  and code. Open source, free, and tailored to after-school educators, youth
  organization staff, parents and those without education backgrounds, the camps
  will enable people in underserved communities all over LA to use Minecraft to
  develop STEAM skills in youth.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Often described as virtual Legos, Minecraft has been embraced by progressive
  educators as a learner-centered environment for developing problem-solving,
  creative, technical, and coding skills. Minecraft thus represents a unique
  opportunity to scale a gateway to STEAM-related interests, identities, and
  skills that can be implemented across a student education pipeline. This
  project leverages Minecraft to 1) bring more kids into coding and technically
  sophisticated forms of gaming, and 2) sharpen our understanding of the
  relational and cultural supports kids need to develop STEAM interests as they
  move from K-12 institutions to higher education systems.
    
   Relative to our proposal, while Minecraft gives kids a foot in the door, they need support to engage technically sophisticated aspects of Minecraft and fully develop STEAM interests. Prior research indicates that in order to engage in technical gaming interests kids need two supports: 1) peers and mentors they identify with, and 2) projects that engage their identities and interests. Our coding camp would offer these supports, both through the peer-based multiplayer environment in which the camp takes place, as well as via the curriculum itself.
   
   In addition, because Minecraft is deeply engaging as a learning environment, kids want to learn and have opportunities to cultivate positive attitudes toward learning. We know from research that attitudes toward learning play an important role in a child’s willingness to stay in school. It is our hope that by helping kids to develop positive attitudes toward learning, we can impact truancy rates in schools.
   
   And, because our camp model employs high school and college-aged counselors we are also working to reduce youth underemployment and unemployment.
   
   Lastly, we will be partnering with after-school organizations to deliver the camps, which will include professional development for their staff so they can repeat the camps independently.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  The greatest difficulty we anticipate is bridging the gap between
  Minecraft-savvy kids and Minecraft-wary adults. Millions of kids are obsessed
  with Minecraft, but many parents and other adults are confused about what
  happens in the game and what effect it may have on kids. Our coding curriculum
  makes STEAM learning outcomes apparent to adults, because they can see them
  writing code to solve in-game design challenges. Via the college-age mentors
  that kids have a chance to interact with and learn from, kids and parents
  experience a pathway of coding expertise that leads, in many cases, to
  computer science-based degrees. In addition, the curriculum itself includes an
  introduction to Minecraft basic gameplay, facilitated for the parents by their
  child.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We use a number of metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the camp. One
  measure is engagement: are kids actively engaged in our coding challenges; do
  they log in to our servers whenever possible? Another measure is a sense of
  belonging: do kids feel part of a community to which they are actively
  contributing and in which they are recognized as an important participant? A
  third measure relates to the mapping of our curriculum to the Next Generation
  Science Standards. Based on these specific learning outcomes, our coding
  challenges serve as performance-based assessments measuring the extent to
  which a kid has learned a particular coding skill or set of skills. We also
  gather daily data from our counselors on their interactions with the kids,
  noting learning challenges and successes and capturing information on how kids
  are doing with each of the different coding challenges. Counselor data is
  summarized and reviewed daily so that modifications to the curriculum can be
  made as needed.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There are currently two form of coding camps available in Los Angeles. These
  are: fully-featured, robust multi-session experiences held by for-profits such
  as iD Tech Camps, UCode, Planet Bravo, and CodeRev kids. At a cost of
  $550-$1700 a week, these camps are not accessible to many Angelenos. The
  second kind are free programs, which are typically one-off workshops or have
  limited seats because they are sponsored or run by a nonprofit.
   
   LA Makerspace is one of these nonprofits. We have experience in offering workshops in neighborhoods around LA County via our partnership with the Los Angeles Public Library (LAPL) system. Our workshops in Minecraft are multi-session, but spaces are limited by the funding available for LAPL. Partnering with Connected Camps to hold 200 hours of coding instruction remotely, for free, overcomes many of these obstacles. Particularly, through our partnership with afterschool programs, it empowers non-educator, non-Minecraft experts who work with LA’s underserved youth, to offer the camps for free again and again.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  LA Makerspace will be partnering with Connected Camps, a benefit corporation.
  Connected Camps was co-founded by LA Makerspace’s founder, technologist and
  entrepreneur Tara Tiger Brown; with Mimi Ito, Professor in Residence and
  MacArthur Foundation Chair in Digital Media and Learning at UC Irvine,
  Research Director of the Digital Media and Learning Research Hub, and Chair of
  the Connected Learning Research Network; and Katie Salen, game designer and
  force behind the creation of Institute of Play and its partner school Quest to
  Learn. 
   
   LA Makerspace - $70,000
   Connected Camps - $30,000
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': |-
  60 workshop series; 825 Los Angeles students learning to code = $100,000
   
   The camp and its curriculum will be facilitated in the form of a series of workshops that will be made available to kids all over Los Angeles. The workshops will be delivered either in-person or online depending on the resources available in each afterschool setting. The in-person workshop is best for those afterschool programs that do not have laptops or sufficient internet access. LA Makerspace will run the entire workshop series and provide coding counselors, Minecraft server memberships for all participants, and something called a Minecraft-in-a-Box kit (1 Minecraft server + 15 laptops). The online coding workshop is for facilities that have computers and sufficient internet access and want to focus on flexibility and providing their staff with professional development. 
   
   We are proposing that each in-person coding workshop series is composed of 4 2-hour workshops and that we would offer 35 instances of the series with 525 students. Each online coding workshop series is composed of 8, 1.5 hour workshops and we will offer 25 instances of this series with 300 students.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-

How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Ability to scale is built in to the basic premise of the proposal. With years
  of experience and a hotline to the network of connected learning proponents
  nationwide, the curriculum will be made in a collaborative process with
  representatives from end user groups, integrating feedback as we proceed with
  development. We will be partnering with after-school organizations to deliver
  the camps, which will include professional development for their staff so they
  can repeat the camps independently. Additionally, through our partnership with
  Connected Camps we have another opportunity to scale. Connected Camps offers
  year-round learning experiences in Minecraft where kids log-in from home, and
  the curriculum that is developed as part of this proposal could be easily
  integrated into their core model. Last summer, they served 2,000 kids and have
  plans to double this number next summer.
