  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: "LA 2050 seeks to “Create in LA means of fostering entrepreneurship, cultural diversity, and inclusivity.”  Our proposal does this in the following ways:\r\n\r\nWe will identify 20 small companies with long-term employees (3 years or more) who seek to own the company they work for. The overwhelming majority of minority workers in LA’s private sector work for small businesses, (companies with 500 or fewer employees). Yet, less than 33% of these companies are owned by people of color; our proposal seeks to address this issue by encouraging entrepreneurship in the workplace of these smaller companies\r\nProceeds from our 2050  grant would be used to create a transition plan for employee groups that includes a  business valuation for negotiating the business sale, a training plan that identifies employee skills needed and drafting of a ‘letter of intent’ to preclude the business from being sold during a period of due diligence.\r\n \r\nWe will enroll interested employees in entrepreneurial training designed to prepare them for eventual company ownership. By including blue collar workers in the ‘class’ of potential business owners and buyers, our proposal seeks to address income inequality and expand the economic horizons of employees it  touches\r\n \r\nBy extending ownership opportunities to employees who would otherwise not have the chance to own their own company, our initiative seeks to make LA a more inclusive environment that encourages entrepreneurship, risk taking and creativity.  The overwhelming majority of blue collar, manufacturing jobs are in the areas of LA with the highest concentration of low-income residents and people of color yet the ownership of these companies is still predominantly white and live outside of the communities where the companies are located. . “Seventy five percent of all small business is owned by folks over 55 years of age and every 7 seconds a Boomer is turning 65 and will do so for the next 15 years.” Transitioning these companies to existing management/employees groups will revitalize the business, realign their outlook with more contemporary racial and ethnic realities and extend the company’s useful life. \r\n\r\nRecycling an existing manufacturing company with its years of goodwill, customer base and trade credit in-tack is easier than starting a new one. Bank financing is more readily available due to a track record of earnings or past history that demonstrates repayment ability.  Long-term employees understand their business.\r\n"

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "The largest single barrier employee groups face who seek to take-over a company is the widely held myth that workers can’t be entrepreneurs and that self-governance isn’t possible in the workplace.  We hope to demonstrate that this myth is false. We have already  successfully transferred the ownership of 7 LA County companies to employee groups - and all have been successful.\r\n \r\nA 2050 grant would increase our ability to transition more companies by giving us  the resources needed to  prepare employees for the transfer: time needed to learn new skills and arrange the financing needed to purchase a company.  In much the same way that ‘first time homeowner’ programs have been successful teaching new buyers financial literacy, we hope to prepare potential business owners  for the challenges of owning their own company – one whose operations they fully understand but whose finances are frequently a mystery to them."
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "We evaluate our work in the method that traditional economic development practitioners do; by the numbers.  We will use the following matrix:\r\n\r\n·Jobs saved and/or created\r\n· Number of entrepreneurial candidates readied to take over a company\r\n·Number of companies identified as potential transfer of ownership candidates\r\n·Total dollar amount of investment\r\n·Total number of loans secured and dollar amount\r\n·Total number of businesses where ownership transferred to employees.\r\n \r\nWe will also have a qualitative evaluation of our work with focus group studies using our partners as members.  These qualitative focus groups will examine such questions as to our effectiveness in following areas:  leads generated, quality of referral we make to them for trainees and impact in their service area of our work transitioning companies.\r\n "
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "Our approach to minority business development is unique.  We’re looking at entrepreneurship from within an existing company with an eye toward preserving and recycling an existing company as opposed to starting up a new one.\r\n\r\nWe work with the long-term employee (3 years or more) in a private company where the owner is seeking to retire or transition the ownership of the firm.  Most existing entrepreneurial training programs are geared to those seeking to start-up a new venture.  Our efforts are geared to preserving and recycling LA County’s existing small business infrastructure.  We believe that start-ups are much riskier than taking over the reins of an existing company with an established track record where the employees are familiar with the operations and business cycle.\r\n\r\nThere’s a tsunami of small business ‘baby boomer’ owners seeking to exit their companies in the next 10 years for retirement.  National statistics show than less than 1/3 of smaller companies’ transition to the next generation in a family.  Many of these businesses will be sold to interests outside of California, larger companies seeking to consolidate their operations or competitors seeking to broaden their market.  This results in loss of the company identity and jobs.    Our program will prepare a very different group of owners to take the place of these owners; ones that are younger, more diverse and with a different perspective on running the company.  Our overall goal is to make LA a more diverse and inclusive place for business ownership.\r\n\r\nThe existing network of business brokers, banks and lawyers involved in transitioning small companies are  transaction-ally oriented focused on preserving ‘assets only’.  We’re transitioning whole companies and the jobs within.  We seek to breathe new life into existing companies; not strip them of their character or separate them from their workforce.  Currently, seasoned employees in management of these companies are forced to exit when a company is sold to a new owner. Our initiative seeks to expand their capacity, broaden their horizons and create new wealth by having them own the company they work for.  It’s a ‘bottom’s up’ approach to economic development as opposed to a traditional approach of increasing investment opportunities for those who currently own assets. "
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    Our partners in this project will be the collection of non-bank lenders,
    workforce centers and economic development providers who make up the fabric
    of LA’s economic development infrastructure.  This includes Pacific Coast
    Regional Corporation (PCR), the Valley Economic Development Center (VEDC)
    and TELACU (lenders).  The LA City and County network of Rapid Response
    Teams that are part of the Workforce Center Program funded by the U.S.
    Department of Labor will help us identify companies undergoing a transition
    of ownership.   Many of the groups that offer loans also offer
    entrepreneurial training along with other community based groups such as
    Vermont Slauson Economic Development Corporation, West Angeles Community
    Development Center and the network of Small Business Development Centers
    sponsored by the Small Business Administration. 
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': "The successful transfer of ownership of all 20 companies will cost and estimated $ 5,100,000 over the next 3 years. Almost 75% of the cost is the equity needed for each transaction.  The remaining 25% of the costs, approximately $ 900,000 are the transaction costs, which average $ 45,000 per company.  \r\n\r\nWe estimate that it will take 36 months to transfer all 20 companies because each group of potential buyers will have a varying state of readiness to become owners.  Each group will need a personalized transfer program, tailored to their level of business acumen. It is likely that one third of the groups identified by our outreach will need a year or more of training to be ready to take over the business. Given the time it takes to get the buyers ready and the businesses’ varying state of readiness to transfer ownership, it is important that we cast a wide net and create a pipeline of businesses.\r\n\r\nWithin 12 months of the grant award, Concerned Capital estimates that we will transfer the ownership for seven businesses. Concerned Capital will evaluate and prioritize the businesses in the pipeline for readiness to transfer. An estimated $1,400,000 to successfully complete the transfer of ownership of 7 of these companies. \r\n\r\n$140,000 will be needed to hire a Certified Public Accountant to create independent valuation reports, and generate year-end financial reports and projections for the target businesses.\r\n\r\n$160,000 will be needed to provide legal assistance for both sides, including due diligence for warranties and representations of the seller, write purchase contracts, ensure the legality of the transfer pursuant to state law, and make sure the new officers are appointed correctly and set up the new corporation with the state.\r\n"
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Our LA2050 grant proceeds will provide matching grants to employees seeking to develop entrepreneurial skills.  We look to identify 100 employees within existing companies that seek to develop the skills needed to own and run their companies.  Our training budget allows for $200 per employee with $100 matching funds coming from the interested employee.  Our total budget for non-profit partners we will use for training is $20,000.  Our training partners charge for their training services and each offer a different range of services – bookkeeping, management, advertising, marketing and sales.  We will be selecting which training program is needed once we’re able to access the employee group skill set.   \r\n\r\nTo help us identify companies with interested employees we will develop a social media campaign that uses video testimonials distributed over LinkedIn and Instagram.  Our goal is to reach out to younger workers in companies where the owner is seeking to retire or transition the ownership of the company.  We have successfully transitioned 7 companies over the life of Concerned Capital and we seek to document these first.  We estimate a budget need of $25,000 for this work.\r\n\r\nThe balance of our budget will be used to support activity connected with transition of ownership work which includes; development of an offer letter with employees and the owner, valuations and securing financing from non –traditional lenders.  Development of projections, business plans and organizational development will be part of this activity."
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "We plan to scale this project first to the Southern California Region and then to the rest of the Country.  Our work has been identified by the Los Angeles providers of Workforce Services as a  Best Practice for saving Jobs. We plan to launch this initiative with these providers as a ‘demonstration program’ and based on our local success share it with the Federal Government.  \r\n\r\nOur plan is to start by deploying this program in 25 Major US Cities through the Department of Labor.\r\n\r\nWe also hope to introduce this concept to Economic Development Professionals in cities throughout California and eventually the rest of the nation.  Every city has an Office of Economic Development who we will reach through social media as we currently do on Linkedin.\r\n\r\nThe National Association of Workforce Providers is a trade group with 14,300 members nationwide that we routinely share innovations with.  This group will also scale the program nationally.  \r\n\r\nWe feel that the idea of long term employees buying the company they work for will be seen as a solution to the issue of income inequality and preserving manufacturing jobs.  These issues have already been highlighted in our nation's upcoming presidential election.\r\n"
