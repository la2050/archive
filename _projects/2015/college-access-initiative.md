  We will expand and enhance our College Access Initiative in Carson and South
  Los Angeles. Students (6th to 12th grade) will receive a wide range of college
  access services and career prep and exposure activities through our
  comprehensive, high-quality, outcome driven program designed to keep middle
  school and high school students on the path towards their college and career
  goals.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  The COLLEGE ACCESS INITIATIVE will make LA the best place to learn by
  improving the academic outcomes of youth. We will improve grades, increase
  high school graduation rates and the pursuit of post-secondary education and
  ensure youth are college and career ready after high school. The Initiative
  will expand and enhance our College Access Programs in three schools in Carson
  and four schools in South Los Angeles.
   
   We will provide age and grade appropriate college pathway services at 4 middle schools through our AIM (ACHIEVEMENT IN MIDDLE SCHOOL) FOR COLLEGE component. AIM provides activities to help middle school students begin developing their college and career path. ACADEMIC CASE MANAGEMENT focuses on academic course work, study habits, preparing for high school and an introduction to college. WORKSHOPS introduce youth to college, the college pathway and what they need to begin doing now to achieve their academic goals. Youth build life skills that will help them succeed academically (study skills, time management, note taking etc.) and in their careers (mock interviews, professional etiquette and networking). AIM transition activities at our elementary school sites prepare incoming 6th grade students and parents for middle school.
   
   Through COLLEGE BOUND, we provide academic support, academic case management and college pathway services to high school youth. ACADEMIC SUPPORT includes tutoring, homework help and writing workshops. Students receive a vast array of COLLEGE PATHWAY PROGRAMMING from SAT, ACT, and CAHSEE prep, to assistance in preparing college, scholarship, and financial aid applications. ACADEMIC CASE MANAGEMENT focuses on preparing for high school graduation, post-secondary options and preparing for success after high school. COLLEGE EXPOSURE activities include college visits, conferences and guest speakers; inspiring youth to pursue post-secondary education. WORKSHOPS cover a vast range of topics from choosing the write college to financial aid. Targeted workshops for 12th grade youth cover topics that help to develop life skills, prepare for success in the workforce and build skills to make appropriate educational and career choices. 
   
   The Boys & Girls Clubs of Carson’s College Access Initiative will provide at-risk, underserved youth with the tools, support and resources to develop the skills and confidence they need to reach their goals and achieve their full potential.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Limited resources are the largest obstacle. The resources available for the
  College Access Initiative will determine the number of youth that can
  participate. In order to address this, the Boys & Girls Clubs of Carson will
  work with schools and parents to identify and recruit youth who will benefit
  most from the program to ensure that we are making the greatest impact with
  the resources we have. Most importantly, we will continue to develop
  partnerships to increase the resources available to enable the College Access
  Initiative to reach as many youth as possible.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We are committed to continuous quality improvement and regularly measure the
  effectiveness of our programs and their impact on youth. Director of
  Operations, Veronica Jimenez, is a leader in evaluation within the Boys &
  Girls Clubs of America and was named 2015 National Professional of the Year.
  Our evaluation process collects data on: 1) Number of youth served; 2)
  Participation rates; 3) Grades; 4) Grade progression; 5) High school
  graduation rates and 6) Improvement in competencies and skills. Registration
  forms document enrollment numbers. Sign-in sheets and rosters record
  participation. Case management files track academic progress. Our data sharing
  partnership with LAUSD enables us to receive transcripts and report cards.
  Parents/guardians sign consent forms allowing schools to release their child’s
  information to us to track academic outcomes. Pre-/Post-tests measure changes
  in skills and knowledge.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Other Boys & Girls Clubs and YMCA’s throughout Los Angeles County are just
  some of the youth serving organizations that provide youth development and
  educational support to students. However, there are few direct service
  programs for youth in Carson and South Los Angeles. Many provide limited daily
  youth programming, serve a different target population or serve a different
  geographic area from our sites. 
   
   Our people, places and programs are what make the Boys & Girls Clubs of Carson unique.
   
   OUR PEOPLE: Our staff is made up of passionate, committed and qualified professionals who invest knowledge and time to help youth become confident individuals. The dedication and drive of our staff is what sets us apart. The people who come to work at our Clubs are drawn to the same values that define us: high expectations, impact, commitment and integrity. Our staff work to create an environment that nurtures potential, embraces opportunity and encourages growth for all. The interaction between staff and the youth we serve is based on respect, trust and commitment. All of our full-time staff possess college degrees and 63% have masters degrees. 
   
   OUR PLACES: We offer a safe and positive place where youth are given a sense of hope and opportunity for a brighter future. Our Club environments are youth-focused and fun. Youth truly enjoy coming, because the environment is welcoming and engaging. Our Clubs are designed to cultivate youths’ ability to dream, discover and develop their full potential.
   
   OUR PROGRAMS: Our programs develop kids’ minds, build character and nurture healthy lifestyles so they may thrive as adults. We focus on 3 key priority program outcomes: increased Academic Success, Healthy Lifestyles and improved Character & Citizenship. The integration of academic support with our two other core program areas enables us to address all aspects of their lives. By improving their health, well being, confidence and character we help youth reach not only their academic goals, but their personal and career goals as well. Our vision is that 100% of youth who participate in BGCC programs at least three times a week will graduate on time, live healthy, and give back to their community.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  We believe that an important part of the success of our programs lie in our
  collaborative partnerships with organizations and experts within education,
  health and leadership sectors providing our youth and staff with the best
  learning experiences. Key partnerships include LAUSD, local schools,
  corporations, and community based organizations. LAUSD and schools provide
  referrals, data sharing and activities that align with the school day goals
  and curriculum. United Way supports our programs at Stephen White and Carnegie
  Middle Schools. Corporate partners (Toyota Financial Services, Tesoro,
  Northrop Grumman, Alcoa, Kaiser Permanente, Phillips66, Ross Stores, and Waste
  Management) provide career mentors and job shadowing. Some have employees
  serving on the Board of Directors and as program volunteers. The Rotary Club,
  Kiwanis and Women’s Club provide volunteers. The City of Carson is a partner
  of various community events and activities. The Sheriff Department Gang Task
  Force provides and receives referrals for services. Carson Coordinating
  Council, LA Parks & Recreation and United Way all help to provide free
  day/resident camp programs to needy youth. Toastmasters provides activities to
  teens to develop and strengthen their public speaking skills. Local colleges
  and universities (CSU Dominguez Hills and Harbor College) provide volunteer
  support and college exposure activities. UCLA RAND Community Advisory Board
  works to meet the health needs of adolescents and their parents. We developed
  a partnership with the Carson Wellness Center in Carson High School to provide
  our teens with access to programs and support in areas such as anger
  management, teen depression and loss/grief. As a member of Carson High
  School’s Crisis Team, we have developed connections with other team members
  that can provide psychological support to our teens that are in need of mental
  health services and support. We partner with Brotherhood Crusade to provide
  students in South Los Angeles with sports programs. 
   
   The $100,000 grant award will support Boys & Girls Clubs of Carson staff that implement the programs and work with our partners to bring in additional resources and coordinate activities.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  The College Access Initiative Budget is $568,213. Our Beyond the Bell contract
  with LAUSD underwrites a portion of personnel expenses and program supplies at
  school sites. A portion of a 3-year grant from the Tesoro Foundation supports
  the STEM Coordinator and Tech Program Coordinator. We are confident we will
  cover the additional costs through grants and general operating funds raised
  through our resource development plan. Our Board and Executive Team
  participated in the Executive Service Corps’ Developing Development Program
  that has resulted in a new strategic plan, case for support, and resource
  development plan. Diversification of funding streams continues to be at the
  core of our resource development strategy. We implement aggressive
  fundraising, proposal development, annual special events and individual donor
  campaigns. 
   
   The Executive Leadership and Board of Directors work together to continue to identify and approach potential funders. The BGCC continues to build upon its existing partnerships with foundations, corporations and businesses and develop new ones to sustain its various programs and services. We have created a successful partnership with Toyota Financial Services that serves as a model to engage volunteers, recognize corporate partners and increase resources and opportunities for youth. Staff and Board work to steward donors and partners to ensure they are recognized, supported, and engaged in the organization. This past year, the BGCC upgraded its donor database. Donor data is now easily accessible, providing our Board of Directors and Resource Development staff with information that will help them to steward our supporters to higher levels of giving and engagement. The addition of a Development Coordinator in 2014 is increasing our marketing and communications. We have developed new marketing material, revamped our website to be more dynamic and engaging and increased our use of social media.
   
   Our Resource Development team plays a leadership role in the newly created Boys & Girls Clubs of America’s Pacific Region Resource Development Exchange. The Exchange enables Boys & Girls Clubs throughout the Pacific Region to share best practices and develop partnerships. Our involvement in the Exchange is placing the BGCC as a leader in resource development nationwide.

How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  If the Boys & Girls Clubs of Carson were to raise less than the total budget
  expenses for the year, we would scale down activities within each school site.
  Program expenses would be reduced through fewer field trips, incentives and
  activities. If absolutely necessary, we would scale down the number of youth
  served by reducing the number of Tutors and Youth Development Professionals at
  each site. However, we are confident we will sustain the College Access
  Initiative to serve thousands of youth in Carson and South Los Angeles.

    If the Boys & Girls Clubs of Carson were to raise less than the total budget
    expenses for the year, we would scale down activities within each school
    site. Program expenses would be reduced through fewer field trips,
    incentives and activities. If absolutely necessary, we would scale down the
    number of youth served by reducing the number of Tutors and Youth
    Development Professionals at each site. However, we are confident we will
    sustain the College Access Initiative to serve thousands of youth in Carson
    and South Los Angeles.

    explanation: ''
    answer: "The COLLEGE ACCESS INITIATIVE will make LA the best place to learn by improving the academic outcomes of youth. We will improve grades, increase high school graduation rates and the pursuit of post-secondary education and ensure youth are college and career ready after high school. The Initiative will expand and enhance our College Access Programs in three schools in Carson and four schools in South Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nWe will provide age and grade appropriate college pathway services at 4 middle schools through our AIM (ACHIEVEMENT IN MIDDLE SCHOOL) FOR COLLEGE component. AIM provides activities to help middle school students begin developing their college and career path. ACADEMIC CASE MANAGEMENT focuses on academic course work, study habits, preparing for high school and an introduction to college. WORKSHOPS introduce youth to college, the college pathway and what they need to begin doing now to achieve their academic goals. Youth build life skills that will help them succeed academically (study skills, time management, note taking etc.) and in their careers (mock interviews, professional etiquette and networking). AIM transition activities at our elementary school sites prepare incoming 6th grade students and parents for middle school.\r\n\r\nThrough COLLEGE BOUND, we provide academic support, academic case management and college pathway services to high school youth. ACADEMIC SUPPORT includes tutoring, homework help and writing workshops. Students receive a vast array of COLLEGE PATHWAY PROGRAMMING from SAT, ACT, and CAHSEE prep, to assistance in preparing college, scholarship, and financial aid applications. ACADEMIC CASE MANAGEMENT focuses on preparing for high school graduation, post-secondary options and preparing for success after high school. COLLEGE EXPOSURE activities include college visits, conferences and guest speakers; inspiring youth to pursue post-secondary education. WORKSHOPS cover a vast range of topics from choosing the write college to financial aid. Targeted workshops for 12th grade youth cover topics that help to develop life skills, prepare for success in the workforce and build skills to make appropriate educational and career choices. \r\n\r\nThe Boys & Girls Clubs of Carson’s College Access Initiative will provide at-risk, underserved youth with the tools, support and resources to develop the skills and confidence they need to reach their goals and achieve their full potential."

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      Limited resources are the largest obstacle. The resources available for
      the College Access Initiative will determine the number of youth that can
      participate. In order to address this, the Boys & Girls Clubs of Carson
      will work with schools and parents to identify and recruit youth who will
      benefit most from the program to ensure that we are making the greatest
      impact with the resources we have. Most importantly, we will continue to
      develop partnerships to increase the resources available to enable the
      College Access Initiative to reach as many youth as possible. 
  - name: Please explain how you will evaluate your work.
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      We are committed to continuous quality improvement and regularly measure
      the effectiveness of our programs and their impact on youth. Director of
      Operations, Veronica Jimenez, is a leader in evaluation within the Boys &
      Girls Clubs of America and was named 2015 National Professional of the
      Year. Our evaluation process collects data on: 1) Number of youth served;
      2) Participation rates; 3) Grades; 4) Grade progression; 5) High school
      graduation rates and 6) Improvement in competencies and skills.
      Registration forms document enrollment numbers. Sign-in sheets and rosters
      record participation. Case management files track academic progress. Our
      data sharing partnership with LAUSD enables us to receive transcripts and
      report cards. Parents/guardians sign consent forms allowing schools to
      release their child’s information to us to track academic outcomes.
      Pre-/Post-tests measure changes in skills and knowledge.

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Other Boys & Girls Clubs and YMCA’s throughout Los Angeles County are just some of the youth serving organizations that provide youth development and educational support to students. However, there are few direct service programs for youth in Carson and South Los Angeles. Many provide limited daily youth programming, serve a different target population or serve a different geographic area from our sites. \r\n\r\nOur people, places and programs are what make the Boys & Girls Clubs of Carson unique.\r\n\r\nOUR PEOPLE: Our staff is made up of passionate, committed and qualified professionals who invest knowledge and time to help youth become confident individuals. The dedication and drive of our staff is what sets us apart. The people who come to work at our Clubs are drawn to the same values that define us: high expectations, impact, commitment and integrity. Our staff work to create an environment that nurtures potential, embraces opportunity and encourages growth for all.  The interaction between staff and the youth we serve is based on respect, trust and commitment. All of our full-time staff possess college degrees and 63% have masters degrees. \r\n\r\nOUR PLACES: We offer a safe and positive place where youth are given a sense of hope and opportunity for a brighter future. Our Club environments are youth-focused and fun. Youth truly enjoy coming, because the environment is welcoming and engaging. Our Clubs are designed to cultivate youths’ ability to dream, discover and develop their full potential.\r\n\r\nOUR PROGRAMS: Our programs develop kids’ minds, build character and nurture healthy lifestyles so they may thrive as adults. We focus on 3 key priority program outcomes: increased Academic Success, Healthy Lifestyles and improved Character & Citizenship. The integration of academic support with our two other core program areas enables us to address all aspects of their lives. By improving their health, well being, confidence and character we help youth reach not only their academic goals, but their personal and career goals as well. Our vision is that 100% of youth who participate in BGCC programs at least three times a week will graduate on time, live healthy, and give back to their community. "

      Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on
      this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner
      receive?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "We believe that an important part of the success of our programs lie in our collaborative partnerships with organizations and experts within education, health and leadership sectors providing our youth and staff with the best learning experiences. Key partnerships include LAUSD, local schools, corporations, and community based organizations. LAUSD and schools provide referrals, data sharing and activities that align with the school day goals and curriculum. United Way supports our programs at Stephen White and Carnegie Middle Schools. Corporate partners (Toyota Financial Services, Tesoro, Northrop Grumman, Alcoa, Kaiser Permanente, Phillips66, Ross Stores, and Waste Management) provide career mentors and job shadowing. Some have employees serving on the Board of Directors and as program volunteers. The Rotary Club, Kiwanis and Women’s Club provide volunteers. The City of Carson is a partner of various community events and activities. The Sheriff Department Gang Task Force provides and receives referrals for services. Carson Coordinating Council, LA Parks & Recreation and United Way all help to provide free day/resident camp programs to needy youth. Toastmasters provides activities to teens to develop and strengthen their public speaking skills. Local colleges and universities (CSU Dominguez Hills and Harbor College) provide volunteer support and college exposure activities. UCLA RAND Community Advisory Board works to meet the health needs of adolescents and their parents. We developed a partnership with the Carson Wellness Center in Carson High School to provide our teens with access to programs and support in areas such as anger management, teen depression and loss/grief. As a member of Carson High School’s Crisis Team, we have developed connections with other team members that can provide psychological support to our teens that are in need of mental health services and support. We partner with Brotherhood Crusade to provide students in South Los Angeles with sports programs. \r\n\r\nThe $100,000 grant award will support Boys & Girls Clubs of Carson staff that implement the programs and work with our partners to bring in additional resources and coordinate activities."

      How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you
      cover the additional costs?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "The College Access Initiative Budget is $568,213. Our Beyond the Bell contract with LAUSD underwrites a portion of personnel expenses and program supplies at school sites. A portion of a 3-year grant from the Tesoro Foundation supports the STEM Coordinator and Tech Program Coordinator. We are confident we will cover the additional costs through grants and general operating funds raised through our resource development plan. Our Board and Executive Team participated in the Executive Service Corps’ Developing Development Program that has resulted in a new strategic plan, case for support, and resource development plan. Diversification of funding streams continues to be at the core of our resource development strategy. We implement aggressive fundraising, proposal development, annual special events and individual donor campaigns. \r\n\r\nThe Executive Leadership and Board of Directors work together to continue to identify and approach potential funders. The BGCC continues to build upon its existing partnerships with foundations, corporations and businesses and develop new ones to sustain its various programs and services. We have created a successful partnership with Toyota Financial Services that serves as a model to engage volunteers, recognize corporate partners and increase resources and opportunities for youth. Staff and Board work to steward donors and partners to ensure they are recognized, supported, and engaged in the organization. This past year, the BGCC upgraded its donor database. Donor data is now easily accessible, providing our Board of Directors and Resource Development staff with information that will help them to steward our supporters to higher levels of giving and engagement. The addition of a Development Coordinator in 2014 is increasing our marketing and communications. We have developed new marketing material, revamped our website to be more dynamic and engaging and increased our use of social media.\r\n\r\nOur Resource Development team plays a leadership role in the newly created Boys & Girls Clubs of America’s Pacific Region Resource Development Exchange. The Exchange enables Boys & Girls Clubs throughout the Pacific Region to share best practices and develop partnerships. Our involvement in the Exchange is placing the BGCC as a leader in resource development nationwide."

    answer: >-
      If the Boys & Girls Clubs of Carson were to raise less than the total
      budget expenses for the year, we would scale down activities within each
      school site. Program expenses would be reduced through fewer field trips,
      incentives and activities. If absolutely necessary, we would scale down
      the number of youth served by reducing the number of Tutors and Youth
      Development Professionals at each site. However, we are confident we will
      sustain the College Access Initiative to serve thousands of youth in
      Carson and South Los Angeles.
