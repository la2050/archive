  Disrupt the Desert: Reduce Poverty by Accelerating Social Innovation in South
  LA
project_summary: >-
  We propose a social innovation accelerator where design thinking meets social
  justice, on its home turf, to disrupt the patterns of disinvestment that have
  made So. LA into a human services non-profit desert. Cross-sector teams
  composed of local service providers, designers, and strategists will
  participate in an innovative, multi-modal series of events including 3
  leadership development workshops, a 2.5 day design sprint, and a 1 day
  symposium on how to amplify the impact of So. LA nonprofits.
