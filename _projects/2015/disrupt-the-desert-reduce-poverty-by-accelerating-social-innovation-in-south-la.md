  Disrupt the Desert: Reduce Poverty by Accelerating Social Innovation in South
  LA
project_summary: >-
  We propose a social innovation accelerator where design thinking meets social
  justice, on its home turf, to disrupt the patterns of disinvestment that have
  made So. LA into a human services non-profit desert. Cross-sector teams
  composed of local service providers, designers, and strategists will
  participate in an innovative, multi-modal series of events including 3
  leadership development workshops, a 2.5 day design sprint, and a 1 day
  symposium on how to amplify the impact of So. LA nonprofits.

  'DESCRIBE IN GREATER DETAIL HOW YOU WILL MAKE LA THE HEALTHIEST PLACE TO LIVE: ': "According to the study “Spread Thin: Human Services Organizations in Poor Neighborhoods” based on research conducted at the USC Luskin School, Neighborhoods with a high concentration of poor residents have a much lower density of nonprofit human services organizations. The lack of established nonprofit / community-based organizations (CBOs) has made many neighborhoods in South LA into “human services deserts” (or non-profit deserts). This means that residents in these poor neighborhoods, who are increasingly dependent on CBOs to access needed services, have the most need but the least access to basic services, which adversely affect the social and psychological well-being of residents in the neighborhood. They found that CBOs in predominately African American neighborhoods have a higher rate of closure, not because of a lack of capacity building activities per se, but due to the lack of resources to adopt and implement changes needed. \r\n\r\nOur response: unleash new solutions by “hacking” the most acute problems faced by these organizations, while investing in the capacity of local organizational leaders. We propose to do this by piloting a social innovation accelerator that pairs non-profits based in South LA with entrepreneurs from other fields, namely business, tech, design, and strategy to encourage lateral thinking and spawn creative solutions that not only strengthen their existing infrastructure, but also boost their growth by imparting a new model for problem-solving and skill building. Cross-sector teams composed of local service providers, designers, and strategists will participate in an innovative, multi-modal series of events including 3 leadership development workshops, a 2.5 day design sprint, and a 1 day symposium on how to amplify the impact of So. LA nonprofits.\r\nThe workshops will combine the power of storytelling with other immersive experiences such as site visits to build empathy, trust, cultural competence, and connectedness across teams in advance of the design sprint. The sprint itself will focus on the elements of design – empathy, patterns, divergence, prototyping, and validation – in a compressed format, so as to spawn innovative solutions to real problems in an intensive, yet efficient way. Having uncovered the real human needs to be addressed by engaging community members directly, the symposium will then surface key lessons and opportunities involve community members in the process of determining the path forward.

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "Given the adverse conditions for non-profits in South LA, we anticipate that there will be some work needed to build trust for this pioneering collaboration to succeed. Residents of these neighborhoods are used to organizations that are here today and gone tomorrow, so we are deeply grateful to benefit from our partnership with LA Southwest College - the most visible and enduring symbol of stability in the area. In addition to putting our stake in the ground by locating our offices on the campus of LASC, the key feature of the partnership is SoACT’s work with LASC’s latest initiative Working Families Success Network, a multi-year initiative funded by Achieving The Dream and a consortium of funders.  Fostering a sense of trust within teams will be critical.\r\nWe will address this by creating experiences that build empathy, specifically through using site visits as immersive learning opportunities, and leveraging Marshall Gantz's \"Story of Self\" framework for the workshops."
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: By the success of the events and increased effectiveness of partners.
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    No. Our approach is unique because it brings design thinking and cross
    sector collaboration to local organizations in extremely poor neighborhoods,
    but does so in a culturally sensitive, creative, and immersive way. 
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    As this grant will be leveraged with funds from other sources and build upon
    existing partnerships, we think of the benefit to partners in terms of the
    value received and created, rather than a crude dollar amount. Partnership
    is the very nature of our work - partnering for progress - so we will be
    using these funds strategically to help many partners at once.
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': "We will utilize resources available through other partnerships with funders, and also plan to approach local tech companies for sponsorship. \r\n"
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Event costs - $25K\r\nOther program costs - $60K\r\nMaterials - $5K\r\nOverhead - $10K"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "To ensure that other communities can benefit from this model of place-based, locally-grounded, multi-stakeholder revival, we would also produce a playbook that catalogs guiding principles, methods, and approach, and distills key success factors for replication. Documenting learnings and communicating both successes and learning opportunities will enable others to adapt this model to their local context.\r\n"
