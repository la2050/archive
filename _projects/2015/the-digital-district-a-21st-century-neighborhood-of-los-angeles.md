  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "Los Angeles is a paradox; the vibrant metropolitan region boasting the fourth largest economy in the nation is also home to one of the most dismal levels of civic participation in the country with record breaking low voter turnout. Despite being filled with conscientious consumers, entrepreneurs, activists and advocates Los Angeles is a vacuum of civic engagement.  \r\n\r\nAccording to the LA2050 Vision for a Successful Los Angeles Report, only 22 percent of Los Angeles-area residents formally volunteer on annual basis and only 9 percent ever make it out to the voting polls. A staggering 49 percent of Angelenos have reported never voting in local elections at all. Participation in Neighborhood Councils meetings are declining, subscriptions to local newspapers are diminishing and community centered events are happening with less frequency and urgency. \r\n\r\nIn an effort to improve civic engagement and community involvement, Impact Hub Los Angeles is proposing a centrally-organized, interactive public wifi network in the Arts District that will provide civic updates, disseminate information about events, and help coordinate large-scale community-based initiatives. \r\n\r\nImpact Hub LA would install 13 access points throughout the Arts District, LA River Basin and Skid Row which would create a centrally managed public wifi mesh network - The Digital District -  focused on improving civic engagement. \r\n\r\nAccess to the Digital District’s free wifi requires user registration and participation in live polling of current, real-time issues/policies/legislative initiatives concerning Los Angeles. Impact Hub LA will then collect that information and leverage a membership community of 300 social entrepreneurs in addressing local community issues. This will allow Impact Hub LA to create a physical and virtual Town Hall for individuals to gather and crowdsource issues from the Digital District and provide a mobile based tool that will serve as a project accelerator. \r\n"

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    The installation of the mesh network will prove to be the most difficult
    aspect of this project due to the number of stakeholders that need to be
    engaged. However, Impact Hub LA will leverage its ties with local community
    groups such as; Arts District Community Council LA, Arts District Los
    Angeles - Business Improvement District and the Los Angeles River Artists &
    Business Association to galvanize the neighborhood into a unified direction.
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Evaluation will happen on three levels: 1. The effectiveness of digital campaigns for civic updates; 2. Attendance rates for cultural events and Impact Hub LA's Town Halls 3. Project management for the community-based initiatives that originated from those Town Halls on Networked Capital's mobile tool, Rep.  \r\n\r\nBy way of the public wireless signal, individuals are authenticated by providing contact information allowing for the Digital District to inform people of relevant local issues utilizing the wifi as an outreach opportunity. \r\n\r\nFrom initial contact, the sign in process presents each individual with a registration splash page which also displays either a daily initiative of the area, a civic update, or a small question for immediate polling which is captured and entered into a campaign management database. As each person uses the wifi on a frequent basis, their interaction with either the initiatives, civic engagement and informal polling is analyzed."
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "CityLinkLA, an initiative led by Mayor Eric Garcetti and City Councilman Bob Blumenfield, has a complementary approach to the Digital District.  \r\n\r\nCity officials say more than 30 percent of families in LA still don't have broadband Internet access so this initiative would provide all public infrastructure at the disposal of any company who can provide a baseline service free to residents.   \r\n\r\nThe goal of the CityLinkLA initiative is to have every Angeleno connected to the internet within the next five years; this would provide the technical means of connection but how will that digital connection turn into community and civic engagement? That is what the Digital District is attempting to prototype and master, to provide not only access to information but a structure to participate in civic life. \r\n\r\nSince the lack of civic engagement is a chronic problem in Los Angeles, mere technical availability does not translate into citizens caring about the issues that matter most. Impact Hub LA is aiming to effectively message a clear, step-by-step, channel to get a millennial audience past awareness and into action. "
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "Impact Hub Los Angeles will work with two valued partners to make the Digital District a reality: our IT Management company, EZWorknet and Hub members and local start-up, Networked Capital.\r\n\r\nEZWorknet:\r\nEZWorknet is a IT management company specializing in information/data management, information system security, network infrastructure architecture and business intelligence analysis. EZWorknet is a disabled veteran owned/operated company with a focus non-profits and civically engaged organizations.  \r\n\r\nNetworked Capital:\r\nNetworked Capital accelerates and open-sources the execution of projects.  By uploading the blueprint for a project to the Networked Capital mobile application (Rep), leaders of a project can isolate the core metrics that need to be accomplished, recruit and scale teams, and incentivize people along the way. \r\n\r\nAs a project moves from vision to reality, progress and momentum will be visible in real time. This allows people to work on multiple projects they are passionate about, doing what they do best, while getting paid and accelerating their idea of a better future."
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': "Based on 12 Month Projection:\r\nTotal Cost, First Year: $96,187\r\nRecurring Cost: $72,150\r\n\r\nAdditional licensing and costs associated with maintenance or yearly licensing will be sourced through sponsorships and subscriptions by Arts District neighborhood businesses. All hardware will be covered by warranty through the manufacturers and installation will be sourced by prepaid services."
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Impact HUB LA, in coordination with EZworknet, will oversee the public wireless and network broadcast platform, campaign registration database and event driven analytic reporting via the following cost scheduling. \r\n\r\nBelow is a one year cost analysis projection for 13 access point devices followed by recurring licensing and utility service fees.\r\n\r\nSetup Node: $7399 first year, per device\r\nWireless Access Points: 13 access points, $1599 each\r\nInstallation: $250 per device\r\nLicense: $150 per device\r\nInternet Service: $350 /mo per device\r\nCampaign, Analysis, Registration Platform: $100/mo per device\r\n\r\nRecurring Costs Per Node: $5,550\r\nLicense Per Year: $150 per device\r\nInternet Service Per Year: $4,200\r\nCampaign Analysis Registration Platform: $1,200 \r\n\r\n\r\nBased on 12 Month Projection:\r\nTotal Cost, First Year: $96,187\r\nRecurring Cost: $72,150\r\n\r\n"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "The success of Impact Hub Los Angeles' Digital District is based, first and foremost on the number of users that participate in the full process of the Digital District: to message the millennial community of the Arts District on local issues relevant to them, providing a physical space for town hall like meetings, and a path towards leading their own community based initiative. Based on use and responsiveness of the digital district, it will expand and into neighboring communities such as Boyle Heights and Little Tokyo,  expanding exposure of local and community organizations. As more of the area becomes connected to this civic network, greater exposure of community based events and local initiatives will become available to a greater portion of angelenos as well as potentially laying a foundation for public wifi programs across the county.\r\n\r\n"

    answer: "Los Angeles is a paradox; the vibrant metropolitan region boasting the fourth largest economy in the nation is also home to one of the most dismal levels of civic participation in the country with record breaking low voter turnout. Despite being filled with conscientious consumers, entrepreneurs, activists and advocates Los Angeles is a vacuum of civic engagement.  \r\n\r\nAccording to the LA2050 Vision for a Successful Los Angeles Report, only 22 percent of Los Angeles-area residents formally volunteer on annual basis and only 9 percent ever make it out to the voting polls. A staggering 49 percent of Angelenos have reported never voting in local elections at all. Participation in Neighborhood Councils meetings are declining, subscriptions to local newspapers are diminishing and community centered events are happening with less frequency and urgency. \r\n\r\nIn an effort to improve civic engagement and community involvement, Impact Hub Los Angeles is proposing a centrally-organized, interactive public wifi network in the Arts District that will provide civic updates, disseminate information about events, and help coordinate large-scale community-based initiatives. \r\n\r\nImpact Hub LA would install 13 access points throughout the Arts District, LA River Basin and Skid Row which would create a centrally managed public wifi mesh network - The Digital District -  focused on improving civic engagement. \r\n\r\nAccess to the Digital District’s free wifi requires user registration and participation in live polling of current, real-time issues/policies/legislative initiatives concerning Los Angeles. Impact Hub LA will then collect that information and leverage a membership community of 300 social entrepreneurs in addressing local community issues. This will allow Impact Hub LA to create a physical and virtual Town Hall for individuals to gather and crowdsource issues from the Digital District and provide a mobile based tool that will serve as a project accelerator. \r\n"

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      The installation of the mesh network will prove to be the most difficult
      aspect of this project due to the number of stakeholders that need to be
      engaged. However, Impact Hub LA will leverage its ties with local
      community groups such as; Arts District Community Council LA, Arts
      District Los Angeles - Business Improvement District and the Los Angeles
      River Artists & Business Association to galvanize the neighborhood into a
      unified direction.
  - name: Please explain how you will evaluate your work.
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Evaluation will happen on three levels: 1. The effectiveness of digital campaigns for civic updates; 2. Attendance rates for cultural events and Impact Hub LA's Town Halls 3. Project management for the community-based initiatives that originated from those Town Halls on Networked Capital's mobile tool, Rep.  \r\n\r\nBy way of the public wireless signal, individuals are authenticated by providing contact information allowing for the Digital District to inform people of relevant local issues utilizing the wifi as an outreach opportunity. \r\n\r\nFrom initial contact, the sign in process presents each individual with a registration splash page which also displays either a daily initiative of the area, a civic update, or a small question for immediate polling which is captured and entered into a campaign management database. As each person uses the wifi on a frequent basis, their interaction with either the initiatives, civic engagement and informal polling is analyzed."

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "CityLinkLA, an initiative led by Mayor Eric Garcetti and City Councilman Bob Blumenfield, has a complementary approach to the Digital District.  \r\n\r\nCity officials say more than 30 percent of families in LA still don't have broadband Internet access so this initiative would provide all public infrastructure at the disposal of any company who can provide a baseline service free to residents.   \r\n\r\nThe goal of the CityLinkLA initiative is to have every Angeleno connected to the internet within the next five years; this would provide the technical means of connection but how will that digital connection turn into community and civic engagement? That is what the Digital District is attempting to prototype and master, to provide not only access to information but a structure to participate in civic life. \r\n\r\nSince the lack of civic engagement is a chronic problem in Los Angeles, mere technical availability does not translate into citizens caring about the issues that matter most. Impact Hub LA is aiming to effectively message a clear, step-by-step, channel to get a millennial audience past awareness and into action. "

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "The success of Impact Hub Los Angeles' Digital District is based, first and foremost on the number of users that participate in the full process of the Digital District: to message the millennial community of the Arts District on local issues relevant to them, providing a physical space for town hall like meetings, and a path towards leading their own community based initiative. Based on use and responsiveness of the digital district, it will expand and into neighboring communities such as Boyle Heights and Little Tokyo,  expanding exposure of local and community organizations. As more of the area becomes connected to this civic network, greater exposure of community based events and local initiatives will become available to a greater portion of angelenos as well as potentially laying a foundation for public wifi programs across the county.\r\n\r\n"
