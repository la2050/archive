project_summary: >-
  We change the way music is taught - teaching music theory, songwriting, audio
  engineering & production + enabling students to be creators, not just
  consumers, of music. We connect students with music industry pros, & build
  bridges from the classrooms to careers through internships & more. 
   
   We’d like your help to capitalize on the momentum from our pilot (Jan-March 2015) and the partnerships we have since developed to launch PWM in schools across LA, focusing our impact on at-risk students.
Please specify below: >-
  We can run programs wherever our partners, Green Dot Public Schools, and The
  Harmony Project, are operating.
