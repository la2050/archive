  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "We’re opening doors for kids with relevant music and technology education, and we follow up by connecting them with the music industry and career opportunities right here in LA. We’re not just giving music education a much needed update, we’re preparing kids for a world that is tech driven and empowering them to be creators of their own work. We’re doing this in the schools where it’s not happening. In LA, the media and entertainment capital of the world, we want our kids to be the resource that fuels our creative industries, by providing education that prepares our kids for those jobs. We’re making LA the best place to learn for ALL kids in LA, regardless of resources or skill level.\r\n\r\nPlay with Music works directly with schools, teachers and administrations to fill 3 major gaps in music/education:\r\n\r\nCREATIVITY & COLLABORATION\r\nMusic education has mostly been unchanged since the 19th century. Our students get to create their own music, in collaboration with their peers and music industry professionals. This develops crucial skills in creative thinking, teamwork, communication, organization, and more. We want our students not to be just consumers of music, but creators of it, and to learn by doing. \r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SKILLS\r\nWe teach technology. Music software (audio engineering, production, recording, set-up, & more) is essential to making music today. Beyond music, digital literacy and tech skills are essential in today's workforce. We’re not  just empowering students to better use technology as a work tool, we are opening their eyes to see technology as a creative tool as well, helping break down the digital divide, and paving a way for students enter into LA's “creative class”.\r\n\r\nFROM CLASSROOM TO CAREERS\r\nOur students meet, are mentored by, and collaborate with, professionals who make their living in the music industry. These mentors bring insight into the creative professional landscape and help students expand their sense of what is possible for their own futures. We also provide internship opportunities for students who complete the program through our amazing partners! This creates important gateways and opportunities for at-risk kids to access the industries in their city. We also provide graduates with support beyond the program through ongoing guidance and communication on social media about education and career opportunities."
