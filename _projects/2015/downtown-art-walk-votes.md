  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    We anticipate that political speech will foster discourse, which is
    sometimes impolite.  Our goal is to encourage civilized discussion and
    debate, and to encourage speech across the spectrum of political views.  Our
    volunteers will be attentive to the quality of the discussion, and will
    intervene when and if discourse becomes too heated or disruptive.  
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    We will post a reward for bringing "I Voted" stickers to the Art Walk
    immediately after the election.  This may be an artist-designed small poster
    or large postcard relating to the theme of the event - My Vote Matters.  We
    will tally the number of stickers we receive (or the number of posters we
    give out).  We will ask each person who submits a sticker whether they have
    voted in an election (or mid-year election) in the past.  
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    Yes.  Political parties and the League of Women voters conduct vote drives. 
    Our proposal is unique in that it ties voting with a social event (the Art
    Walk) and special programming designed around the theme - My Vote Matters. 
    Art Walk gathers a large constituency of people interested in the arts and
    culture.  Many of our followers are young and are have not yet become
    involved in the political process.  We can involve our followers through a
    number of activities not traditionally associated with voters registration
    drives - visiting galleries, viewing murals, attending film series, etc. 
    These participants will be rewarded for returning after the election and
    showing that they voted.  We will be using culture and social interaction to
    encourage participation in the political process.  We will also encourage
    families with children to participate in a "kinder walk" of
    politically-themed murals to introduce children to the idea of participating
    in the political system.
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "We would ask the Regent Theater (and if not the Regent, another local theater) to program films relating to the political process and live broadcasts of major debates as well as live debates on local issues of interest.  We would like to be able to offer the theater up to $10,000 for the use of their facilities, staffing and film rentals. \r\n\r\nWe would ask the Last Bookstore to offer programs and panels by authors and politicians in the week leading up to Art Walk, and to frame these programs under the same rubric - My Vote Matters.  We would like to be able to offer the Last Bookstore up to $2,000 for staff and promotion costs and speakers fees for this programming."
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    We think that the cost will be under $45,000.  This will include developing
    programming and adding staff for the events - for mural tours, gallery
    tours, artwork  social media, as well as posters/cards for voters.  This
    will also include costs incurred by the theater for debates and films and
    the book store for programs and panels.
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Staff for development and guiding of five mural tours based on political themes:  $7,500\r\nStaff for development and guiding of ten \"kinder walks\" for groups of children and their families.  These walks will be tied to politically-themed murals and gallery exhibits: $12,500\r\nArtist fees and printing for My Vote Matters posters/cards: $500\r\nArtist fees, permit fees, paint and coating for a My Vote Matters mural: $7,500\r\nStaff for coordinating and promoting My Vote Matters events:  $2,500\r\nCost for Regent Theater (or other local theater) for venue, film rental, staff for debates and film series: $10,000\r\nCost for Last Bookstore for staff, speakers fees and publicity: $2,000\r\n"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    We want to encourage young people to vote and to participate in the
    political process by volunteering for campaigns and causes they believe in. 
    We can ask for feedback on our Facebook page - e.g. "did you volunteer with
    a political campaign as a result of a contact you made at Art Walk?"  This,
    combined with the number of "I voted" stickers we receive at the Art Walk
    following the election, will give us some idea of how well we have
    succeeded.  We will evaluate this feedback in framing how to proceed in
    future election cycles.

    answer: "Downtown Los Angeles Art Walk reaches over 100,000 through its Facebook page and other social media.  Over 20,000 people from all over the County of Los Angeles attend each monthly Art Walk.  We intend to put the focus on civic involvement, by sponsoring viewing sites for political debates, candidates forums, politically-themed art exhibits at downtown galleries, voters registration tables and screenings of films concerning the political process.  We will develop a mural tour focusing on politically-themed art.  We will develop a tour for children and their families focusing on the political process and encouraging children to care about elections.\r\n\r\nEvery vote makes a difference, and we want our followers to appreciate how important their participation in the political process is.  We will encourage our followers to lead their own \"get out the vote\" drives, and will add links to voters registration and information sites on our Facebook page and website.  "

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      We anticipate that political speech will foster discourse, which is
      sometimes impolite.  Our goal is to encourage civilized discussion and
      debate, and to encourage speech across the spectrum of political views. 
      Our volunteers will be attentive to the quality of the discussion, and
      will intervene when and if discourse becomes too heated or disruptive.

      We will post a reward for bringing "I Voted" stickers to the Art Walk
      immediately after the election.  This may be an artist-designed small
      poster or large postcard relating to the theme of the event - My Vote
      Matters.  We will tally the number of stickers we receive (or the number
      of posters we give out).  We will ask each person who submits a sticker
      whether they have voted in an election (or mid-year election) in the
      past.

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      Yes.  Political parties and the League of Women voters conduct vote
      drives.  Our proposal is unique in that it ties voting with a social event
      (the Art Walk) and special programming designed around the theme - My Vote
      Matters.  Art Walk gathers a large constituency of people interested in
      the arts and culture.  Many of our followers are young and are have not
      yet become involved in the political process.  We can involve our
      followers through a number of activities not traditionally associated with
      voters registration drives - visiting galleries, viewing murals, attending
      film series, etc.  These participants will be rewarded for returning after
      the election and showing that they voted.  We will be using culture and
      social interaction to encourage participation in the political process. 
      We will also encourage families with children to participate in a "kinder
      walk" of politically-themed murals to introduce children to the idea of
      participating in the political system.

    answer: "We would ask the Regent Theater (and if not the Regent, another local theater) to program films relating to the political process and live broadcasts of major debates as well as live debates on local issues of interest.  We would like to be able to offer the theater up to $10,000 for the use of their facilities, staffing and film rentals. \r\n\r\nWe would ask the Last Bookstore to offer programs and panels by authors and politicians in the week leading up to Art Walk, and to frame these programs under the same rubric - My Vote Matters.  We would like to be able to offer the Last Bookstore up to $2,000 for staff and promotion costs and speakers fees for this programming."

      How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      We think that the cost will be under $45,000.  This will include
      developing programming and adding staff for the events - for mural tours,
      gallery tours, artwork  social media, as well as posters/cards for
      voters.  This will also include costs incurred by the theater for debates
      and films and the book store for programs and panels.

      We want to encourage young people to vote and to participate in the
      political process by volunteering for campaigns and causes they believe
      in.  We can ask for feedback on our Facebook page - e.g. "did you
      volunteer with a political campaign as a result of a contact you made at
      Art Walk?"  This, combined with the number of "I voted" stickers we
      receive at the Art Walk following the election, will give us some idea of
      how well we have succeeded.  We will evaluate this feedback in framing how
      to proceed in future election cycles.
