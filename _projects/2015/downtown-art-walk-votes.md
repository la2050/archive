'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Downtown Los Angeles Art Walk reaches over 100,000 through its Facebook page
  and other social media. Over 20,000 people from all over the County of Los
  Angeles attend each monthly Art Walk. We intend to put the focus on civic
  involvement, by sponsoring viewing sites for political debates, candidates
  forums, politically-themed art exhibits at downtown galleries, voters
  registration tables and screenings of films concerning the political process.
  We will develop a mural tour focusing on politically-themed art. We will
  develop a tour for children and their families focusing on the political
  process and encouraging children to care about elections.
   
   Every vote makes a difference, and we want our followers to appreciate how important their participation in the political process is. We will encourage our followers to lead their own "get out the vote" drives, and will add links to voters registration and information sites on our Facebook page and website.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  We anticipate that political speech will foster discourse, which is sometimes
  impolite. Our goal is to encourage civilized discussion and debate, and to
  encourage speech across the spectrum of political views. Our volunteers will
  be attentive to the quality of the discussion, and will intervene when and if
  discourse becomes too heated or disruptive.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We will post a reward for bringing "I Voted" stickers to the Art Walk
  immediately after the election. This may be an artist-designed small poster or
  large postcard relating to the theme of the event - My Vote Matters. We will
  tally the number of stickers we receive (or the number of posters we give
  out). We will ask each person who submits a sticker whether they have voted in
  an election (or mid-year election) in the past.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Yes. Political parties and the League of Women voters conduct vote drives. Our
  proposal is unique in that it ties voting with a social event (the Art Walk)
  and special programming designed around the theme - My Vote Matters. Art Walk
  gathers a large constituency of people interested in the arts and culture.
  Many of our followers are young and are have not yet become involved in the
  political process. We can involve our followers through a number of activities
  not traditionally associated with voters registration drives - visiting
  galleries, viewing murals, attending film series, etc. These participants will
  be rewarded for returning after the election and showing that they voted. We
  will be using culture and social interaction to encourage participation in the
  political process. We will also encourage families with children to
  participate in a "kinder walk" of politically-themed murals to introduce
  children to the idea of participating in the political system.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  We would ask the Regent Theater (and if not the Regent, another local theater)
  to program films relating to the political process and live broadcasts of
  major debates as well as live debates on local issues of interest. We would
  like to be able to offer the theater up to $10,000 for the use of their
  facilities, staffing and film rentals. 
   
   We would ask the Last Bookstore to offer programs and panels by authors and politicians in the week leading up to Art Walk, and to frame these programs under the same rubric - My Vote Matters. We would like to be able to offer the Last Bookstore up to $2,000 for staff and promotion costs and speakers fees for this programming.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 â€“ how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  We think that the cost will be under $45,000. This will include developing
  programming and adding staff for the events - for mural tours, gallery tours,
  artwork social media, as well as posters/cards for voters. This will also
  include costs incurred by the theater for debates and films and the book store
  for programs and panels.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
  Staff for development and guiding of five mural tours based on political
  themes: $7,500
   Staff for development and guiding of ten "kinder walks" for groups of children and their families. These walks will be tied to politically-themed murals and gallery exhibits: $12,500
   Artist fees and printing for My Vote Matters posters/cards: $500
   Artist fees, permit fees, paint and coating for a My Vote Matters mural: $7,500
   Staff for coordinating and promoting My Vote Matters events: $2,500
   Cost for Regent Theater (or other local theater) for venue, film rental, staff for debates and film series: $10,000
   Cost for Last Bookstore for staff, speakers fees and publicity: $2,000
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  We want to encourage young people to vote and to participate in the political
  process by volunteering for campaigns and causes they believe in. We can ask
  for feedback on our Facebook page - e.g. "did you volunteer with a political
  campaign as a result of a contact you made at Art Walk?" This, combined with
  the number of "I voted" stickers we receive at the Art Walk following the
  election, will give us some idea of how well we have succeeded. We will
  evaluate this feedback in framing how to proceed in future election cycles.
