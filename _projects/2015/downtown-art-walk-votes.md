How do you plan to use these resources to make change?:

How will your proposal improve the following “Connect” metrics?:

Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "Downtown Los Angeles Art Walk reaches over 100,000 through its Facebook page and other social media.  Over 20,000 people from all over the County of Los Angeles attend each monthly Art Walk.  We intend to put the focus on civic involvement, by sponsoring viewing sites for political debates, candidates forums, politically-themed art exhibits at downtown galleries, voters registration tables and screenings of films concerning the political process.  We will develop a mural tour focusing on politically-themed art.  We will develop a tour for children and their families focusing on the political process and encouraging children to care about elections.\r\n\r\nEvery vote makes a difference, and we want our followers to appreciate how important their participation in the political process is.  We will encourage our followers to lead their own \"get out the vote\" drives, and will add links to voters registration and information sites on our Facebook page and website.  "
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We will post a reward for bringing "I Voted" stickers to the Art Walk
  immediately after the election.  This may be an artist-designed small poster
  or large postcard relating to the theme of the event - My Vote Matters.  We
  will tally the number of stickers we receive (or the number of posters we give
  out).  We will ask each person who submits a sticker whether they have voted
  in an election (or mid-year election) in the past.  
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
  - Money (financial capital)
  - Volunteers/staff (human capital)
  - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
  - Community outreach
  - Network/relationship support
