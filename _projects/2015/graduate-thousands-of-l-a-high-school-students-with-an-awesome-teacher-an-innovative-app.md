  Graduate thousands of L.A. High School Students with an Awesome Teacher & an
  Innovative App

project_summary: >-
  Our proposal is to take otherwise non-graduating students and help them
  graduate by focusing on the fail they received in biology class (often the
  only obstacle between them and a diploma).  
Please specify below: ''
category: learn
'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  It's difficult for any human being to sit in a classroom for six hours a day.
  They should have to do endure that to graduate from high school; however, by
  focusing one a huge requirement for high school graduation (passing biology),
  we can not only make students smarter with the notification and feedback
  system we've developed to make every student engage socially (but privately)
  in biology class. By focusing on biology class, we think we can help these
  kids graduate from high school and change the trajectory of their lives. 
   
   We'll work with who we feel is one of the most accomplished science teachers in the nation who has achieved goals no on would have ever thought possible. Not only does he teach, but it turns out most of his students are teachers too. The 8th Graders teach the sixth graders all the math, science and writing to get every student at a level most people would have a hard time believing. We think his approach and what we discovered in the field are aligned. We think its the magic behind what many consider impossible. We're duplicating this process with our software, and we believe that by giving our tool away to students and teachers that we can begin to truly achieve 100% graduation rates. Of course, we have to gather the data, learn from our mistakes, and work with some of the best programmers (founding CEO of Pandora.com, Jon Kraft, and the guy who built one of the most secure websites in the world (stamps.com). We will talk to teachers and students everyday to make sure we're doing it right. Once we get it right a year from now, we'll be able to duplicate our success year after year, and apply what we learned by working with other teachers in other subject areas.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Having taught all over Los Angeles, we know we're going to have to reach out
  to students who have a lot challenges going on in their lives; however, we
  think that these very same kids use apps like Instagram and Snapchat because
  of the notifications and social engagement. Our app has a similar type of
  engagement, but actually helps the student improve their real life outcomes.
  Every student wants to be successful, but some would rather just fail than to
  sit in a classroom. We're offering them a compelling alternative.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We wil evaluate our work by comparing results with students who use our
  platform to students who use another learning platform. We think LAUSD is
  probably tackling this problem now on some level. Our Learning Xprize insights
  surprised even us. This got us pretty excited and even inspired some legends
  in the tech industry to work with us. We think it could be done in a much more
  effective way by segmenting the biology content and assessment in a way that
  is delightfully simple and clear. By working closely with 2-4 high schools and
  their counseling staff, we will compare the performance of 200-400 students
  who use our app compared with those who don't.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There are are organization that do similar work, but we haven't been able to
  find another company that takes the burden from the teacher, and makes every
  student a teacher. We think it's physically impossible for a teacher to
  provide all of the feedback and attention a student needs to master a subject.
  However, a slightly smarter student can help another student in an area where
  he is slightly smarter, and we realized in our work that kids would rather
  have kids teaching them than a teacher. It's more fun that way. It's social.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': |-
  We will be working with Carlos Lauchu
   Jon Kraft, founding CEO of Pandora, and Girish Venkat, the guy who built one of the most secure websites in the world - stamps.com (it's like printing money). We will work with some of the best programmers in the world (Lift Off) to make sure the security and level of programming is world class. This will help us scale to expand our efforts. 
   $75,000 will be spent on programmers working for a highly discounted rate through Lift Off, our technical partner on this project. 
   $25,000 will be spent on servers, UX designers, teacher support inside of classrooms to make sure there's a conduit between the teachers, students, UX designers, engineers, and programmers. 
   
   Except for Carly Saltzman who will be paid approximately $15,000 to work directly with schools and teachers over a year in classrooms, no other partners will be getting paid for this project. 
   
   We think it will add an awesome capability to our Xprize Learning platform.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  To create the biology class and a dynamic assessment, it will cost $100,000.
  We have developed an preliminary interface and a set of questions and lessons
  with Mr. Lauchu. We discussed it with Girish Venkat, the technical lead on the
  project, who estimated it would be enough to build a biology class feature
  into our application.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  $75,000 Programming & Engineering Costs
   $15,000 School & Teacher Liaison & Expenses
   $ 5,000 Interface Design
   $ 5,000 Servers, extra support & expenses
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Once we succeed with the biology class, we will have built the infrastructure
  to tackle any other subject on the platform. We can expand to more high
  schools throughout the city, and make sure graduating from high school is
  never problematic for any student who just doesn't want to do the seat time.
  With our team, we think our success will be able to be duplicated at any high
  school in the United States. We could also expand to other subjects to make it
  very difficult NOT TO GRADUATE. We realize that graduating all high school
  students sounds impossible given the amount of effort that has gone into it.
  We also think that it's really tough to learn the way most kids do today so we
  understand why some kids would rather just quit. By giving students a tool in
  the palm of their hands, we think we can scale the success of our proposal
  well beyond high schools in the city of Los Angeles. At this point, we're
  excited to take it one step at a time.

    answer: "It's difficult for any human being to sit in a classroom for six hours a day.  They should have to do endure that to graduate from high school; however, by focusing one a huge requirement for high school graduation (passing biology), we can not only make students smarter with the notification and feedback system we've developed to make every student engage socially (but privately) in biology class.  By focusing on biology class, we think we can help these kids graduate from high school and change the trajectory of their lives.  \r\n\r\nWe'll work with who we feel is one of the most accomplished science teachers in the nation who has achieved goals no on would have ever thought possible.   Not only does he teach, but it turns out most of his students are teachers too. The 8th Graders teach the sixth graders all the math, science and writing to get every student at a level most people would have a hard time believing.   We think his approach and what we discovered in the field are aligned.  We think its the magic behind what many consider impossible.  We're duplicating this process with our software, and we believe that by giving our tool away to students and teachers that we can begin to truly achieve 100% graduation rates.  Of course, we have to gather the data, learn from our mistakes, and work with some of the best programmers (founding CEO of Pandora.com, Jon Kraft, and the guy who built one of the most secure websites in the world (stamps.com).  We will talk to teachers and students everyday to make sure we're doing it right.  Once we get it right a year from now, we'll be able to duplicate our success year after year, and apply what we learned by working with other teachers in other subject areas.  "

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      Having taught all over Los Angeles, we know we're going to have to reach
      out to students who have a lot challenges going on in their lives;
      however, we think that these very same kids use apps like Instagram and
      Snapchat because of the notifications and social engagement.  Our app has
      a similar type of engagement, but actually helps the student improve their
      real life outcomes.  Every student wants to be successful, but some would
      rather just fail than to sit in a classroom.  We're offering them a
      compelling alternative.   
  - name: Please explain how you will evaluate your work.
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      We wil evaluate our work by comparing results with students who use our
      platform to students who use another learning platform.  We think LAUSD is
      probably tackling this problem now on some level.  Our Learning Xprize
      insights surprised even us.   This got us pretty excited and even inspired
      some legends in the tech industry to work with us.  We think it could be
      done in a much more effective way by segmenting the biology content and
      assessment in a way that is delightfully simple and clear.   By working
      closely with 2-4 high schools and their counseling staff, we will compare
      the performance of 200-400 students who use our app compared with those
      who don't.

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      There are are organization that do similar work, but we haven't been able
      to find another company that takes the burden from the teacher, and makes
      every student a teacher.  We think it's physically impossible for a
      teacher to provide all of the feedback and attention a student needs to
      master a subject.   However, a slightly smarter student can help another
      student in an area where he is slightly smarter, and we realized in our
      work that kids would rather have kids teaching them than a teacher.  It's
      more fun that way.  It's social.

      To create the biology class and a dynamic assessment, it will cost
      $100,000.  We have developed an preliminary interface and a set of
      questions and lessons with Mr. Lauchu.  We discussed it with Girish
      Venkat, the technical lead on the project, who estimated it would be
      enough to build a biology class feature into our application.

    answer: >-
      Once we succeed with the biology class, we will have built the
      infrastructure to tackle any other subject on the platform.  We can expand
      to more high schools throughout the city, and make sure graduating from
      high school is never problematic for any student who just doesn't want to
      do the seat time.  With our team, we think our success will be able to be
      duplicated at any high school in the United States.  We could also expand
      to other subjects to make it very difficult NOT TO GRADUATE.  We realize
      that graduating all high school students sounds impossible given the
      amount of effort that has gone into it.  We also think that it's really
      tough to learn the way most kids do today so we understand why some kids
      would rather just quit.  By giving students a tool in the palm of their
      hands, we think we can scale the success of our proposal well beyond high
      schools in the city of Los Angeles.   At this point, we're excited to take
      it one step at a time.
