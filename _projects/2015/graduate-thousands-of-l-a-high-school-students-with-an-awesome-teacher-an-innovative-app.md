  Graduate thousands of L.A. High School Students with an Awesome Teacher & an
  Innovative App
project_summary: >-
  Our proposal is to take otherwise non-graduating students and help them
  graduate by focusing on the fail they received in biology class (often the
  only obstacle between them and a diploma).

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "It's difficult for any human being to sit in a classroom for six hours a day.  They should have to do endure that to graduate from high school; however, by focusing one a huge requirement for high school graduation (passing biology), we can not only make students smarter with the notification and feedback system we've developed to make every student engage socially (but privately) in biology class.  By focusing on biology class, we think we can help these kids graduate from high school and change the trajectory of their lives.  \r\n\r\nWe'll work with who we feel is one of the most accomplished science teachers in the nation who has achieved goals no on would have ever thought possible.   Not only does he teach, but it turns out most of his students are teachers too. The 8th Graders teach the sixth graders all the math, science and writing to get every student at a level most people would have a hard time believing.   We think his approach and what we discovered in the field are aligned.  We think its the magic behind what many consider impossible.  We're duplicating this process with our software, and we believe that by giving our tool away to students and teachers that we can begin to truly achieve 100% graduation rates.  Of course, we have to gather the data, learn from our mistakes, and work with some of the best programmers (founding CEO of Pandora.com, Jon Kraft, and the guy who built one of the most secure websites in the world (stamps.com).  We will talk to teachers and students everyday to make sure we're doing it right.  Once we get it right a year from now, we'll be able to duplicate our success year after year, and apply what we learned by working with other teachers in other subject areas.  "

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    Having taught all over Los Angeles, we know we're going to have to reach out
    to students who have a lot challenges going on in their lives; however, we
    think that these very same kids use apps like Instagram and Snapchat because
    of the notifications and social engagement.  Our app has a similar type of
    engagement, but actually helps the student improve their real life
    outcomes.  Every student wants to be successful, but some would rather just
    fail than to sit in a classroom.  We're offering them a compelling
    alternative.   
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    We wil evaluate our work by comparing results with students who use our
    platform to students who use another learning platform.  We think LAUSD is
    probably tackling this problem now on some level.  Our Learning Xprize
    insights surprised even us.   This got us pretty excited and even inspired
    some legends in the tech industry to work with us.  We think it could be
    done in a much more effective way by segmenting the biology content and
    assessment in a way that is delightfully simple and clear.   By working
    closely with 2-4 high schools and their counseling staff, we will compare
    the performance of 200-400 students who use our app compared with those who
    don't.     
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    There are are organization that do similar work, but we haven't been able to
    find another company that takes the burden from the teacher, and makes every
    student a teacher.  We think it's physically impossible for a teacher to
    provide all of the feedback and attention a student needs to master a
    subject.   However, a slightly smarter student can help another student in
    an area where he is slightly smarter, and we realized in our work that kids
    would rather have kids teaching them than a teacher.  It's more fun that
    way.  It's social. 
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "We will be working with Carlos Lauchu\r\nJon Kraft, founding CEO of Pandora, and Girish Venkat, the guy who built one of the most secure websites in the world - stamps.com (it's like printing money).   We will work with some of the best programmers in the world (Lift Off) to make sure the security and level of programming is world class.  This will help us scale to expand our efforts.  \r\n$75,000 will be spent on programmers working for a highly discounted rate through Lift Off, our technical partner on this project.  \r\n$25,000 will be spent on servers, UX designers, teacher support inside of classrooms to make sure there's a conduit between the teachers, students, UX designers, engineers, and programmers.   \r\n\r\nExcept for Carly Saltzman who will be paid approximately $15,000 to work directly with schools and teachers over a year in classrooms, no other partners will be getting paid for this project.  \r\n\r\nWe think it will add an awesome capability to our Xprize Learning platform.  \r\n"
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    To create the biology class and a dynamic assessment, it will cost
    $100,000.  We have developed an preliminary interface and a set of questions
    and lessons with Mr. Lauchu.  We discussed it with Girish Venkat, the
    technical lead on the project, who estimated it would be enough to build a
    biology class feature into our application. 
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "$75,000 Programming & Engineering Costs\r\n$15,000 School & Teacher Liaison & Expenses\r\n$ 5,000  Interface Design\r\n$ 5,000  Servers, extra support & expenses \r\n"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    Once we succeed with the biology class, we will have built the
    infrastructure to tackle any other subject on the platform.  We can expand
    to more high schools throughout the city, and make sure graduating from high
    school is never problematic for any student who just doesn't want to do the
    seat time.  With our team, we think our success will be able to be
    duplicated at any high school in the United States.  We could also expand to
    other subjects to make it very difficult NOT TO GRADUATE.  We realize that
    graduating all high school students sounds impossible given the amount of
    effort that has gone into it.  We also think that it's really tough to learn
    the way most kids do today so we understand why some kids would rather just
    quit.  By giving students a tool in the palm of their hands, we think we can
    scale the success of our proposal well beyond high schools in the city of
    Los Angeles.   At this point, we're excited to take it one step at a time.
