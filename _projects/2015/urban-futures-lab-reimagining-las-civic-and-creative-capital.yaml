Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: "Urban Futures Lab creates work that matters. It reimagines Los Angeles’ civic and creative capital by altering how young adults from under-resourced communities of color access opportunities that employ their inventiveness and support their professional aspirations. The Lab provides young adult Fellows with career-building skills that simultaneously strengthen the region through work of social consequence. It prepares Fellows to pursue higher-earning professions that require varied skill sets through direct work on Public Matters projects. Unlike conventional service learning or workforce development programs that focus on “the job, ” the Lab focuses on Fellows’ career arcs. \r\n\r\nYoung adults have the financial imperative to work, the desire to pursue meaningful work, but lack outlets, professional networks, or structure. Often, those pursuing higher education don’t have access to paid civic opportunities. Most young adults lack the on-going mentorship and support essential for their educational and professional growth. For those who desire to work in cross-disciplinary fields or create their own jobs, the challenges are even greater. They are even more formidable for young adults from resource-poor LA neighborhoods. \r\n\r\nThrough Urban Futures Lab, Public Matters senior staff act as project leaders and mentors, guiding Fellows’ work in LA neighborhoods. Fellows work in project-based teams, interacting with Public Matters’ vast network of multi-sector partners and collaborators. \r\n\r\nUrban Futures Lab Fellows are paid living wages to use creative, visual and critical thinking skills in neighborhood-based projects. Fellows participate in regular expert-led workshops and trainings. Concentrated summer labs and retreats add in-depth learning. Fellows gain career and life skills that include: \r\n\r\n•\tProject Conceptualization, Design, and Implementation\r\n•\tLeadership and Communication\r\n•\tCommunity Engagement and Relationship Building \r\n•\tPublic Speaking, Performances and Presentations\r\n•\tMentoring \r\n•\tCreative Skills (including Media Production, Social Marketing + Design)\r\n•\tPersonal and Community Health\r\n•\tCultural and Economic Development\r\n\r\nAnticipated projects include Hidden Hi Fi, an arts and cultural economic development project in Historic Filipinotown; an urban planning and design project with East LA high school students; assisting the LA Kitchen to develop a line of healthy, affordable snacks; and Market Makeovers that address healthy food access."
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "We will evaluate two tracks: Fellows’ learning/career development and Fellows’ impact on LA neighborhoods. \r\n\r\nWe will evaluate learning/career development at various points during a Fellows’ tenure through metrics including: contribution to projects; quality of work; partner/client feedback. We will gauge written, verbal and visual communication skills, time management, project implementation and capacity for independent work. Fellows will maintain a portfolio with client references and their own reflections, allowing us to track their progress. \r\n\r\nTo assess Public Matters and Fellows’ impact on neighborhoods, we will use evaluation methods that track their contributions as part of Public Matters’ projects. In general, we employ mixed-methods evaluations – quantitative (surveys) and qualitative data (structured interviews and direct observation). Fellows will participate as both subjects and participants in our research, and thereby expand their own research skill set. "
