title: Compost Hubs throughout Los Angeles
project_summary: >-
  L.A. Compost and Kiss the Ground are partnering to create a local solution to
  composting in Los Angeles.  We are currently composting over 2,000lbs of food
  weekly across 5 hubs countywide. Over the next 5 years we plan to expand our
  work by building 20 more hubs and establishing composting programs that will
  keep unnecessary food scraps out of landfills, providing communities with the
  tools and education needed to compost locally.

Where will you be working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - San Gabriel Valley
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South LA
  - Westside
  - South Bay
  - Antelope Valley
  - County of Los Angeles
  - City of Los Angeles
  - LAUSD
How do you plan to use these resources to make change?:
  - Conduct research
  - Engage residents and stakeholders
  - Expand a pilot or a program
  - Mobilize for systems change
  - Advocate with policymakers and leaders
  - Implement and track policy
How will your proposal improve the following “Live” metrics?:
  - Access to healthy food
  - Percent of imported water
  - Obesity rates
  - Acres and miles of polluted waterways
  - Percentage of LA communities that are resilient (Dream Metric)
  - Percentage of tree canopy cover (Dream Metric)
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "1) Track weight of organics diverted from landfills: Prior to depositing organics into one of our composting systems, we weigh and record the amount of food or yards scraps. This record gives us a clear picture as to how many organics are being diverted from landfills each week, month, and year.\r\n\r\n2) Record attendance at workshops/hubs:  By tracking how many people are interacting with their local compost hub, as well as tracking attendance at workshops we will be able to measure the interest from the local community. As interest and educational opportunities increase, more individuals will have the tools needed to compost on their own.\r\n\r\n3) Measure how much finished compost is being created: By weighing the finished product we can determine how much finished compost is being used and kept in the same community where it was created. This will allow us to gauge how many gardens and farms we are contributing to throughout the county.\r\n"
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
  - Money (financial capital)
  - Volunteers/staff (human capital)
  - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
  - 'Infrastructure (building/space/vehicles, etc.)'
  - Education/training
  - 'Technical infrastructure (computers, etc.)'
  - Community outreach
  - Network/relationship support
  - Quality improvement research
