title: Compost Hubs throughout Los Angeles
project_summary: >-
  L.A. Compost and Kiss the Ground are partnering to create a local solution to
  composting in Los Angeles.  We are currently composting over 2,000lbs of food
  weekly across 5 hubs countywide. Over the next 5 years we plan to expand our
  work by building 20 more hubs and establishing composting programs that will
  keep unnecessary food scraps out of landfills, providing communities with the
  tools and education needed to compost locally.

  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "1) Track weight of organics diverted from landfills: Prior to depositing organics into one of our composting systems, we weigh and record the amount of food or yards scraps. This record gives us a clear picture as to how many organics are being diverted from landfills each week, month, and year.\r\n\r\n2) Record attendance at workshops/hubs:  By tracking how many people are interacting with their local compost hub, as well as tracking attendance at workshops we will be able to measure the interest from the local community. As interest and educational opportunities increase, more individuals will have the tools needed to compost on their own.\r\n\r\n3) Measure how much finished compost is being created: By weighing the finished product we can determine how much finished compost is being used and kept in the same community where it was created. This will allow us to gauge how many gardens and farms we are contributing to throughout the county.\r\n"

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Our goal is to reconnect the city of L.A. with the soil that feeds us. We want
  people to understand that completing the entire loop (farm to table, table to
  compost, compost to farm) is a significant goal. In order to reach this goal
  L.A. Compost and Kiss the Ground are teaming up to expand an entirely local
  compost model. 
   
   Our hub model currently diverts waste from landfills and provides rich compost to neighborhoods and school gardens in Monrovia, Elysian Valley Community Garden, and at USC and the Natural History Museum. The creation of 20 new hubs will provide ongoing education to local communities and change the way individuals look at “waste”. Instead of having only one option where residents throws away countless organics in the trash, a large truck hauls them over an hour away, creates compost, and sells it back to the same individuals whose waste created the compost, we want to help localize it. By localizing the process and keeping it within the community, we continue to divert thousands of pounds of organics from reaching the landfill, and we create a valuable product through compost. This is then distributed to local growers in the area, as well as edible school and community gardens, to contribute to the growth of their green spaces.
   
   The composting hubs we build for LA communities create a space where individuals can coexist and create change side by side. They are a tool for educating the public about composting for soil health, a testimony to the practicality of composting, and a distribution center from which we send compost made on-site into the local community. 
   
   Composting is a beautiful, regenerative process that is collaborative, self-giving, and exemplifies the type of city we want to embody. Localized food systems will be the way of the future… LA can lead the way.
   
   Why Compost?
   
   Diversion: Collectively, 20 new hubs will have the capacity to divert 1,500 lbs. of organics per day, 10,500 lbs. per week, and over 540,000 lbs. per year.
   Drought: Compost acts as a natural sponge, storing water and holding moisture in the soil for plants to use when needed. When it rains, water that falls on land covered in compost can actually soak into the soil, rather than washing off into the storm drains. 
   Climate change: Healthy soil helps removes excess carbon from the air and stores it in the ground.
   Healthy Food: Viewing food scraps as a resource and keeping it in the community allows for Healthy soil=healthy plants =healthy people.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Lack of education about composting has caused many people to negatively
  associate it with dirt or garbage-many believe it is an inherently dirty or
  smelly process. Los Angeles residents have mentioned that they have tried
  composting, but one bad experience due to mismanagement (which often causes
  smell, bugs or raccoons) caused them to stop and never give it a second
  chance. 
   
   In order to overcome the negative stigmas associated with composting, we will implement an education plan for every compost hub we create. These plans will discuss the composting process with residents and equip them with all they need to understand its value and how simple it is to make. By modeling successful composting at local hubs, we will reveal the positive impact that the process has on both food production and quality of life. In communities where this strategy has already been adopted, residents who attend our workshops consistently express to us their new understanding of and appreciation for compost
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  1) Track weight of organics diverted from landfills: Prior to depositing
  organics into one of our composting systems, we weigh and record the amount of
  food or yards scraps. This record gives us a clear picture as to how many
  organics are being diverted from landfills each week, month, and year.
   
   2) Record attendance at workshops/hubs: By tracking how many people are interacting with their local compost hub, as well as tracking attendance at workshops we will be able to measure the interest from the local community. As interest and educational opportunities increase, more individuals will have the tools needed to compost on their own.
   
   3) Measure how much finished compost is being created: By weighing the finished product we can determine how much finished compost is being used and kept in the same community where it was created. This will allow us to gauge how many gardens and farms we are contributing to throughout the county.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  School garden organizations (Enrich LA, Garden School Foundation) and food
  resource and recovery agencies (Food Forward, L.A. Kitchen) are doing a great
  job when it comes to growing food at schools and capturing usable food that
  might otherwise be thrown away. L.A. Compost and Kiss the Ground are focusing
  on a different chapter when it comes to the story of food by focusing on soil
  health by composting materials that can no longer be consumed. Once, composted
  the material is kept within the same community where it was created and
  distributed to local growers (school, community gardens, parks).
   
   Apart from school garden groups and food recovery agencies, haulers in L.A. over the next few years will begin to offer organic pick up services. We do not view this as competition, but rather an opportunity to collaborate. Since the roll out of curbside organic pick ups will only cover a portion of L.A. County, there are still plenty of opportunities to create local solutions for those who don’t have any composting options. Larger cities across the U.S. have adopted citywide composting, and residents in these cities are still enthused about participating in a more local solution that keeps the resources within their zip code. 
   
   Each organization plays an important role when it comes to telling the entire story of food and both L.A. Compost and Kiss the Ground are excited to lead the charge when it comes to soil health and keeping unnecessary material out of landfills on a local level. By focusing on the heartbeat of the food system (soil) we are working to ensure that there will be good local food for years to come.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  L.A. Compost and Kiss the Ground have worked with several partners throughout
  the county. Through our combined efforts we believe that this work will only
  improve over time and that each city throughout the county will have access to
  a local composting solution by 2050. The money given to each partner will
  support existing hubs and new compost programs. 
   
   USC: $1,500.00
   Natural history Museum: $1,500.00
   Elysian Valley Community Garden: $750.00
   Monrovia high school: $750.00
   Temple Israel of Hollywood Day School: $500.00
   Roots for peace: $500.00
   New Horizon School Peace Garden: $500.00
   Hope Through Housing: $500.00
   Frank Del Elmo Elementary: $500.00
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Having already proven that the hub model works, we will continue to grow
  strategically each year with the goal of a hub in each city by 2050 (88 cities
  across L.A. County). We will work on creating a seamless process that allows a
  new community to start a new hub when ready. From schools and restaurants to
  community gardens and parks we will look for areas central to the communities
  where they are located to maximize community usage. This approach has already
  proven to be effective as two affordable housing buildings in Downey and Mar
  Vista are excited to move forward with new their compost hub.
   
   We will also approach larger waste and organic haulers in the future to identify ways in which we can collaborate. Unfortunately in Los Angeles there is more food scraps and yard waste than companies and groups of people to handle it all. By partnering with those who’ve been trying to deal with the issue of keeping organics out of land fills, we can help through educating communities and creating local solutions.
   
   Food scraps will continue to exist and because of how much we produce, some of it will often find its way in a landfill. Unless we change the way we look at it (how we now view glass, plastic, and aluminum as a reusable product) it will be hard to create long lasting change. Through educating individuals within their community and providing options for them to be part of this change, we believe our hubs have the potential to change the issue we have with waste both now, and through 2050.
