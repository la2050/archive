project_summary: >-
  Our proposal supports the design/installation of shade structures in highly
  trafficked central gathering spaces for park events & weekly food truck events
  (22K DTLA residents & employees a year).  Visitors consistently request
  additional shade particularly for our most vulnerable visitors; children and
  elders. Adding shade areas will increase capacity and enhance the comfort of
  the 1MM people who access Grand Park annually to play, enjoy quiet green
  spaces and attend free events in downtown LA.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Grand Park is the most popular green space in DTLA to play (1MM visitors per
  year) and is the first and only-large scale public park in DTLA that combines
  opportunities for multi-generational play with community well-being through
  hundreds of culturally diverse and free programs hosted in the park since our
  opening in 2012. Grand Park is dedicated to creating a safe and enjoyable
  space for everyone with family-oriented, no-alcohol large-scale events (4th of
  July, Día de los Muertos, New Year’s Eve) with no major incidents or arrests
  among crowds as large as 45K people. With 24/7 security, well maintained clean
  toilets, ample drinking water, a splash-pad for adult and child water play,
  food and beverage choices, the park is dedicated to offering a safe, clean and
  comfortable place for LA to play. Grand Park also features a children’s
  playground specifically designed to stimulate social, motor and cognitive
  skills through play. Providing children safe places to play is critical in
  their development and future success. The current lack of permanent shade
  structures, however, limits the use of some areas of the park. Creating more
  shade will increase the use of the park; provide UV protection, spaces for
  performances and exhibitions, and more activities for children and elders.
  With 2.6MM+ Angelinos living more than 1/4 mile from a park and Latino,
  African American and Asian Americans less likely to live near parks, Grand
  Park provides critical access to the 31K residents (US Census) (71% non-white)
  500K employees and 10MM tourists that live/work in and visit DTLA. A growing
  body of research from UCLA, the CDC and the Surgeon General supports a direct
  correlation between access to parks and physical activity (play) with
  important psychological and social health benefits: relieves symptoms of
  depression/anxiety, improves mood and enhances psychological well-being.
  Parks, gardens and other natural places such as Grand Park make for more
  livable communities, opportunities for recreation, exercise, stronger social
  ties and a sense of community and increase social capital bringing diverse
  communities together to share experiences. Grand Park is a work in progress,
  constantly responding to the needs of our public, reflected in the evolution
  of public programs that build on each prior event and improvements made to the
  physical infrastructure to accommodate the growing audiences that have
  identified Grand Park as their favorite place to gather and play.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Grand Park is a resource to thousands on a daily basis. Over the past few
  years, it has entered into people’s routines and habits and they depend on it
  for lunch, for respite, and for gathering with friends, family, and
  colleagues. The process of installing shading, while a long-term benefit, will
  briefly interrupt this daily way of life for many. In order to overcome this,
  the park will need to work with neighbors and community stakeholders to share
  vision and timeline in order to build buy-in. The park will also need to
  ensure no interruption of programs such as concerts, lunch offerings, and
  health classes. This will require that we move some programs to other areas of
  the park and ongoing communication with park-goers.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Grand Park has established a vigorous network, via social media, with
  park-goers, nearby communities and programming partners. We rely on their
  constant input to evaluate our programs and services year round and will
  conduct outreach to survey their response to the new shade structure. We will
  also evaluate changes (+/-) in park attendance during and after the
  installation, using prior year data as a control.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  While there are a variety of venues and programming entities in DTLA that
  offer free entertainment as well as a few small green spaces, Grand Park is
  uniquely positioned as the only inner city green space that combines full
  access to its public space with year-round free public programs. This makes
  the investment in elements that can support year-round enjoyable
  multi-generational usage all the more essential. The Grand Park approach to
  supporting usage of its green spaces and attendance at programs is grassroots,
  building programs around collaboration and partnership in order to reach and
  serve diverse and disparate communities. The shading project will benefit from
  this expertise as the park team will work one-on-one with organizations to
  connect with and grow the audiences who will be most directly served by the
  shade enhancements. Programming outreach will be extended to work more deeply
  with parenting communities and organizations that work with aging population
  in order to make them aware that more protected spaces have been developed in
  the park. Grand Park will also seek out programming collaborations with
  organizations such as the Ketchum YMCA to bring increased health and fitness
  activities.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  In keeping with Grand Park’s commitment to Los Angeles based artists a maximum
  of $15,000 will be allocated to commission a local artist to design the
  graphic elements of the shade sails. The graphics will be inspired by two
  existing elements currently present in Grand Park: the “play” signage in the
  playground and “Park For Everyone” totems located at each cross street. These
  both include translations of the texts into 26 languages that reflects the
  inclusive and welcoming nature of Grand Park.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  While all of Grand Park would benefit from shading, the LA2050 grant will be
  used to pilot the very first area. This pilot will cost $100,000.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  Artist Commission: $15,000
   Construction: $72,000
   Permits: $8,000
   Contingency: $5,000
   Total: $100,000
   This budget does not include Grand Park administrative staff salaries for time spent on the project. All staff time will be fully funded by Grand Park/The Music Center.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Based on usage and community feedback, Grand Park will assess the degree of
  positive impact that shading pilot has had. The project can be scaled up by
  creating other artistic shade installations in other parts of the park.

      Grand Park is the most popular green space in DTLA to play (1MM visitors
      per year) and is the first and only-large scale public park in DTLA that
      combines opportunities for multi-generational play with community
      well-being through hundreds of culturally diverse and free programs hosted
      in the park since our opening in 2012. Grand Park is dedicated to creating
      a safe and enjoyable space for everyone with family-oriented, no-alcohol
      large-scale events (4th of July, Día de los Muertos, New Year’s Eve) with
      no major incidents or arrests among crowds as large as 45K people.  With
      24/7 security, well maintained clean toilets, ample drinking water, a
      splash-pad for adult and child water play, food and beverage choices, the
      park is dedicated to offering a safe, clean and comfortable place for LA
      to play.  Grand Park also features a children’s playground specifically
      designed to stimulate social, motor and cognitive skills through play.
      Providing children safe places to play is critical in their development
      and future success. The current lack of permanent shade structures,
      however, limits the use of some areas of the park. Creating more shade
      will increase the use of the park; provide UV protection, spaces for
      performances and exhibitions, and more activities for children and elders.
      With 2.6MM+ Angelinos living more than 1/4 mile from a park and Latino,
      African American and Asian Americans less likely to live near parks, Grand
      Park provides critical access to the 31K residents (US Census) (71%
      non-white) 500K employees and 10MM tourists that live/work in and visit
      DTLA.   A growing body of research from UCLA, the CDC and the Surgeon
      General supports a direct correlation between access to parks and physical
      activity (play) with important psychological and social health benefits:
      relieves symptoms of depression/anxiety, improves mood and enhances
      psychological well-being. Parks, gardens and other natural places such as
      Grand Park make for more livable communities, opportunities for
      recreation, exercise, stronger social ties and a sense of community and
      increase social capital bringing diverse communities together to share
      experiences. Grand Park is a work in progress, constantly responding to
      the needs of our public, reflected in the evolution of public programs
      that build on each prior event and improvements made to the physical
      infrastructure to accommodate the growing audiences that have identified
      Grand Park as their favorite place to gather and play.

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      Grand Park is a resource to thousands on a daily basis. Over the past few
      years, it has entered into people’s routines and habits and they depend on
      it for lunch, for respite, and for gathering with friends, family, and
      colleagues. The process of installing shading, while a long-term benefit,
      will briefly interrupt this daily way of life for many. In order to
      overcome this, the park will need to work with neighbors and community
      stakeholders to share vision and timeline in order to build buy-in. The
      park will also need to ensure no interruption of programs such as
      concerts, lunch offerings, and health classes. This will require that we
      move some programs to other areas of the park and ongoing communication
      with park-goers. 
  - name: Please explain how you will evaluate your work.
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      Grand Park has established a vigorous network, via social media, with
      park-goers, nearby communities and programming partners. We rely on their
      constant input to evaluate our programs and services year round and will
      conduct outreach to survey their response to the new shade structure.  We
      will also evaluate changes (+/-) in park attendance during and after the
      installation, using prior year data as a control.

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      While there are a variety of venues and programming entities in DTLA that
      offer free entertainment as well as a few small green spaces, Grand Park
      is uniquely positioned as the only inner city green space that combines
      full access to its public space with year-round free public programs. 
      This makes the investment in elements that can support year-round
      enjoyable multi-generational usage all the more essential. The Grand Park
      approach to supporting usage of its green spaces and attendance at
      programs is grassroots, building programs around collaboration and
      partnership in order to reach and serve diverse and disparate communities.
      The shading project will benefit from this expertise as the park team will
      work one-on-one with organizations to connect with and grow the audiences
      who will be most directly served by the shade enhancements. Programming
      outreach will be extended to work more deeply with parenting communities
      and organizations that work with aging population in order to make them
      aware that more protected spaces have been developed in the park. Grand
      Park will also seek out programming collaborations with organizations such
      as the Ketchum YMCA to bring increased health and fitness activities.

      In keeping with Grand Park’s commitment to Los Angeles based artists a
      maximum of $15,000 will be allocated to commission a local artist to
      design the graphic elements of the shade sails. The graphics will be
      inspired by two existing elements currently present in Grand Park: the
      “play” signage in the playground and “Park For Everyone” totems located at
      each cross street. These both include translations of the texts into 26
      languages that reflects the inclusive and welcoming nature of Grand Park.

      Based on usage and community feedback, Grand Park will assess the degree
      of positive impact that shading pilot has had. The project can be scaled
      up by creating other artistic shade installations in other parts of the
      park.
