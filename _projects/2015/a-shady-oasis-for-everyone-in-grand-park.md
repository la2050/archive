title: A shady oasis for everyone in Grand Park
project_summary: >-
  Our proposal supports the design/installation of shade structures in highly
  trafficked central gathering spaces for park events & weekly food truck events
  (22K DTLA residents & employees a year).  Visitors consistently request
  additional shade particularly for our most vulnerable visitors; children and
  elders. Adding shade areas will increase capacity and enhance the comfort of
  the 1MM people who access Grand Park annually to play, enjoy quiet green
  spaces and attend free events in downtown LA.

Where will you be working?:
  - Central LA
How do you plan to use these resources to make change?:
  - Engage residents and stakeholders
  - Implement a pilot or new project
How will your proposal improve the following “Play” metrics?:
  - Access to open space and park facilities
  - Per capita crime rates
  - Residents within 1⁄4 mile of a park (Dream Metric)
  - Number of residents with easy access to a “vibrant” park (Dream Metric)
  - Number of parks with intergenerational play opportunities (Dream Metric)
  - Number (and quality) of informal spaces for play (Dream Metric)
Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to play.: >-
  Grand Park is the most popular green space in DTLA to play (1MM visitors per
  year) and is the first and only-large scale public park in DTLA that combines
  opportunities for multi-generational play with community well-being through
  hundreds of culturally diverse and free programs hosted in the park since our
  opening in 2012. Grand Park is dedicated to creating a safe and enjoyable
  space for everyone with family-oriented, no-alcohol large-scale events (4th of
  July, Día de los Muertos, New Year’s Eve) with no major incidents or arrests
  among crowds as large as 45K people.  With 24/7 security, well maintained
  clean toilets, ample drinking water, a splash-pad for adult and child water
  play, food and beverage choices, the park is dedicated to offering a safe,
  clean and comfortable place for LA to play.  Grand Park also features a
  children’s playground specifically designed to stimulate social, motor and
  cognitive skills through play. Providing children safe places to play is
  critical in their development and future success. The current lack of
  permanent shade structures, however, limits the use of some areas of the park.
  Creating more shade will increase the use of the park; provide UV protection,
  spaces for performances and exhibitions, and more activities for children and
  elders. With 2.6MM+ Angelinos living more than 1/4 mile from a park and
  Latino, African American and Asian Americans less likely to live near parks,
  Grand Park provides critical access to the 31K residents (US Census) (71%
  non-white) 500K employees and 10MM tourists that live/work in and visit
  DTLA.   A growing body of research from UCLA, the CDC and the Surgeon General
  supports a direct correlation between access to parks and physical activity
  (play) with important psychological and social health benefits: relieves
  symptoms of depression/anxiety, improves mood and enhances psychological
  well-being. Parks, gardens and other natural places such as Grand Park make
  for more livable communities, opportunities for recreation, exercise, stronger
  social ties and a sense of community and increase social capital bringing
  diverse communities together to share experiences. Grand Park is a work in
  progress, constantly responding to the needs of our public, reflected in the
  evolution of public programs that build on each prior event and improvements
  made to the physical infrastructure to accommodate the growing audiences that
  have identified Grand Park as their favorite place to gather and play.  
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Grand Park has established a vigorous network, via social media, with
  park-goers, nearby communities and programming partners. We rely on their
  constant input to evaluate our programs and services year round and will
  conduct outreach to survey their response to the new shade structure.  We will
  also evaluate changes (+/-) in park attendance during and after the
  installation, using prior year data as a control.
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
  - Money (financial capital)
  - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
  - Community outreach
  - Network/relationship support
  - Quality improvement research
