title: The CoachArt Student/Coach Matching App
project_summary: >-
  The CoachArt Matching App will modernize the way chronically ill students are
  paired into arts and athletics mentorships and expand CoachArt’s
  transformative community to include exponentially more families. Our
  algorithmic matching app will reduce 99+% of the overhead currently needed to
  make a successful matches, from an average matching process of 8 hours down to
  approximately 5 minutes. In two years, that will scale annually to provide a
  projected 3,000 more students in Los Angeles.

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "Los Angeles is booming. From the re-emergence of a thriving downtown to having the third largest technological ecosystem in the nation, Los Angeles is a force to be reckoned with. Residents continue to find innovative ways to connect to the community and expand their impact. That community importance has also been prevalent in the world of volunteerism in the city. About 21% of Angeleno residents volunteer -- giving 283.3 million hours of their time amounting to $6.4 billion of services contributed per year.\r\n \r\nCoachArt wants to revolutionize how volunteers are matched to individuals in need by creating an app to speed up the process. We’re a nonprofit that creates a transformative arts and athletics community for families impacted by childhood chronic illness. \r\n\r\nIn 2012, the University of Michigan reported that 15-18% of children nationwide were living with a chronic illness. Chronic illnesses disproportionately impact under-resourced communities with one in four children below the poverty line suffering from a chronic illness. \r\n\r\nThese startling numbers motivate the dedicated staff at CoachArt to improve the lives of these students by matching them with volunteers who share their interests. In 2014 alone, over 90% of our CoachArt students confirmed that CoachArt allowed them to express what they think and feel creatively. \r\n\r\nCurrently, CoachArt serves 1,300 students and their families in Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area, and are on pace to provide over 20,000 hours of free lessons to our participants by the end of 2015. Hundreds more students are on CoachArt’s waiting list as they work to recruit new volunteers to meet ever-growing student needs. We rely heavily on the dedicated program coordinators to make matches, which can take up to 8 hours per match. By implementing a matching app system, the process can be decreased significantly to only 5 minutes per match.\r\n\r\nThe core insight is that the quality of potential matches can be algorithmically predicted in the same way technology predicts matches for employment, dating, and advertising; significantly reducing overhead. This will bring a nuance to the nonprofit sector and transform local matching programs.\r\n\r\nWe anticipate an 8,800% increase once fully integrated at CoachArt. Moreover, our “moonshot” includes the creation of a replicable tool that will empower any current and future organizations with a matching model in their organization helping increase volunteerism rates in LA."

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "The biggest challenge for this project would be if families impacted by childhood chronic illness did not adopt the technology, particularly families from under-resourced communities that make up 80+% of our students. We’ve addressed that by creating an app instead of a website because of the higher prevalence of smartphones among our population compared to computers. Additionally, we believe the risk is diminishing, as over 90% of families from marginalized communities now have access to a smartphone and/or internet service. \r\n\r\nThe second biggest challenge is that the quality of our matches is reduced without the human matchmaking element. Most of the traditional matching process is a simple information problem, but it’s hard to quantify the intuitive value that is currently added. By changing to a high-tech solution, we seek to keep our high-touch relationship with our families. We’ll address this through feedback from matches, and periodically iterating on the algorithm. "
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    CoachArt recently launched a new performance evaluation tool that measures
    the impact of our program activities on each student we serve across five
    key metrics: skills learned, sense of community,
    self-expression/self-empowerment, positive attitudes toward self/confidence,
    and health attitudes. We anticipate showing gains in all five measurements
    in nearly 100% of the students we serve. The CoachArt Student/Coach Matching
    Tool will pair approximately 30,000 additional students (an 8,800% increase)
    affected by chronic illness per year with adults who will engage them in an
    8-hour arts or athletics mentorship. The health impacts of those mentorships
    will vary based on the disease and the activity. For instance, among cancer
    patients, 1 hour of art therapy causes statistically significant reductions
    in 8 out of 9 qualitative symptoms. As for athletics, 1 hour per day of
    sports reduces depression among youth by 8%. 
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "Several organizations are tackling different aspects of childhood chronic illnesses. Entities like St. Jude Children’s Research hospital are seeking cures and performing medical treatment for children with chronic illnesses. Whereas Make-A-Wish, on a national level, and Casey Cares in the mid-Atlantic, are providing fun events for a similar population. Starbright World seeks to create an online community of forums for children affected by childhood chronic illness to share their experiences, thus sharing the goal to use technology to reach this population. \r\n\r\nCoachArt is unaware, though, of any organization that is tackling the issue of pairing chronically ill children with coaches for an on-going and transformative arts and athletics experience, nor of an organization that serves the entire family and any siblings of children with chronic illnesses, nor of any organization that is seeking to do so by using technology to algorithmically replace the “matching” process. "
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "CoachArt does not have any planned collaborations to pilot the matching app, but is fortunate to have a Board of Directors that is deeply rooted in the technology sector who will be an invaluable guide during this process. Our disruptive and entrepreneurial board makes CoachArt nearly uniquely positioned to transform match-based volunteerism. The board’s Tech Team will hand-pick the product manager, engineers and developers from their connections. \r\n\r\nThe board Tech Team includes: \r\nCoachArt co-founder Zander Lurie (Senior VP media, GoPro and Interim Executive Chairman, SurveyMonkey)  \r\nKelly Merryman (VP of Content Partnerships, YouTube) \r\nKay Madati (EVP and Chief Digital Officer, BET)\r\nPete Distad (VP of product marketing, Apple)\r\nSean Moriarty (CEO, Demand Media) \r\nWalter Delph (Partner and Managing Director, BCG Digital Ventures)"

  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    The indicators to track progress will be: average time needed for a match,
    number of students matched, and number of cities represented. We will track
    the average time needed for a match by dividing the total monthly time spent
    by staffers making matches by the number of matches finalized that month. We
    will track the number of students matched through our SalesForce database.
    We will track the number of cities represented by considering a city
    “represented” when at least 30 matches are taking place in that city.
