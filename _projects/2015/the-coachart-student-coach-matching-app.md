  The CoachArt Matching App will modernize the way chronically ill students are
  paired into arts and athletics mentorships and expand CoachArt’s
  transformative community to include exponentially more families. Our
  algorithmic matching app will reduce 99+% of the overhead currently needed to
  make a successful matches, from an average matching process of 8 hours down to
  approximately 5 minutes. In two years, that will scale annually to provide a
  projected 3,000 more students in Los Angeles.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Los Angeles is booming. From the re-emergence of a thriving downtown to having
  the third largest technological ecosystem in the nation, Los Angeles is a
  force to be reckoned with. Residents continue to find innovative ways to
  connect to the community and expand their impact. That community importance
  has also been prevalent in the world of volunteerism in the city. About 21% of
  Angeleno residents volunteer -- giving 283.3 million hours of their time
  amounting to $6.4 billion of services contributed per year.
    
   CoachArt wants to revolutionize how volunteers are matched to individuals in need by creating an app to speed up the process. We’re a nonprofit that creates a transformative arts and athletics community for families impacted by childhood chronic illness. 
   
   In 2012, the University of Michigan reported that 15-18% of children nationwide were living with a chronic illness. Chronic illnesses disproportionately impact under-resourced communities with one in four children below the poverty line suffering from a chronic illness. 
   
   These startling numbers motivate the dedicated staff at CoachArt to improve the lives of these students by matching them with volunteers who share their interests. In 2014 alone, over 90% of our CoachArt students confirmed that CoachArt allowed them to express what they think and feel creatively. 
   
   Currently, CoachArt serves 1,300 students and their families in Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area, and are on pace to provide over 20,000 hours of free lessons to our participants by the end of 2015. Hundreds more students are on CoachArt’s waiting list as they work to recruit new volunteers to meet ever-growing student needs. We rely heavily on the dedicated program coordinators to make matches, which can take up to 8 hours per match. By implementing a matching app system, the process can be decreased significantly to only 5 minutes per match.
   
   The core insight is that the quality of potential matches can be algorithmically predicted in the same way technology predicts matches for employment, dating, and advertising; significantly reducing overhead. This will bring a nuance to the nonprofit sector and transform local matching programs.
   
   We anticipate an 8,800% increase once fully integrated at CoachArt. Moreover, our “moonshot” includes the creation of a replicable tool that will empower any current and future organizations with a matching model in their organization helping increase volunteerism rates in LA.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  The biggest challenge for this project would be if families impacted by
  childhood chronic illness did not adopt the technology, particularly families
  from under-resourced communities that make up 80+% of our students. We’ve
  addressed that by creating an app instead of a website because of the higher
  prevalence of smartphones among our population compared to computers.
  Additionally, we believe the risk is diminishing, as over 90% of families from
  marginalized communities now have access to a smartphone and/or internet
  service. 
   
   The second biggest challenge is that the quality of our matches is reduced without the human matchmaking element. Most of the traditional matching process is a simple information problem, but it’s hard to quantify the intuitive value that is currently added. By changing to a high-tech solution, we seek to keep our high-touch relationship with our families. We’ll address this through feedback from matches, and periodically iterating on the algorithm.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  CoachArt recently launched a new performance evaluation tool that measures the
  impact of our program activities on each student we serve across five key
  metrics: skills learned, sense of community, self-expression/self-empowerment,
  positive attitudes toward self/confidence, and health attitudes. We anticipate
  showing gains in all five measurements in nearly 100% of the students we
  serve. The CoachArt Student/Coach Matching Tool will pair approximately 30,000
  additional students (an 8,800% increase) affected by chronic illness per year
  with adults who will engage them in an 8-hour arts or athletics mentorship.
  The health impacts of those mentorships will vary based on the disease and the
  activity. For instance, among cancer patients, 1 hour of art therapy causes
  statistically significant reductions in 8 out of 9 qualitative symptoms. As
  for athletics, 1 hour per day of sports reduces depression among youth by 8%.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Several organizations are tackling different aspects of childhood chronic
  illnesses. Entities like St. Jude Children’s Research hospital are seeking
  cures and performing medical treatment for children with chronic illnesses.
  Whereas Make-A-Wish, on a national level, and Casey Cares in the mid-Atlantic,
  are providing fun events for a similar population. Starbright World seeks to
  create an online community of forums for children affected by childhood
  chronic illness to share their experiences, thus sharing the goal to use
  technology to reach this population. 
   
   CoachArt is unaware, though, of any organization that is tackling the issue of pairing chronically ill children with coaches for an on-going and transformative arts and athletics experience, nor of an organization that serves the entire family and any siblings of children with chronic illnesses, nor of any organization that is seeking to do so by using technology to algorithmically replace the “matching” process.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  CoachArt does not have any planned collaborations to pilot the matching app,
  but is fortunate to have a Board of Directors that is deeply rooted in the
  technology sector who will be an invaluable guide during this process. Our
  disruptive and entrepreneurial board makes CoachArt nearly uniquely positioned
  to transform match-based volunteerism. The board’s Tech Team will hand-pick
  the product manager, engineers and developers from their connections. 
   
   The board Tech Team includes: 
   CoachArt co-founder Zander Lurie (Senior VP media, GoPro and Interim Executive Chairman, SurveyMonkey) 
   Kelly Merryman (VP of Content Partnerships, YouTube) 
   Kay Madati (EVP and Chief Digital Officer, BET)
   Pete Distad (VP of product marketing, Apple)
   Sean Moriarty (CEO, Demand Media) 
   Walter Delph (Partner and Managing Director, BCG Digital Ventures)
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': 'It will cost $92,760.00 to create the app.'
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-

  provided an approximate line item cost breakdown.

How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  The indicators to track progress will be: average time needed for a match,
  number of students matched, and number of cities represented. We will track
  the average time needed for a match by dividing the total monthly time spent
  by staffers making matches by the number of matches finalized that month. We
  will track the number of students matched through our SalesForce database. We
  will track the number of cities represented by considering a city
  “represented” when at least 30 matches are taking place in that city.
