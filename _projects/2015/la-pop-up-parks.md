project_summary: >-
  We built the first park in 30 days with less than $20K and a lot of volunteer
  help.  We propose to re-create this project in 5-7 unused or open city owned
  spaces all over LA.  We have lessons learned in place from the first
  successful pop up park and partners ready to support the creation of several
  more right away.  We can take dead space in LA and bring it back to life to
  help people create stronger communities. 
Please specify below: >-
  We can build these parks anywhere there is unused or open lots in the city or
  county
category: play
'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Our parks are free to use by anyone. Paid for by grants, sponsors and partners
  and built in 30-45 days on a lot that is totally unused or unwanted. In our
  park in Venice, there are places to work on your own or in teams. Many young
  parents come by with small children so they can be engaged in their community
  without sacrificing parental quality time. Events can book out the space for
  non-commercial purposes and local organizations use the space for community
  meetings and gatherings (both civil and religious). We are unbranded, totally
  inclusive and literally a gift to the local community. We also build a robust
  website, provide free wifi, set up a staffing and oversight plan and even
  bring in local food and drink vendors so that park guests have a chance to get
  something light to eat or drink.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  We've identified hundreds of open lots across LA, we need the city to allow us
  to transform these lots and financial partners to underwrite the costs. We
  also need slight zoning changes on some of the land but that is also avoidable
  through selective consideration of potential lots. Otherwise, no barriers
  exist and we already built this in Venice so a proof of concept exists and I
  encourage all judges to visit the Venice Pop up Park to be convinced of our
  effectiveness at making neighborhoods better.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We evaluate our work based on three things. 1) can we get people to use the
  park once it's built 2) can we attract the right kinds of events that will be
  productive and respectful of neighbors 3) Can we gain overwhelming acceptance
  and support from the immediately surrounding community prior to construction
  so we can build a park that fits what the surrounding community needs. In
  Venice it was quite place to work, create, sit down (there are no places to
  sit on AK Blvd) and bring family and friends without a more raucous element in
  proximity. In other communities the requests may differ.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Yes. Pop up parks are not new. They are done by community organizations and
  brands all the time. However, we can't find any organizations doing them in LA
  right now. We did this because we could and we needed to for our community. We
  are applying for this grant because others have begged us to do this again and
  again and we think the cost metrics finally support that goal.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  The 100K grant will be used to set up a program to build 5-7 pop up parks all
  over LA. We build these parks well enough so that can be permanent but we call
  them pop up parks because sometimes the land chosen may have another purpose
  in the next few years and then we can literally pick up the park and bring it
  to a new location where it can do good. The whole process we create was such
  that almost everything is re-used. For each project we will recruit a design
  firm that reflects the local community and is able to pull the best ideas out
  of the local residents. The City and County of LA will have to partner with us
  as well since they most likely own the land we will build on. For the Venice
  Park we found private property to do this on so we didn't have to deal with
  government red tape on the pilot program.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  We built the first park for $20K. We would like to build 5-7 more. The grant
  funds will compliment a fundraising effort to ask local businesses to chip in
  for the extra cost, which is minimal and actually totally avoidable if that
  effort is successful. We didn't need grant funds to build the first. We raised
  money from 4 local businesses but that was quite difficult and having a block
  grant like this means we can actually move forward and guarantee at least 5
  parks without additional funding.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
  These metrics are for one park: We feel if we build 5 at once we can get a
  significant discount and many items for free or donated (such as wifi)
   
   $5K Design and Construction Oversight (licensed contractor reduced fee for 2 months)
   $11K Materials (wood, AstroTurf, paint, sandpaper, hardware, tools)
   $500 Website
   $2K Opening Event
   $1K City and County fees for permitting
   $1K Free wifi and power for 1 year
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  With more parks we can make deals with telco's to provide free wifi. TWC
  passpoint seems like the most likely since they are city wide already and can
  just provide us log in access to the network. we have relationships with Lowes
  and Home Depot and with higher volume of park they are interested in donating
  materials. The only thing that slows our scaling down would be the interest in
  local/city/county government in allowing citizens to use their own resources
  to beautify and enhance their neighborhoods. We also would have to work very
  hard to recruit and hold onto human capital in the form of coordination and
  construction volunteers.

      Our parks are free to use by anyone.  Paid for by grants, sponsors and
      partners and built in 30-45 days on a lot that is totally unused or
      unwanted.  In our park in Venice, there are places to work on your own or
      in teams. Many young parents come by with small children so they can be
      engaged in their community without sacrificing parental quality time.
      Events can book out the space for non-commercial purposes and local
      organizations use the space for community meetings and gatherings (both
      civil and religious). We are unbranded, totally inclusive and literally a
      gift to the local community.  We also build a robust website, provide free
      wifi, set up a staffing and oversight plan and even bring in local food
      and drink vendors so that park guests have a chance to get something light
      to eat or drink.

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      We've identified hundreds of open lots across LA, we need the city to
      allow us to transform these lots and financial partners to underwrite the
      costs. We also need slight zoning changes on some of the land but that is
      also avoidable through selective consideration of potential lots. 
      Otherwise, no barriers exist and we already built this in Venice so a
      proof of concept exists and I encourage all judges to visit the Venice Pop
      up Park to be convinced of our effectiveness at making neighborhoods
      better. 
  - name: Please explain how you will evaluate your work.
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      We evaluate our work based on three things. 1) can we get people to use
      the park once it's built 2) can we attract the right kinds of events that
      will be productive and respectful of neighbors 3) Can we gain overwhelming
      acceptance and support from the immediately surrounding community prior to
      construction so we can build a park that fits what the surrounding
      community needs. In Venice it was quite place to work, create, sit down
      (there are no places to sit on AK Blvd) and bring family and friends
      without a more raucous element in proximity. In other communities the
      requests may differ.

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      Yes.  Pop up parks are not new.  They are done by community organizations
      and brands all the time. However, we can't find any organizations doing
      them in LA right now.  We did this because we could and we needed to for
      our community.  We are applying for this grant because others have begged
      us to do this again and again and we think the cost metrics finally
      support that goal.

      Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on
      this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner
      receive?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      The 100K grant will be used to set up a program to build 5-7 pop up parks
      all over LA.  We build these parks well enough so that can be permanent
      but we call them pop up parks because sometimes the land chosen may have
      another purpose in the next few years and then we can literally pick up
      the park and bring it to a new location where it can do good.  The whole
      process we create was such that almost everything is re-used. For each
      project we will recruit a design firm that reflects the local community
      and is able to pull the best ideas out of the local residents.  The City
      and County of LA will have to partner with us as well since they most
      likely own the land we will build on.  For the Venice Park we found
      private property to do this on so we didn't have to deal with government
      red tape on the pilot program.

      How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you
      cover the additional costs?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      We built the first park for $20K.  We would like to build 5-7 more.  The
      grant funds will compliment a fundraising effort to ask local businesses
      to chip in for the extra cost, which is minimal and actually totally
      avoidable if that effort is successful.  We didn't need grant funds to
      build the first. We raised money from 4 local businesses but that was
      quite difficult and having a block grant like this means we can actually
      move forward and guarantee at least 5 parks without additional funding.

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      With more parks we can make deals with telco's to provide free wifi.  TWC
      passpoint seems like the most likely since they are city wide already and
      can just provide us log in access to the network. we have relationships
      with Lowes and Home Depot and with higher volume of park they are
      interested in donating materials. The only thing that slows our scaling
      down would be the interest in local/city/county government in allowing
      citizens to use their own resources to beautify and enhance their
      neighborhoods. We also would have to work very hard to recruit and hold
      onto human capital in the form of coordination and construction
      volunteers.
