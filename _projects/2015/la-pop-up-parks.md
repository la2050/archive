title: LA Pop Up Parks
project_summary: >-
  We built the first park in 30 days with less than $20K and a lot of volunteer
  help.  We propose to re-create this project in 5-7 unused or open city owned
  spaces all over LA.  We have lessons learned in place from the first
  successful pop up park and partners ready to support the creation of several
  more right away.  We can take dead space in LA and bring it back to life to
  help people create stronger communities.

Where will you be working?:
  - County of Los Angeles
  - City of Los Angeles
  - >-
    We can build these parks anywhere there is unused or open lots in the city
    or county
How do you plan to use these resources to make change?:
  - Engage residents and stakeholders
  - Expand a pilot or a program
  - Mobilize for systems change
  - Advocate with policymakers and leaders
  - >-
    We plan to make structural and tabngible change to several neighborhoods
    with new pop up parks to work and play
How will your proposal improve the following “Play” metrics?:
  - Access to open space and park facilities
  - Percentage of residents that feel safe in their neighborhoods
  - Residents within 1⁄4 mile of a park (Dream Metric)
  - Number of residents with easy access to a “vibrant” park (Dream Metric)
  - Number of parks with intergenerational play opportunities (Dream Metric)
  - Number (and quality) of informal spaces for play (Dream Metric)
Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to play.: >-
  Our parks are free to use by anyone.  Paid for by grants, sponsors and
  partners and built in 30-45 days on a lot that is totally unused or unwanted. 
  In our park in Venice, there are places to work on your own or in teams. Many
  young parents come by with small children so they can be engaged in their
  community without sacrificing parental quality time. Events can book out the
  space for non-commercial purposes and local organizations use the space for
  community meetings and gatherings (both civil and religious). We are
  unbranded, totally inclusive and literally a gift to the local community.  We
  also build a robust website, provide free wifi, set up a staffing and
  oversight plan and even bring in local food and drink vendors so that park
  guests have a chance to get something light to eat or drink.  
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We evaluate our work based on three things. 1) can we get people to use the
  park once it's built 2) can we attract the right kinds of events that will be
  productive and respectful of neighbors 3) Can we gain overwhelming acceptance
  and support from the immediately surrounding community prior to construction
  so we can build a park that fits what the surrounding community needs. In
  Venice it was quite place to work, create, sit down (there are no places to
  sit on AK Blvd) and bring family and friends without a more raucous element in
  proximity. In other communities the requests may differ. 
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
  - Money (financial capital)
  - Volunteers/staff (human capital)
  - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
  - 'Infrastructure (building/space/vehicles, etc.)'
  - Community outreach
  - Network/relationship support
