title: LA Pop Up Parks
project_summary: >-
  We built the first park in 30 days with less than $20K and a lot of volunteer
  help.  We propose to re-create this project in 5-7 unused or open city owned
  spaces all over LA.  We have lessons learned in place from the first
  successful pop up park and partners ready to support the creation of several
  more right away.  We can take dead space in LA and bring it back to life to
  help people create stronger communities.

    Our parks are free to use by anyone.  Paid for by grants, sponsors and
    partners and built in 30-45 days on a lot that is totally unused or
    unwanted.  In our park in Venice, there are places to work on your own or in
    teams. Many young parents come by with small children so they can be engaged
    in their community without sacrificing parental quality time. Events can
    book out the space for non-commercial purposes and local organizations use
    the space for community meetings and gatherings (both civil and religious).
    We are unbranded, totally inclusive and literally a gift to the local
    community.  We also build a robust website, provide free wifi, set up a
    staffing and oversight plan and even bring in local food and drink vendors
    so that park guests have a chance to get something light to eat or drink.

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    We've identified hundreds of open lots across LA, we need the city to allow
    us to transform these lots and financial partners to underwrite the costs.
    We also need slight zoning changes on some of the land but that is also
    avoidable through selective consideration of potential lots.  Otherwise, no
    barriers exist and we already built this in Venice so a proof of concept
    exists and I encourage all judges to visit the Venice Pop up Park to be
    convinced of our effectiveness at making neighborhoods better. 
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    We evaluate our work based on three things. 1) can we get people to use the
    park once it's built 2) can we attract the right kinds of events that will
    be productive and respectful of neighbors 3) Can we gain overwhelming
    acceptance and support from the immediately surrounding community prior to
    construction so we can build a park that fits what the surrounding community
    needs. In Venice it was quite place to work, create, sit down (there are no
    places to sit on AK Blvd) and bring family and friends without a more
    raucous element in proximity. In other communities the requests may differ. 
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    Yes.  Pop up parks are not new.  They are done by community organizations
    and brands all the time. However, we can't find any organizations doing them
    in LA right now.  We did this because we could and we needed to for our
    community.  We are applying for this grant because others have begged us to
    do this again and again and we think the cost metrics finally support that
    goal. 
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    The 100K grant will be used to set up a program to build 5-7 pop up parks
    all over LA.  We build these parks well enough so that can be permanent but
    we call them pop up parks because sometimes the land chosen may have another
    purpose in the next few years and then we can literally pick up the park and
    bring it to a new location where it can do good.  The whole process we
    create was such that almost everything is re-used. For each project we will
    recruit a design firm that reflects the local community and is able to pull
    the best ideas out of the local residents.  The City and County of LA will
    have to partner with us as well since they most likely own the land we will
    build on.  For the Venice Park we found private property to do this on so we
    didn't have to deal with government red tape on the pilot program. 
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    We built the first park for $20K.  We would like to build 5-7 more.  The
    grant funds will compliment a fundraising effort to ask local businesses to
    chip in for the extra cost, which is minimal and actually totally avoidable
    if that effort is successful.  We didn't need grant funds to build the
    first. We raised money from 4 local businesses but that was quite difficult
    and having a block grant like this means we can actually move forward and
    guarantee at least 5 parks without additional funding. 
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "These metrics are for one park: We feel if we build 5 at once we can get a significant discount and many items for free or donated (such as wifi)\r\n\r\n$5K Design and Construction Oversight (licensed contractor reduced fee for 2 months)\r\n$11K Materials (wood, AstroTurf, paint, sandpaper, hardware, tools)\r\n$500 Website\r\n$2K Opening Event\r\n$1K City and County fees for permitting\r\n$1K Free wifi and power for 1 year"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    With more parks we can make deals with telco's to provide free wifi.  TWC
    passpoint seems like the most likely since they are city wide already and
    can just provide us log in access to the network. we have relationships with
    Lowes and Home Depot and with higher volume of park they are interested in
    donating materials. The only thing that slows our scaling down would be the
    interest in local/city/county government in allowing citizens to use their
    own resources to beautify and enhance their neighborhoods. We also would
    have to work very hard to recruit and hold onto human capital in the form of
    coordination and construction volunteers.
