  With California experiencing record drought and the soaring financial and
  environmental cost of importing 80% of Los Angeles’ water supply, Heal the Bay
  strongly believes that local citizens should have the tools and information
  needed to create a sustainable water future for themselves and neighbors.
   
   Further, with Mayor Eric Garcetti’s directive to source 50% of Los Angeles’ water locally by 2035, significant policy and behavioral change is urgently needed to conserve existing resources and bridge the gap before much-needed infrastructure projects are implemented – projects that may take many years to be developed.
   
   Changing Los Angeles’ dependence on costly, unsustainable imported water is crucial to our future, but how can we do this if most of us don’t understand the problem? The vast majority of residents have no idea where their water comes from, let alone how to do a better job of managing it.
   
   Heal the Bay is set to launch the Dropping Knowledge Project – Building a Water-Literate L.A. – an inclusive, multi-language water conservation initiative designed to enhance citizens’ understanding of Los Angeles’ dependency on water imports and simple, affordable water conservation strategies that can be implemented at their home and businesses.
   
   Furthermore, we will help Los Angelenos understand that the water challenge is winnable through smart planning and prudent investment in multi-benefit infrastructure projects that do a better job of using and re-using the water we ALREADY have.
   
   We have boiled down our educational mantra to the three key easily memorable directives familiar from the world of packaged goods:
   
   Reduce – We need to cut back on the amount of water we use as a region.
   
   Reuse – We need to capture, cleanse and reuse water, such as urban runoff and stormwater.
   
   Recycle – We need to recharge our aquifers with treated wastewater from Hyperion instead of dumping it useless into the sea.
   
   Heal the Bay will train new and existing organization volunteers, so they can present the curriculum to groups via Heal the Bay’s existing network of partners (e.g. schools, businesses, faith-based and civic organizations), in addition to reaching all 95 neighborhood councils that represent a diverse cross-section of the city of Los Angeles.
   
   Heal the Bay will also leverage its impact and messaging via social media.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Los Angeles is made up of a diverse and dense collection of cities and
  communities. 
   
   Reaching a significant population will be a challenge. 
   
   This is why it is so important to use a team of trained volunteers from all over the region to make the greatest impact. 
   
   To leverage the Dropping Knowledge Project, Heal the Bay will work with PAVA - Pacific American Volunteer Association and Pacoima Beautiful to help overcome language and cultural barriers in its messaging. 
   
   Both groups will assist Heal the Bay in developing its messaging, materials and presentations. 
   
   As the program grows, Heal the Bay will conduct outreach to partner organizations that reach other ethnic communities in the Greater L.A. region – be it the Japanese-speaking communities in Torrance or Armenian-speaking neighborhoods in Glendale.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Heal the Bay will evaluate the success of the Dropping Knowledge Project using
  the following metrics:
   
   Between January 1, 2016-January 31, 2016: Partner contracts will be signed. Heal the Bay will finalize its multi-language curriculum, with input from scientists and partner organizations. 
   
   
   Between February 1, 2016 and February 28, 2016: Heal the Bay will introduce 35 individuals to its water literacy curriculum through its existing Speakers Bureau training program.
   
   Between February 1, 2016 and February 28, 2016: Heal the Bay will train volunteers/community partners.
   
   Between February 2016 and November 2016: Staff and trained volunteers will provide 150 water-literacy presentations for 8,000 individuals, with a special focus on 95 L.A. neighborhood councils.
   
   Dropping Knowledge Project materials will also be disseminated at 75 community festivals across the city reaching 10,000 people. 
   
   Heal the Bay will evaluate feedback offered through pre- and post tests.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There are currently no other Los Angeles-based organizations providing free,
  multi-language water literacy programs for the general public. The Los Angeles
  Department of Water & Power and Metropolitan Water District provide content
  online, but the information is tailored for K-12th grade audiences, not
  adults.
   
   What makes Heal the Bay’s approach different is its capacity to meet and educate citizens ‘where they are’ including schools, churches, civic (Rotary and Kiwanis) businesses and community centers and then reinforcing messaging via social media and directing citizens to other useful online resources.
   
   As a trusted member of the community for 30 years, Heal the Bay has developed a reputation for integrity and trust. Heal the Bay has a long track record of blending science-based advocacy and hands-on community action. 
   
   Heal the Bay's awareness and favorability ratings are the highest among local nonprofits.
   
   People know us, like us, and listen to what we have to say.
   
   We let people be active agents in healing the bay, rather than just passive donors. We have developed a unique voice that is fun and participatory – as demonstrated by our booming social media networks. So we think that we can engage people in direct, funny and powerful ways that traditional nonprofits and bureaucratic “play it safe” government agencies can’t

'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  To leverage the impact of its Dropping Knowledge Project, Heal the Bay will
  contract with PAVA and Pacoima Beautiful, with $10,000 awarded to each group,
  to support water literacy training, assist in the translation of materials and
  ultimately provide presentations.
   
   Each partner will be tasked with participating in 10 hours of training and providing 33 presentations to its target audiences.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  Heal the Bay’s Dropping Knowledge Project is expected to cost $100,000, which
  includes staff time, training supplies, partner stipends, mileage, and the
  printing of educational materials.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
  Heal the Bay’s Dropping Knowledge project budget is approximately $100,000
  (January 2016-December 2016).
   
   Staff time $65,500
   Educational Outreach Manager $37,500
   Programs Director $8,000
   Programs Associate $15,000
   Administration $5,000
   
   Supplies $14,500
   Binders for curriculum, printing costs, room rental fees, parking fees, mileage, projector equipment
   
   Partner stipends $20,000
   PAVA - Pacific American Volunteer Association and Pacoima Beautiful will each receive $10,000 to support the objectives of the project, attend water literacy training, assist in the translation of materials and ultimately provide presentations to their target populations.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Heal the Bay has three decades of experience spearheading effective
  educational and advocacy campaigns in Los Angeles. In fact, Heal the Bay’s
  first major victory was the citizen-driven initiative that resulted in
  critical infrastructure upgrades at the Hyperion Treatment Plant in 1987–
  still to this day, one of most important environmental wins to benefit the
  Santa Monica Bay. 
   
   Heal the Bay is confident that its proposed Dropping Knowledge Project will make a great impact due in large part to the organization’s capacity to develop meaningful, call-to-action messaging, broad network of contacts in the Greater Los Angeles area and reputation as a reliable educational resource for the greater community– the project also has the potential of being successfully replicated in other large urban cities with water security issues and ethnically diverse populations.
