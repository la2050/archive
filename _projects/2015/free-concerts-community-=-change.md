  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "GP believes that access to the arts should be a right and not a privilege and that the arts play a critical role in healthy communities.  Since 1987, a million Southern Californians have come to our concerts, discovered new artists and connected and engaged with those around them. In 2016, Grand Performances will:\r\n\r\n1) CELEBRATE 30 YEARS\r\nGP will launch a celebratory 30th season of music, dance, film, theater and spoken word that addresses local, national and even international issues through the performing arts. These programs will be complemented by post-show discussions, community gatherings, and online forums to encourage active participation from the community. This will include the second year of “re:ARRANGED - Muslim Cultures Illuminated” a 22-month cultural exchange and artist residency project that expands the definition of Muslim culture for participating local artists, underserved youth, and the general public. \r\n\r\n2) TAKE THE SHOW ON THE ROAD \r\nGP will test off-site programming collaborations through a deeper partnership with the Los Angeles City Public Library (LAPL).

GP will deepen current partnerships with community organizations to engage audiences around voter registration and volunteer engagement. Organizations like the African American Voter Registration and Education Project and other community-focused operations will be onsite at our performances and be complemented by a social media campaign. \r\n\r\n4) SUPPORT PROFESSIONAL ARTISTS\r\nMany people ask us – if the shows are free, do the artists perform for free? Not only are talented local and international artists paid competitive fees, they are supported by a crew of seasoned theatre professionals and work with our Director of Programming to develop new work and create one-of-a-kind programs.

  GP believes that access to the arts should be a right and not a privilege and
  that the arts play a critical role in healthy communities. Since 1987, a
  million Southern Californians have come to our concerts, discovered new
  artists and connected and engaged with those around them. In 2016, Grand
  Performances will:
   
   1) CELEBRATE 30 YEARS
   GP will launch a celebratory 30th season of music, dance, film, theater and spoken word that addresses local, national and even international issues through the performing arts. These programs will be complemented by post-show discussions, community gatherings, and online forums to encourage active participation from the community. This will include the second year of “re:ARRANGED - Muslim Cultures Illuminated” a 22-month cultural exchange and artist residency project that expands the definition of Muslim culture for participating local artists, underserved youth, and the general public. 
   
   2) TAKE THE SHOW ON THE ROAD 
   GP will test off-site programming collaborations through a deeper partnership with the Los Angeles City Public Library (LAPL). This will include a series of Poetry Writing and Performance workshops at three South L.A. branch libraries and a series of five viewing and discussion programs in East and North L.A. branch libraries around the “Latino Americans 500 Years of History” public programming initiative produced by the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) and the American Library Association (ALA).
    
   3) INCREASE VOTER REGISTRATION AND VOLUNTEER ENGAGEMENT
   GP recognizes the need to develop a well-trained volunteer force that is deeply engaged with and actively involved in the organization - as "music docents" for the larger audience during our free concert series, or goodwill brand ambassadors at offsite events. GP will deepen current partnerships with community organizations to engage audiences around voter registration and volunteer engagement. Organizations like the African American Voter Registration and Education Project and other community-focused operations will be onsite at our performances and be complemented by a social media campaign. 
   
   4) SUPPORT PROFESSIONAL ARTISTS
   Many people ask us – if the shows are free, do the artists perform for free? Not only are talented local and international artists paid competitive fees, they are supported by a crew of seasoned theatre professionals and work with our Director of Programming to develop new work and create one-of-a-kind programs.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  FUNDING: While funding from California Plaza owners has been a stabilizing
  factor since our inception covering nearly half the budget, each summer
  requires greater private sector funding to cover increased production and
  maintenance costs, professional and competitive artist fees, and the costs of
  expanded marketing and new media applications to engage and inform audiences.
  Strategic board nominations and a focus on individual/major gifts, corporate
  sponsorships and new foundation partners will be a key to future growth. 
   
   PUBLIC AWARENESS: GP continues to fall under the radar for many Angelenos because there are numerous free public events from which to choose. GP has proactively embraced technology – recently improving our website and social media messaging - and 2016 will include a re-branding and viral video campaign. Being part of the LA2050 Challenge gives GP exposure on a wider public platform and helps us educate audiences about our values and message.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  GP will invest in a major audience survey tracking attendance figures,
  demographics, # of new audience members, growth of social media participation,
  and artist/audience reactions to programs along with the LA2050 CONNECT
  metrics identified. Surveys will be deployed onsite at events with the help of
  volunteers and through social media and e-newsletter. Metrics provided by our
  web server and social media outlets provide data on # of hits, time spent on
  the web site, pages viewed/shared and other essential evaluation information. 
   
   While data-driven measurements are crucial, it is often the personal anecdote or story that best relates the impact of our work in the community and these stories are gathered online and through participatory activities (a new StoryCorps style initiative) at live events. A successful project will meet or exceed the following goals:
   
   Increase audience by 10%
   Increase social media followers by 25% 
   Add 100 new volunteers
   Add 500 new voters
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  While other free performing arts venues have emerged in Los Angeles, GP is
  uniquely positioned to serve the community because of the high caliber of our
  artists and production standards, the confidence our audience has in their
  experience at our venue, the diversity of artists on our stage, and deep
  outreach to diverse communities. 
   
   Our audience is multigenerational, multicultural, multi-ethnic and comes from every socio-economic group and geographic area of L.A. County creating an inclusive environment ripe for cultural exchange and community building. Nearly half of our audience is below the median family income for LA County ($55,476). 
   
   When underserved communities are served by performing arts presenters, it is typically through outreach activities separate from the primary performing arts program or through limited free ticket distribution. GP believes that underserved communities are served best when integrated into a diverse audience experiencing a rich and varied program. Multiple programming initiatives/themes are woven through each season that inspire and direct our community engagement strategies. It is this thoughtfully-curated programming that sets GP apart.
   
   Without the barrier of ticket prices, people can connect with the art and each other in deeper and more meaningful ways. Grand Performances builds community and promotes cross-cultural understanding by providing the opportunity to see one’s own culture validated and the chance to get an informed view of other cultures. 
   
   “It's organizations like Grand Performances that keep the essence of communities alive through the power of love...the power of music.” - artist Fared Shafinury (2013)
   
   “Although I live 60 miles North of LA, I come down as often as possible to get arts and culture. I have been exposed to so much diverse, exotic music by GP, and met so many kind and wonderful people. The oasis that is California Plaza is an amazing open air showcase nestled in the heart of DTLA. If it weren't for music, I wouldn't be here today. Thanks to Grand Performances, for enriching our lives with so much good stuff. I can't wait for the next season.” - audience member Lamar (2014)
   
   “Never in 1,000 years did we think we would end a night like this....Stevie Wonder. The stage was on fire… LaLa land is alive and thankful tonight. From Downey, CA we always have loved Grand Performances… thank you for keeping it REAL.” – audience member Anita (2013)
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Grand Performances works closely with non-arts organizations such as Downtown
  Women’s Center, Prototypes, The Wall Las Memorias, the African American Voter
  Registration and Education Project, and L.A. Bicycle Coalition to serve our
  audiences. These collaborations help attract new audiences to our programs
  while creating community dialogue around important issues. Some deeper
  partnerships planned for 2016 include:
   
   Council Districts: GP has established quality relations with the three Councilmembers serving the populations living within 3-5 miles of our primary venue and will continue to appropriately engage their field deputies to deepen relations with their constituents.
   
   Los Angeles Public Library: As natural collaborators, GP and LAPL have had formal and informal relations for over a decade and meetings between key staff are often held to discuss collaborative options. There have been coordinated engagements for GP artists; distribution of collateral through LAPL branches, and “Songs in the Key of LA” a major 2013 presentation which brought music from the LAPL sheet music collection to life on the GP stage drawing more than 3,500 Angelenos.
   
   Voter Registration Organizations: African-American Voter Registration and Education Project and others will be invited to be part of an onsite registration effort.
   
   Non-Profit Organizations: We will identify additional non-profit organizations in the Chicano/Latino community to dovetail with programming related to the Chicano Moratorium.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  A successful LA2050 project will raise the profile of Grand Performances,
  reinvigorate our base of supporters, and educate a whole new constituency
  about our values and mission. Most importantly it will support three core
  priorities of a three year strategic plan 2015-17 that will propel GP’s
  artistic reputation, organizational vitality and sustainability for years to
  come. 
   
   EXPAND AUDIENCE BREADTH AND ENGAGEMENT
   GP will use data garnered from LA2050 surveys to better understand what motivates our audiences and test various modes of communication to reach deep and repeatedly into communities.
   
   GP will continue to create cross-sector opportunities that will expand our audience reach while bringing information about our partners’ services to all of the people in our audiences. 
   
   GP will position its programs be even more involved in LA neighborhoods; GP leadership has been in conversation with elected officials who are interested in securing special funding to bring GP programs to their districts because not all residents are willing and able to travel to Downtown for programs.
   
   GP will engage with more community-based organizations to reach the “high-hanging fruit” – those people, who for various cultural reasons are least likely to become part of our audiences.
   
   GP will deepen our relationships with artists who want to create work of importance and relevance to LA; and, in other ways, expand on our mission to bring performing arts to diverse audiences.
   
   ENHANCE AND DIVERSIFY FUNDING
   GP is establishing partnerships with several new sponsors and new potential funders that are recognizing we are a mission-driven performing arts organization with high standards for presentation and audience development and an eye on demonstrating the role that the arts play in civil societies. 
   
   GP has been in conversations with a number of government agencies and leading foundations to discuss partnerships and support for initiatives and expanded community engagement.
   
   STRENGTHEN ORGANIZATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND LEADERSHIP
   Most importantly, our board is committed to expanding its membership and securing the broad-based support needed to connect Angelenos all the way to 2050!
