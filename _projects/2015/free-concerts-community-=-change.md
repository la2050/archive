  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "GP believes that access to the arts should be a right and not a privilege and that the arts play a critical role in healthy communities.  Since 1987, a million Southern Californians have come to our concerts, discovered new artists and connected and engaged with those around them. In 2016, Grand Performances will:\r\n\r\n1) CELEBRATE 30 YEARS\r\nGP will launch a celebratory 30th season of music, dance, film, theater and spoken word that addresses local, national and even international issues through the performing arts. These programs will be complemented by post-show discussions, community gatherings, and online forums to encourage active participation from the community. This will include the second year of “re:ARRANGED - Muslim Cultures Illuminated” a 22-month cultural exchange and artist residency project that expands the definition of Muslim culture for participating local artists, underserved youth, and the general public. \r\n\r\n2) TAKE THE SHOW ON THE ROAD \r\nGP will test off-site programming collaborations through a deeper partnership with the Los Angeles City Public Library (LAPL).  This will include a series of Poetry Writing and Performance workshops at three South L.A. branch libraries and a series of five viewing and discussion programs in East and North L.A. branch libraries around the “Latino Americans 500 Years of History” public programming initiative produced by the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) and the American Library Association (ALA).\r\n \r\n3) INCREASE VOTER REGISTRATION AND VOLUNTEER ENGAGEMENT\r\nGP recognizes the need to develop a well-trained volunteer force that is deeply engaged with and actively involved in the organization - as \"music docents\" for the larger audience during our free concert series, or goodwill brand ambassadors at offsite events. GP will deepen current partnerships with community organizations to engage audiences around voter registration and volunteer engagement. Organizations like the African American Voter Registration and Education Project and other community-focused operations will be onsite at our performances and be complemented by a social media campaign. \r\n\r\n4) SUPPORT PROFESSIONAL ARTISTS\r\nMany people ask us – if the shows are free, do the artists perform for free? Not only are talented local and international artists paid competitive fees, they are supported by a crew of seasoned theatre professionals and work with our Director of Programming to develop new work and create one-of-a-kind programs.

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "FUNDING: While funding from California Plaza owners has been a stabilizing factor since our inception covering nearly half the budget, each summer requires greater private sector funding to cover increased production and maintenance costs, professional and competitive artist fees, and the costs of expanded marketing and new media applications to engage and inform audiences. Strategic board nominations and a focus on individual/major gifts, corporate sponsorships and new foundation partners will be a key to future growth. \r\n\r\nPUBLIC AWARENESS: GP continues to fall under the radar for many Angelenos because there are numerous free public events from which to choose. GP has proactively embraced technology – recently improving our website and social media messaging - and 2016 will include a re-branding and viral video campaign. Being part of the LA2050 Challenge gives GP exposure on a wider public platform and helps us educate audiences about our values and message.\r\n"
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "GP will invest in a major audience survey tracking attendance figures, demographics, # of new audience members, growth of social media participation, and artist/audience reactions to programs along with the LA2050 CONNECT metrics identified. Surveys will be deployed onsite at events with the help of volunteers and through social media and e-newsletter. Metrics provided by our web server and social media outlets provide data on # of hits, time spent on the web site, pages viewed/shared and other essential evaluation information. \r\n\r\nWhile data-driven measurements are crucial, it is often the personal anecdote or story that best relates the impact of our work in the community and these stories are gathered online and through participatory activities (a new StoryCorps style initiative) at live events.  A successful project will meet or exceed the following goals:\r\n\r\nIncrease audience by 10%\r\nIncrease social media followers by 25% \r\nAdd 100 new volunteers\r\nAdd 500 new voters"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "While other free performing arts venues have emerged in Los Angeles, GP is uniquely positioned to serve the community because of the high caliber of our artists and production standards, the confidence our audience has in their experience at our venue, the diversity of artists on our stage, and deep outreach to diverse communities. \r\n\r\nOur audience is multigenerational, multicultural, multi-ethnic and comes from every socio-economic group and geographic area of L.A. County creating an inclusive environment ripe for cultural exchange and community building. Nearly half of our audience is below the median family income for LA County ($55,476). \r\n\r\nWhen underserved communities are served by performing arts presenters, it is typically through outreach activities separate from the primary performing arts program or through limited free ticket distribution. GP believes that underserved communities are served best when integrated into a diverse audience experiencing a rich and varied program. Multiple programming initiatives/themes are woven through each season that inspire and direct our community engagement strategies. It is this thoughtfully-curated programming that sets GP apart.\r\n\r\nWithout the barrier of ticket prices, people can connect with the art and each other in deeper and more meaningful ways. Grand Performances builds community and promotes cross-cultural understanding by providing the opportunity to see one’s own culture validated and the chance to get an informed view of other cultures. \r\n\r\n“It's organizations like Grand Performances that keep the essence of communities alive through the power of love...the power of music.” - artist Fared Shafinury (2013)\r\n\r\n“Although I live 60 miles North of LA, I come down as often as possible to get arts and culture. I have been exposed to so much diverse, exotic music by GP, and met so many kind and wonderful people. The oasis that is California Plaza is an amazing open air showcase nestled in the heart of DTLA. If it weren't for music, I wouldn't be here today. Thanks to Grand Performances, for enriching our lives with so much good stuff. I can't wait for the next season.” - audience member Lamar (2014)\r\n\r\n“Never in 1,000 years did we think we would end a night like this....Stevie Wonder. The stage was on fire… LaLa land is alive and thankful tonight. From Downey, CA we always have loved Grand Performances… thank you for keeping it REAL.”  – audience member Anita (2013)\r\n"
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "Grand Performances works closely with non-arts organizations such as Downtown Women’s Center, Prototypes, The Wall Las Memorias, the African American Voter Registration and Education Project, and L.A. Bicycle Coalition to serve our audiences.  These collaborations help attract new audiences to our programs while creating community dialogue around important issues. Some deeper partnerships planned for 2016 include:\r\n\r\nCouncil Districts: GP has established quality relations with the three Councilmembers serving the populations living within 3-5 miles of our primary venue and will continue to appropriately engage their field deputies to deepen relations with their constituents.\r\n\r\nLos Angeles Public Library: As natural collaborators, GP and LAPL have had formal and informal relations for over a decade and meetings between key staff are often held to discuss collaborative options.  There have been coordinated engagements for GP artists; distribution of collateral through LAPL branches, and “Songs in the Key of LA” a major 2013 presentation which brought music from the LAPL sheet music collection to life on the GP stage drawing more than 3,500 Angelenos.\r\n\r\nVoter Registration Organizations: African-American Voter Registration and Education Project and others will be invited to be part of an onsite registration effort.\r\n\r\nNon-Profit Organizations: We will identify additional non-profit organizations in the Chicano/Latino community to dovetail with programming related to the Chicano Moratorium. "
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': "An award from LA2050 will help support the 30th anniversary season of Grand Performances which is our project. The annual programming budget is approximately $1.3 million of a $1.8 million annual operating budget. An annual fundraising plan that strives for a sustainable, diverse funding base will be employed to cover the additional programming costs. \r\n\r\nINCOME \r\nEarned Revenue (Cal Plaza) $630,000\r\nEarned Revenue (sponsorships) $50,000\r\nBoard/Individual Contributions $200,000 \r\nCorporate Contributions $40,000 \r\nFoundation Contributions $125,000 \r\nGovernment Contributions $80,000 \r\nSpecial Events – Fundraiser $75,000 \r\nLA2050 Grant $100,000\r\nTOTAL $1,300,000\r\n\r\nCorporate gifts and sponsorships, grants from public and private foundations, and support from individuals are actively solicited throughout the year including a highly effective “red bucket” campaign onsite at each performance. In addition to the set amount of funding committed to the organization by the building owners for administration and operations, Grand Performances is seeking funding for the 2016 season and beyond. Important grants from the American Library Association, Doris Duke Foundation for Islamic Arts, California Arts Council, Los Angeles County Arts Commission, Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs have been secured.  \r\n\r\nRenewing funding partners pending include The National Endowment for the Arts, The Ralph M. Parsons Foundation, The Ahmanson Foundation, The Green Foundation, The Colburn Foundation, The Farhang Foundation, City National Bank, Sony Pictures Entertainment Union Bank, U.S. Bank, Employees Community Fund Boeing, Black Equities, Wells Fargo AARP and many others."
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "55% of the award would be used to cover a portion of the 30th anniversary season artist fees and production costs. 25% would be used to cover the 2016 advertising, marketing and re-branding campaign. 20% would be used to cover the costs of season evaluation and community engagement activities.\r\n\r\nArtist Fees/Touring $30,000\r\nAdvertising/Marketing $25,000\r\nProduction Costs $25,000\r\nSurvey/Evaluation/Website: $10,000\r\nCommunity Engagement Activities $10,000\r\nTOTAL: $100,000\r\n"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "A successful LA2050 project will raise the profile of Grand Performances, reinvigorate our base of supporters, and educate a whole new constituency about our values and mission. Most importantly it will support three core priorities of a three year strategic plan 2015-17 that will propel GP’s artistic reputation, organizational vitality and sustainability for years to come. \r\n\r\nEXPAND AUDIENCE BREADTH AND ENGAGEMENT\r\nGP will use data garnered from LA2050 surveys to better understand what motivates our audiences and test various modes of communication to reach deep and repeatedly into communities.\r\n\r\nGP will continue to create cross-sector opportunities that will expand our audience reach while bringing information about our partners’ services to all of the people in our audiences.   \r\n\r\nGP will position its programs be even more involved in LA neighborhoods; GP leadership has been in conversation with elected officials who are interested in securing special funding to bring GP programs to their districts because not all residents are willing and able to travel to Downtown for programs.\r\n\r\nGP will engage with more community-based organizations to reach the “high-hanging fruit” – those people, who for various cultural reasons are least likely to become part of our audiences.\r\n\r\nGP will deepen our relationships with artists who want to create work of importance and relevance to LA; and, in other ways, expand on our mission to bring performing arts to diverse audiences.\r\n\r\nENHANCE AND DIVERSIFY FUNDING\r\nGP is establishing partnerships with several new sponsors and new potential funders that are recognizing we are a mission-driven performing arts organization with high standards for presentation and audience development and an eye on demonstrating the role that the arts play in civil societies. \r\n\r\nGP has been in conversations with a number of government agencies and leading foundations to discuss partnerships and support for initiatives and expanded community engagement.\r\n\r\nSTRENGTHEN ORGANIZATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND LEADERSHIP\r\nMost importantly, our board is committed to expanding its membership and securing the broad-based support needed to connect Angelenos all the way to 2050!"

  priorities of a three year strategic plan 2015-17 that will propel GP’s
  artistic reputation, organizational vitality and sustainability for years to
  come. 
   
   EXPAND AUDIENCE BREADTH AND ENGAGEMENT
   GP will use data garnered from LA2050 surveys to better understand what motivates our audiences and test various modes of communication to reach deep and repeatedly into communities.
   
   GP will continue to create cross-sector opportunities that will expand our audience reach while bringing information about our partners’ services to all of the people in our audiences. 
   
   GP will position its programs be even more involved in LA neighborhoods; GP leadership has been in conversation with elected officials who are interested in securing special funding to bring GP programs to their districts because not all residents are willing and able to travel to Downtown for programs.
   
   GP will engage with more community-based organizations to reach the “high-hanging fruit” – those people, who for various cultural reasons are least likely to become part of our audiences.
   
   GP will deepen our relationships with artists who want to create work of importance and relevance to LA; and, in other ways, expand on our mission to bring performing arts to diverse audiences.
   
   ENHANCE AND DIVERSIFY FUNDING
   GP is establishing partnerships with several new sponsors and new potential funders that are recognizing we are a mission-driven performing arts organization with high standards for presentation and audience development and an eye on demonstrating the role that the arts play in civil societies. 
   
   GP has been in conversations with a number of government agencies and leading foundations to discuss partnerships and support for initiatives and expanded community engagement.
   
   STRENGTHEN ORGANIZATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND LEADERSHIP
   Most importantly, our board is committed to expanding its membership and securing the broad-based support needed to connect Angelenos all the way to 2050!
