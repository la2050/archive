  This grant will support IAVA’s Rapid Response Referral Program (RRRP),
  providing LA’s more than 320,000 veterans and their families with support as
  they transition to civilian life—which can be challenging in LA, where
  homelessness and unemployment rates among veterans are higher than average and
  where it can take over a year for a VA claim to be processed. IAVA will hold
  numerous community outreach activities to provide vets with access to RRRP and
  its holistic, integrated partner services.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Post-9/11 veterans living in LA face daunting challenges during their
  transition to civilian life. Many struggle to find employment, reintegrate
  into their community, or navigate complex bureaucracies to obtain health care.
  A $100,000 grant through this program will enable IAVA to meet these
  challenges by expanding the work of RRRP in the greater LA area. Our Veteran
  Transition Managers (VTMs), who have master’s degrees in social work, will
  help connect veterans to needed resources in Los Angeles. Our VTMs will
  increase VA healthcare utilization by educating clients on the services of the
  West LA. VA and advocating for them to get appointments, and will do the same
  with other vet-specific and community-based resources in greater LA, including
  housing and mental health resources. We will build and demonstrate resiliency
  through our community building work in California, creating social engagement
  events for veterans.
   
   Through this program, IAVA will ensure that veterans in LA receive the services they need to enable them to become productive members of their communities. The specific outcomes that will be realized during the grant period are:
   
   • RRRP will serve at least 180 veterans and veteran family members from the Greater Los Angeles area. This would represent a 20 percent increase in the number of individuals served over the past year, indicating that RRRP is gaining traction and deepening its impact in southern California.
   • RRRP will provide these clients with at least 400 referrals to critical resources and support systems—addressing a variety of needs such as mental health care, financial and legal assistance, and help with finding civilian jobs.
   • Trained RRRP Ambassadors (veteran members of IAVA) will conduct 25 or more peer-to-peer outreach activities at LA colleges and universities, service partner locations, and community events to encourage veterans to access RRRP and its many benefits.
   • IAVA will host one convening of veterans’ service providers in southern California, in order to broaden the network of providers to which RRRP refers clients, and also to foster increased cooperation among nonprofits, government agencies, and other key stakeholders for the veterans community. Our ultimate goal is to strengthen the safety net for veterans throughout Greater L.A.
   • IAVA will develop formal relationships with at least six providers in Greater L.A.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  A primary barrier for this program is limited staff to promote the above
  services. To address this challenge, IAVA has introduced a new program through
  which our most dedicated members serve as “RRRP Ambassadors”. These
  Ambassadors—mostly veterans, but also some family members and
  civilians—volunteer to promote RRRP in their local communities on a regular
  basis. They receive a one-day training that focuses on outreach and
  mobilization practices, best practices in community mapping, RRRP’s service
  model, and techniques for engaging veterans on a peer-to-peer level. Thus far,
  IAVA has more than ten active Ambassadors in the LA area, and we are currently
  working to schedule additional training sessions for additional interested
  volunteers. Harnessing energy from other potential stakeholders, such as the
  bureaucratic VA system (e.g., the troubled VA West LA Medical Center), is a
  potential challenge, but we plan to use our VTMs and Ambassadors to work with
  these partners.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  IAVA monitors each client’s case through Salesforce, the database that
  confidentially tracks our interactions with veterans and core program
  outcomes. Salesforce enables IAVA to process real-time information on: the
  number of RRRP clients served; the number and type of referrals provided to
  clients; the number of benefits confirmed as received; and the length of time
  it takes to resolve each client’s case.
   
   IAVA also receives direct feedback from RRRP clients. Once their cases have closed, clients complete surveys in which they report their level of satisfaction with their case managers and whether RRRP helped reduce their stress levels. RRRP clients consistently rate the level of service they receive from RRRP VTMs highly. Written feedback further illuminates clients’ experiences with RRRP. “Thank you,” one wrote recently. “You may have just saved my life man.” This is just one example of the warm words of appreciation that RRRP clients have shared.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  The need for a program like RRRP is great, and other notable
  organizations—such as The Soldiers Project, 211, the Battle Buddy Bridge
  Program and the United Way—are responding to it. To date, however, none are
  simultaneously providing holistic and ongoing professional support,
  facilitating seamless access to quality resources, connecting veterans and
  family members to an expansive peer community, and amplifying impact through
  data collection and dissemination. Additionally, while this project is focused
  on veterans in the greater L.A. area, IAVA works nationwide, enabling us to
  provide continuous care to a potentially transient population.
   
   Specific examples of what sets RRRP apart include:
   
   • RRRP offers more than a hotline: Veteran Transition Managers look at clients’ needs holistically and provide ongoing support for as long as it takes. All VTM’s are masters-level social workers, whose education and experience has focused on veterans. Many are veterans or veteran family members.
   • Each RRRP client has a dedicated point of contact to manage resource navigation, while also having access to IAVA’s expansive peer community. This broad support is more versatile and readily available than would be possible for any single peer counselor.
   • RRRP connects veterans with a range of resources—from local services to national programs, both governmental and nongovernmental. We listen to clients about what works and what doesn’t, and we make referrals only to best-in-class resources.
   • RRRP has a low barrier to entry, helping people with all discharge statuses and income levels, as well as family members. No one has to come to an office. Help is just a phone call or email away.
   • RRRP brings to bear IAVA’s national brand and a decade of media savvy. Thanks in part to our regular media presence our brand is both recognized and trusted; this is critical for a program that requires veterans to proactively ask for help.
   • Because RRRP does not provide direct services, it does not compete with providers. We do possess the tools, digital capabilities, and reach to facilitate connections among providers and more seamlessly shepherd clients through the maze.
   • RRRP tracks program data in real-time, including the number and location of clients served, number and type of referrals and benefits received, average case times, and more. We survey clients about their experience with RRRP and every referral received. This data helps refine program and outreach strategies.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Strong relationships with service providers and a solid understanding of their
  programs enable VTMs to make better quality referrals and to serve as stronger
  advocates on clients’ behalf when needed. These providers are also the best
  sources of referrals to RRRP—a client is more likely to contact RRRP at the
  recommendation of another service provider that he or she trusts. Top partners
  in the Greater L.A. area include PATH (People Assisting the Homeless),
  Volunteers of America, the Soldiers Project, Inner City Law, and Valiant VA
  Claims Services in Orange County. 
   
   Thanks to a grant from a private foundation, IAVA is currently piloting a program in LA through which we provide small ($2,000 to $3,000) sub-grants to a select number of referral partners. We anticipate completing an evaluation of this pilot program by June 2016, with plans to expand the program if it proves successful. We have therefore included $5,000 in the budget for this grant for sub-grants.
   
   To advance referral relationships, IAVA is making a concerted effort to develop formal memoranda of understanding with service providers in Greater Los Angeles. IAVA recently hosted a convening in Orange County for representatives from 17 best-in-class service providers from across the employment, education, housing, and mental health sectors. These will be excellent referral partners for RRRP; we plan to host a similar event in southern California in the coming year.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  As detailed below, the one year budget for this program is $343,980. IAVA
  receives support for this program from a number of foundations, including the
  Resnick Foundation, Phil and Monica Rosenthal Foundation, Annenberg Foundation
  and the May and Stanley Smith Charitable Trust. In addition, RRRP’s national
  activities (including those in California) are funded by the Educational
  Foundation of America, The van Ameringen Foundation, and Harley-Davidson
  Foundation. IAVA is committed to sustaining and expanding RRRP, and our
  development team is working tirelessly alongside senior leadership to
  diversify and expand revenue sources for the program in LA and on a national
  basis.

How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  In the short time since its launch in L.A. a little more than a year ago, the
  Rapid Response Referral Program has successfully served hundreds of clients;
  enabled IAVA to build relationships with local service providers; and paved
  the way for our L.A.-based community organizing work. IAVA is now leveraging
  this presence to expand and deepen RRRP’s impact in the L.A. area, and this
  grant would support these efforts. We are training RRRP Ambassadors, hiring
  L.A. social work staff, and increasing our outreach and community building
  activities.
