project_summary: >-
  The 30,000 children under the care of the Dependency Court in L.A. County are
  hurt, frightened, and confused children in desperate need of support and
  advocacy services -- a need that trained, court-appointed CASA volunteer
  advocates fill. CASA of Los Angeles will recruit 250 more volunteers to help
  these children navigate not only the trials of the courtroom but the trials of
  a challenged childhood.
