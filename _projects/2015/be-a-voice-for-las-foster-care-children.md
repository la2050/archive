project_summary: >-
  The 30,000 children under the care of the Dependency Court in L.A. County are
  frightened and confused, and in desperate need of support and advocacy
  services - a need that trained volunteers fill by building a relationship with
  a child in foster care, and working with the Court to determine the best
  strategies to support him or her. CASA/LA will recruit 550 more volunteers by
  the end of 2017 to help these children navigate the trials of the courtroom -
  and the trials of a challenged childhood.

  CASA of Los Angeles helps children in foster care from everywhere in Los
  Angeles County.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Nelson Mandela once said, "There can be no keener revelation of a society's
  soul than the way in which it treats its children." For LA's abused and
  neglected children, LA's soul is revealed to be diverse, hopeful, challenged,
  determined, and sadly, in desperate need of connection. CASA/LA creates a
  connection between an adult volunteer and a neglected child that transforms
  the volunteer’s life as much as it changes the child’s. CASA of Los Angeles
  unites these multiple generations, responding to the needs of our community’s
  most vulnerable children with the knowledge of our city’s most brilliant,
  compassionate, and committed adults.
   
   Being a CASA is unlike any other volunteer opportunity in the city. CASAs become a critical part of the foster care youth's life - they get to know their families and caregivers, they work with their teachers and counselors, they connect them to services and advocate for what they need in the courtroom, and they create a stable, long-term relationship with the child without ever being paid to do so.
   
   Every child faces challenges in life. From homework to bullies, from fights with their siblings to issues with their parents, but for children in foster care, every single one of those problems is magnified, overwhelming children who already struggle with resiliency. They are alone and afraid. They have often been removed from a traumatic home life only to be transferred to a strange placement with strange people, having to negotiate not only the social rules of a new school, but a whole new family, adults and children alike. 
   
   It is not surprising that children in foster care experience the following distressing consequences:
   • 85% of foster youth live with serious mental health challenges 
   • 37% will not finish high school 
   • 33% of girls in foster care became pregnant by age 17 
   • 27% of the homeless population spent time in foster care 
   • 25% of youth aging out of foster care will be incarcerated within two years
   
   There is no more critical cause through which Angelenos can connect than its most vulnerable children - children who have no voice. Through LA2050, CASA will recruit and train 250 new volunteers in FY2016, and 300 new volunteers in FY2017, a significant increase over any previous year. In the next few years, CASA plans to serve 10% of the 30,000 children in the foster care system. By connecting Angelenos, we can make that goal happen, revealing the compassion and commitment that is Los Angeles.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  The biggest barrier to recruiting more volunteers is the lack of awareness in
  the Los Angeles community about CASA of Los Angeles and the critical services
  that our volunteer advocates provide. Through increased exposure, CASA/LA can
  introduce more people to this life-changing work and can recruit more
  volunteers to advocate on behalf of abused and neglected youth in the foster
  care system, many of whom are struggling with some of the largest issues of
  our day: human trafficking, sexual exploitation, mental health and educational
  delays, and more. When someone becomes a CASA volunteer, they are not only
  addressing the challenges of the foster care system, they are addressing a
  number of issues affecting our community. We believe that through the support
  of LA 2050, we can create a new idea of what it means to be a volunteer. The
  CASA program offers its volunteers the opportunity to become conduits for
  change in the lives of abused and neglected children throughout our community.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  CASA/LA currently tracks all key data elements, i.e. how many children we
  serve, how many CASAs are serving said youth, the number of children on our
  waitlist, and how many more CASA volunteers are needed to serve that waitlist.
  In addition, we also track case progress. When a case is assigned, both the
  Senior Program Coordinator and the CASA volunteer will examine the case and
  will rate the status and level of risk of the child on a baseline scale along
  the three core dimensions of safety, permanency and wellbeing. We will be
  documenting in the database the initial assessment related to these
  dimensions; the advocacy goals and plans (steps and procedures to be
  implemented); the degree to which the plan is then implemented; and how the
  assessment of safety, permanency, and wellbeing measures changes over time.
  The overall goal of CASA/LA’s evaluation plan is to determine if inputs are
  leading to effective outcomes.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  CASA of Los Angeles is the only organization in Los Angeles providing
  court-appointed advocates to foster care youth. Though we will work with other
  organizations on recruitment efforts, CASA/LA is unique in that we recruit and
  train volunteers from all across Los Angeles to serve as mentors, guides, and
  as a voice for the child who cannot speak up for him or herself. As a result,
  foster children paired with a CASA spend fewer years in foster care, are more
  likely to be adopted, and have a better chance of achieving greater academic
  success.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  CASA/LA’s current partnerships include numerous organizations advocating for
  the wellbeing of underserved youth throughout Los Angeles County and beyond,
  such as The Right Way Foundation, Zero to Three, Project ABC, L.A. Child
  Guidance Center, Child Development Institute, Vista Del Mar Child and Family
  Services, Secure Transitions Foster Family Agency, the Alliance for Children’s
  Rights, among others. In addition, of Los Angeles regularly partners with
  like-minded organizations and governmental agencies to serve—and save—more
  children in the dependency courts, including:
   
   • Los Angeles Dependency Court
   • The Los Angeles Department of Children and Family Services
   • Children's Law Center
   • The Alliance for Children's Rights
   • Child Development Institute
   • Los Angeles Department of Mental Health
   • Los Angeles Department of Public Health
   
   However, through LA2050, CASA/LA hopes to expand its partnerships to include groups which work with specific diverse populations, like First African Methodist Episcopal Church (FAME), the Los Angeles Latino Chamber of Congress (LALCC), the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center, Hispanic Organization Promoting Education (HOPE), Brotherhood Crusade, and 100 Black Men of Los Angeles. Through this project, CASA hopes to expand outreach to these specific communities and their respective organizations to find new and creative ways to collaborate and to connect community members as CASA volunteers.

How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  This year, CASA aims to serve 1,000 of the 30,000 children in foster care, but
  are goals are far more ambitious than that. In the last five years, CASA has
  nearly doubled the number served, and in the next five years, we plan to
  triple it, serving 10% of the youth in foster care. By 2050, CASA/LA will
  serve all youth in foster care, but we cannot do that without an enormous
  recruitment effort across Los Angeles, engaging potential volunteers from all
  communities, all income classes, and all races and ethnicities. This first
  major recruitment effort will allow us to build an outreach model to
  accomplish this significant goal, first by changing how Los Angeles views
  volunteer opportunities, and then by recruiting enough volunteers to serve all
  children in need.
