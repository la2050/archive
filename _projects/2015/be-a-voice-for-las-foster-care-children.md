title: Be a Voice for LAs Foster Care Children!
project_summary: >-
  The 30,000 children under the care of the Dependency Court in L.A. County are
  hurt, frightened, and confused children in desperate need of support and
  advocacy services -- a need that trained, court-appointed CASA volunteer
  advocates fill.  CASA of Los Angeles will recruit 250 more volunteers to help
  these children navigate not only the trials of the courtroom but the trials of
  a challenged childhood.

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "Nelson Mandela once said, \"There can be no keener revelation of a society's soul than the way in which it treats its children.\" For LA's abused and neglected children, LA's soul is revealed to be diverse, hopeful, challenged, determined, and sadly, in desperate need of connection. CASA/LA creates a connection between an adult volunteer and a neglected child that transforms the volunteer’s life as much as it changes the child’s. By uniting these multiple generations, CASA of Los Angeles responds to the needs of our community’s most vulnerable children with the knowledge of our city’s most brilliant, compassionate, and committed adults.\r\n\r\nBeing a CASA is unlike any other volunteer opportunity in the city. CASAs become a critical part of the foster care youth's life - they get to know their families and caregivers, they work with their teachers and counselor, they connect them to services and advocate for what they need in the courtroom, and they become a stable, long-term adult who cares about the child without ever being paid to do so.\r\n\r\nEvery child faces challenges in life. From homework to bullies, from fights with their siblings to issues with their parents, but for children in foster care, every single one of those problems is magnified, overwhelming children who already struggle with resiliency. They are alone and afraid. They have often been removed from a traumatic home life only to be transferred to a strange placement with strange people, having to negotiate not only the social rules of a new school, but a whole new set of children, who have come from equally traumatized homes. It is not surprising that children in foster care experience the following distressing consequences:\r\n\r\n•\t85% of foster youth live with serious mental health challenges\r\n•\t37% will not finish high school \r\n•\t33% of girls in foster care became pregnant by age 17\r\n•\t27% of the homeless population spent time in foster care\r\n•\t25% of youth aging out of foster care will be incarcerated within two years\r\n\r\nThere is no more critical cause through which Angelenos can connect than its most vulnerable children - children who have no voice. Through LA2050, CASA will recruit and train 250 new volunteers in 2016, a significant increase over any previous year. In the next few years, CASA plans to serve 10% of the 30,000 children in the foster care system. By connecting Angelenos, we can make that goal happen, revealing the kindness, compassion, and commitment that is Los Angeles."

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "The biggest barrier to recruiting more volunteers is the level of commitment that being a CASA demands. CASA volunteers work anywhere from 10-20 hours a month on their cases. They drive all over Los Angeles County to meet with their youth, to appear in court, and to provide educational, medical, and mental health advocacy for foster care youth. And their lives are absolutely transformed by it.\r\n\r\nWe believe that through the support of LA 2050, we can create a new idea of what it means to be a volunteer. Though spending a few hours or a few days giving one's time is amazing, creating a long-term connection with a child who has no one else to help them creates a network of social and emotional support not only for the youth, both also for the CASA. The CASA program offers its volunteers the opportunity to become investigators, reporters, liaisons, and conduits for change. The hours invested forever changes the lives of everyone involved."
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    CASA/LA currently tracks all key data elements, i.e. how many children we
    serve, how many CASAs are serving said youth, the number of children on our
    waitlist, and how many more CASA volunteers are needed to serve that
    waitlist. In addition, we also track case progress. When a case is assigned,
    both the Senior Program Coordinator and the CASA volunteer will examine the
    case and will rate the status and level of risk of the child on a baseline
    scale along the three core dimensions of safety, permanency and wellbeing.
    We will be documenting in the database the initial assessment related to
    these dimensions; the advocacy goals and plans (steps and procedures to be
    implemented); the degree to which the plan is then implemented; and how the
    assessment of safety, permanency, and wellbeing measures changes over time.
    The overall goal of CASA/LA’s evaluation plan is to determine if inputs are
    leading to effective outcomes.
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    CASA of Los Angeles is the only organization in Los Angeles providing
    court-appointed advocates to foster care youth. Though we will work with
    other organizations on recruitment efforts, CASA/LA is unique in that we
    recruit and train volunteers from all across Los Angeles to serve as
    mentors, guides, and as a voice for the child who cannot speak up for him or
    herself. As a result, foster children paired with a CASA spend fewer years
    in foster care, are more likely to be adopted, and have a better chance of
    achieving greater academic success.
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "CASA/LA’s current partnerships include numerous organizations advocating for the wellbeing of underserved youth throughout Los Angeles County and beyond, such as The Right Way Foundation, Zero to Three, Project ABC, L.A. Child Guidance Center, Child Development Institute, Vista Del Mar Child and Family Services, Secure Transitions Foster Family Agency, the Alliance for Children’s Rights, among others. In addition, of Los Angeles regularly partners with like-minded organizations and governmental agencies to serve—and save—more children in the dependency courts, including:\r\n\r\n•\tLos Angeles Dependency Court\r\n•\tThe Los Angeles Department of Children and Family Services\r\n•\tChildren's Law Center\r\n•\tThe Alliance for Children's Rights\r\n•\tChild Development Institute\r\n•\tLos Angeles Department of Mental Health\r\n•\tLos Angeles Department of Public Health\r\n\r\nHowever, through LA2050, CASA/LA hopes to expand its partnerships to include groups which work with specific diverse populations, like First African Methodist Episcopal Church (FAME), the Los Angeles Latino Chamber of Congress (LALCC), the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center, Hispanic Organization Promoting Education (HOPE), Brotherhood Crusade, and 100 Black Men of Los Angeles. Through this project, CASA hopes to expand outreach to these specific communities and their respective organizations to find new and creative ways to collaborate and to connect community members as CASA volunteers. \r\n"
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': "$389,680\r\n\r\nAdditional costs will be covered by alternative fundraising through foundations, corporations, events, and individual giving.\r\n"
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Outreach Expenses\r\n\r\nPersonnel - $50,000\r\nAdvertising - $25,000\r\nProfessional Services - $7,500\r\nTraining and Travel - $7,500\r\nFacilities & Equipment - $5,000\r\nInformation Systems - $5,000\r\nTotal Expense - $100,000\r\n"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    This year, CASA aims to serve 1,000 of the 30,000 children in foster care,
    but are goals are far more ambitious than that. In the last five years, CASA
    has nearly doubled the number served, and in the next five years, we plan to
    triple it, serving 10% of the youth in foster care. By 2050, CASA/LA will
    serve all youth in foster care, but we cannot do that without an enormous
    recruitment effort across Los Angeles, engaging potential volunteers from
    all communities, all income classes, and all races and ethnicities. This
    first major recruitment effort will allow us to build an outreach model to
    accomplish this significant goal, first by changing how Los Angeles views
    volunteer opportunities, and then by recruiting enough volunteers to serve
    all children in need.

By connecting Angelenos, we can make that goal happen, revealing the compassion and commitment that is Los Angeles.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  The biggest barrier to recruiting more volunteers is the lack of awareness in
  the Los Angeles community about CASA of Los Angeles and the critical services
  that our volunteer advocates provide. Through increased exposure, CASA/LA can
  introduce more people to this life-changing work and can recruit more
  volunteers to advocate on behalf of abused and neglected youth in the foster
  care system, many of whom are struggling with some of the largest issues of
  our day: human trafficking, sexual exploitation, mental health and educational
  delays, and more. When someone becomes a CASA volunteer, they are not only
  addressing the challenges of the foster care system, they are addressing a
  number of issues affecting our community. We believe that through the support
  of LA 2050, we can create a new idea of what it means to be a volunteer. The
  CASA program offers its volunteers the opportunity to become conduits for
  change in the lives of abused and neglected children throughout our community.

    answer: "Nelson Mandela once said, \"There can be no keener revelation of a society's soul than the way in which it treats its children.\" For LA's abused and neglected children, LA's soul is revealed to be diverse, hopeful, challenged, determined, and sadly, in desperate need of connection. CASA/LA creates a connection between an adult volunteer and a neglected child that transforms the volunteer’s life as much as it changes the child’s. By uniting these multiple generations, CASA of Los Angeles responds to the needs of our community’s most vulnerable children with the knowledge of our city’s most brilliant, compassionate, and committed adults.\r\n\r\nBeing a CASA is unlike any other volunteer opportunity in the city. CASAs become a critical part of the foster care youth's life - they get to know their families and caregivers, they work with their teachers and counselor, they connect them to services and advocate for what they need in the courtroom, and they become a stable, long-term adult who cares about the child without ever being paid to do so.\r\n\r\nEvery child faces challenges in life. From homework to bullies, from fights with their siblings to issues with their parents, but for children in foster care, every single one of those problems is magnified, overwhelming children who already struggle with resiliency. They are alone and afraid. They have often been removed from a traumatic home life only to be transferred to a strange placement with strange people, having to negotiate not only the social rules of a new school, but a whole new set of children, who have come from equally traumatized homes. It is not surprising that children in foster care experience the following distressing consequences:\r\n\r\n•\t85% of foster youth live with serious mental health challenges\r\n•\t37% will not finish high school \r\n•\t33% of girls in foster care became pregnant by age 17\r\n•\t27% of the homeless population spent time in foster care\r\n•\t25% of youth aging out of foster care will be incarcerated within two years\r\n\r\nThere is no more critical cause through which Angelenos can connect than its most vulnerable children - children who have no voice. Through LA2050, CASA will recruit and train 250 new volunteers in 2016, a significant increase over any previous year. In the next few years, CASA plans to serve 10% of the 30,000 children in the foster care system. By connecting Angelenos, we can make that goal happen, revealing the kindness, compassion, and commitment that is Los Angeles."

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "The biggest barrier to recruiting more volunteers is the level of commitment that being a CASA demands. CASA volunteers work anywhere from 10-20 hours a month on their cases. They drive all over Los Angeles County to meet with their youth, to appear in court, and to provide educational, medical, and mental health advocacy for foster care youth. And their lives are absolutely transformed by it.\r\n\r\nWe believe that through the support of LA 2050, we can create a new idea of what it means to be a volunteer. Though spending a few hours or a few days giving one's time is amazing, creating a long-term connection with a child who has no one else to help them creates a network of social and emotional support not only for the youth, both also for the CASA. The CASA program offers its volunteers the opportunity to become investigators, reporters, liaisons, and conduits for change. The hours invested forever changes the lives of everyone involved."

      CASA/LA currently tracks all key data elements, i.e. how many children we
      serve, how many CASAs are serving said youth, the number of children on
      our waitlist, and how many more CASA volunteers are needed to serve that
      waitlist. In addition, we also track case progress. When a case is
      assigned, both the Senior Program Coordinator and the CASA volunteer will
      examine the case and will rate the status and level of risk of the child
      on a baseline scale along the three core dimensions of safety, permanency
      and wellbeing. We will be documenting in the database the initial
      assessment related to these dimensions; the advocacy goals and plans
      (steps and procedures to be implemented); the degree to which the plan is
      then implemented; and how the assessment of safety, permanency, and
      wellbeing measures changes over time. The overall goal of CASA/LA’s
      evaluation plan is to determine if inputs are leading to effective
      outcomes.

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      CASA of Los Angeles is the only organization in Los Angeles providing
      court-appointed advocates to foster care youth. Though we will work with
      other organizations on recruitment efforts, CASA/LA is unique in that we
      recruit and train volunteers from all across Los Angeles to serve as
      mentors, guides, and as a voice for the child who cannot speak up for him
      or herself. As a result, foster children paired with a CASA spend fewer
      years in foster care, are more likely to be adopted, and have a better
      chance of achieving greater academic success.

    answer: "CASA/LA’s current partnerships include numerous organizations advocating for the wellbeing of underserved youth throughout Los Angeles County and beyond, such as The Right Way Foundation, Zero to Three, Project ABC, L.A. Child Guidance Center, Child Development Institute, Vista Del Mar Child and Family Services, Secure Transitions Foster Family Agency, the Alliance for Children’s Rights, among others. In addition, of Los Angeles regularly partners with like-minded organizations and governmental agencies to serve—and save—more children in the dependency courts, including:\r\n\r\n•\tLos Angeles Dependency Court\r\n•\tThe Los Angeles Department of Children and Family Services\r\n•\tChildren's Law Center\r\n•\tThe Alliance for Children's Rights\r\n•\tChild Development Institute\r\n•\tLos Angeles Department of Mental Health\r\n•\tLos Angeles Department of Public Health\r\n\r\nHowever, through LA2050, CASA/LA hopes to expand its partnerships to include groups which work with specific diverse populations, like First African Methodist Episcopal Church (FAME), the Los Angeles Latino Chamber of Congress (LALCC), the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center, Hispanic Organization Promoting Education (HOPE), Brotherhood Crusade, and 100 Black Men of Los Angeles. Through this project, CASA hopes to expand outreach to these specific communities and their respective organizations to find new and creative ways to collaborate and to connect community members as CASA volunteers. \r\n"

      This year, CASA aims to serve 1,000 of the 30,000 children in foster care,
      but are goals are far more ambitious than that. In the last five years,
      CASA has nearly doubled the number served, and in the next five years, we
      plan to triple it, serving 10% of the youth in foster care. By 2050,
      CASA/LA will serve all youth in foster care, but we cannot do that without
      an enormous recruitment effort across Los Angeles, engaging potential
      volunteers from all communities, all income classes, and all races and
      ethnicities. This first major recruitment effort will allow us to build an
      outreach model to accomplish this significant goal, first by changing how
      Los Angeles views volunteer opportunities, and then by recruiting enough
      volunteers to serve all children in need.
