  Children Now will help make LA County the best place to learn by recruiting,
  connecting and building the advocacy capacity of a diverse range of LA groups,
  including parent, faith, business and community organizations. With tools and
  training from Children Now, these groups will collectively push for local and
  state policies designed to ensure that all of the estimated 793,811 kids ages
  0-5 living in LA County have access to quality early childhood programs.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  The gap in services and supports for children birth-5 years is stunning. Some
  families have access to many high-quality services, while others have
  absolutely nothing. For example, a parent making minimum wage in California
  would need to spend 71% of her income on full-day infant care. By the time
  kids start kindergarten, there are already wide learning gaps that are
  extraordinarily difficult to close. With only 55% of Los Angeles third-grade
  students reading at grade level, bolder steps are needed to support our
  youngest learners. 
   The problem is urgent, and the Movement is a game changer. Public policy change is actually the most efficient and fastest way to scale innovative high-impact programs and secure the resources needed to improve early childhood outcomes for kids. Children Now created The Children’s Movement to connect a diverse range of organizations and provide the collective advocacy power needed to make kids and early learning the top investment and policy priority.
   Over the next year, LA County will become the best place to learn with the help of significant increases in proven early childhood programs, especially for low-income children, foster care kids and English language learners. This will be accomplished through these activities:
   - Identify and recruit 100 additional LA County groups to join the Children’s Movement; 
   - Spread awareness and create urgency about the need for more investments that increase quality early learning supports;
   - Provide tailored tools, such as fact sheets, talking points and sign-on letters that allow groups to successfully engage in local and state advocacy; 
   - Provide intensive, hands on advocacy training to all Movement members within targeted districts.
   As a result, at least 4 school districts in LA County addition to LAUSD will initiate or increase investments in proven early childhood programs, and the 2016-17 state budget will include increased investments in quality early childhood programs like quality child care, comprehensive home visitation and increased preschool support (with over a quarter of the state’s population, these state investments have a substantial impact on our County).
   Longer-term, Movement members will create a sustained, powerful force for local and state policy change that will help bridge the equity gap in the fragmented birth-5 system. This includes efforts aimed at creating equal access to programs working to close the opportunity gap for all kids, starting at birth.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Historically, school districts have not invested heavily, if at all, in early
  childhood programs. While Children Now’s advocacy ensured money in the new
  state education finance law could be used for early childhood, it still
  remains a struggle at the local level. The Movement strategy response is
  ensuring that diverse groups have the tools to push for local early childhood
  investments.
   
   Another major challenge is the fragmentation of the birth-5 field, complicating the essential “unified” ask. We address this risk through 1) our trusted relationships with First 5s, business, labor, provider, parent equity and other groups that need to be coordinated in a unified ask, and 2) our proven ability to position complex policy issues as “Pro-Kid.” All this was evidenced in our successful 2015 effort to unite the field in an unprecedented state policy ask advocating for early childhood investments.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: |-
  Children Now will track metrics around 3 key areas as follows:
   
   Equity: At least 4 LA County school districts, in addition to LAUSD, will initiate policies or increase investments in proven early childhood models, with a focus on English language learners and kids in poverty and foster care. District budgets will be reviewed to verify these early investments and policies.
   
   Community engagement: The number of Movement members in LA County will be increased by at least 100. Membership growth and diversity will be tracked through online databases. 
   
   Scale and Leverage: Participation of LA County Movement members in local and state level advocacy campaigns that lead to increased support for quality birth-5 programs will increase by at least 35% (policies Movement members will influence include quality child care and preschool, home visiting and others). Groups that sign onto campaigns and attend trainings to influence school district and state Pro-Kid policies will be tracked.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There are thousands of organizations in Los Angeles County that care about
  kids, but none do what Children Now does. In local and state advocacy, the
  cacophony of voices can overwhelm or confuse policymakers. Connecting and
  coordinating partners is the core of the Children’s Movement – we bring
  diverse groups together under the simple “Pro-Kid” umbrella, allowing each
  group to share credit for policy wins. Our 285+ cohort of current Los Angeles
  County members demonstrate the Movement’s breadth and diversity, and also
  indicates how powerful the Movement can be at scale. (See full Movement member
  list: http://ow.ly/Rm47z). 
   
   We are able to coordinate this vast, diverse Movement because Children Now is California’s only umbrella kid’s organization (akin to the Chamber of Commerce being an umbrella business organization). We excel at research, policy, communications, network-building and advocacy, taking a “whole child” approach and covering the full range of issues critical to child development, including early childhood, education reform, health and child welfare. We bring together opinion leaders, policymakers and community groups to find common ground and drive innovative “win-win” local and state policies that help all children thrive. 
   
   Children Now studied successful interest groups like the AARP and Chamber of Commerce to develop a proof of concept that includes: 1) a clear vision for advancing public policy for kids, 2) deep policy expertise in a broad range of topics related to children, 3) simple, unifying messaging and 4) a strong grassroots membership to create pressure needed to move kids’ issues. 
   
   The Movement soft-launched in 2011 and was successfully tested in major campaigns, including passing California’s historic school finance law in 2013 (prioritizing resources for 3.5 million kids living in poverty, 1.3 million English language learners, and 43,000 foster youth) and in 2015 unifying 350+ organizations to successfully advocate for over $300 million in investments to improve quality and access to child care and preschool for over 16,000 children statewide. There have also been local policy wins, including some school districts investing in quality early learning supports. Additionally, communities that have integrated The Children’s Movement into their advocacy work have reported they are more effective and better connected to allies in the capital and across the state.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Stakeholder involvement, support and coordination is at the core of the
  Children Now model. We currently partner with over 1500 groups across the
  state, including hundreds in Los Angeles County. This collaboration includes
  engaging groups that are rarely invited to be part of the conversation – such
  as individual businesses and faith-based congregations. 
   
   Our LA County outreach team will provide easy-to-use tools to local organizations to effectively engage and lift up a range of diverse voices – including those of parents and caregivers - to advocate for quality early childhood programs. The Movement will leverage these collective voices to scale proven efforts – created by local partners in the public, non-profit and private sectors that support early child development and literacy at the state and local levels. 
   
   While we won’t be directly sub-granting to partners, our project team has a wealth of community organizing and advocacy experience that will serve as in-kind support to hundreds of groups. Our Los Angeles office includes Sharyn Church, former deputy director of LA’s Inner-City Arts, and Fatima Morales, former policy liaison to community-based groups. The team also includes Jim Keddy, former state director of PICO California (the faith based community organizing network), Kendra Rogers, former Executive Director of First 5 Fresno, and Eduardo Aguilar, former district administrator and community organizer. Our on the ground staff will train local groups for local and state advocacy and build their confidence to participate in policy campaigns. This coordinated collection of diverse groups will effectively engage in state and local advocacy activities to support quality early childhood programs and help make LA the best place to learn.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  We estimate this project will cost $250,000 and have secured $150,000 to
  support our work to expand early childhood programs in Los Angeles.

How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  The Movement is readily scalable – whether it’s national, state or local, the
  core strategy works: connect, educate and coordinate diverse groups that care
  about kids’ wellbeing, use Pro-Kid messaging and leverage their collective
  power in the policymaking process. 
   
   No issue has more community and bipartisan support than kids’ wellbeing. But in our interest-group-driven politics, children lose out to more strategic, coordinated and consolidated efforts. The Children’s Movement addresses this by taking kids’ groups out of their silos and leveraging their collective power. The Movement is making kids the #1 policy priority by empowering hundreds of parent, business and community groups to speak with one voice.
   
   During the first year, Children Now will highlight early childhood and secure tangible wins in at least 4 school districts (and LAUSD) and the state budget by scaling The Children’s Movement model in Los Angeles County. This will be done by:
   
   - Employing the organization’s research, policy, and advocacy expertise;
   - Leveraging trusted relationships with local and state policymakers to reach the right decision makers;
   - Using our unique position as the only whole-child/umbrella children’s organization to bring hundreds of stakeholders on board;
   - Developing simple, effective Pro-Kid messaging; 
   - Communicates with Movement members daily via digital media, and engages local groups one on one to participate in local and state policy campaigns; and
   - Mobilizing the network at the right times. 
   
   The coordinated, diverse Pro-Kid advocacy base strengthened as a result of this grant will enable communities to keep working on future critical issues affecting the County’s kids. By unifying hundreds of Pro-Kid groups and serving as hub to mobilize their actions, the Movement gives children’s issues an advocacy base strong enough to compete with powerful special interests. Moving forward, kids’ issues will truly be the top priority of state and local policymakers (not just lip service), and there will be an army of engaged, coordinated organizations ready when critical policy issues arise. After the funding period, Children Now will continue to expand the Movement model throughout LA County and California.
