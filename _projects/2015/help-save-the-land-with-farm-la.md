  We want to use this grant money to create a model farm that showcases a
  sustainable way to grow organic food. In the process we will educate and
  encourage the community to get involved and learn about a more
  health-conscious way of life.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Farm LA envisions a healthier, more self-sufficient Los Angeles by utilizing
  our vacant spaces for growing organic produce. We have an over abundance of
  deserted land in Los Angeles and an under abundance of affordable organic
  produce. Using the tools we have for harnessing the sun’s energy, being
  water-wise while growing drought-tolerant organic fruits and vegetables - We
  know the problems and we have the solutions.
   
   Imagine walking out of your house or apartment and seeing flourishing vegetables and herbs instead of neglected pieces of land. Imagine walking with your family within a ten-block radius and gathering organic produce for dinner knowing that they’ve witnessed the growth of those vegetables first-hand. This is our vision.
   
   Not only will we provide organic food for those in need and beautify the city, we will also teach our communities how to farm healthy food. We believe there is a lack of appreciation for where your food comes from and being an active part of that process will help one to make informed decisions about their diet. Farm LA presents at Childhood Obesity Awareness events and neighborhood council health fairs sharing interesting nutritional facts, delicious recipes and the tools to grow their own healthy food. We work with the UC Master Gardeners who have to satisfy a certain amount of volunteer hours every year and ask them educate our neighbors and volunteers. We also educate by connecting with schools who require their students volunteer a certain number of hours and have them join our volunteer days. By encouraging our Farm LA mentality at a younger age, we can expect that health-conscious way of thinking to grow and propagate, making LA the healthiest place to live.
   
   In our current drought predicament we are practicing water consciousness in everything we do. Farm LA wants to spearhead solar-powered atmospheric water generation to irrigate its drought-tolerant farms. This is not inexpensive, but due to the sustainability of it versus time and costs for water hook-up hurdles it is the most viable self-sustaining method, rendering us unaffected by a drought.
   
   Farm LA’s passion lies in turning vacant land into viable land. By creating a model of what we see as being the future of Los Angeles, we can continue creating a cultural awareness for a healthy sustainable way of life.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  1- As a new non-profit organization we anticipate some challenges with gaining
  community support in pitching in and helping maintain our farms. Our strategy
  to overcome this is heavy community outreach in multiple languages to activate
  neighbors and get people excited. 
   2- We will have to comply with all local zoning and land-use laws and work through general red tape for having vegetable and or solar farms. Our plan to overcome these challenges is to work with city officials, neighborhood council, legal aid and pro-bono experts. 
   3- Being very new we obviously are concerned about our financial sustainability, our strategy to overcome this common challenge is persistent grant writing, fundraising and using funds only where necessary.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Our current evaluation process consists of measuring square footage converted
  and number of plants planted. Our future statistics and record keeping to
  evaluate our effectiveness will include: monetary donations, pounds of
  produce, visitors to site, new volunteer sign-ups, volunteer hours
  accumulated, weight-loss success stories, kilowatts generated and gallons of
  water produced.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There are definitely other organizations aware of the abundance of
  underutilized land in Los Angeles. LA Open Acres’ amazing database filled with
  helpful tools will play a big part in our research of vacant land. LA Food
  Policy Council is also focused on making healthy food accessible in Los
  Angeles and is also very in the know on how much vacant land there is in LA.
  We want to utilize AB-551 (The Urban Agricultural Incentive Zone Act) with LA
  Food Policy Council and work with property owners in utilizing their land to
  grow fruits and vegetables. Together, we can create accessible affordable
  organic food for those with little access. These organizations will act as a
  facilitator for Farm LA, but Farm LA will physically create the
  transformation. LA Green Grounds is a similar organization with the mission to
  turn vacant space into gardens. Their focus however is more on front lawns and
  Farm LA’s mission is converting vacant unbuildable land into sustainable,
  drought-tolerant edible farms.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': Farm LA is solely applying for the My LA2050 Grants Challenge.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  We feel confident in creating a functioning model farm in one year for
  $100,000. To keep the farm functioning we will create a sustainable financial
  business model in addition to fundraising and applying for grants to keep the
  farm going and growing indefinitely.
   If there are remaining funds from the $100K budget we would allocate them to our Farm LA curbside mini-garden program by the end of 2016.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
  Administration: $20,000 *Costs to ensure project runs on schedule and within
  budget/Collect monthly data/general paperwork
   Construction: $20,000 *Costs for solar install and supervision of all construction related line items
   Rent or Land Purchase + FeesL $7,000 *We will try to have land donated, if not we have a modest budget for land purchase or rent + fees
   Property Tax (AB551):$1,000 *Our goal will be to implement AB-551 Urban Agriculture Incentive Zone Act
   Soil testing:$500 
   Engineering Consultant: $2,000 
   Solar (PV) System: $6,000 
   Security/Fence/Locks: $3,000 
   Slab: $1,200 *Costs to create area production zone and or necessary storage
   Grading/Sodding: $1,500 *Costs for leveling
   City (Land-Use) Paperwork/Permitting: $8,000 
   Insurance: $800
   Annual Fundraiser: $1,500
   Marketing:$2,500
   Atmospheric water generator: $20,000
   Contingency */Additional Curbside: $5,000 *Remaining will go towards creating additional curbside mini-farms in food-desert communities
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Farm LA is the first non-profit organization dedicated to physically rescuing
  unbuildable land in Los Angeles for solar and drought-tolerant agricultural
  farming. Even Detroit (a city with very different zoning laws than LA) only
  just recently started taking over vacant property to supplement organic food
  needs for its city. The closest thing we could be compared to might be the
  Victory Gardens of WWII, which were extremely successful and had massive
  funding by the US government. We are essentially creating the benchmarks for
  this kind of mission in Los Angeles with it’s own set of variables.
   
   For this reason we don’t have the standard 5 year reference for other programs who are doing the same thing to scale for success. But we plan to take a simple and effective collection of our monthly evaluated data (monetary donations, pounds of produce, visitors to site, new volunteer sign-ups, volunteer hours accumulated, weight-loss success stories, kilowatts generated and gallons of water produced) and from there we can identify the key components that make our program work that month and set key goals for our next month. 
   
   We plan to ensure the success of our model farm with outreach to students, after school programs, camps, senior centers, neighborhood councils, public offices and walking tours - if every person we meet looks at a vacant piece of land as an opportunity to grow organic food, we feel we are one step closer to a maturing healthy Los Angeles.
   
   We want our program to be easily replicated at the end of 2016 hopefully with the support of organizations and communities we’ve worked with that year combined with fundraising, grant writing and effective marketing we can replicate this model easily and count on reoccurring funding to ensure Farm LA’s efforts in making this the healthiest place to live by 2050.
   
   Though Farm LA is still young, we have the applicable skills to champion our mission. We have no problem taking on leadership roles or getting our hands dirty. We have a commitment to our dream, the passion to expand and serve new sites in the future.

      DESCRIBE IN GREATER DETAIL HOW YOU WILL MAKE LA THE HEALTHIEST PLACE TO
      LIVE: 
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Farm LA envisions a healthier, more self-sufficient Los Angeles by utilizing our vacant spaces for growing organic produce. We have an over abundance of deserted land in Los Angeles and an under abundance of affordable organic produce. Using the tools we have for harnessing the sun’s energy, being water-wise while growing drought-tolerant organic fruits and vegetables - We know the problems and we have the solutions.\r\n\r\nImagine walking out of your house or apartment and seeing flourishing vegetables and herbs instead of neglected pieces of land. Imagine walking with your family within a ten-block radius and gathering organic produce for dinner knowing that they’ve witnessed the growth of those vegetables first-hand. This is our vision.\r\n\r\nNot only will we provide organic food for those in need and beautify the city, we will also teach our communities how to farm healthy food. We believe there is a lack of appreciation for where your food comes from and being an active part of that process will help one to make informed decisions about their diet. Farm LA presents at Childhood Obesity Awareness events and neighborhood council health fairs sharing interesting nutritional facts, delicious recipes and the tools to grow their own healthy food. We work with the UC Master Gardeners who have to satisfy a certain amount of volunteer hours every year and ask them educate our neighbors and volunteers. We also educate by connecting with schools who require their students volunteer a certain number of hours and have them join our volunteer days. By encouraging our Farm LA mentality at a younger age, we can expect that health-conscious way of thinking to grow and propagate, making LA the healthiest place to live.\r\n\r\nIn our current drought predicament we are practicing water consciousness in everything we do. Farm LA wants to spearhead solar-powered atmospheric water generation to irrigate its drought-tolerant farms. This is not inexpensive, but due to the sustainability of it versus time and costs for water hook-up hurdles it is the most viable self-sustaining method, rendering us unaffected by a drought.\r\n\r\nFarm LA’s passion lies in turning vacant land into viable land. By creating a model of what we see as being the future of Los Angeles, we can continue creating a cultural awareness for a healthy sustainable way of life."

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "1- As a new non-profit organization we anticipate some challenges with gaining community support in pitching in and helping maintain our farms. Our strategy to overcome this is heavy community outreach in multiple languages to activate neighbors and get people excited. \r\n2- We will have to comply with all local zoning and land-use laws and work through general red tape for having vegetable and or solar farms. Our plan to overcome these challenges is to work with city officials, neighborhood council, legal aid and pro-bono experts. \r\n3- Being very new we obviously are concerned about our financial sustainability, our strategy to overcome this common challenge is persistent grant writing, fundraising and using funds only where necessary."

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      There are definitely other organizations aware of the abundance of
      underutilized land in Los Angeles. LA Open Acres’ amazing database filled
      with helpful tools will play a big part in our research of vacant land. LA
      Food Policy Council is also focused on making healthy food accessible in
      Los Angeles and is also very in the know on how much vacant land there is
      in LA. We want to utilize AB-551 (The Urban Agricultural Incentive Zone
      Act) with LA Food Policy Council and work with property owners in
      utilizing their land to grow fruits and vegetables. Together, we can
      create accessible affordable organic food for those with little access.
      These organizations will act as a facilitator for Farm LA, but Farm LA
      will physically create the transformation. LA Green Grounds is a similar
      organization with the mission to turn vacant space into gardens. Their
      focus however is more on front lawns and Farm LA’s mission is converting
      vacant unbuildable land into sustainable, drought-tolerant edible farms.

  - name: How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Farm LA is the first non-profit organization dedicated to physically rescuing unbuildable land in Los Angeles for solar and drought-tolerant agricultural farming. Even Detroit (a city with very different zoning laws than LA) only just recently started taking over vacant property to supplement organic food needs for its city. The closest thing we could be compared to might be the Victory Gardens of WWII, which were extremely successful and had massive funding by the US government. We are essentially creating the benchmarks for this kind of mission in Los Angeles with it’s own set of variables.\r\n\r\nFor this reason we don’t have the standard 5 year reference for other programs who are doing the same thing to scale for success. But we plan to take a simple and effective collection of our monthly evaluated data (monetary donations, pounds of produce, visitors to site, new volunteer sign-ups, volunteer hours accumulated, weight-loss success stories,  kilowatts generated and gallons of water produced) and from there we can identify the key components that make our program work that month and set key goals for our next month. \r\n\r\nWe plan to ensure the success of our model farm with outreach to students, after school programs, camps, senior centers, neighborhood councils, public offices and walking tours - if every person we meet looks at a vacant piece of land as an opportunity to grow organic food, we feel we are one step closer to a maturing healthy Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nWe want our program to be easily replicated at the end of 2016 hopefully with the support of organizations and communities we’ve worked with that year combined with fundraising, grant writing and effective marketing we can replicate this model easily and count on reoccurring funding to ensure Farm LA’s efforts in making this the healthiest place to live by 2050.\r\n\r\nThough Farm LA is still young, we have the applicable skills to champion our mission. We have no problem taking on leadership roles or getting our hands dirty. We have a commitment to our dream, the passion to expand and serve new sites in the future.\r\n"
