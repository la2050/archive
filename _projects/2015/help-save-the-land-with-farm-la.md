  'DESCRIBE IN GREATER DETAIL HOW YOU WILL MAKE LA THE HEALTHIEST PLACE TO LIVE: ': "Farm LA envisions a healthier, more self-sufficient Los Angeles by utilizing our vacant spaces for growing organic produce. We have an over abundance of deserted land in Los Angeles and an under abundance of affordable organic produce. Using the tools we have for harnessing the sun’s energy, being water-wise while growing drought-tolerant organic fruits and vegetables - We know the problems and we have the solutions.\r\n\r\nImagine walking out of your house or apartment and seeing flourishing vegetables and herbs instead of neglected pieces of land. Imagine walking with your family within a ten-block radius and gathering organic produce for dinner knowing that they’ve witnessed the growth of those vegetables first-hand. This is our vision.\r\n\r\nNot only will we provide organic food for those in need and beautify the city, we will also teach our communities how to farm healthy food. We believe there is a lack of appreciation for where your food comes from and being an active part of that process will help one to make informed decisions about their diet. Farm LA presents at Childhood Obesity Awareness events and neighborhood council health fairs sharing interesting nutritional facts, delicious recipes and the tools to grow their own healthy food. We work with the UC Master Gardeners who have to satisfy a certain amount of volunteer hours every year and ask them educate our neighbors and volunteers. We also educate by connecting with schools who require their students volunteer a certain number of hours and have them join our volunteer days. By encouraging our Farm LA mentality at a younger age, we can expect that health-conscious way of thinking to grow and propagate, making LA the healthiest place to live.\r\n\r\nIn our current drought predicament we are practicing water consciousness in everything we do. Farm LA wants to spearhead solar-powered atmospheric water generation to irrigate its drought-tolerant farms. This is not inexpensive, but due to the sustainability of it versus time and costs for water hook-up hurdles it is the most viable self-sustaining method, rendering us unaffected by a drought.\r\n\r\nFarm LA’s passion lies in turning vacant land into viable land. By creating a model of what we see as being the future of Los Angeles, we can continue creating a cultural awareness for a healthy sustainable way of life."

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "1- As a new non-profit organization we anticipate some challenges with gaining community support in pitching in and helping maintain our farms. Our strategy to overcome this is heavy community outreach in multiple languages to activate neighbors and get people excited. \r\n2- We will have to comply with all local zoning and land-use laws and work through general red tape for having vegetable and or solar farms. Our plan to overcome these challenges is to work with city officials, neighborhood council, legal aid and pro-bono experts. \r\n3- Being very new we obviously are concerned about our financial sustainability, our strategy to overcome this common challenge is persistent grant writing, fundraising and using funds only where necessary."
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    Our current evaluation process consists of measuring square footage
    converted and number of plants planted. Our future statistics and record
    keeping to evaluate our effectiveness will include: monetary donations,
    pounds of produce, visitors to site, new volunteer sign-ups, volunteer hours
    accumulated, weight-loss success stories, kilowatts generated and gallons of
    water produced. 
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    There are definitely other organizations aware of the abundance of
    underutilized land in Los Angeles. LA Open Acres’ amazing database filled
    with helpful tools will play a big part in our research of vacant land. LA
    Food Policy Council is also focused on making healthy food accessible in Los
    Angeles and is also very in the know on how much vacant land there is in LA.
    We want to utilize AB-551 (The Urban Agricultural Incentive Zone Act) with
    LA Food Policy Council and work with property owners in utilizing their land
    to grow fruits and vegetables. Together, we can create accessible affordable
    organic food for those with little access. These organizations will act as a
    facilitator for Farm LA, but Farm LA will physically create the
    transformation. LA Green Grounds is a similar organization with the mission
    to turn vacant space into gardens. Their focus however is more on front
    lawns and Farm LA’s mission is converting vacant unbuildable land into
    sustainable, drought-tolerant edible farms.
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': Farm LA is solely applying for the My LA2050 Grants Challenge.
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': "We feel confident in creating a functioning model farm in one year for $100,000. To keep the farm functioning we will create a sustainable financial business model in addition to fundraising and applying for grants to keep the farm going and growing indefinitely.\r\nIf there are remaining funds from the $100K budget we would allocate them to our Farm LA curbside mini-garden program by the end of 2016."
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Administration: $20,000 *Costs to ensure project runs on schedule and within budget/Collect monthly data/general paperwork\r\nConstruction: $20,000 *Costs for solar install and supervision of all construction related line items\r\nRent or Land Purchase + FeesL $7,000 *We will try to have land donated, if not we have a modest budget for land purchase or rent + fees\r\nProperty Tax (AB551):$1,000 *Our goal will be to implement AB-551 Urban Agriculture Incentive Zone Act\r\nSoil testing:$500 \r\nEngineering Consultant: $2,000 \r\nSolar (PV) System: $6,000 \r\nSecurity/Fence/Locks:\t$3,000 \r\nSlab: $1,200 *Costs to create area production zone and or necessary storage\r\nGrading/Sodding: $1,500 *Costs for leveling\r\nCity (Land-Use) Paperwork/Permitting: $8,000 \r\nInsurance: $800\r\nAnnual Fundraiser: $1,500\r\nMarketing:$2,500\r\nAtmospheric water generator: $20,000\r\nContingency */Additional Curbside: $5,000 *Remaining will go towards creating additional curbside mini-farms in food-desert communities\r\n\r\n"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "Farm LA is the first non-profit organization dedicated to physically rescuing unbuildable land in Los Angeles for solar and drought-tolerant agricultural farming. Even Detroit (a city with very different zoning laws than LA) only just recently started taking over vacant property to supplement organic food needs for its city. The closest thing we could be compared to might be the Victory Gardens of WWII, which were extremely successful and had massive funding by the US government. We are essentially creating the benchmarks for this kind of mission in Los Angeles with it’s own set of variables.\r\n\r\nFor this reason we don’t have the standard 5 year reference for other programs who are doing the same thing to scale for success.
