  Facing History will engage its LA Partnership Schools Network in a year-long
  journey to create compassionate school communities and build a stronger, more
  empathetic LA. The network includes 17 diverse public middle and high schools
  that infuse Facing History content across grade levels and disciplines to
  increase students’ ability to relate history to their own lives; heighten
  their understanding of the origins of bigotry and hatred; and engage them in
  creating change in their communities.

  Facing History instruction does not simply nurture students’ academic growth;
  it provides them with complementary skills for thriving in a diverse,
  collaborative 21st century economy. The organization’s approach, which is
  infused throughout Partnership Schools’ culture and curricula, significantly
  increases student engagement, empathy, critical thinking skills, and sense of
  civic responsibility. Facing History students are nearly twice as likely to be
  motivated to learn, more likely to stand up to bullying, and demonstrate
  significantly less racist attitudes than students in non-Facing History
  classrooms.
   
   The 17 Partner School communities come together to examine issues that affect all LA citizens. To kick off the 2015-16 school year, students, teachers, administrators, and parents from diverse neighborhoods across the city attended the annual Partner School Summit on Saturday, October 3. This year’s Partner School Network theme is “The Promise of Los Angeles.” The summit featured the film Tom Bradley’s Impossible Dream. This film tells the powerful story of how Mr. Bradley became the first mayor of a major American city without a black majority. Mr. Bradley built a coalition of African Americans, Jews, Whites, Mexican Americans, and Asian Americans who came together in support of common values. After viewing the film, participants examined its lessons and created action plans to reshape or improve their respective school cultures. These projects empower students to be active participants in building inclusive and effective learning environments and communities. 
   
   Throughout the year, Facing History Partnership Schools encourage their students to act as “upstanders”—people who take action to address problems in their communities, as opposed to bystanders who do nothing. At the conclusion of the school year, the network reconvenes for the Upstander Celebration, which honors students who have taken positive action in their schools and communities.
   
   The support of LA2050 and contest voters will help Facing History add four schools to the network this year. If brought to scale, the Facing History Partner School Network will not only help enhance the quality of education in LA by 2050, but also build a future generation of compassionate, inclusive, and thoughtful leaders.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Based on our work establishing and growing the Partnership Schools Network
  over the past six years, Facing History anticipates continued challenges
  related to school leadership turnover and school consolidation. Leadership
  transitions have made it difficult for some schools to maintain their
  membership in the network, but our partnerships have been able to persevere in
  schools where Facing History has built a strong, broad base of support among
  teachers. In schools with high year-to-year teacher turnover, highly
  experienced Facing History teachers have been able to provide orientation and
  guidance for new teachers who have not yet received professional development
  services from the organization. Facing History will continue to meet these
  challenges by deepening existing relationships with educators, offering them
  ongoing professional development opportunities and individualized support.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Primary liaisons at each of the 17 Partner Schools will complete a survey
  about the faculty’s collective experience with Facing History school climate
  initiatives, classroom implementation activities, and network event
  participation related to the School Summit and Upstander Celebration. This
  feedback will help inform future improvements to all Partner School Network
  activity in future years.
   
   An additional measure of success will be the overall renewal rate of Partnership Schools for the 2016-17 school year. 
   
   More than 140 internal and external studies have demonstrated Facing History’s positive impact on students. Among many findings, these studies show that Facing History students: have increased understanding and willingness to interact with other ethnic groups; marked decreases in racist attitudes; and reduced fighting behavior.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Facing History trains and supports teachers at Partnership Schools to
  integrate the study of history and literature with ethical decision making,
  innovative teaching strategies, and social-emotional learning. In an era of
  high teacher turnover in urban schools, studies have shown that Facing
  History’s professional development increases educators’ engagement,
  satisfaction, and sense of personal accomplishment. Educators who participate
  in professional development sessions receive year-round follow-up support from
  a Facing History staff member. Facing History is unique, individualized
  follow-up support includes curriculum planning consultations, classroom
  visits, model lesson plans, and access to a lending library of resources.
   
   Facing History's content is aligned with the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) in literacy. CCSS implementation tools and resources are integrated into the organization's professional development offerings to providing teachers with support for these instructional shifts. Facing History recently completed a two-year project funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) that expanded the organization’s CCSS-aligned resources and support, and was recently approved for a new, two year grant from BMGF to continue this work. The 2015 guide from the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL) cited Facing History as the only organization with well-designed, evidence-based programs that impact students’ social and emotional development at both the middle and high school levels. 
   
   Outside of the classroom, Facing History works with all Partner School faculty on positive school climate initiatives to enhance students’ leadership competencies and create safe, reflective learning environments. On-site trainings help faculty members develop a school-wide vocabulary that encourages unity and a shared sense of ownership of the school community among all students.
   
   By using an approach that leverages highly effective professional development for educators, Facing History’s Partner School Network is able to improve students’ academic engagement and social-emotional learning, nurture hard-working teachers, and build safe, inclusive learning communities that prepare students for success in work, life, and civil society.

  Seventeen public or charter schools within LAUSD, all classified as Title I
  schools, will be active members of the network during the 2015-16 school year.
  The following LAUSD schools are members of the Facing History Partnership
  Schools Network. They are primarily located in East LA, South LA, downtown,
  and the San Fernando Valley:
   
   - Academy of Medical Arts at Carson High School
   - Animo Jackie Robinson Charter High School 
   - Bert Corona Charter Middle School
   - Esteban E. Torres High School: Engineering and Technology Academy
   - Esteban E. Torres High School: Humanitas Academy of Art and Technology
   - Esteban E. Torres High School: Social Justice Leadership Academy
   - Gertz-Ressler High School
   - Los Angeles School of Global Studies
   - Monsenor Oscar Romero Charter Middle School
   - Richard Merkin Middle School
   - San Fernando Institute of Applied Media
   - School for the Visual Arts and Humanities
   - SEA-New Technology High School
   - Social Justice Humanitas Academy
   - The Alliance Leichtman-Levine Family Foundation Environmental Science High School
   - Valor Academy High School
   - Watts Learning Center Charter Middle School
   
   As previously described, Facing History featured the film Tom Bradley’s Impossible Dream as part of the School Summit event held on October 3rd. This event was held in collaboration with the filmmakers and the family of Mr. Bradley. The film, which has not yet been released to the public, was followed by a panel discussion with filmmaker Alison Sotomayor and Tom Bradley’s daughter, long-time teacher Lorraine Bradley. A copy of the film has been provided to each partner school with many network members planning to screen the film during the school year for their student bodies. Ms. Sotomayor and Ms. Bradley hope to attend many of these screenings and participate in Q&A sessions for students to enhance their understanding of the film’s message. 
   
   Facing History is headquartered in Brookline, MA and has regional offices in Chicago, Cleveland, Denver, New England, New York, and San Francisco in addition to LA with international partner affiliates in Toronto and London. Facing History staff regularly share best practices, resources, and strategies with one another. LA teachers and students are therefore being supported by an entire network of professional development experts that have a breadth of experience far beyond the confines of the city.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  For the 2015-16 school year, Facing History anticipates that the project and
  all related events will cost $250,720. In addition to this LA2050 application,
  the organization will submit renewal grant requests to past project supporters
  to fund the remaining $150,720. Any additional expenses incurred will be
  covered by general operating funds provided by individual donors and event
  sponsorships. 
   
   The value of each unique school partnership is assessed at $10,000-$25,000, depending on the level of services needed. Bringing on a new Partnership Schools, for instance, has higher costs than maintaining a Partner School, including more initial teacher training, class sets of books and educational resources, and more Facing History staff assistance for implementing positive school culture initiatives in their first year of membership. Facing History has four new member schools during the 2015-16 school year. The $100,000 grant from LA2050 would fully fund these four new partner schools, allowing for projected growth to continue into future years.
   
   The Facing History Partnership Schools Network has been supported in the past by many generous individual donors and private foundation grants. The network began as a pilot program funded by the Johnny Carson Foundation in 2009 with five charter members. Since that initial investment, the Johnny Carson Foundation has provided additional support to fund the network’s growth. Additional funding for the network has been generously provided by the Rose Hills Foundation, the Harold McAlister Charitable Foundation, and the Weingart Foundation.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  Salaries and Benefits - $144,140
   Stipends and Substitute Teacher Fees for educators - $12,300*
   Event Speaker Fees - $2,130
   Supplies for Workshops, Seminars, and Events - $1,045
   Food for Workshops, Seminars, and Events - $8,990
   Staff Travel - $2,485
   Event Venue Fees - $5,515
   Postage - $1,480
   FH Resources Books - $9,850
   Scholarships for approximately 42 partner school teachers to attend professional development - $21,000
   Indirect Costs - $41,785**
   
   Total Project Costs - $250, 720
   
   *Stipends and substitute fees are for educators who take on leadership roles in carrying out Facing History activities at their schools, which requires additional training sessions and meetings. Partner School teachers are also invited to a symposium on urban education, held annually in the Spring, which requires substitute time as well.
   
   ** Indirect costs are essential services including information technology, human resources, and finance.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  The Partnership Schools Network has grown from five schools in 2009 to 17
  LAUSD public and charter schools with a combined enrollment of more than
  10,000 students. The organization’s goal is to expand this network to 25
  partner schools by the end of the 2016-17 school year, with growth continuing
  beyond that level in future years.
   
   A major challenge for Facing History in growing the network is securing the monetary and staffing resources needed to meet the current demand of LAUSD schools that want to join the network. As previously described, new network schools require approximately $25,000 worth of professional development support and resources. The LA2050 grant would fully fund the activation of four new partnership schools in 2015-16. 
   
   Facing History also plans to increase the visibility of the Partnership Schools Network in order to scale up, creating additional demand from non-member schools and inspiring upstanding behavior in students and adults throughout the city. The culminating event for the Partnership Schools Network each year is an Upstander Celebration in which network schools nominate students who have gone above and beyond in service of others. Two examples from last year’s celebration event exemplify the powerful example that Facing History’s Partnership Schools can provide for the LA community. Students at Watts Learning Center Charter Middle School undertook a comprehensive project that cleaned up a once blighted neighborhood street. Graduating seniors at the Academy of Medical Arts, Carson High School transformed an unused part of their school grounds into an outdoor classroom for students and community members to study plants and learn how to use container gardens to grow food. 
   
   Facing History will publicize these stories through social media channels, blog posts, and newsletters in addition to seeking broadcast and print media coverage. These stories inspire others throughout LA and raise awareness of the network’s positive impact on LAUSD.
   
   The steady success of this project has already created ripples outside of LA. The Partner School Network model is now being replicated in other regions of the country. Chicago, Cleveland, and Memphis are now either operating or about to launch school networks that will leverage best practices from the LA network’s six years of operation.
