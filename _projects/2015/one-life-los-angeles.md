'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  During the course of one year, we will produce 8 workshops sessions in all the
  corners of LA County. Each session will focus on the local community and it's
  future, it will be the vision of our youth.
   The One Los Angeles project, will be feature on a unique website, showcasing all the PSA’s inviting the community to comment, and post their own views.
   Social media, from Facebook, Instagram and more will be created to keep an on-going flow of communication within the community.
   We will also have a special screening evening where we will screen all the PSA’s.....it will become a special One Life Los Angeles event
   
   The One Life Los Angeles project will teach students to create effective messages for visual media, focusing on building the skills to author narrative elements and produce high quality images. Students will be challenged to construct innovative messages that communicate their own perspective on the issue of living in Los Angeles and contribute their own ideas on ways to best utilize social media for mass communication to promote it.
   We will have a total of 8 workshops in 8 corners of Los Angeles County. Each workshop has up to 20 students, divided into 5 groups of 4. These groups will each produce a 30 – 60 second Public Service Announcement (PSA) designed specifically for distribution online and eventually on local television. A total of 40 PSA’s will be developed by the conclusion of the workshops. 
   This innovative program is designed to empower youth to express and communicate the prevalence of living in their city and community while teaching them the skills using visual media/arts and increase their employability by providing job skills training. 
   
   The program objectives include:
   • Teach students skills in narrative authorship, visual media, and film production. 
   • Teach students about the social issues and community life.
   • Engage students by capturing their interest in visual media and utilizing their knowledge of social media channels. 
   • Inspire students to become community stewards and effective communicators on important issues. 
   • Demonstrate an example of utilizing social media in non-leisure pursuits 
   • Raise audience awareness about the issue by providing content for both television and online distribution. 
   • Raise awareness and involvement on the issue within the local community.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Since more than 5 years now the Center has produce more than 10 workshops, up
  to 60 PSA’s, each time with the participation of High Schools, Cities, Museums
  and other community’s organization.
   There aren’t that many barriers to implement this unique curriculum workshop.
   The major barrier/Challenge is always to find the High-School that can dedicate some time to gather the 20/25 students to participate.
   It’s a matter of us visiting and connecting with high-schools.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  The total number of youth to be served is 8x20= 160. The following outcomes
  will be documented: 
   
   1. Academic/Vocational:
   Students are inspired to continue their education, learn about various job opportunities in the film industry and understand the requirements for entering film school. Pre/post-tests will be given to document increase knowledge of: filmmaking, job opportunities in the industry, education/vocation programs to prepare for careers in film industry, requirements for entering and completing the education/vocation programs
   
   2. Raise awareness on Community life:
   •Moving images created will travel and reach out to thousands of other young student as well as adults in the community.
   •Heighten community awareness on living in their cities.
   •Youth are empowered to change the statistics by becoming community activists.
   • 40 PSA’s will be screened publicly with invited local officials, university partners, school teachers, administrators, parents and communitY.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There are many organizations that work with High School student in
  complementing education. 
   There are many organizations that teach the basic of filmmaking.
   
   Yet, there are not so many organizations that use the skills of filmmaking to strengthen student interpersonal skills and community responsibility, this is our unique approach
   
   We have now produced workshops on Voting matters (with Hollywood High), Water conservation (with John Marshall High), Teen life with Museums and more....see on vimeo.
