Each workshop has up to 20 students, divided into 5 groups of 4. These groups will each produce a 30 – 60 second Public Service Announcement (PSA) designed specifically for distribution online and eventually on local television. A total of 40 PSA’s will be developed by the conclusion of the workshops. \r\nThis innovative program is designed to empower youth to express and communicate the prevalence of living in their city and community while teaching them the skills using visual media/arts and increase their employability by providing job skills training.  \r\n\r\nThe program objectives include:\r\n• Teach students skills in narrative authorship, visual media, and film production. \r\n• Teach students about the social issues and community life.\r\n• Engage students by capturing their interest in visual media and utilizing their knowledge of social media channels. \r\n• Inspire students to become community stewards and effective communicators on important issues. \r\n• Demonstrate an example of utilizing social media in non-leisure pursuits \r\n• Raise audience awareness about the issue by providing content for both television and online distribution. \r\n• Raise awareness and involvement on the issue within the local community. \r\n"
