  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "Mission: The Los Angeles Youth Poet Laureate & Ambassadors program aims to identify youth writers and leaders who are committed to civic and community engagement, poetry and performance, and diversity and human dignity across Los Angeles. \r\n\r\nLaunched in 2014, with only in-kind support from our various partners, the Los Angeles Youth Poet Laureate program brought forth and celebrated the top teen poets in Los Angeles, and provided various platforms for their voice and leadership. Program materials were promoted across the LA Unified School District, and students were encouraged to submit five poems and a CV. These materials were created to not only identify the best poets and writers, but also young leaders. A group of esteemed judges, including CA Poet Laureate, and numerous other writers from across Los Angeles, selected 12 finalists, as well as the first ever LA Youth Poet Laureate. Along with receiving a proclamation from the City of Los Angeles at a live poetry event held at the Downtown Public Library (where all the finalists performed), the winner received a book deal from Penmanship Books. \r\nThis year we hope to expand the program by offering curricula resources that promote the values of our program through poetry. To this end your support will help us expand the program and work of the Youth Poet Ambassasdors to:\r\n\r\n\tHold (4) Town Hall Meetings during the year, open to the public, that engage issues of voter participation, job opportunities, and college access.\r\n\tEngage Ambassadors for (4-6) voter drives during the year, and 4 additional volunteer engagements.\r\n\tPlan and produce (4) Word/Works trips where young writers access professional spaces where writers are valued, like PR/marketing firms, recording studios, and city government.\r\n\tProvide free creative writing workshops and curricula that promotes civic engagement, youth leadership and voter participation.\r\n\tCreate a series of [4] events leading up to the final event where the LA Youth Poet Laureate will be chosen and a Proclamation issued.\r\n\tCreate a public library tour for the youth poets involved.\r\nIn summary, this program aims to expand the role of poetry for young people to include writing that inspires a sense of civic and community participation, as well as speak to the issues that affect them most.
