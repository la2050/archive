  The Youth Poet Ambassadors program honors 15 teens each year, and names the LA
  Youth Poet Laureate. These youth are not only selected by the strength of
  their creative voices, but most importantly because of their histories of
  volunteerism and civic/community engagement. Each year, we activate around (3)
  issues, and this year we've identified: 1) voter awareness/participation, 2)
  access to creative industries & workforce development, and 3) college access,
  as our Ambassador Initiatives.

  Mission: The Los Angeles Youth Poet Laureate & Ambassadors program aims to
  identify youth writers and leaders who are committed to civic and community
  engagement, poetry and performance, and diversity and human dignity across Los
  Angeles. 
   
   Launched in 2014, with only in-kind support from our various partners, the Los Angeles Youth Poet Laureate program brought forth and celebrated the top teen poets in Los Angeles, and provided various platforms for their voice and leadership. Program materials were promoted across the LA Unified School District, and students were encouraged to submit five poems and a CV. These materials were created to not only identify the best poets and writers, but also young leaders. A group of esteemed judges, including CA Poet Laureate, and numerous other writers from across Los Angeles, selected 12 finalists, as well as the first ever LA Youth Poet Laureate. Along with receiving a proclamation from the City of Los Angeles at a live poetry event held at the Downtown Public Library (where all the finalists performed), the winner received a book deal from Penmanship Books. 
   This year we hope to expand the program by offering curricula resources that promote the values of our program through poetry. To this end your support will help us expand the program and work of the Youth Poet Ambassasdors to:
   
   § Hold (4) Town Hall Meetings during the year, open to the public, that engage issues of voter participation, job opportunities, and college access.
   § Engage Ambassadors for (4-6) voter drives during the year, and 4 additional volunteer engagements.
   § Plan and produce (4) Word/Works trips where young writers access professional spaces where writers are valued, like PR/marketing firms, recording studios, and city government.
   § Provide free creative writing workshops and curricula that promotes civic engagement, youth leadership and voter participation.
   § Create a series of [4] events leading up to the final event where the LA Youth Poet Laureate will be chosen and a Proclamation issued.
   § Create a public library tour for the youth poets involved.
   In summary, this program aims to expand the role of poetry for young people to include writing that inspires a sense of civic and community participation, as well as speak to the issues that affect them most.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  With some of the lowest voter rates in the country, we anticipate that it will
  take time to shift the culture around voting. 
   
   The multi-faceted ways that we will address these issues, with young poets driving the conversation, adds an immediacy and relevance that is not founded in the voter/volunteerism framework.
   
   This program in NYC was responsible, in 5 years, for helping to raise the voting rate for young people by 18%.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Because this program is based in presenting/producing events and Town Halls
  aimed at shifting the culture, as well as Word/Works trips, workshops and
  college access activities - we evaluate our work by not only reaching our
  benchmarks, but also by serving as many youth as possible with these
  opportunities.
   
   Also, as we shift the culture and bring attention to these issues, we are allowed great access to spaces of power and governance. Evaluating our success enlists a multi-faceted approach to document all of this work.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Because this work centers the creative voices of our youth around real and
  tangible issues, there are not many competitive organizations doing this work.
  We have aligned ourselves with all of the literary arts orgs across LA County
  in order to identify top writers, as well as share these opportunities to as
  many students as possible.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  We have a number of literary arts organizations that will be enlisted in this
  work as we receive support, that include Beyond Baroque, Say Word, Write Girl,
  and Get Lit. These organizations all have thriving youth communities and also
  are key partners as we choose the Youth Poet Ambassadors and LA Youth Poet
  Laureate. Each organization will receive up to $10,000 for their participation
  and partnership.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  This project will cost approx. $120,000. Additional costs of the program will
  be covered by donor support and earned income from LAUSD residencies that we
  offer.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  Program Director - $24,000
   Personnel (Teaching Artists/Staff) - $40,000
   (4) Town Halls (@ $5,000 each - venue/production) - $20,000
   Word/Works Trips (@ $2,500/trip) - $10,000
   (4) Ambassador/Laureate performances - $10,000
   Voter Drives (@ $1,000 each) - $6,000
   Library Tour - $10,000
   Admin - $10,000
   
   TOTAL = $120,000
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  This program's success is measured in how broadly we can extend these
  opportunities and events. We aim to spread this work through the creative and
  activists spaces across LA, but ultimately as we grow this model, we have a
  vision and plan to engage the LA Unified School District to enter this work
  into school and after-school settings.
