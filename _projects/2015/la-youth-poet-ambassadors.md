  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate.

  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Because this program is based in presenting/producing events and Town Halls aimed at shifting the culture, as well as Word/Works trips, workshops and college access activities - we evaluate our work by not only reaching our benchmarks, but also by serving as many youth as possible with these opportunities.\r\n\r\nAlso, as we shift the culture and bring attention to these issues, we are allowed great access to spaces of power and governance. Evaluating our success enlists a multi-faceted approach to document all of this work."
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    Because this work centers the creative voices of our youth around real and
    tangible issues, there are not many competitive organizations doing this
    work. We have aligned ourselves with all of the literary arts orgs across LA
    County in order to identify top writers, as well as share these
    opportunities to as many students as possible.
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    We have a number of literary arts organizations that will be enlisted in
    this work as we receive support, that include Beyond Baroque, Say Word,
    Write Girl, and Get Lit. These organizations all have thriving youth
    communities and also are key partners as we choose the Youth Poet
    Ambassadors and LA Youth Poet Laureate. Each organization will receive up to
    $10,000 for their participation and partnership.
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    This project will cost approx. $120,000. Additional costs of the program
    will be covered by donor support and earned income from LAUSD residencies
    that we offer.
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Program Director - $24,000\r\nPersonnel (Teaching Artists/Staff) - $40,000\r\n(4) Town Halls (@ $5,000 each - venue/production) - $20,000\r\nWord/Works Trips (@ $2,500/trip) - $10,000\r\n(4) Ambassador/Laureate performances - $10,000\r\nVoter Drives (@ $1,000 each) - $6,000\r\nLibrary Tour - $10,000\r\nAdmin - $10,000\r\n\r\nTOTAL = $120,000 \r\n"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    This program's success is measured in how broadly we can extend these
    opportunities and events. We aim to spread this work through the creative
    and activists spaces across LA, but ultimately as we grow this model, we
    have a vision and plan to engage the LA Unified School District to enter
    this work into school and after-school settings.

  Mission: The Los Angeles Youth Poet Laureate & Ambassadors program aims to
  identify youth writers and leaders who are committed to civic and community
  engagement, poetry and performance, and diversity and human dignity across Los

   This year we hope to expand the program by offering curricula resources that promote the values of our program through poetry. To this end your support will help us expand the program and work of the Youth Poet Ambassasdors to:
   
   § Hold (4) Town Hall Meetings during the year, open to the public, that engage issues of voter participation, job opportunities, and college access.
   § Engage Ambassadors for (4-6) voter drives during the year, and 4 additional volunteer engagements.
   § Plan and produce (4) Word/Works trips where young writers access professional spaces where writers are valued, like PR/marketing firms, recording studios, and city government.
   § Provide free creative writing workshops and curricula that promotes civic engagement, youth leadership and voter participation.
   § Create a series of [4] events leading up to the final event where the LA Youth Poet Laureate will be chosen and a Proclamation issued.
   § Create a public library tour for the youth poets involved.
   In summary, this program aims to expand the role of poetry for young people to include writing that inspires a sense of civic and community participation, as well as speak to the issues that affect them most.
