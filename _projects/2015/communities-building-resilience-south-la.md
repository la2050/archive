title: 'Communities Building Resilience: South LA'
project_summary: >-
  Low-income communities are most vulnerable to the threats of disaster. SCOPE
  has partnered with USGBC-LA and USGBC National on a long-term vision to
  promote resilience in South Los Angeles. The USGBC-LA is developing a Building
  Resilience Certification System to incentivize solutions for buildings and
  communities. Our project will create both a real world example of community
  resilience building, as well as tools to replicate the process in other
  communities.
