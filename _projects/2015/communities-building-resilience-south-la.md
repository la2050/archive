  'DESCRIBE IN GREATER DETAIL HOW YOU WILL MAKE LA THE HEALTHIEST PLACE TO LIVE: ': "Between climate change, urbanization and globalization, disasters are increasing. According to the City of Los Angeles Emergency Management Department, LA is prone to 13 of the 16 possible types of natural and human-caused disasters. The US Geological Survey estimates the probability of an earthquake greater than 6.7 hitting California in the next 30 years is 99%. Our growing population depends on an aging infrastructure for water, energy, food and other basic needs.\r\n\r\nResilience is the capacity of individuals, organizations and communities to survive and thrive in the face of stressors and shocks. The shocks are the big disruptive events that make headlines. But it is the stressors that determine our ability to respond and recover. Nowhere are stressors more pronounced than in communities like South LA, where chronic disinvestment and lack of opportunity have left people with few reserve resources to fall back on. A resilient community is more than prepared—it is strong, connected and healthy. It creates good jobs and opportunities. It increases access to transit, food, and other critical services. Its networks of mutual support complements government initiatives, fostering social cohesion at the neighborhood level. \r\n\r\nSCOPE and USGBC-LA have partnered to create both a real world example of community resilience building, as well as tools to replicate the process in other communities. We will focus on the SCOPE facility and neighborhood as an epicenter of a green and resilient community. Drawing on SCOPE’s deep community connection and active engagement processes, we will generate a long-term community vision, and identify and implement physical improvements of the SCOPE facility and the surrounding neighborhood. Examples include installing green infrastructure to reduce heat island, infiltrate stormwater and bring greatly needed trees and gardens to the area; a solar system that can both generate clean energy and support an emergency cooling station; or seismic retrofits to make the building a safe space following a disaster. All implementation will support local job training opportunities. \r\n\r\nLessons learned from this process will inform development of the Building Resilience-LA program. This USGBC-LA led effort to create a voluntary certification system for resilience will improve the built environment and support social capital across our region, so that all Angelenos can survive and thrive in the face of whatever comes our way. \r\n"
  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    A major challenge will be engaging residents around an issue that is
    inherently complex. Resilience ranges across scales, disciplines and
    stakeholders, and means different things to different people. Emergency
    planning is not a sexy topic, and part of the reason we are not prepared is
    that people try not to think about, much less plan for, worst-case
    scenarios. Our strategy for overcoming these obstacles is through tying
    resilience efforts to opportunities around community-building and job
    creation. By helping to articulate the many benefits of a project (i.e.
    solar rooftops, community gardens, green space, emergency cooling centers,
    storm water systems, etc.), a resilience certification system can shift the
    conversation from what we don’t want (disaster) to what we do want (safety,
    health, connection, resilience), and help people respond from a place of
    hope, creativity and vision.
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "These criteria will help us evaluate our work:\r\n•\tThe number of community members who actively engage in the resilience process\r\n•\tIncorporation of job training into implementation of all projects\r\n•\tEnvironmental metrics appropriate to targeted measures (e.g. water or energy saved)\r\n•\tSurvey of participants to assess levels of awareness, preparedness and sense of connection as a result of the project\r\n•\tEvaluations and feedback from USGBC-LA advisors and SCOPE\r\n\r\nOur project will be also be measured by the successful completion of:\r\n•\tA long-range community-driven resilience vision supported by a detailed implementation plan and milestones\r\n•\tIdentification, design and implementation of physical improvements in the SCOPE facility and surrounding community\r\n•\tA written case study that documents and develops a replicable and scalable process for involving communities in climate resilience efforts\r\n"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "Our project is unique in that we are actively combining the fields of green building, community organizing, emergency preparedness and public health to build a step-by-step process for stakeholders to meet multiple goals as simply and effectively as possible. A number of organizations are working to improve sustainability in low-income communities, but few of these directly combine green strategies with emergency preparedness or take a holistic and integrative approach to building resilience. Similarly, there are programs that focus on resilience, but none fully combine improving the built environment with developing social cohesion and social capital. The majority of resilience-related programs focus at the local government scale and not the individual building and community level. \r\n\r\nOur goal is to leverage the work currently being done in this area by other organizations, rather than reinventing the wheel where there is overlap. Several groups in South LA lead complementary efforts: From Lot to Spot greens vacant lots and creates community gardens; LA Neighborhood Land Trust works with community to develop urban parks and gardens in underserved neighborhoods; TRUST SLA builds community leadership in housing, transportation and recreation; and Trust for Public Land and LA Conservation Corps also have green projects in South LA. Our project complements these efforts through tying resilience in the built environment to social equity and cohesion. \r\n\r\nTo ensure that our program aligns with municipal efforts, we are referencing the National Institute for Standards and Technology’s Community Resilience Planning guide, which was developed as a tool for local government. We are working closely with the LEED systems, Living Building Challenge, Envision, STAR Communities, Perkins and Will’s ReLi system, the SEED Network, SITES, the Los Angeles County Community Disaster Resilience Project, and many others as we evaluate technical strategies. For seismic resilience, we are referencing the Urban Resilience Council’s program and Arup’s REDI system. \r\n\r\nWe have received a letter of support from Mayor Garcetti, who believes that our work is consistent with his goals for the City. We are aligning specifically with the City of LA’s Sustainability pLAn and the Resilience by Design Plan, as well as with efforts of Rockefeller’s 100 Resilient Cities program via LA’s Chief Resilience Officer, who serves on our Steering Committee. \r\n"
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "This project requires non-traditional cross-sector partnerships, and involves a wider network of over 25 partners from city, engineering, academic, non-profit, community and private sectors to ensure a diverse and collaborative process. The project will be managed and implemented by SCOPE and the USGBC-LA, with support from many other stakeholders and organizations. SCOPE’s members and neighbors are our most important partners. SCOPE has a reach of 50,000 community supporters, and more than 600 members who are predominantly low-income African-American and Latino South LA residents that are actively involved in shaping programs and policies that create positive change and improve the quality of life in the community.\r\n\r\nActive Steering Committee members and Advisors of USGBC-LA’s Building Resilience program are providing pro-bono thought leadership and design support to the Building Resilience program. In addition, several have offered in-kind contribution to the SCOPE project, including technical support and professional services. Steering Committee and Advisor organizations include: \r\n\r\n•\tArup\r\n•\tCity of LA\r\n•\tClimate Resolve\r\n•\tEstolano LeSar Perez Advisors\r\n•\tGensler\r\n•\tICF\r\n•\tKilroy Realty Corp.\r\n•\tLoyola Marymount Center for Urban Resilience\r\n•\tLos Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority\r\n•\tLos Angeles Department of Water and Power\r\n•\tLos Angeles Neighborhood Land Trust\r\n•\tLos Angeles Regional Collaborative for Climate Change\r\n•\tNatural Resources Defense Council\r\n•\tParsons\r\n•\tPerkins & Will\r\n•\tSony Pictures\r\n•\tSouthern California Edison\r\n•\tTRC Solutions\r\n•\tTrust for Public Land\r\n•\tTrust South LA\r\n•\tUCLA Facilities\r\n•\tUCLA Center for Public Health and Disasters\r\n•\tUSC Center for Sustainable Cities\r\n•\tUS Green Building Council\r\n•\tUS Geological Survey\r\n\r\n\r\nThe LA Department of Water and Power has offered to provide an energy audit and to work with the project team to identify building-scale energy and water improvements, including access to incentives. The LA Department of Public Works will conduct a site walk with the project team to identify opportunities for community-scale improvements that they can provide. \r\n\r\nUrban Revitalization exptert Majora Carter is providing facilitation support to the project as part of USGBC National’s Building Sustainable Communities Together campaign. USGBC National will reach out to its tens of thousands of member organizations to identify donors of materials and technologies. (Note that USGBC National and USGBC-LA are separate and indepen"
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': "The proposed project, which is the initial phase of a much larger vision for climate resilience in South LA, will cost $250K. The additional costs will be covered in-kind by local Building Resilience- LA partners (referenced above), as well as through grant and corporate-based fundraising. Several local foundations have expressed interest in the project and are strongly considering supporting it, especially if we can secure other sources of funding. The USGBC-LA and USGBC National will reach out to their vast network of member organizations to secure pro-bono professional services, such as architecture and engineering, as well as donation of materials directly from manufacturers hoping to highlight their products to the broader green building community and beyond. The Building Resilience-LA project has already logged more than 600 volunteer hours from senior level subject matter experts, and our coalition is growing rapidly. \r\n\r\nThe USGBC will host its annual Greenbuild Conference and Expo in Los Angeles in October, 2016, an event which is expected to draw close to 30,000 practitioners from around the world. We plan to include the SCOPE building and neighborhood on a tour of significant projects in the region, which will make the project highly visible. As a result, we have already been approached by a number of organizations hoping to be involved with this project to demonstrate their products or services. We will leverage our visibility to raise the resources to implement the subsequent phases over the next several years. \r\n"

  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "The future is uncertain, but disasters are inevitable. Many of the solutions to one problem can also be solutions to other problems, but achieving those multiple benefits requires a thoughtful and organized process, involving various stakeholders from decision-makers to architects and engineers to community members. A critical component of this project will be to create a template that can be used by other organizations and communities to initiate similar resilience efforts. This template will be incorporated into the Building Resilience LA program. \r\n\r\nThe Building Resilience LA’s certification system will help stakeholders implement resilience strategies for existing buildings, their owners, tenants, and contractors, and their surrounding communities. We have learned from experience that well-designed rating systems can change the world—the USGBC’s LEED systems have transformed the building industry, moving green building from the fringe to the mainstream. Building on these approaches, the USGBC-LA’s toolkit will take projects beyond green to become truly resilient. The Building Resilience system will help projects, and communities, to prepare, adapt, recover and thrive in the face of disruptive change. \r\n\r\nBy October 2016, when USGBC’s Greenbuild Conference comes to LA, we will have developed a detailed framework that includes both a step-by-step process and library of technical strategies that will work for the LA region and serve as a template for other regions. With additional funding, we will take this program to market by developing a subscription service that helps project teams implement resilience planning efforts, manage their information and progress, access a network of peers and receive technical support, and ultimately receive third party certification. Drawing on SCOPE’s expertise in community engagement, grassroots organizing, and leadership development, our project will serve as a case study for building community resilience to inform Building Resilience LA. Designed with scalability at the forefront, our project has the potential to influence real estate, insurance, community development, property management, public policy and a number of other fields in other regions. \r\n"

    answer: "Between climate change, urbanization and globalization, disasters are increasing. According to the City of Los Angeles Emergency Management Department, LA is prone to 13 of the 16 possible types of natural and human-caused disasters. The US Geological Survey estimates the probability of an earthquake greater than 6.7 hitting California in the next 30 years is 99%. Our growing population depends on an aging infrastructure for water, energy, food and other basic needs.\r\n\r\nResilience is the capacity of individuals, organizations and communities to survive and thrive in the face of stressors and shocks. The shocks are the big disruptive events that make headlines. But it is the stressors that determine our ability to respond and recover. Nowhere are stressors more pronounced than in communities like South LA, where chronic disinvestment and lack of opportunity have left people with few reserve resources to fall back on. A resilient community is more than prepared—it is strong, connected and healthy. It creates good jobs and opportunities. It increases access to transit, food, and other critical services. Its networks of mutual support complements government initiatives, fostering social cohesion at the neighborhood level. \r\n\r\nSCOPE and USGBC-LA have partnered to create both a real world example of community resilience building, as well as tools to replicate the process in other communities. We will focus on the SCOPE facility and neighborhood as an epicenter of a green and resilient community. Drawing on SCOPE’s deep community connection and active engagement processes, we will generate a long-term community vision, and identify and implement physical improvements of the SCOPE facility and the surrounding neighborhood. Examples include installing green infrastructure to reduce heat island, infiltrate stormwater and bring greatly needed trees and gardens to the area; a solar system that can both generate clean energy and support an emergency cooling station; or seismic retrofits to make the building a safe space following a disaster. All implementation will support local job training opportunities. \r\n\r\nLessons learned from this process will inform development of the Building Resilience-LA program. This USGBC-LA led effort to create a voluntary certification system for resilience will improve the built environment and support social capital across our region, so that all Angelenos can survive and thrive in the face of whatever comes our way. \r\n"

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      A major challenge will be engaging residents around an issue that is
      inherently complex. Resilience ranges across scales, disciplines and
      stakeholders, and means different things to different people. Emergency
      planning is not a sexy topic, and part of the reason we are not prepared
      is that people try not to think about, much less plan for, worst-case
      scenarios. Our strategy for overcoming these obstacles is through tying
      resilience efforts to opportunities around community-building and job
      creation. By helping to articulate the many benefits of a project (i.e.
      solar rooftops, community gardens, green space, emergency cooling centers,
      storm water systems, etc.), a resilience certification system can shift
      the conversation from what we don’t want (disaster) to what we do want
      (safety, health, connection, resilience), and help people respond from a
      place of hope, creativity and vision.

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Our project is unique in that we are actively combining the fields of green building, community organizing, emergency preparedness and public health to build a step-by-step process for stakeholders to meet multiple goals as simply and effectively as possible. A number of organizations are working to improve sustainability in low-income communities, but few of these directly combine green strategies with emergency preparedness or take a holistic and integrative approach to building resilience. Similarly, there are programs that focus on resilience, but none fully combine improving the built environment with developing social cohesion and social capital. The majority of resilience-related programs focus at the local government scale and not the individual building and community level. \r\n\r\nOur goal is to leverage the work currently being done in this area by other organizations, rather than reinventing the wheel where there is overlap. Several groups in South LA lead complementary efforts: From Lot to Spot greens vacant lots and creates community gardens; LA Neighborhood Land Trust works with community to develop urban parks and gardens in underserved neighborhoods; TRUST SLA builds community leadership in housing, transportation and recreation; and Trust for Public Land and LA Conservation Corps also have green projects in South LA. Our project complements these efforts through tying resilience in the built environment to social equity and cohesion. \r\n\r\nTo ensure that our program aligns with municipal efforts, we are referencing the National Institute for Standards and Technology’s Community Resilience Planning guide, which was developed as a tool for local government. We are working closely with the LEED systems, Living Building Challenge, Envision, STAR Communities, Perkins and Will’s ReLi system, the SEED Network, SITES, the Los Angeles County Community Disaster Resilience Project, and many others as we evaluate technical strategies. For seismic resilience, we are referencing the Urban Resilience Council’s program and Arup’s REDI system. \r\n\r\nWe have received a letter of support from Mayor Garcetti, who believes that our work is consistent with his goals for the City. We are aligning specifically with the City of LA’s Sustainability pLAn and the Resilience by Design Plan, as well as with efforts of Rockefeller’s 100 Resilient Cities program via LA’s Chief Resilience Officer, who serves on our Steering Committee. \r\n"

      How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you
      cover the additional costs?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "The proposed project, which is the initial phase of a much larger vision for climate resilience in South LA, will cost $250K. The additional costs will be covered in-kind by local Building Resilience- LA partners (referenced above), as well as through grant and corporate-based fundraising. Several local foundations have expressed interest in the project and are strongly considering supporting it, especially if we can secure other sources of funding. The USGBC-LA and USGBC National will reach out to their vast network of member organizations to secure pro-bono professional services, such as architecture and engineering, as well as donation of materials directly from manufacturers hoping to highlight their products to the broader green building community and beyond. The Building Resilience-LA project has already logged more than 600 volunteer hours from senior level subject matter experts, and our coalition is growing rapidly. \r\n\r\nThe USGBC will host its annual Greenbuild Conference and Expo in Los Angeles in October, 2016, an event which is expected to draw close to 30,000 practitioners from around the world. We plan to include the SCOPE building and neighborhood on a tour of significant projects in the region, which will make the project highly visible. As a result, we have already been approached by a number of organizations hoping to be involved with this project to demonstrate their products or services. We will leverage our visibility to raise the resources to implement the subsequent phases over the next several years. \r\n"

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "The future is uncertain, but disasters are inevitable. Many of the solutions to one problem can also be solutions to other problems, but achieving those multiple benefits requires a thoughtful and organized process, involving various stakeholders from decision-makers to architects and engineers to community members. A critical component of this project will be to create a template that can be used by other organizations and communities to initiate similar resilience efforts. This template will be incorporated into the Building Resilience LA program. \r\n\r\nThe Building Resilience LA’s certification system will help stakeholders implement resilience strategies for existing buildings, their owners, tenants, and contractors, and their surrounding communities. We have learned from experience that well-designed rating systems can change the world—the USGBC’s LEED systems have transformed the building industry, moving green building from the fringe to the mainstream. Building on these approaches, the USGBC-LA’s toolkit will take projects beyond green to become truly resilient. The Building Resilience system will help projects, and communities, to prepare, adapt, recover and thrive in the face of disruptive change. \r\n\r\nBy October 2016, when USGBC’s Greenbuild Conference comes to LA, we will have developed a detailed framework that includes both a step-by-step process and library of technical strategies that will work for the LA region and serve as a template for other regions. With additional funding, we will take this program to market by developing a subscription service that helps project teams implement resilience planning efforts, manage their information and progress, access a network of peers and receive technical support, and ultimately receive third party certification. Drawing on SCOPE’s expertise in community engagement, grassroots organizing, and leadership development, our project will serve as a case study for building community resilience to inform Building Resilience LA. Designed with scalability at the forefront, our project has the potential to influence real estate, insurance, community development, property management, public policy and a number of other fields in other regions. \r\n"
