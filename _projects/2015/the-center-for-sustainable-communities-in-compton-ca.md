  'DESCRIBE IN GREATER DETAIL HOW YOU WILL MAKE LA THE HEALTHIEST PLACE TO LIVE: ': "NHS' Center for Sustainable Communities will serve hundreds of low income families annually in a region that has endured many of the worst impacts of the economic downturn and decades of blight. Of primary concern is how to deal with the growing challenges among these neighborhoods regarding chronic unemployment and underemployment, reduced capital access for small business development, the ongoing threat of food insecurity, substandard transit options, skyrocketing housing costs, educational disparities, and youth disengagement. \r\n\r\nIn response, the Center for Sustainable Communities will provide the people of Compton and South Los Angeles County a facility that will serve as a hub to build a solid foundation for creating neighborhood sustainability over the next decades. Specific impacts include 1) Improving the job readiness and overall skills base of local workforce; 2) Providing healthy living resources and medical clinic services to residents; 3) Reaching and training residents through the CSC Neighborhood Revitalization Institute; 4) Increasing access to business incubator services and originating loans for small business owners; 5) Engaging  youth (ages 5-24) in on-site green education and mentoring programs; 6) Assisting families through our Financial Opportunity Center; 7) Establishing community garden projects on the property and in surrounding neighborhoods; 8) Providing valuable community meeting space. In addition to meeting crucial resource access needs for families, the Center will allow its partners to share sustainability concepts that drive planning approaches in other impacted communities throughout South Los Angeles and LA County.\r\n\r\nAs the facility grows, the Center will expand to help hundreds of small business owners, neighborhood non-profit groups, and homeowners through on-site services and regional partnerships with community service groups, community development agencies, green organizations, health providers, technology professionals, schools, and municipalities. At least 50% of our tenants will be service-driven. By winter 2016 we expect to partner with the adjacent Los Angeles Conservation Corps Campus to magnify our regional impact, collaborate to attract a wide range of volunteers for our municipal water and green projects, and reach out to the educational community as the Compton Creek Project evolves.\r\n"

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "Though we have adequate funds in hand to meet our initial costs for launching the Center, securing an ongoing source of sustainable funding and investment commitments to maintain the facility over the first five years of operation will be a challenge. Our primary focus over the first year of operation (Dec 2015 - Dec 2016) will include facilitating the necessary number of non-profit service and commercial tenants for the Center as well as continuing to leverage funds through the City of Compton, CDCs, regional financing partners, and community lending organizations to ensure viability through 2016 and beyond. \r\n\r\nAn additional challenge involves meeting the immediate needs of the community. Given that the community has endured an abandoned and neglected building since 1990, NHS feels obligated to open the facility and establish community services as soon as possible. Allocating staff to co-manage the Center will be a driving force behind staying on our planning schedule.\r\n"
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Gauging the success and impact of the project will require tracking data among partners and service providers that utilize the facility. NHS will work with partners to consolidate and filter impact data of those taking courses, attending classes, and receiving training. Affiliated groups working through the Center will be asked to share all relevant statistics and deliverables data with NHS. NHS will serve as the central filter for evaluating the impacts and status of job training, homeowner education, senior and afterschool programming, and small business education programs. \r\n\r\nSpecific annual benchmarks include:\r\n• Providing healthy living services and resources to 1,500 residents;\r\n• Assisting 1,200 families through the Financial Opportunity Center; \r\n• Improving job readiness and overall skills base of local workforce by 20%;\r\n• Establishing 50 home and neighborhood gardens with youth workers; \r\n• Increasing lending access for 50 small business owners.\r\n"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "There are dozens of organizations in Los Angeles County that focus on encouraging and promoting sustainability programs for a wide array of stakeholders (Global Green, Sustainable LA, etc). And there are a vast number of health and community support groups and programs that assist small businesses, schools, government agencies, and municipalities with transitioning to a more sustainable future. Some of these non-profits in the housing and neighborhood revitalization/community health field such as Habitat for Humanity and the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America operate in more specific areas of direct need such as stand-alone housing construction and exclusively foreclosure relief. There are smaller-scale community centers in surrounding cities that offer valuable neighborhood resources, but the Center for Sustainable Communities is truly unique in that it will serve as a diverse, multi-use 28,000 sq ft facility in South LA that will provide a broad range of critically needed specialized services, information, and access to resources that will make underserved and blighted neighborhoods in Compton and surrounding communities stronger and more resilient. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, the Center will include a set of features and services not found elsewhere in the region in a single location. These include a business incubator, health clinic services, fitness rooms, a Community Technology Center, free community meeting space, a Neighborhood Revitalization Institute, senior and afterschool programming, a free library, adult and youth job training, a Green Education & Conservation Center, a Healthy Living Cafe, non-profit and select commercial tenants, and organic urban gardens. With the exception of the Eco-Village in central Los Angeles, there isn't another property and partnership on the scale of what NHS is undertaking with the plan. With the first Center scheduled to open in Compton in December 2015, NHS will be exploring additional locations for new Centers in underserved communities and cities throughout Los Angeles County over the next decade.  \r\n"
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "NHS has entered into agreements with the City of Compton, Metro CDC, and the Pacific Coast Regional Small Business Development Corporation as primary partners and is formalizing arrangements with the Los Angeles Conservation Corps and Christian Health Centers to provide expertise, customized services, training opportunities, and cross-collaborative projects through the Center. The LA2050 award will be allocated to partners based on this formula: NHS - $40,000; each partner (4 total) - $15,000. \r\n\r\nEach core partner brings unique experience and value:\r\n• City of Compton – Compton contributed bond funds to acquire the property and will facilitate project approvals, general public outreach, and program advocacy. \r\n• METRO CDC – Providing neighborhood outreach, employment training, community engagement, community garden management, and referral services for youth and young adults. \r\n• Pacific Coast Regional Small Business Development Corporation – As a tenant, PCR offers financial, educational and consulting services to small business owners and start-ups. \r\n• Los Angeles Conservation Corps – LACC will partner on environmental and urban reclamation projects in the Compton Creek watershed and surrounding area and will provide training, education, and mentoring for youth.\r\n• Christian Health Centers  – Providing full service health clinic programs and services. \r\n\r\nAt least 50% of the tenants in the CSC facility will be service-driven. Critical factors for partnerships include: 1) a commitment to build sustainability in Compton/South Los Angeles County, 2) eliminating “silo organizing” on common regional issues, 3) diversity of services offered, and 4) history of delivering neighborhood revitalization programs in low income communities.\r\n"
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': "The Center will be funded by a mix of public/private community partner and major donor support. The total estimated cost of the acquisition and renovation of the facility is $7.3m. The property was purchased in 2014 for $2.6 million and we need to raise an additional $950,000 to meet our initial project projection. NHS has already entered into MOUs with several developers to finalize land bank, joint ventures, healthy schools initiative work, urban gardening and other community development strategic alignment agreements. The project is currently under construction. A key goal is to further target New Markets Tax Credits, local lender financing, faith-based institutions, foundation capital grants, and exploring as many community investment options as appropriate to leverage the project.  \r\n\r\nNHS will use CSC program activities and tenant rentals to help fund project costs and is securing additional foundation fundraising to cover financial gaps. Because of commitments from local foundations, federal agencies, and a handful of donors, we are in a good position to leverage partnerships with local banks, servicers, and the City of Compton to move forward together in our commitment to serve Compton/South Los Angeles County. LA2050 support will serve as a capstone award for the Center and will allow us to leverage additional funds to help NHS and its partners meet our launch date for the facility as we build on our vision to create sustainable economic and educational opportunities for the residents of Compton.\r\n"
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Revenue\r\nLA2050 \t\t\t\t\t\t\t                100,000\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTotal \t\t\t\t\t\t\t                100,000\r\n\r\nExpenses\r\nPersonnel (CSC Director X 50% FTE)\t\t\t25,000\r\nComputer Equipment (IT & Media Production)  40,000\r\nTraining (Urban Gardening, IT, Workforce)\t\t25,000\r\nOutreach Materials/Media/Events\t\t\t10,000\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTotal \t\t\t\t\t\t\t                100,000\t\r\n"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    Once completed in December 2015, the Center will leverage its partnerships
    to expand support and delivery of its programs in the Compton community. 
    The rehabilitated facility will serve as a model for establishing additional
    Centers in surrounding cities throughout the region, including San Fernando
    Valley, east Los Angeles County, and the South Bay. For 30 years NHS has
    partnered with private and public investors, financial institutions,
    foundations, national non-profits, and cities to create and expand
    sustainable funding relationships to broaden access to capital. Based on our
    project funding projections and overwhelmingly positive response NHS has
    received from residents and partners, we believe there is sufficient support
    among community leaders, local businesses, service groups, and residents to
    both meet the resource needs of the Center and support the creation of new
    Centers in underserved communities.
