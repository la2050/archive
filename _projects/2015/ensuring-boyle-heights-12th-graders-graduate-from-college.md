College Track removes the barriers that prevent students from earning their college degree through a four-part model, which includes Academic Affairs supports through tutoring, academic workshops and SAT and ACT prep; Student Life opportunities to explore workshops that cultivate students’ creativity, passions, leadership and socio-emotional skills; College Completion advisory workshops and scholarship guidance; and College Success mentoring, academic and emotional support during college. Each student spends approximately 5 hours per week at our center, receiving support in math and English, attending a college advisory course and participating in a student life activity.\r\n\r\nCollege Track supports the whole student and offers student life activities that are similar to what students in more affluent schools enjoy. College Track also provides significant financial aid to our college students, as most of our students would not be able to afford college without it. In addition to training students to write and apply for scholarships, we provide both merit-based and need-based financial aid. With our Bank Book for Success, students can earn up to $5,600 in financial support from i.am College Track by meeting specific academic, community service and attendance goals.
