  School this June. Almost all of these students will be the first in their
  family to graduate from college, and most come from families that are living
  at or below the federal poverty level. Funding from LA2050 will help make
  college a reality for these students, and support our efforts to make college
  an expectation for all students across LA.

  i.am College Track Boyle Heights is a collaboration between College Track and
  the i.am.angel foundation. College Track is a national nonprofit that empowers
  students from low-income communities to reach their dreams of a college
  degree. Our 10-year program removes the barriers that prevent students from
  earning their college degree by providing them with comprehensive academic
  support, leadership training, financial and college advising, and
  scholarships. will.i.am created the i.am.angel foundation to TRANS4M lives
  through education, inspiration and opportunity, especially in his hometown of
  Boyle Heights in East Los Angeles. Boyle Heights is a predominantly
  low-income, working class, immigrant community that is rich in culture and
  potential, but struggling with a lack of resources and opportunities. 
   
   i.am College Track is a comprehensive program that provides social and academic support to over 260 Boyle Heights students from Roosevelt High School each year. 98% of students will be the first in their families to apply to college, and 94% come from low-income families that are living at or below the federal poverty level. College Track removes the barriers that prevent students from earning their college degree through a four-part model, which includes Academic Affairs supports through tutoring, academic workshops and SAT and ACT prep; Student Life opportunities to explore workshops that cultivate students’ creativity, passions, leadership and socio-emotional skills; College Completion advisory workshops and scholarship guidance; and College Success mentoring, academic and emotional support during college. Each student spends approximately 5 hours per week at our center, receiving support in math and English, attending a college advisory course and participating in a student life activity.
   
   College Track supports the whole student and offers student life activities that are similar to what students in more affluent schools enjoy. College Track also provides significant financial aid to our college students, as most of our students would not be able to afford college without it. In addition to training students to write and apply for scholarships, we provide both merit-based and need-based financial aid. With our Bank Book for Success, students can earn up to $5,600 in financial support from i.am College Track by meeting specific academic, community service and attendance goals. These funds provide both upfront funding and help minimize student loan debt
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  College Track’s primary challenge is ensuring that our students’ families are
  invested in and supportive of their children’s goals. Many of our
  first-generation college students not only lack the financial resources to
  attend college, but may also embark upon a lonely path, lacking family members
  to provide guidance. Some families dislike the idea of children independently
  living on a college campus. Alternatively, while parents may be supportive of
  their children, the student may suffer with guilt about their own aspirations,
  which may involve leaving home and abandoning their responsibilities.
   
   To address this concern, i.am College Track Boyle Heights developed a family engagement program to complement students’ regular academic and social programming. Our family engagement strategies ensure that families are aware of the path to and through college, are given timely information, and have opportunities to understand what their students will experience at college or university.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  College Track measures our effectiveness by the number of students served and
  the impact we have in helping them earn a college degree. Nationally, College
  Track aims to reach 75% four-year high school program retention, 100% high
  school graduation, 90% college matriculation, and a 60% college graduation
  rate.
   
   As the i.am College Track Boyle Heights center prepares to graduate its first cohort of students, the site’s 2015-16 school year goals include enrolling 260 students (4 cohorts), 85% student attendance rate, 90% one-year retention rate, 85% of 12th graders Cal State (CSU) eligible (2.5+ GPA), 70% of 12th graders University of California (UC) eligible (3.0+ GPA), 100% of 12th graders graduate high school, and 85% of 12th graders matriculate into a four-year college. We measure progress on an ongoing basis against various indicators, including enrollment, retention, attendance, college readiness and academic performance, in order to adjust our strategies accordingly.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There are various nonprofit organizations across LA and the nation that
  provide either college access supports to help students get into college, or
  supports once the students have gotten into college. Unlike these
  organizations, College Track recruits students during the summer before 9th
  grade and works continuously with them for up to 10 years through both high
  school and college graduation. After analyzing college completion results for
  our first three graduating classes, we realized that focusing our support on
  ensuring that students were eligible to attend college did not guarantee that
  they would graduate from college. Our students are primarily first generation
  college students, and as such, face a great deal of hardship in completing
  their degrees. 
   
   College Track is more than a college prep program, and our reach goes well beyond that of a tutoring center. The College Track model supports students through every crucial step of high school and college through college graduation. College Track becomes part of a student’s life, a member of their community, and an academic lifeline when students need one the most. Our program model is structured to prepare students for the academic and social demands of college. A student who completes our four-year high school program receives support equivalent to one additional year of high school. College Track supports the whole student and offers student life activities that are similar to what students in more affluent schools enjoy. Some examples include robotics and computer science workshops, guitar and photography lessons, and a Chinese Alive course where student have an opportunity to learn Mandarin and travel to China.
   
   Unlike similar organizations, once College Track helps students get into college, we continue to support them through college graduation. As our 12th grade students prepare to graduate high school, we provide financial planning workshops, academic advising and social/emotional support because getting into college is one thing, and being financially and emotionally ready for it is another. Our team is committed to doing whatever it takes to make sure our students graduate from college. We visit our students on campus, provide academic advising, connect students with on-campus resources, provide need- and merit-based scholarships, and host an annual student reunion.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  College Track and the i.am.angel foundation are working together to support
  the students of i.am College Track Boyle Heights on their journey to college
  graduation. The full $100,000 award amount will go to fund scholarships for
  the 46 seniors graduating this June as part of the Class of 2016.
   
   As part of his commitment to philanthropy, will.i.am launched the i.am.angel foundation in 2009 to TRANS4M lives through education, inspiration and opportunity. The i.am.angel foundation administers charitable activities and programs targeted toward providing college scholarships, college preparation and opportunities in STEAM education (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics).
   
   i.am College Track Boyle Heights serves students from Roosevelt High School and Roosevelt Math, Science and Technology Magnet Academy, in collaboration with the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) and the Partnership for Los Angeles Schools. College Track collaborates with additional partner organizations, including 826LA and the Boys and Girls Club, to build a network of coordinated and complementary services, share best practices and professional development, and leverage joint resources. We also participate in the Boyle Heights Building Healthy Communities collaborative to strategically benefit the local community.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  i.am College Track currently has $150,000 budgeted for scholarships for our
  Class of 2016 graduating seniors. To raise the remaining $50,000 College Track
  and i.am.angel foundation staff will seek additional philanthropic dollars
  from local individuals, foundations and corporations. College Track and the
  i.am.angel foundation continually work to diversify funding sources and pursue
  new sources of revenue to support our scholarship program, core services and
  expansion efforts through grant writing and individual donor solicitation with
  the help of our Board of Directors and Los Angeles Local Advisory Board.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
  i.am College Track will use the $100,000 LA2050 prize to fund the scholarships
  awarded to our Class of 2016 graduating seniors. As noted above, College Track
  provides our students with both merit-based and need-based financial aid in
  order to help minimize student loan debt, which is one of the primary
  obstacles facing low-income students’ completion of college. Our Bank Book for
  Success offers students the opportunity to earn up to $5,600 in financial
  support from i.am College Track by meeting specific academic, community
  service and attendance goals.
   
   The full scholarship budget ($150,000) is based on 39 graduating seniors (85% college matriculation rate of full cohort) receiving an average Bank Book award of $3,845 per student. The LA2050 $100,000 grant will specifically support college scholarships for 26 i.am College Track Boyle Heights students.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Together, College Track and the i.am.angel foundation strive to turn Boyle
  Heights into a model for other communities around the country. College Track’s
  model for student success is based on over 18 years of operations in
  California and across the country. Historically, 93% of College Track 12th
  grade students have been accepted into four-year colleges. Furthermore, 84% of
  our 12th grade students are college eligible and 89% have matriculated into a
  four-year college. Our students are graduating from college at a rate that is
  2.5 times the national average for low-income students. We are confident that
  applying our program model in Boyle Heights will bring the same success and
  long-term well being to the students of Roosevelt High School, and positive
  outcomes to the LA community overall. Building on the success of our Boyle
  Heights center, College Track recently launched its second LA site in Watts,
  and we plan to launch two additional LA-based sites in low-income
  neighborhoods over the next five years.
   
   College Track is in the process of defining our formal 10-year vision to scale our success to benefit a greater number of students. Our current plan involves creating deep partnerships with the schools, college and communities we serve to act as a thought partner around improving the broader college completion pipeline, both in LA and beyond. We will also take best practices from our work in Boyle Heights to further drive the seamless integration of our high school and college programming, minimizing the transition that can often serve as an obstacle in students’ quests to obtain a college degree. 
   
   College Track and the i.am.angel foundation have a history of partnering with other nonprofit and government organizations across Los Angeles, and we are happy to share the lessons learned from our work at the i.am College Track center in Boyle Heights to improve academic outcomes for students across LA and help ensure that every high school student in LA will graduate and be college and career ready by 2050.
