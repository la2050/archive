  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "i.am College Track Boyle Heights is a collaboration between College Track and the i.am.angel foundation. College Track is a national nonprofit that empowers students from low-income communities to reach their dreams of a college degree. Our 10-year program removes the barriers that prevent students from earning their college degree by providing them with comprehensive academic support, leadership training, financial and college advising, and scholarships. will.i.am created the i.am.angel foundation to TRANS4M lives through education, inspiration and opportunity, especially in his hometown of Boyle Heights in East Los Angeles. Boyle Heights is a predominantly low-income, working class, immigrant community that is rich in culture and potential, but struggling with a lack of resources and opportunities. \r\n\r\ni.am College Track is a comprehensive program that provides social and academic support to over 260 Boyle Heights students from Roosevelt High School each year. 98% of students will be the first in their families to apply to college, and 94% come from low-income families that are living at or below the federal poverty level. College Track removes the barriers that prevent students from earning their college degree through a four-part model, which includes Academic Affairs supports through tutoring, academic workshops and SAT and ACT prep; Student Life opportunities to explore workshops that cultivate students’ creativity, passions, leadership and socio-emotional skills; College Completion advisory workshops and scholarship guidance; and College Success mentoring, academic and emotional support during college. Each student spends approximately 5 hours per week at our center, receiving support in math and English, attending a college advisory course and participating in a student life activity.\r\n\r\nCollege Track supports the whole student and offers student life activities that are similar to what students in more affluent schools enjoy. College Track also provides significant financial aid to our college students, as most of our students would not be able to afford college without it. In addition to training students to write and apply for scholarships, we provide both merit-based and need-based financial aid. With our Bank Book for Success, students can earn up to $5,600 in financial support from i.am College Track by meeting specific academic, community service and attendance goals.

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "College Track’s primary challenge is ensuring that our students’ families are invested in and supportive of their children’s goals. Many of our first-generation college students not only lack the financial resources to attend college, but may also embark upon a lonely path, lacking family members to provide guidance. Some families dislike the idea of children independently living on a college campus. Alternatively, while parents may be supportive of their children, the student may suffer with guilt about their own aspirations, which may involve leaving home and abandoning their responsibilities.\r\n\r\nTo address this concern, i.am College Track Boyle Heights developed a family engagement program to complement students’ regular academic and social programming. Our family engagement strategies ensure that families are aware of the path to and through college, are given timely information, and have opportunities to understand what their students will experience at college or university."
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "College Track measures our effectiveness by the number of students served and the impact we have in helping them earn a college degree. Nationally, College Track aims to reach 75% four-year high school program retention, 100% high school graduation, 90% college matriculation, and a 60% college graduation rate.\r\n\r\nAs the i.am College Track Boyle Heights center prepares to graduate its first cohort of students, the site’s 2015-16 school year goals include enrolling 260 students (4 cohorts), 85% student attendance rate, 90% one-year retention rate, 85% of 12th graders Cal State (CSU) eligible (2.5+ GPA), 70% of 12th graders University of California (UC) eligible (3.0+ GPA), 100% of 12th graders graduate high school, and 85% of 12th graders matriculate into a four-year college. We measure progress on an ongoing basis against various indicators, including enrollment, retention, attendance, college readiness and academic performance, in order to adjust our strategies accordingly."
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "There are various nonprofit organizations across LA and the nation that provide either college access supports to help students get into college, or supports once the students have gotten into college. Unlike these organizations, College Track recruits students during the summer before 9th grade and works continuously with them for up to 10 years through both high school and college graduation. After analyzing college completion results for our first three graduating classes, we realized that focusing our support on ensuring that students were eligible to attend college did not guarantee that they would graduate from college. Our students are primarily first generation college students, and as such, face a great deal of hardship in completing their degrees. \r\n\r\nCollege Track is more than a college prep program, and our reach goes well beyond that of a tutoring center. The College Track model supports students through every crucial step of high school and college through college graduation. College Track becomes part of a student’s life, a member of their community, and an academic lifeline when students need one the most. Our program model is structured to prepare students for the academic and social demands of college. A student who completes our four-year high school program receives support equivalent to one additional year of high school. College Track supports the whole student and offers student life activities that are similar to what students in more affluent schools enjoy. Some examples include robotics and computer science workshops, guitar and photography lessons, and a Chinese Alive course where student have an opportunity to learn Mandarin and travel to China.\r\n\r\nUnlike similar organizations, once College Track helps students get into college, we continue to support them through college graduation. As our 12th grade students prepare to graduate high school, we provide financial planning workshops, academic advising and social/emotional support because getting into college is one thing, and being financially and emotionally ready for it is another. Our team is committed to doing whatever it takes to make sure our students graduate from college. We visit our students on campus, provide academic advising, connect students with on-campus resources, provide need- and merit-based scholarships, and host an annual student reunion."
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "College Track and the i.am.angel foundation are working together to support the students of i.am College Track Boyle Heights on their journey to college graduation. The full $100,000 award amount will go to fund scholarships for the 46 seniors graduating this June as part of the Class of 2016.\r\n\r\nAs part of his commitment to philanthropy, will.i.am launched the i.am.angel foundation in 2009 to TRANS4M lives through education, inspiration and opportunity. The i.am.angel foundation administers charitable activities and programs targeted toward providing college scholarships, college preparation and opportunities in STEAM education (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics).\r\n\r\ni.am College Track Boyle Heights serves students from Roosevelt High School and Roosevelt Math, Science and Technology Magnet Academy, in collaboration with the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) and the Partnership for Los Angeles Schools. College Track collaborates with additional partner organizations, including 826LA and the Boys and Girls Club, to build a network of coordinated and complementary services, share best practices and professional development, and leverage joint resources. We also participate in the Boyle Heights Building Healthy Communities collaborative to strategically benefit the local community."
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    i.am College Track currently has $150,000 budgeted for scholarships for our
    Class of 2016 graduating seniors. To raise the remaining $50,000 College
    Track and i.am.angel foundation staff will seek additional philanthropic
    dollars from local individuals, foundations and corporations. College Track
    and the i.am.angel foundation continually work to diversify funding sources
    and pursue new sources of revenue to support our scholarship program, core
    services and expansion efforts through grant writing and individual donor
    solicitation with the help of our Board of Directors and Los Angeles Local
    Advisory Board.
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "i.am College Track will use the $100,000 LA2050 prize to fund the scholarships awarded to our Class of 2016 graduating seniors. As noted above, College Track provides our students with both merit-based and need-based financial aid in order to help minimize student loan debt, which is one of the primary obstacles facing low-income students’ completion of college. Our Bank Book for Success offers students the opportunity to earn up to $5,600 in financial support from i.am College Track by meeting specific academic, community service and attendance goals.\r\n\r\nThe full scholarship budget ($150,000) is based on 39 graduating seniors (85% college matriculation rate of full cohort) receiving an average Bank Book award of $3,845 per student. The LA2050 $100,000 grant will specifically support college scholarships for 26 i.am College Track Boyle Heights students."
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "Together, College Track and the i.am.angel foundation strive to turn Boyle Heights into a model for other communities around the country. College Track’s model for student success is based on over 18 years of operations in California and across the country. Historically, 93% of College Track 12th grade students have been accepted into four-year colleges. Furthermore, 84% of our 12th grade students are college eligible and 89% have matriculated into a four-year college. Our students are graduating from college at a rate that is 2.5 times the national average for low-income students. We are confident that applying our program model in Boyle Heights will bring the same success and long-term well being to the students of Roosevelt High School, and positive outcomes to the LA community overall. Building on the success of our Boyle Heights center, College Track recently launched its second LA site in Watts, and we plan to launch two additional LA-based sites in low-income neighborhoods over the next five years.\r\n\r\nCollege Track is in the process of defining our formal 10-year vision to scale our success to benefit a greater number of students. Our current plan involves creating deep partnerships with the schools, college and communities we serve to act as a thought partner around improving the broader college completion pipeline, both in LA and beyond. We will also take best practices from our work in Boyle Heights to further drive the seamless integration of our high school and college programming, minimizing the transition that can often serve as an obstacle in students’ quests to obtain a college degree. \r\n\r\nCollege Track and the i.am.angel foundation have a history of partnering with other nonprofit and government organizations across Los Angeles, and we are happy to share the lessons learned from our work at the i.am College Track center in Boyle Heights to improve academic outcomes for students across LA and help ensure that every high school student in LA will graduate and be college and career ready by 2050."
