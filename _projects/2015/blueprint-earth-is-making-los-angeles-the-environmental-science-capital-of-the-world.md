  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: "Blueprint Earth makes L.A. the best place to create by building, growing, and sustaining a culture of curiosity. Blueprint Earth is creating the foundation for Los Angeles to become the world leader in environmental science and technology research by 2050. The Blueprint First program reaches elementary students early. The Blueprint Labs program creates opportunities for older students. The Mission Mojave project creates “blueprints” of our planet’s environments by engaging scientists and engineers. Blueprint Earth is creating the perfect atmosphere for new technologies, new research, and new types of manufacturing and production.\r\n\r\nBlueprint Earth gives traditionally under-represented students access to positive science role models. The Blueprint First science literacy pilot program at Haddon Avenue Elementary in Pacoima starts this fall by connecting real scientists with 225 students. The scientists and students work together to create memorable hands-on science experiments. This helps students discover the world while generating enthusiasm for learning about the planet.\r\n\r\nBlueprint Earth is creating an environmental science laboratory for Angelenos in high school and college to learn real skills that will prepare them for vocational lab jobs, or for work or higher education after earning a degree. The Blueprint Labs program will work with private companies, universities, and the government to study environments, and will create paid jobs for young adults in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nFor the future of the entire city of Los Angeles, Blueprint Earth is creating teams of scientists and engineers working together to understand the environment in new ways. Our signature project, Mission Mojave, supports these teams as they create environmental blueprints, which will help protect, preserve, and restore damaged environments.

Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  The major challenge Blueprint Earth anticipates is with communication.
  Delivering the organization’s message to the number of people required for
  optimum engagement requires significant grassroots effort. Blueprint Earth
  wants Los Angeles to be to the environmental science world what Hollywood is
  to the film world. That level of name recognition requires strategic message
  distribution.
   
   This challenge will be overcome by word-of-mouth campaigns, media coverage, publication of research results, presentations at professional conferences, appearances at schools, public lectures to community groups, and by social media campaigns. The work needs to be publicized in media-friendly ways to keep the science accessible. Careful messaging planning will ensure that Blueprint Earth can build on early success in raising awareness. In Blueprint Earth’s first two years of operation, the organization was featured in numerous publications, including The Huffington Post and Popular Science magazine.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  The Blueprint First program will require evaluation of whether the program
  activities proceed as planned and produce the expected results. Evaluations
  will occur during each academic year using short student knowledge
  questionnaires both pre and post each Blueprint First session. Classroom
  teachers will be surveyed throughout the year to assess program success.

   Mission Mojave is evaluated through participant interviews, demographic surveys, observation, and case studies. Success is measured by invitations to present at professional science conferences and publication in scientific journals. The final measure of Mission Mojave’s success is the replication of the natural study environment in a controlled setting.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Blueprint Earth is the catalyst for Los Angeles to become the world leader in
  environmental science and technology. No other organization is attempting this
  type of work from a holistic, community-focused perspective. This work touches
  the environment, science, and education and has tangible impact on Los
  Angeles. Blueprint Earth’s programs have served 76% females, 56% non-white
  minorities, and 60% of participants come from low-income households, groups
  traditionally under-represented in science.
   
   Currently, there are no other organizations approaching environmental science work this way. Some programs focus on individual fields, like biology. Others are designed to conserve a particular environment, like a single watershed. Still others are geared toward species conservation. Organizations like the National Ecological Observatory Network, the Critical Zone Observatories, and Biosphere2 have superficial similarity to Blueprint Earth, but discussion with these organizations indicates Blueprint Earth’s approach is both distinctive and unique. Additionally, Blueprint Earth was recognized as groundbreaking in Popular Science magazine’s May 2015 issue.
   
   The Mission Mojave program has included scientists and students from 11 universities and 20 private companies in California. These science teams have gathered 1,500 unique observations about the Mojave Desert. This work spans geology, hydrology, biology, and atmospheric science. Collaboration between scientific disciplines is currently both infrequent and highly encouraged by major grantmaking organizations like the National Science Foundation. Blueprint Earth’s work fills a gap in the current approach to environmental science.
   
   Blueprint Earth focuses on creating environmental science opportunities for Angelenos from childhood through their professional careers. Educational programs are often designed to train teachers, or modify science curriculum. Blueprint First brings diverse, culturally relevant scientists into the classroom, allowing students the opportunity to work with positive role models. Blueprint Labs creates a working environmental science lab that will serve as a training center for young scientists and lab technicians to gain real career skills. These job opportunities for young science professionals are currently rare. Mission Mojave’s environmental research is unique in that it creates a big-picture view of environments that are too often only looked at in a very narrow, specialized way.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Blueprint Earth is currently partnered with Haddon Avenue Elementary School in
  Pacoima and the California State University, Los Angeles Hydrogeology Student
  Union. Neither of the partners will receive any of the $100,000 grant award
  directly. A portion of the award money will go towards running our science
  literacy pilot program at Haddon Avenue Elementary School, and a small portion
  will go towards reimbursing members of the California State University, Los
  Angeles Hydrogeology Student Union for travel expenses (gas money) from their
  campus to Haddon during outreach activities.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Successful implementation of Blueprint Labs will generate $250,000 in annual
  revenue. Students will receive compensation for hours worked, and after
  subtracting expenses, an estimated $50,000 in yearly profit will be available.
  All revenue generated by the lab will support the Blueprint First and Mission
  Mojave programs.
   
   LA 2050 funding will enable completion of Phase 1 of 3 for Mission Mojave. Phase 2 of Mission Mojave (blueprint creation) will be funded by Blueprint Labs revenue. Phase 3 of Mission Mojave (environmental replication) will remain, and strong individual and corporate giving programs are in the planning stage. Blueprint Earth is funded with support from Edison International, Qualcomm, Cadiz Ltd., and Healthy Souls. Funding for future work will be sought from current funders as well as new grantmakers. 
   
   The key to scaling and future projects (e.g., Mission Tundra, Mission Rainforest, etc.) is positioning Blueprint Labs as a source of sustainable revenue. The combination of individual donations, grants, and earned revenue will continue progress on blueprinting all of Earth’s environments with L.A. as the home base. The foundation Blueprint Earth is building in the diverse, resource-rich city of Los Angeles will place our city as the global leader in environmental science by 2050. A timeline follows.
