Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: "Blueprint Earth makes L.A. the best place to create by building, growing, and sustaining a culture of curiosity. Blueprint Earth is creating the foundation for Los Angeles to become the world leader in environmental science and technology research by 2050. The Blueprint First program reaches elementary students early. The Blueprint Labs program creates opportunities for older students. The Mission Mojave project creates “blueprints” of our planet’s environments by engaging scientists and engineers. Blueprint Earth is creating the perfect atmosphere for new technologies, new research, and new types of manufacturing and production.\r\n\r\nBlueprint Earth gives traditionally under-represented students access to positive science role models. The Blueprint First science literacy pilot program at Haddon Avenue Elementary in Pacoima starts this fall by connecting real scientists with 225 students. The scientists and students work together to create memorable hands-on science experiments. This helps students discover the world while generating enthusiasm for learning about the planet.\r\n\r\nBlueprint Earth is creating an environmental science laboratory for Angelenos in high school and college to learn real skills that will prepare them for vocational lab jobs, or for work or higher education after earning a degree. The Blueprint Labs program will work with private companies, universities, and the government to study environments, and will create paid jobs for young adults in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nFor the future of the entire city of Los Angeles, Blueprint Earth is creating teams of scientists and engineers working together to understand the environment in new ways. Our signature project, Mission Mojave, supports these teams as they create environmental blueprints, which will help protect, preserve, and restore damaged environments. This type of collaboration between professionals leads to revolutionary discoveries and innovation.\r\n\r\nBlueprint Earth’s programs are creating a culture of curiosity focused on environmental science in Los Angeles. Blueprint First creates environment passion in our youngest citizens. Blueprint Labs creates real career skills for young adults. Finally, Mission Mojave creates real knowledge about how the planet functions, and opens possibilities for exciting discoveries and creative solutions to environmental problems facing Los Angeles in the 21st century.\r\n"
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "The Blueprint First program will require evaluation of whether the program activities proceed as planned and produce the expected results. Evaluations will occur during each academic year using short student knowledge questionnaires both pre and post each Blueprint First session. Classroom teachers will be surveyed throughout the year to assess program success.\r\n\r\nThe participant experience and work of Blueprint Labs will be evaluated using customer and participant case studies, customer satisfaction surveys, participant demographic surveys, and documentation reviews to measure customer satisfaction and the overall program benefit.\r\n\r\nMission Mojave is evaluated through participant interviews, demographic surveys, observation, and case studies. Success is measured by invitations to present at professional science conferences and publication in scientific journals. The final measure of Mission Mojave’s success is the replication of the natural study environment in a controlled setting."
