'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Blueprint Earth makes L.A. the best place to create by building, growing, and
  sustaining a culture of curiosity. Blueprint Earth is creating the foundation
  for Los Angeles to become the world leader in environmental science and
  technology research by 2050. The Blueprint First program reaches elementary
  students early. The Blueprint Labs program creates opportunities for older
  students. The Mission Mojave project creates “blueprints” of our planet’s
  environments by engaging scientists and engineers. Blueprint Earth is creating
  the perfect atmosphere for new technologies, new research, and new types of
  manufacturing and production.
   
   Blueprint Earth gives traditionally under-represented students access to positive science role models. The Blueprint First science literacy pilot program at Haddon Avenue Elementary in Pacoima starts this fall by connecting real scientists with 225 students. The scientists and students work together to create memorable hands-on science experiments. This helps students discover the world while generating enthusiasm for learning about the planet.
   
   Blueprint Earth is creating an environmental science laboratory for Angelenos in high school and college to learn real skills that will prepare them for vocational lab jobs, or for work or higher education after earning a degree. The Blueprint Labs program will work with private companies, universities, and the government to study environments, and will create paid jobs for young adults in Los Angeles.
   
   For the future of the entire city of Los Angeles, Blueprint Earth is creating teams of scientists and engineers working together to understand the environment in new ways. Our signature project, Mission Mojave, supports these teams as they create environmental blueprints, which will help protect, preserve, and restore damaged environments. This type of collaboration between professionals leads to revolutionary discoveries and innovation.
   
   Blueprint Earth’s programs are creating a culture of curiosity focused on environmental science in Los Angeles. Blueprint First creates environment passion in our youngest citizens. Blueprint Labs creates real career skills for young adults. Finally, Mission Mojave creates real knowledge about how the planet functions, and opens possibilities for exciting discoveries and creative solutions to environmental problems facing Los Angeles in the 21st century.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  The major challenge Blueprint Earth anticipates is with communication.
  Delivering the organization’s message to the number of people required for
  optimum engagement requires significant grassroots effort. Blueprint Earth
  wants Los Angeles to be to the environmental science world what Hollywood is
  to the film world. That level of name recognition requires strategic message
  distribution.
   
   This challenge will be overcome by word-of-mouth campaigns, media coverage, publication of research results, presentations at professional conferences, appearances at schools, public lectures to community groups, and by social media campaigns. The work needs to be publicized in media-friendly ways to keep the science accessible. Careful messaging planning will ensure that Blueprint Earth can build on early success in raising awareness. In Blueprint Earth’s first two years of operation, the organization was featured in numerous publications, including The Huffington Post and Popular Science magazine.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  The Blueprint First program will require evaluation of whether the program
  activities proceed as planned and produce the expected results. Evaluations
  will occur during each academic year using short student knowledge
  questionnaires both pre and post each Blueprint First session. Classroom
  teachers will be surveyed throughout the year to assess program success.
   
   The participant experience and work of Blueprint Labs will be evaluated using customer and participant case studies, customer satisfaction surveys, participant demographic surveys, and documentation reviews to measure customer satisfaction and the overall program benefit.
   
   Mission Mojave is evaluated through participant interviews, demographic surveys, observation, and case studies. Success is measured by invitations to present at professional science conferences and publication in scientific journals. The final measure of Mission Mojave’s success is the replication of the natural study environment in a controlled setting.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Blueprint Earth is the catalyst for Los Angeles to become the world leader in
  environmental science and technology. No other organization is attempting this
  type of work from a holistic, community-focused perspective. This work touches
  the environment, science, and education and has tangible impact on Los
  Angeles. Blueprint Earth’s programs have served 76% females, 56% non-white
  minorities, and 60% of participants come from low-income households, groups
  traditionally under-represented in science.
   
   Currently, there are no other organizations approaching environmental science work this way. Some programs focus on individual fields, like biology. Others are designed to conserve a particular environment, like a single watershed. Still others are geared toward species conservation. Organizations like the National Ecological Observatory Network, the Critical Zone Observatories, and Biosphere2 have superficial similarity to Blueprint Earth, but discussion with these organizations indicates Blueprint Earth’s approach is both distinctive and unique. Additionally, Blueprint Earth was recognized as groundbreaking in Popular Science magazine’s May 2015 issue.
   
   The Mission Mojave program has included scientists and students from 11 universities and 20 private companies in California. These science teams have gathered 1,500 unique observations about the Mojave Desert. This work spans geology, hydrology, biology, and atmospheric science. Collaboration between scientific disciplines is currently both infrequent and highly encouraged by major grantmaking organizations like the National Science Foundation. Blueprint Earth’s work fills a gap in the current approach to environmental science.
   
   Blueprint Earth focuses on creating environmental science opportunities for Angelenos from childhood through their professional careers. Educational programs are often designed to train teachers, or modify science curriculum. Blueprint First brings diverse, culturally relevant scientists into the classroom, allowing students the opportunity to work with positive role models. Blueprint Labs creates a working environmental science lab that will serve as a training center for young scientists and lab technicians to gain real career skills. These job opportunities for young science professionals are currently rare. Mission Mojave’s environmental research is unique in that it creates a big-picture view of environments that are too often only looked at in a very narrow, specialized way.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Blueprint Earth is currently partnered with Haddon Avenue Elementary School in
  Pacoima and the California State University, Los Angeles Hydrogeology Student
  Union. Neither of the partners will receive any of the $100,000 grant award
  directly. A portion of the award money will go towards running our science
  literacy pilot program at Haddon Avenue Elementary School, and a small portion
  will go towards reimbursing members of the California State University, Los
  Angeles Hydrogeology Student Union for travel expenses (gas money) from their
  campus to Haddon during outreach activities.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  Blueprint Earth anticipates program costs to be $495,000. Of that amount,
  $395,000 will come from donations in kind as indicated in the detailed budget
  breakdown. To date, operations have progressed with limited cash flow and
  reliance on volunteers to deliver the majority of program services. The
  Blueprint Earth mission resonates with the demographic of the core volunteers
  who typically range from 18 to 40 years of age. This has made the previous two
  years of growth a success. With $100,000 in funding, Blueprint Earth will be
  able to accomplish program goals that would otherwise cost $395,000.
  Historically, funds raised have been approximately $20,000 annually, and the
  organization has delivered six times that value using donations in kind. The
  impact to the community has been a value of $120,000 per year. $100,000 in
  funds from LA 2050 would allow Blueprint Earth to accelerate growth and begin
  a path to sustainability by creating a stream of organizational revenue from
  the Blueprint Labs program.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
  Grant funding will be applied to support three programs that contain the full
  cycle of making L.A. the leader in environmental science and technology.

   2b - Installation of Mass Spectrometer = $3,000
   2c - Purchasing Startup Supplies = $2,000
   2d - City Permits and Other Fees = $1,000
   2e - Subject Matter Expert to Setup Lab = $6,000 (donation in kind)
   2f - Mass Spectrometer (previously donated) = $40,000 (donation in kind)
   
   3) Mission Mojave = $30,000
   -Accelerates environmental research and discovery, completes phase one of three phases for Mission Mojave program
   
   3a - Equipment = $1,500
   3b - Transportation / 4x4 Vehicle Rental = $4,000
   3c - Fuel Reimbursement = $4,000
   3d - Food and Lodging = $8,000
   3e - Supervisory Scientist Compensation = $12,500
   3f - Student Catalogers = $60,000 (donation in kind)
   
   4) Overhead Allocation = $10,000
   -Funds Executive Director and Accountant to perform evaluations of grant funding and program success
   
   4a - Executive Director Compensation (partial) = $4,000
   4b - Tracking Program Success and Progress = $2,000
   4c - Accountant and Office Manager (0.15 FTE) = $4,000
   4e - Board Members’ Organizational Support and Management = $150,000 (donation in kind)
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Successful implementation of Blueprint Labs will generate $250,000 in annual
  revenue. Students will receive compensation for hours worked, and after
  subtracting expenses, an estimated $50,000 in yearly profit will be available.
  All revenue generated by the lab will support the Blueprint First and Mission
  Mojave programs.
   
   LA 2050 funding will enable completion of Phase 1 of 3 for Mission Mojave. Phase 2 of Mission Mojave (blueprint creation) will be funded by Blueprint Labs revenue. Phase 3 of Mission Mojave (environmental replication) will remain, and strong individual and corporate giving programs are in the planning stage. Blueprint Earth is funded with support from Edison International, Qualcomm, Cadiz Ltd., and Healthy Souls. Funding for future work will be sought from current funders as well as new grantmakers. 
   
   The key to scaling and future projects (e.g., Mission Tundra, Mission Rainforest, etc.) is positioning Blueprint Labs as a source of sustainable revenue. The combination of individual donations, grants, and earned revenue will continue progress on blueprinting all of Earth’s environments with L.A. as the home base. The foundation Blueprint Earth is building in the diverse, resource-rich city of Los Angeles will place our city as the global leader in environmental science by 2050. A timeline follows.
