project_summary: >-
  Outside The Box creates temporary pop-up plazas at Los Angeles library parking
  lots and other outside spaces, to celebrate community by gathering together
  for fun, entertainment, education, and sharing culture, food, and music. LA's
  new public space! Pop-up plazas at 10 libraries.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Outside The Box reimagines library facilities as civic space and creates a
  setting for communities to gather, learn, live, celebrate and enjoy the
  wonderful assets we have in these important institutions. Libraries need to
  re-position themselves to better serve communities and re-establish their true
  importance in our society. Activating libraries with more social events
  improves our social bond, facilitates lifelong learning and builds
  understanding of diverse cultures living in Los Angeles.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Some members of Library Management may resist this new use of facilities and
  be concerned about management and operations. We plan to introduce each
  selected library site manager to the original temporary Pop-up Plaza installed
  at the San Pedro Regional Library in October 2014 and have the staff from this
  location share the benefits and challenges they have enjoyed as a result of
  this unique use of civic space. By eliminating the fear, uncertainty, and
  doubt some staff may have about this new library asset, we will overcome the
  barrier/challenges as they may develop.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: |-
  1. Outreach to library staff and community
   2. Social media comments
   3. Successful deployment of at least 10 re-usable Pop-up-Plazas at Los Angeles Libraries
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Outside The Box was a 2014 grant to 20 libraries throughout the country
  sponsored by Redbox. Each installation was unique. The approach taken at the
  San Pedro Regional Branch Library utilizes off-the-shelf modular/stackable
  furniture and other items purchased at retailers such as Ikea and Home Depot
  to create useable space from parking lots for use by the community for events
  like: Movie Night; BARK-Kids reading to therapy dogs; Astronomy Club, and
  anything a community can dream up to enjoy outside with friends and neighbors
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Los Angeles Neighborhood Initiative will receive $10,000 for agency
  coordination
   $100,000
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 â€“ how will you cover the additional costs?': |-
  We will seek corporate sponsorship from:
   Redbox
   Ikea
   Home Depot
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  Agency Coordination - $10,000
   Design, logistics, installation - $40,000
   10 Pop-up Plazas - $50,000
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  We have proven the success at one LA library already. We now plan to grow this
  by a factor of 10 through this grant. After successfully deploying 10 new
  pop-up Plazas at libraries in Los Angeles we will have demonstrated the
  viability of this concept and we plan to ask our corporate sponsors (Redbox,
  Ikea, and Home Depot) to fund a Pop-up Plaza at every library in the City of
  Los Angeles. Each of our corporate sponsors have already demonstrated their
  commitment to socially responsible community-building by thinking
  OutsideTheBox.
