  Outside The Box reimagines library facilities as civic space and creates a
  setting for communities to gather, learn, live, celebrate and enjoy the
  wonderful assets we have in these important institutions. Libraries need to
  re-position themselves to better serve communities and re-establish their true
  importance in our society. Activating libraries with more social events
  improves our social bond, facilitates lifelong learning and builds
  understanding of diverse cultures living in Los Angeles.
