    Outside The Box reimagines library facilities as civic space and creates a
    setting for communities to gather, learn, live, celebrate and enjoy the
    wonderful assets we have in these important institutions. Libraries need to
    re-position themselves to better serve communities and re-establish their
    true importance in our society. Activating libraries with more social events
    improves our social bond, facilitates lifelong learning and builds
    understanding of diverse cultures living in Los Angeles.

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    Some members of Library Management may resist this new use of facilities and
    be concerned about management and operations. We plan to introduce each
    selected library site manager to the original temporary Pop-up Plaza
    installed at the San Pedro Regional Library in October 2014 and have the
    staff from this location share the benefits and challenges they have enjoyed
    as a result of this unique use of civic space. By eliminating the fear,
    uncertainty, and doubt some staff may have about this new library asset, we
    will overcome the barrier/challenges as they may develop.
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "1. Outreach to library staff and community\r\n2. Social media comments\r\n3. Successful deployment of at least 10 re-usable Pop-up-Plazas at Los Angeles Libraries\r\n"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    Outside The Box was a 2014 grant to 20 libraries throughout the country
    sponsored by Redbox. Each installation was unique. The approach taken at the
    San Pedro Regional Branch Library utilizes off-the-shelf modular/stackable
    furniture and other items purchased at retailers such as Ikea and Home Depot
    to create useable space from parking lots for use by the community for
    events like: Movie Night; BARK-Kids reading to therapy dogs; Astronomy Club,
    and anything a community can dream up to enjoy outside with friends and
    neighbors
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "Los Angeles Neighborhood Initiative will receive $10,000 for agency coordination\r\n$100,000\r\n"
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': "We will seek corporate sponsorship from:\r\nRedbox\r\nIkea\r\nHome Depot\r\n"
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Agency Coordination - $10,000\r\nDesign, logistics, installation - $40,000\r\n10 Pop-up Plazas - $50,000\r\n"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    We have proven the success at one LA library already. We now plan to grow
    this by a factor of 10 through this grant. After successfully deploying 10
    new pop-up Plazas at libraries in Los Angeles we will have demonstrated the
    viability of this concept and we plan to ask our corporate sponsors (Redbox,
    Ikea, and Home Depot) to fund a Pop-up Plaza at every library in the City of
    Los Angeles. Each of our corporate sponsors have already demonstrated their
    commitment to socially responsible community-building by thinking
    OutsideTheBox.
