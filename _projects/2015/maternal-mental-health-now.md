title: Maternal Mental Health NOW
project_summary: >-
  The overall goal of our project is to improve recognition and response to
  perinatal mood and anxiety disorders in medical settings in the safety net. We
  will do this by implementing a model of collaborative perinatal mental health
  care in 3 FQHCs, evaluating its effectiveness and creating a best practice
  guide. We will address other barriers to identification and treatment of
  perinatal mood and anxiety disorders by facilitating stigma-reduction
  workshops in the communities surrounding the sites.

  'DESCRIBE IN GREATER DETAIL HOW YOU WILL MAKE LA THE HEALTHIEST PLACE TO LIVE: ': "According to the most recent Los Angeles Mother Baby (LAMB) Survey, administered by the LA County Department of Public Health – Maternal, Child, & Adolescent Health Programs, 29.7% of new mothers in Los Angeles County self-report some form of depression during pregnancy, and an astounding 47.3%--representing more than 60,000 women--self-report depression during the postpartum period. Rates of self-reported depression during pregnancy are significantly higher among ethnic minority and low-income women. But many of these women do not seek treatment due to various barriers, including stigma, financial and insurance limitations, transportation issues, lack of childcare, and other concerns. As a result, mothers and their children are exposed to the negative impacts of untreated depression or anxiety, which include poor birth outcomes, prematurity, low birth weight, emotional dysregulation in the infant, difficulties with attachment, and developmental, cognitive, and emotional difficulties in the developing child.\r\nThe unique challenges listed above make the perinatal period an ideal one for instituting a collaborative or integrated care model that treats both the medical and mental health needs of a woman and her family - under one roof.  \r\nBetween 2012-2015, Maternal Mental Health NOW oversaw a pilot project aimed at improving the behavioral and physical outcomes of pregnant and postpartum women through a collaborative care project based on the IMPACT model, at USC-Eisner Family Medical Center, a federally qualified nonprofit community health center serving Metro, South and South Central Los Angeles. Today, Maternal Mental Health NOW is working to refine and spread an effective model of integrated perinatal mental health care into additional medical settings, including pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, primary care, and hospitals throughout Los Angeles, collect data on selected outcome measures, study its impact on the health and well being of pregnant and new mothers and important aspects of their relationship with their new and developing infants.  The end product will be to create a guide, which will provide resources to other medical sites wishing to do the same. \r\n"

    Based on its experience at USC-Eisner FMC, Maternal Mental Health NOW
    anticipates that the biggest challenge it will face is achieving real
    practice change at each participating medical site. Despite weekly meetings
    at USC-Eisner FMC, we learned about inconsistencies and discrepencies in
    screening, referral and treatment procedures.  In addition, we were unable
    to collect data that demonstrated the impact of the project on patient
    outcomes.  To address this, we have devised a range of levels of perinatal
    mental health care integration, starting at Minimal Collaboration through to
    Close Collaboration. Moving forward, our goal is to move medical sites from
    one level to the next.  In addition, we will hire a Quality Improvement
    Manager whose sole responsibility will be to build relationships with each
    medical site, troubleshoot procedures and protocols to help each medical
    site improve its level of perinatal mental health care integration, and
    ensure compliance with data collection.  
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Following recommendations of the AIMS Center at the University of Washington, we will work with each medical site to track the following processes and outcomes in order to evaluate our work:\r\n\r\n•\tNumber and proportion of patients in treatment for at least 10 weeks with significant clinical improvement\r\n•\tTotal number of patients discharged\r\n•\tTotal number of patients active\r\n•\tProportion of active patients receiving any kind of follow-up during the past month\r\n•\tAverage number of contacts since treatment started\r\n•\tAverage length of time in treatment\r\n•\tProportion of patients in treatment who have been reviewed by a psychiatric consultant who has made recommendations to the primary care-based treating medical/behavioral health providers\r\n•\tProportion of patients in treatment for at least 10 weeks who are not improved and who have not been reviewed with the psychiatric specialist.\r\n\r\n"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    Several organizations across the country, including the University of
    Washington AIMS Center, have demonstrated the impact that a collaborative
    care model (integrating mental health care into behavioral health care
    settings) has on patient outcomes.  However, the impact of this model on the
    perinatal population (pregnant and postpartum women) has not yet been
    studied. 
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    Maternal Mental Health NOW will collaborate with USC-Eisner Family Medicine
    Center and Harbor Community Clinic on this project.  A third FQHC is yet to
    be determined.  Each participating FQHC will receive a small stipend to
    cover the personnel time it invests in the project as well as in-kind
    resources and expertise.
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    Total costs of this project are estimated to be $308,908 over a two year
    time period.  Maternal Mental Health NOW will cover the additional costs
    through grant writing and individual donor development.  Maternal Mental
    Health NOW has already secured $50,000 for this project from the Tikkun Olam
    Foundation.  In addition, we are in discussions with the California Health
    Care Foundation and the WM Keck Foundation about funding for this project.
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Quality Improvement Manager - $35,000\r\nEvaluation - $30,000\r\nPhotography & Videography - $3,000\r\nWriter - $2,500\r\nEditor - $2,500\r\nPartner Stipends - $15,000\r\nTravel - $3,000\r\nAdministration & Overhead - $9,000"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "Maternal Mental Health NOW will document the content of all activities associated with this project, including trainings, weekly coaching and consultation sessions, care team meetings and collaborative learning opportunities through written notes, and where applicable, photography and videography.  In addition, Maternal Mental Health NOW will utilize patient registries to track and document qualitative and quantitative data on screening, referrals and treatment as well as patient outcomes on a quarterly basis.  During the second year of the project, Maternal Mental Health NOW will utilize its notes, photographs, videos and data to draft, edit and publish a best practice guide on integrating perinatal mental health care into medical settings.  \r\n\r\nThe best practice guide, which aims to serve as a road map for achieving perinatal mental health care integration at the 129 FQHCs serving 3,412,961 patients in California and the 1,202 FQHCs serving 21,726,965 patients nationwide, will include the following elements:\r\n\r\n•\tCase studies of three medical settings and their experiences with the New Family Care Team project;\r\n•\tRecommendations for HIPPA compliant, web-based registries;\r\n•\tSelf-assessment tool for integrating perinatal mental health care in a medical setting;\r\n•\tAdditional resources for achieving perinatal mental health care integration.\r\n\r\nOnce published, the guidebook will be distributed in print and via online channels to The California Improvement Network and other partners and stakeholders.  As a result of the best practice guide, medical settings throughout the state and beyond will be able to utilize Maternal Mental Health NOW’s recommendations so that the model of integrated perinatal mental health care can spread.\r\n"
