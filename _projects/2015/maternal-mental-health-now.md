title: Maternal Mental Health NOW
project_summary: >-
  The overall goal of our project is to improve recognition and response to
  perinatal mood and anxiety disorders in medical settings in the safety net. We
  will do this by implementing a model of collaborative perinatal mental health
  care in 3 FQHCs, evaluating its effectiveness and creating a best practice
  guide. We will address other barriers to identification and treatment of
  perinatal mood and anxiety disorders by facilitating stigma-reduction
  workshops in the communities surrounding the sites.
