title: Maternal Mental Health NOW
project_summary: >-
  The overall goal of our project is to improve recognition and response to
  perinatal mood and anxiety disorders in medical settings in the safety net. We
  will do this by implementing a model of collaborative perinatal mental health
  care in 3 FQHCs, evaluating its effectiveness and creating a best practice
  guide. We will address other barriers to identification and treatment of
  perinatal mood and anxiety disorders by facilitating stigma-reduction
  workshops in the communities surrounding the sites.

  According to the most recent Los Angeles Mother Baby (LAMB) Survey,
  administered by the LA County Department of Public Health – Maternal, Child, &
  Adolescent Health Programs, 29.7% of new mothers in Los Angeles County
  self-report some form of depression during pregnancy, and an astounding
  47.3%--representing more than 60,000 women--self-report depression during the
  postpartum period. Rates of self-reported depression during pregnancy are
  significantly higher among ethnic minority and low-income women. But many of
  these women do not seek treatment due to various barriers, including stigma,
  financial and insurance limitations, transportation issues, lack of childcare,
  and other concerns. As a result, mothers and their children are exposed to the
  negative impacts of untreated depression or anxiety, which include poor birth
  outcomes, prematurity, low birth weight, emotional dysregulation in the
  infant, difficulties with attachment, and developmental, cognitive, and
  emotional difficulties in the developing child.
   The unique challenges listed above make the perinatal period an ideal one for instituting a collaborative or integrated care model that treats both the medical and mental health needs of a woman and her family - under one roof. 
   Between 2012-2015, Maternal Mental Health NOW oversaw a pilot project aimed at improving the behavioral and physical outcomes of pregnant and postpartum women through a collaborative care project based on the IMPACT model, at USC-Eisner Family Medical Center, a federally qualified nonprofit community health center serving Metro, South and South Central Los Angeles. Today, Maternal Mental Health NOW is working to refine and spread an effective model of integrated perinatal mental health care into additional medical settings, including pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, primary care, and hospitals throughout Los Angeles, collect data on selected outcome measures, study its impact on the health and well being of pregnant and new mothers and important aspects of their relationship with their new and developing infants. The end product will be to create a guide, which will provide resources to other medical sites wishing to do the same.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Based on its experience at USC-Eisner FMC, Maternal Mental Health NOW
  anticipates that the biggest challenge it will face is achieving real practice
  change at each participating medical site. Despite weekly meetings at
  USC-Eisner FMC, we learned about inconsistencies and discrepencies in
  screening, referral and treatment procedures. In addition, we were unable to
  collect data that demonstrated the impact of the project on patient outcomes.
  To address this, we have devised a range of levels of perinatal mental health
  care integration, starting at Minimal Collaboration through to Close
  Collaboration. Moving forward, our goal is to move medical sites from one
  level to the next. In addition, we will hire a Quality Improvement Manager
  whose sole responsibility will be to build relationships with each medical
  site, troubleshoot procedures and protocols to help each medical site improve
  its level of perinatal mental health care integration, and ensure compliance
  with data collection.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Following recommendations of the AIMS Center at the University of Washington,
  we will work with each medical site to track the following processes and
  outcomes in order to evaluate our work:
   
   • Number and proportion of patients in treatment for at least 10 weeks with significant clinical improvement
   • Total number of patients discharged
   • Total number of patients active
   • Proportion of active patients receiving any kind of follow-up during the past month
   • Average number of contacts since treatment started
   • Average length of time in treatment
   • Proportion of patients in treatment who have been reviewed by a psychiatric consultant who has made recommendations to the primary care-based treating medical/behavioral health providers
   • Proportion of patients in treatment for at least 10 weeks who are not improved and who have not been reviewed with the psychiatric specialist.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Several organizations across the country, including the University of
  Washington AIMS Center, have demonstrated the impact that a collaborative care
  model (integrating mental health care into behavioral health care settings)
  has on patient outcomes. However, the impact of this model on the perinatal
  population (pregnant and postpartum women) has not yet been studied.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Maternal Mental Health NOW will collaborate with USC-Eisner Family Medicine
  Center and Harbor Community Clinic on this project. A third FQHC is yet to be
  determined. Each participating FQHC will receive a small stipend to cover the
  personnel time it invests in the project as well as in-kind resources and
  expertise.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Maternal Mental Health NOW will document the content of all activities
  associated with this project, including trainings, weekly coaching and
  consultation sessions, care team meetings and collaborative learning
  opportunities through written notes, and where applicable, photography and
  videography. In addition, Maternal Mental Health NOW will utilize patient
  registries to track and document qualitative and quantitative data on
  screening, referrals and treatment as well as patient outcomes on a quarterly
  basis. During the second year of the project, Maternal Mental Health NOW will
  utilize its notes, photographs, videos and data to draft, edit and publish a
  best practice guide on integrating perinatal mental health care into medical
  settings. 
   
   The best practice guide, which aims to serve as a road map for achieving perinatal mental health care integration at the 129 FQHCs serving 3,412,961 patients in California and the 1,202 FQHCs serving 21,726,965 patients nationwide, will include the following elements:
   
   • Case studies of three medical settings and their experiences with the New Family Care Team project;
   • Recommendations for HIPPA compliant, web-based registries;
   • Self-assessment tool for integrating perinatal mental health care in a medical setting;
   • Additional resources for achieving perinatal mental health care integration.
   
   Once published, the guidebook will be distributed in print and via online channels to The California Improvement Network and other partners and stakeholders. As a result of the best practice guide, medical settings throughout the state and beyond will be able to utilize Maternal Mental Health NOW’s recommendations so that the model of integrated perinatal mental health care can spread.
