title: Learning Through Service at Holy Family School
project_summary: >-
  HFS hopes to transform the way education integrates learning through service
  by transforming our service-learning initiative into a model program and
  catalyst for change. Through programming, research and evaluation we hope to
  develop an innovative and replicable service-learning curriculum characterized
  by meaningful partnerships, reflection and enriched instructional strategies.
  We believe that we learn from the people we serve and that curriculum is
  enriched through community connections.

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "HFS will implement a model service-learning program that transforms the way students LEARN through a strong link between community impact and a strengthened curriculum. Our educational philosophy has long aspired to weave a greater level of service based learning into every aspect of our curriculum. Our students are actively engaged in community and ministerial work through their volunteering efforts with our Holy Family Giving Bank, Ministry to the Elderly and Project Haiti.  Moderate adjustments to our existing curriculum would enable HFS to broaden its scope to become a true model in service-learning that helps make LA the best place to LEARN.  \r\n \r\nA recent study, by the National Center for Learning and Citizenship, supports the view that “high quality service-learning has a statistically significant and positive relationship with students’ acquisition of 21st century skills.” Local, national & global community outreach efforts positively impact our community, teach civic responsibility and motivate students to LEARN. Through service-learning, students LEARN that they can make a difference and be active citizens. Through active LEARNING they discover that they have a voice and how to use it. \r\n\r\nOur service-learning model will integrate the community through authentic lessons in all subject areas. Many subjects will be tied to a garden-based curriculum delivered through the process of growing and harvesting produce for our local Giving Bank’s weekly food distribution and local restaurants supplying our school lunch program. Outdoor education will be expanded to cover environmental topics and relate them to our immediate community through the development of a large scale recycling program and a neighborhood improvement fund. Media literacy will be incorporated, in the forms of student broadcasting and public service announcements, to teach student the importance of analyzing and critiquing the local and global topics in which they will be immersed. \r\n\r\nOur service-learning model will immediately impact the over 550 school and religious education students we serve. This includes students from preschool through high school citywide, creating an integrated network of support. Sharing our strategies will enable our program to reach far beyond our immediate campus to the many schools we partner with. Additionally, we will make our new curriculum design available to students of all socioeconomic backgrounds through a community summer program with scholarships. "

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    Logistics of time and space remain an ongoing challenge in education. Common
    Core standards, benchmarks and curriculum time requirements often leave
    teachers overextended. This challenge is one of the main obstacles that we
    hope to overcome by developing a comprehensive curriculum model to provide
    an engaging framework to teach these educational requirements. With the
    right design, we believe service-learning can be liberally used as an
    institutional strategy to meet learning goals and Common Core standards.
    Overcoming these obstacles will involve developing a Guiding Coalition, a
    team of three teachers representing each grade cluster, to design, implement
    and create a relevant and replicable service-learning curriculum that will
    enhance and augment learning standards.
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "The successful implementation of a service-learning model program will require systems for reporting, collecting and analyzing data. The Principal and Guiding Coalition will document and analyze the growth of this program through the following methods: \r\n\r\n1. Individual student portfolios. The student portfolios will consist of written evaluations and work samples from all subject areas displaying how service-learning enhances lessons. These portfolios will be assessed by the Guiding Coalition quarterly.  \r\n2. Faculty assessment & collaboration. Quarterly classroom observations and written evaluations will be completed for each individual teacher by the Guiding Coalition. This will also serve as an opportunity for teachers to build a shared knowledge of service-learning goals & strategies.   \r\n3. Overall program. A system will be developed by the Guiding Coalition for collecting data and organizing the service-learning curriculum into a comprehensive manual to be shared with other schools."
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    There are many schools and nonprofits working to implement a more vibrant
    future for our school system through innovative education. In a
    comprehensive study by the Center for Education Reform (CER) it was
    discovered that, for the most part, the school system operates on a model
    that worked a half-century ago but fails to account for a wholly different
    social structure and education environment in our nation today. What makes
    our approach unique is our adoption of a comprehensive service-learning
    model in a truly collaborative effort with a variety of schools and
    community partners. 
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "Mutually-beneficial partnerships make up the core of an impactful service-learning model and we know that we are strengthened through collaboration and community impact. Notably, our collaboration and leadership role with our economically disadvantaged partner schools (Dolores Mission, Our Lady of Guadalupe, Assumption and St. Alphonsus) throughout East Los Angeles, will be enhanced through documented implementation methods around this service-learning model. For the past decade, Holy Family staff, students, parents and parishioners have committed time and resources to bring these schools new educational, drama, theater and art programs, text books, computers, playground equipment and school supplies. Our service-learning curriculum advancements and shared resources will be on ongoing opportunity to advance in solidarity with these schools. \r\n\r\nAdditional direct community partnerships will include: growing produce for the Holy Family Giving Bank weekly food distribution; supplying herbs and vegetables to local restaurants that supply our school hot lunch program; shared resources and joint faculty and student service-learning lessons in collaboration with our partner schools; as well as countless partnerships as part of our non-profit of the month service-learning partnerships with some examples including the Center for Restorative Justice Works (an organization providing assistance to children of the incarcerated), Hillsides for Abused Children and Project Haiti. "
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    As a pilot school for many projects in the archdiocese of Los Angeles, Holy
    Family implements programs that exist for the benefit of our greater
    community. The true measurement of success will be for the benefits of our
    service-learning program to reach beyond our own students and truly
    exemplify ways that integrated service enhances learning and impacts the
    world around us. Particularly in our commitment to partner with and guide
    economically disadvantaged schools, our model’s success will be measured by
    a successful and replicable guide for implementing creative service-learning
    into all aspects of an enhanced curriculum.
