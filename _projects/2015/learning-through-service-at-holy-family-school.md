  HFS hopes to transform the way education integrates learning through service
  by transforming our service-learning initiative into a model program and
  catalyst for change. Through programming, research and evaluation we hope to
  develop an innovative and replicable service-learning curriculum characterized
  by meaningful partnerships, reflection and enriched instructional strategies.
  We believe that we learn from the people we serve and that curriculum is
  enriched through community connections.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  HFS will implement a model service-learning program that transforms the way
  students LEARN through a strong link between community impact and a
  strengthened curriculum. Our educational philosophy has long aspired to weave
  a greater level of service based learning into every aspect of our curriculum.
  Our students are actively engaged in community and ministerial work through
  their volunteering efforts with our Holy Family Giving Bank, Ministry to the
  Elderly and Project Haiti. Moderate adjustments to our existing curriculum
  would enable HFS to broaden its scope to become a true model in
  service-learning that helps make LA the best place to LEARN. 
    
   A recent study, by the National Center for Learning and Citizenship, supports the view that “high quality service-learning has a statistically significant and positive relationship with students’ acquisition of 21st century skills.” Local, national & global community outreach efforts positively impact our community, teach civic responsibility and motivate students to LEARN. Through service-learning, students LEARN that they can make a difference and be active citizens. Through active LEARNING they discover that they have a voice and how to use it. 
   
   Our service-learning model will integrate the community through authentic lessons in all subject areas. Many subjects will be tied to a garden-based curriculum delivered through the process of growing and harvesting produce for our local Giving Bank’s weekly food distribution and local restaurants supplying our school lunch program. Outdoor education will be expanded to cover environmental topics and relate them to our immediate community through the development of a large scale recycling program and a neighborhood improvement fund. Media literacy will be incorporated, in the forms of student broadcasting and public service announcements, to teach student the importance of analyzing and critiquing the local and global topics in which they will be immersed. 
   
   Our service-learning model will immediately impact the over 550 school and religious education students we serve. This includes students from preschool through high school citywide, creating an integrated network of support. Sharing our strategies will enable our program to reach far beyond our immediate campus to the many schools we partner with. Additionally, we will make our new curriculum design available to students of all socioeconomic backgrounds through a community summer program with scholarships.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Logistics of time and space remain an ongoing challenge in education. Common
  Core standards, benchmarks and curriculum time requirements often leave
  teachers overextended. This challenge is one of the main obstacles that we
  hope to overcome by developing a comprehensive curriculum model to provide an
  engaging framework to teach these educational requirements. With the right
  design, we believe service-learning can be liberally used as an institutional
  strategy to meet learning goals and Common Core standards. Overcoming these
  obstacles will involve developing a Guiding Coalition, a team of three
  teachers representing each grade cluster, to design, implement and create a
  relevant and replicable service-learning curriculum that will enhance and
  augment learning standards.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  The successful implementation of a service-learning model program will require
  systems for reporting, collecting and analyzing data. The Principal and
  Guiding Coalition will document and analyze the growth of this program through
  the following methods: 
   
   1. Individual student portfolios. The student portfolios will consist of written evaluations and work samples from all subject areas displaying how service-learning enhances lessons. These portfolios will be assessed by the Guiding Coalition quarterly. 
   2. Faculty assessment & collaboration. Quarterly classroom observations and written evaluations will be completed for each individual teacher by the Guiding Coalition. This will also serve as an opportunity for teachers to build a shared knowledge of service-learning goals & strategies. 
   3. Overall program. A system will be developed by the Guiding Coalition for collecting data and organizing the service-learning curriculum into a comprehensive manual to be shared with other schools.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There are many schools and nonprofits working to implement a more vibrant
  future for our school system through innovative education. In a comprehensive
  study by the Center for Education Reform (CER) it was discovered that, for the
  most part, the school system operates on a model that worked a half-century
  ago but fails to account for a wholly different social structure and education
  environment in our nation today. What makes our approach unique is our
  adoption of a comprehensive service-learning model in a truly collaborative
  effort with a variety of schools and community partners.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Mutually-beneficial partnerships make up the core of an impactful
  service-learning model and we know that we are strengthened through
  collaboration and community impact. Notably, our collaboration and leadership
  role with our economically disadvantaged partner schools (Dolores Mission, Our
  Lady of Guadalupe, Assumption and St. Alphonsus) throughout East Los Angeles,
  will be enhanced through documented implementation methods around this
  service-learning model. For the past decade, Holy Family staff, students,
  parents and parishioners have committed time and resources to bring these
  schools new educational, drama, theater and art programs, text books,
  computers, playground equipment and school supplies. Our service-learning
  curriculum advancements and shared resources will be on ongoing opportunity to
  advance in solidarity with these schools. 
   
   Additional direct community partnerships will include: growing produce for the Holy Family Giving Bank weekly food distribution; supplying herbs and vegetables to local restaurants that supply our school hot lunch program; shared resources and joint faculty and student service-learning lessons in collaboration with our partner schools; as well as countless partnerships as part of our non-profit of the month service-learning partnerships with some examples including the Center for Restorative Justice Works (an organization providing assistance to children of the incarcerated), Hillsides for Abused Children and Project Haiti.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  The program will have one-time, start-up costs of $100,000 to implement and
  develop a replicable model. Following the start-up year the program will be
  sustained by the school budget.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  Faculty stipends to design and implement the program $25,000
   Faculty development $15,000
   Expanded resources/curriculum materials for the learning garden, outdoor classroom & multimedia component $40,000
   Replication manual materials $5,000
   Shared resources with partner schools $15,000
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  As a pilot school for many projects in the archdiocese of Los Angeles, Holy
  Family implements programs that exist for the benefit of our greater
  community. The true measurement of success will be for the benefits of our
  service-learning program to reach beyond our own students and truly exemplify
  ways that integrated service enhances learning and impacts the world around
  us. Particularly in our commitment to partner with and guide economically
  disadvantaged schools, our model’s success will be measured by a successful
  and replicable guide for implementing creative service-learning into all
  aspects of an enhanced curriculum.
