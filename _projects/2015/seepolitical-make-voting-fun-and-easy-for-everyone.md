Where will you be working?:
  - City of Los Angeles
  - LAUSD
How do you plan to use these resources to make change?:
  - Conduct research
  - Expand a pilot or a program
  - Implement and track policy
How will your proposal improve the following “Connect” metrics?:
  - Rates of volunteerism
  - Voting rates by race
  - Participation in neighborhood councils
  - Government responsiveness to residents’ needs (Dream Metric)
  - Total number of local social media friends and connections (Dream Metric)
  - Attendance at public/open streets gatherings (Dream Metric)
Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "SeePolitical is an interactive website, widget and mobile app providing objective, easily understood information about ballot propositions for all Angelenos. \r\n\r\nTrying to understand the complex language found on most ballots is frustrating and often results in uninformed voters approving unintended consequences. \r\n\r\nIn the case for our region, most voters are not even participating. This year's primary turned out an alarmingly record-low voter turnout in Los Angeles, less than 9% of voters showed up. This is totally unacceptable. \r\n\r\nSeePolitical breaks the mold by offering unbiased entertaining educational content that informs and empowers voters in English, Spanish and if able to partner with the Goldhirsh Foundation we can expand our explainers to every major spoken language. "
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "For the first time ever underserved voters will be able to: Quickly and easily understand ballot propositions that affect them; easily record thoughts on ballot propositions and establish reminders for specific voting dates; quickly share thoughts with friends in Los Angeles and other interested parties through established social networks.\r\n\r\nHow We Measure Success:\r\n➢\tBuild Relationships Through Digital/Social:\r\n•\tAttract -> Convert -> Support -> Extend\r\n➢\tMeasure Effectiveness of Campaign through Impressions -> Leads -> Conversions -> Loyalty/Engagement\r\n\r\nWe want to meet our brand awareness goal by engaging at least 5% of California registered voters, which equals approximately 890,000 people, mostly in the Los Angeles region. \r\n\r\nMetric Goals\r\nWeb: \t50k monthly unique visits\r\nSocial Media/Emails:\t 50k+ Database\r\nVideo Impressions:\t1M+ video impressions\r\nWidgets Distributed:\t50+\r\nWidget Impressions:\t500k+\r\n"
