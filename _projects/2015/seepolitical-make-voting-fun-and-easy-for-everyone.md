'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  SeePolitical is an interactive website, widget and mobile app providing
  objective, easily understood information about ballot propositions for all
  Angelenos. 
   
   Trying to understand the complex language found on most ballots is frustrating and often results in uninformed voters approving unintended consequences. 
   
   In the case for our region, most voters are not even participating. This year's primary turned out an alarmingly record-low voter turnout in Los Angeles, less than 9% of voters showed up. This is totally unacceptable. 
   
   SeePolitical breaks the mold by offering unbiased entertaining educational content that informs and empowers voters in English, Spanish and if able to partner with the Goldhirsh Foundation we can expand our explainers to every major spoken language.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  One challenge this year will be convincing voters and likely voters that their
  vote counts and a better option is available to learn about what's on their
  ballot. 
   
   Los Angeles already experienced record low voter turnout for the past two years indicating a lack of enthusiasm and interest in our elections. Voting is not a priority for many people in our city – we believe this is because the information is not being communicated in an interesting format people in LA have come to expect. It will be challenging to overcome the voter apathy experienced by millions of Angelenos, however, we believe it is a challenge worth facing considering the long-term dire consequences of a disinterested voting population. 
   
   We aim to address this serious challenge by partnering with past media partners like ABC, Univision, LA Times, NPR, and Twitter as well as organizations such as the League of Women Voters, California Common Cause, Rock the Vote and Head Count to distribute our content.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  For the first time ever underserved voters will be able to: Quickly and easily
  understand ballot propositions that affect them; easily record thoughts on
  ballot propositions and establish reminders for specific voting dates; quickly
  share thoughts with friends in Los Angeles and other interested parties
  through established social networks.
   
   How We Measure Success:
   ➢ Build Relationships Through Digital/Social:
   • Attract -> Convert -> Support -> Extend
   ➢ Measure Effectiveness of Campaign through Impressions -> Leads -> Conversions -> Loyalty/Engagement
   
   We want to meet our brand awareness goal by engaging at least 5% of California registered voters, which equals approximately 890,000 people, mostly in the Los Angeles region. 
   
   Metric Goals
   Web: 50k monthly unique visits
   Social Media/Emails: 50k+ Database
   Video Impressions: 1M+ video impressions
   Widgets Distributed: 50+
   Widget Impressions: 500k+
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  A few providers exist that communicate nonpartisan information about ballot
  proposition. They are competitors in the sense that they provide information.
  However, the websites rely mostly on text to get their messages across and
  prove to be dull user experience platforms. Then there are of course highly
  biased political advertisements which air ad nauseam for months leading to
  Election Day.
   
   First and foremost, it is the CA Secretary of State and LA County Clerks responsibly to gather and disseminate “Voter Guides” to every registered voter. Most are familiar with the drab grey volumes of voter information that gets delivered to the mailbox a month before Election Day. This guide is chock full of information but requires hours of studying to decipher the legalese. Ballotpedia.org provides well-balanced information regarding each ballot proposition, but all the information is text-heavy. The League of Women Voters has been the gold standard for providing unbiased information to voters for nearly a century. Not only is the League’s work complimentary to our own, but also their board of directors voted unanimously to partner with SeePolitical.
   
   SeePolitical’s advantages include:
   1. Technology - the depth of technologies custom built, specifically the capabilities of our social media search and analytics technologies far exceed anything remotely close to being available to competitors. We are also on the cutting edge of application and mobile development to be able to reach our consumers at any touch point. Our technologies are proven and earn us a significant competitive advantage while creating an initial barrier to entry for future competition.
   2. Design - the design of our content clusters allows users to easily interact with valuable content whether on their desktop, mobile phone or Facebook. 
   3. Function - our content clusters operate as independent tools, but give the ability to create profiles and socially interact with other users. Watch>Choose>Vote...hang out and learn from others.
   4. Not to brag, but we produce some of the best looking animations available.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  We are in confidential discussions with three major universities located in
  Los Angeles to establish the first SeePolitical Institute on one of their
  campuses. Although we can't disclose the names of each school at this time to
  the public via this application form, we would be happy to explain directly to
  the Goldhirsh Foundation over the phone or in person.
   
   SeePolitical has been teaching a college course at the Otis College of Art and Design for the past two years and has created a model that has proven extremely successful:
   
   - It's a huge win for SeePolitical to be associated with a fine academic institutions and makes it easier for us to attract additional funding from major sponsors. 
   
   - The school benefits by offering an innovative service that combines academic research and analysis with beautiful content production...usually a difficult combination to forge, but not for us. 
   
   -And of course, the general public greatly benefits by finally having reliable access to information that will bolster interest about what's on the ballot, and help voters make educated decisions on Election Day. Not to mention how many high school social studies teachers use our content. 
   
   The entire $100,000 grant award would go to SeePolitical to help support the initial establishment of the first SeePolitical Institute.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  It will cost approximately $250,000 to establish a SeePolitical Institute at
  one of these colleges/universities. The additional costs have already been
  pledged by individuals in Los Angeles, and the schools themselves.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
  SeePolitical is a Los Angeles based nonprofit organization with big dreams to
  eventually provide clarity of the electoral process for the rest of the
  nation. However, we understand that we need to walk before we can run. This
  initial $100,000 will allow the SeePolitical Institute to build capacity by
  hiring staff and remaining funds will be used to promote and market it's
  educational content for public consumption. 
   
   The genius of this model is that since the voter education content is continually produced by students for class credit, the usually absorbent costs for research and production for each animation is eliminated.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Establishing the first SeePolitical Institute in Los Angeles is just the
  beginning. We are creating a model for other states to adopt our program to
  provide nonpartisan information on state and local issues and elections. 
   
   SeePolitical will establish similar relationships with universities in all 50 states, by which their students enter our program or fellowship to research and explain the issues confronting their states' voters. 
   
   A gift from the Goldhirsh Foundation this year will establish a reputation for improving civic literacy across the city, state and soon the nation!

    answer: "SeePolitical is an interactive website, widget and mobile app providing objective, easily understood information about ballot propositions for all Angelenos. \r\n\r\nTrying to understand the complex language found on most ballots is frustrating and often results in uninformed voters approving unintended consequences. \r\n\r\nIn the case for our region, most voters are not even participating. This year's primary turned out an alarmingly record-low voter turnout in Los Angeles, less than 9% of voters showed up. This is totally unacceptable. \r\n\r\nSeePolitical breaks the mold by offering unbiased entertaining educational content that informs and empowers voters in English, Spanish and if able to partner with the Goldhirsh Foundation we can expand our explainers to every major spoken language.

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "One challenge this year will be convincing voters and likely voters that their vote counts and a better option is available to learn about what's on their ballot.  \r\n\r\nLos Angeles already experienced record low voter turnout for the past two years indicating a lack of enthusiasm and interest in our elections.  Voting is not a priority for many people in our city – we believe this is because the information is not being communicated in an interesting format people in LA have come to expect. It will be challenging to overcome the voter apathy experienced by millions of Angelenos, however, we believe it is a challenge worth facing considering the long-term dire consequences of a disinterested voting population. \r\n\r\nWe aim to address this serious challenge by partnering with past media partners like ABC, Univision, LA Times, NPR, and Twitter as well as organizations such as the League of Women Voters, California Common Cause, Rock the Vote and Head Count to distribute our content."
  - name: Please explain how you will evaluate your work.

    answer: "For the first time ever underserved voters will be able to: Quickly and easily understand ballot propositions that affect them; easily record thoughts on ballot propositions and establish reminders for specific voting dates; quickly share thoughts with friends in Los Angeles and other interested parties through established social networks.\r\n\r\nHow We Measure Success:\r\n➢\tBuild Relationships Through Digital/Social:\r\n•\tAttract -> Convert -> Support -> Extend\r\n➢\tMeasure Effectiveness of Campaign through Impressions -> Leads -> Conversions -> Loyalty/Engagement\r\n\r\nWe want to meet our brand awareness goal by engaging at least 5% of California registered voters, which equals approximately 890,000 people, mostly in the Los Angeles region. \r\n\r\nMetric Goals\r\nWeb: \t50k monthly unique visits\r\nSocial Media/Emails:\t 50k+ Database\r\nVideo Impressions:\t1M+ video impressions\r\nWidgets Distributed:\t50+\r\nWidget Impressions:\t500k+\r\n"

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "A few providers exist that communicate nonpartisan information about ballot proposition. They are competitors in the sense that they provide information. However, the websites rely mostly on text to get their messages across and prove to be dull user experience platforms. Then there are of course highly biased political advertisements which air ad nauseam for months leading to Election Day.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, it is the CA Secretary of State and LA County Clerks responsibly to gather and disseminate “Voter Guides” to every registered voter. Most are familiar with the drab grey volumes of voter information that gets delivered to the mailbox a month before Election Day.   This guide is chock full of information but requires hours of studying to decipher the legalese. Ballotpedia.org provides well-balanced information regarding each ballot proposition, but all the information is text-heavy.  The League of Women Voters has been the gold standard for providing unbiased information to voters for nearly a century. Not only is the League’s work complimentary to our own, but also their board of directors voted unanimously to partner with SeePolitical.\r\n\r\nSeePolitical’s advantages include:\r\n1.\tTechnology - the depth of technologies custom built, specifically the capabilities of our social media search and analytics technologies far exceed anything remotely close to being available to competitors. We are also on the cutting edge of application and mobile development to be able to reach our consumers at any touch point. Our technologies are proven and earn us a significant competitive advantage while creating an initial barrier to entry for future competition.\r\n2.\tDesign - the design of our content clusters allows users to easily interact with valuable content whether on their desktop, mobile phone or Facebook. \r\n3.\tFunction - our content clusters operate as independent tools, but give the ability to create profiles and socially interact with other users. Watch>Choose>Vote...hang out and learn from others.\r\n4. Not to brag, but we produce some of the best looking animations available. "

      Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on
      this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner
      receive?

    answer: "We are in confidential discussions with three major universities located in Los Angeles to establish the first SeePolitical Institute on one of their campuses. Although we can't disclose the names of each school at this time to the public via this application form, we would be happy to explain directly to the Goldhirsh Foundation over the phone or in person.\r\n\r\nSeePolitical has been teaching a college course at the Otis College of Art and Design for the past two years and has created a model that has proven extremely successful:\r\n\r\n- It's a huge win for SeePolitical to be associated with a fine academic institutions and makes it easier for us to attract additional funding from major sponsors.  \r\n\r\n- The school benefits by offering an innovative service that combines academic research and analysis with beautiful content production...usually a difficult combination to forge, but not for us. \r\n\r\n-And of course, the general public greatly benefits by finally having reliable access to information that will bolster interest about what's on the ballot, and help voters make educated decisions on Election Day. Not to mention how many high school social studies teachers use our content. \r\n\r\nThe entire $100,000 grant award would go to SeePolitical to help support the initial establishment of the first SeePolitical Institute. \r\n"

      How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you
      cover the additional costs?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      It will cost approximately $250,000 to establish a SeePolitical Institute
      at one of these colleges/universities. The additional costs have already
      been pledged by individuals in Los Angeles, and the schools themselves. 
  - name: >-
      Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement
      this project.
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "SeePolitical is a Los Angeles based nonprofit organization with big dreams to eventually provide clarity of the electoral process for the rest of the nation. However, we understand that we need to walk before we can run. This initial $100,000 will allow the SeePolitical Institute to build capacity by hiring staff and remaining funds will be used to promote and market it's educational content for public consumption. \r\n\r\nThe genius of this model is that since the voter education content is continually produced by students for class credit, the usually absorbent costs for research and production for each animation is eliminated.
