  'DESCRIBE IN GREATER DETAIL HOW YOU WILL MAKE LA THE HEALTHIEST PLACE TO LIVE: ': "The word ‘health’ comprises various components of well-being—a major one being psychological well-being. For LA to be the healthiest place to live, its residents must have healthy minds. We believe that barriers to achieving optimal mental health in LA include stigma, discrimination, a lack of resources and legislative failure, which are largely perpetuated by indifference and ignorance. All of Us seeks to use dialogue to encourage the community to prioritize mental health and understand its entwined relationship with physical well-being.\r\nThe Conference organized by All of Us will attempt to attack the stigma surrounding mental health and educate individuals about the resources available to combat mental health issues by hosting workshops, providing opportunities to interact with representatives of mental health resources and inspirational keynote speakers, and offering a platform to voice one’s opinions and challenge one’s own beliefs. We hope to empower individuals from diverse educational, private and religious institutions to support their family and friends in dealing with mental health problems, and wish to see the effects suffuse into the society.\r\nMental health issues and psychological disorders are often characterized by biological underpinnings as well as physical and social manifestations that people are generally unaware of. More importantly, there is a distinguishable discrepancy between the clinical and social realities of mental illnesses, resulting in a multitude of myths, false beliefs and preconceived notions. All of Us aims to bridge this gap via education, advocacy and awareness, and therefore, to an extent, break the stigma.   \r\nMental health is a complex, neglected and scorned issue.The objective of All of Us Conference is to address this multifaceted issue through participating minds that are willing and progressive. Sustaining a city of mentally healthy citizens requires a concerted citywide effort that our campaign seeks to promote and accomplish.\r\n"

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "Our lives, especially in educational and professional domains, have increasingly become synonymous with stress, anxiety, eating disorders, body-image issues and disrupted sleeping patterns. This, at an obvious level, has engendered a tendency to normalize and trivialize mental health issues, which is often reflected in phrases such as “snap out of it”, “it is just a phase” and “get over it”.  All of Us believes that these mental health problems signal an impending mental health crisis, and encourages people to seek help, regardless of society’s assessment of their mental health status. \r\n\r\nMental health is exceedingly intricate and subjective in nature, and does not always restrict itself to an objective scale for comparison. Mental health awareness, promoted by All of Us, includes educating the people of Los Angles about the numerous complexities and markers of mental illnesses, making it easier to identify mental health triggers and concerns."
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "We will determine the success of our project through the community’s increase in contact with mental health representatives introduced at the Conference. We will also analyze available usage data from counseling and psychological service centers to determine an increase in utilization of counseling and psychological services. This, coupled with an increase in traffic on our website, should help us evaluate the success of our Conference to a large extent.\r\n"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "Other organizations doing similar work include NAMI at the national level, and ‘Active Minds’ at UCLA and the ‘Mental Health Initiative’ at UCLA, at the local level.\r\nWe're unique since we're taking a proactive approach to outreach, by engaging the work that existing mental health organizations are doing with underprivileged communities. By establishing liaisons and asking these communities to establish a safe space at the conference, we are directly encouraging these communities to begin the dialogue of mental health in their spaces. Furthermore, we are focused on statewide advocacy as well, pushing for funding towards wellness programs and critical care services for our Counseling and Psychological Services at UCLA, as well as other mental health spaces across LA.\r\n\r\n"
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "Our main partners for this campaign include the USAC Office of the President, the Student Wellness Commission (SWC), and Active Minds at UCLA.  We will also be collaborating with UCLA CAPS (Counseling and Psychological Services), the multidisciplinary student mental health center on the UCLA campus, to ensure that all of our messaging and programming is accurate and sensitive of the parties we hope to target with our campaign.  CAPS will train all campaign members in topics pertaining to mental health through Question, Persuade, Refer (QPR) Suicide Prevention Training and Mental Health First Aid training.\r\n \r\nThe USAC Office of the President is responsible for presiding over the Student Body Council and provides services and resources for the UCLA student body through advocacy, education, and programming.  The All of Us campaign was founded by USAC so they are extremely committed to the success of the campaign.  They will provide AOU any support necessary in terms of networking, publicity, and establishing credibility.\r\n \r\nThe SWC at UCLA affirms that student well-being goes hand-in-hand with both physical and psychological health as well as academic success and well-roundedness.  SWC promotes the holistic well-being of the student body through weekly programming of CPR classes, health symposiums, and philanthropic and community service events such as blood drives and Run/Walk at UCLA.  \r\n \r\nActive Minds UCLA Chapter is the student voice for mental health advocacy on campus.  The group provides information on resources for those that suffer from mental health issues and for those who support others who suffer.  Active Minds hold workshops and events on the UCLA campus as well as programs at local elementary schools and community centers.\r\n \r\nThree factors critical to the success of collaboration are (1) we can efficiently create a structure to delegate and accomplish tasks in the most efficient manner possible with our staff of over 100 people (2) we have access to mental health professionals as a resource throughout the creation and execution of the campaign (3)  the SWC’s experience in leading the successful campaign 7000 in Solidarity is vital to the programming for All of Us.  All of the organizations above will collaborate and support All of Us, but the core directors and staff of AOU will be in charge of the funds to facilitate the efficient and effective execution of the All of Us conference and programs.\r\n"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "We will use the success of our conference to recruit more volunteers, partner with more organizations with similar objectives, to expand our 2016 conference, our campaign, and the space for dialogue that we hope to create. The bigger the space, the greater the dialogue, and the greater the dialogue, the greater will be the awareness. Hence, when it comes to the scale of our Conference, the sky is the limit.\r\nWe will build and sustain a robust communication effort around our conference through direct marketing (at UCLA), social media and our newsletters, to keep participants engaged in our work, as well as to reach out to as many people as possible. We intend to use pictures, videos and anecdotes from our conference and the rest of our campaign endeavors to display the kind of work that we do throughout the year, and we expect a large increase in our ‘following’ on our Facebook page, Instagram, email lists and twitter this year, helping us to reach out to a larger audience.\r\nThe success of our 2015 Conference will also help us expand our network of contacts that we can use for inviting keynote speakers, conducting workshops and collaborating with experienced organizations in 2016. This in turn will allow us to conduct larger conferences with better resources in the years forward.\r\n"
