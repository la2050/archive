Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "Plug In provides opportunities for youth, city stakeholders, executives, startups, and entrepreneurs to play a role in South LA’s transformation into a tech hub. Our programming brings together the brightest, most successful, and socially motivated entrepreneurs and business executives. The connections forged through our programming benefit fledgling startups in the area. We facilitate collaboration that can generate new startups in South LA, inspiring a new generation of entrepreneurs in South Los Angeles and making Los Angeles a stronger city overall. \r\n\r\nSouth LA is at the physical edge of intense digital media, tech, and entrepreneurial activity. There are about 1,700 startups and digital media-focused companies within a four-mile radius just outside of — but not in — South LA. Same with dozens of incubators, accelerators, and co-working spaces. Our area remains a tech desert. Our neighborhood didn’t make the top 10 highest funded startup neighborhoods list recently compiled by the online startup community Built in LA. Plug In will change this by infusing South LA with the programming and infrastructure needed to transform it into a viable place for startups. Our Digital and Beyond in LA series provides community education and awareness about the rapidly changing local economy within STEM sectors in the greater Los Angeles area, bringing water to the tech desert. \r\n"
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We will measure the growth and progress of our member companies, including
  startups, as they scale up. One metric is how many internship opportunities
  they develop for local youth. Plug In South LA also has the ability to track
  the total number of local companies launching, local companies moving into the
  next round of funding as well as the number of local youth and residents
  pursuing opportunities in tech and digital media sectors. In addition, we can
  also evaluate our work through attendance at events hosted by the co-working
  space.

  - Volunteers/staff (human capital)
  - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
  - 'Infrastructure (building/space/vehicles, etc.)'
  - Education/training
  - 'Technical infrastructure (computers, etc.)'
  - Community outreach
  - Network/relationship support
  - Quality improvement research
