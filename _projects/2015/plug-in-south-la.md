  Plug In South LA seeks to create a tech hub and co-working space in South LA.
  Our programming brings social capital to the heart of South LA, attracting
  thought leaders and visionaries from around the city and country. We create
  conversations that drive collaboration, partnership, and commerce at the local
  level. This activity is crucial for the youth in South LA. They will shape the
  future of technology and digital media, and the more opportunities they see,
  the more our local community will th

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Plug In provides opportunities for youth, city stakeholders, executives,
  startups, and entrepreneurs to play a role in South LA’s transformation into a
  tech hub. Our programming brings together the brightest, most successful, and
  socially motivated entrepreneurs and business executives. The connections
  forged through our programming benefit fledgling startups in the area. We
  facilitate collaboration that can generate new startups in South LA, inspiring
  a new generation of entrepreneurs in South Los Angeles and making Los Angeles
  a stronger city overall. 
   
   South LA is at the physical edge of intense digital media, tech, and entrepreneurial activity. There are about 1,700 startups and digital media-focused companies within a four-mile radius just outside of — but not in — South LA. Same with dozens of incubators, accelerators, and co-working spaces. Our area remains a tech desert. Our neighborhood didn’t make the top 10 highest funded startup neighborhoods list recently compiled by the online startup community Built in LA. Plug In will change this by infusing South LA with the programming and infrastructure needed to transform it into a viable place for startups. Our Digital and Beyond in LA series provides community education and awareness about the rapidly changing local economy within STEM sectors in the greater Los Angeles area, bringing water to the tech desert.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  There is still a psychological barrier toward South LA as it is one of the
  most stigmatized areas in Los Angeles. We see our programming as an
  opportunity to change this and as a way to spark a new interest in tech and
  digital media among local youth. 
   
   One major challenge is attracting more leaders from outside of South LA to come here in order to demonstrate that South LA is a place where new ideas can be born. We are confident that this challenge is surmountable. Plug In South LA gives the country’s top innovators a compelling reason to be part of South LA’s transformation. It’s an opportunity to help us create an entirely new vibrant ecosystem through a pay it forward approach in mentoring and inspiring local youth to pursue entrepreneurship and careers in tech and digital media. .
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We will measure the growth and progress of our member companies, including
  startups, as they scale up. One metric is how many internship opportunities
  they develop for local youth. Plug In South LA also has the ability to track
  the total number of local companies launching, local companies moving into the
  next round of funding as well as the number of local youth and residents
  pursuing opportunities in tech and digital media sectors. In addition, we can
  also evaluate our work through attendance at events hosted by the co-working
  space.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There are many co-working spaces, accelerators, and incubators in Los Angeles
  County, but we are the first planned for South LA. We are also unique because
  social entrepreneurship is part of our mission. Although Plug In South LA is a
  for-profit organization, we seek to have a positive impact the local community
  by stimulating economic activity that transforms the area. In addition to
  bringing tech and digital media to an underserved part of Los Angeles, Plug In
  South LA will facilitate mentorship for local students and youth organizations
  such as the Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Our partners are Verizon, General Assembly, LA Tech Digest, the Network for
  Teaching Entrepreneurship in Los Angeles, and the University of Southern
  California but the entire grant would go directly into Plug In South LA.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': |-
  We are estimating a total cost of around $350,000. We will cover the 
   additional costs through investors, memberships, sponsors, and 
   corporate partners.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
  Operating manager at $78,000/year: Having an experienced, energetic operating
  manager is essential to meet the programming needs of South LA-based startups
  on a daily basis. This person ensures connectivity and engagement among Plug
  In South LA’s entrepreneurs, mentors, advisors, and the local community.
   
   Administrative assistant at $20/hour: An administrative assistant will be necessary for managing day-to-day communications and operational tasks related to programming and the needs of Plug In South LA’s member entrepreneurs.
   
   Marketing at $5,000: Primary marketing costs cover SEO as well as third party contractors or vendors to assist with marketing strategy across social and mobile media, driving awareness and engagement around our programming and mission to create a tech hub in South LA.
   
   Other expenses beyond grant to be covered with additional funding: Conferences, Transportation and travel-related expenses, Utilities, Technology Licenses, Insurance, Capital expenditures
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Plug In South LA anticipates growing the number of attendees and program
  participants by 20-30% in our second year by increasing our partnerships with
  surrounding educational institutions as well as expanding our professional
  network and sphere of influence by inviting successful executives, venture
  capitalists and angel investors to speak at events. In addition, we plan to
  diversify our programing beyond tech and digital media to include areas such
  as financial literacy within an entrepreneurial context. Scaling up
  successfully for us also means offering workshops and events in more South LA
  neighborhoods such as Inglewood, Compton, Huntington Park, and South Gate. 
   
   Plug In South LA will catalyze the growth of its member companies and startups with its mentorship program and connections to venture capital. As Plug In South LA members become successful and hire more employees they will move out to larger dedicated office spaces in the surrounding community increasing economic activity. After proving to be a successful business model for generating and growing businesses Plug In will seek to open more co-working locations branching out to the South and East.
