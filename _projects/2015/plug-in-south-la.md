  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "Plug In provides opportunities for youth, city stakeholders, executives, startups, and entrepreneurs to play a role in South LA’s transformation into a tech hub. Our programming brings together the brightest, most successful, and socially motivated entrepreneurs and business executives. The connections forged through our programming benefit fledgling startups in the area. We facilitate collaboration that can generate new startups in South LA, inspiring a new generation of entrepreneurs in South Los Angeles and making Los Angeles a stronger city overall. \r\n\r\nSouth LA is at the physical edge of intense digital media, tech, and entrepreneurial activity. There are about 1,700 startups and digital media-focused companies within a four-mile radius just outside of — but not in — South LA. Same with dozens of incubators, accelerators, and co-working spaces. Our area remains a tech desert. Our neighborhood didn’t make the top 10 highest funded startup neighborhoods list recently compiled by the online startup community Built in LA. Plug In will change this by infusing South LA with the programming and infrastructure needed to transform it into a viable place for startups. Our Digital and Beyond in LA series provides community education and awareness about the rapidly changing local economy within STEM sectors in the greater Los Angeles area, bringing water to the tech desert. \r\n"

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "There is still a psychological barrier toward South LA as it is one of the most stigmatized areas in Los Angeles. We see our programming as an opportunity to change this and as a way to spark a new interest in tech and digital media among local youth. \r\n\r\nOne major challenge is attracting more leaders from outside of South LA to come here in order to demonstrate that South LA is a place where new ideas can be born. We are confident that this challenge is surmountable. Plug In South LA gives the country’s top innovators a compelling reason to be part of South LA’s transformation. It’s an opportunity to help us create an entirely new vibrant ecosystem through a pay it forward approach in mentoring and inspiring local youth to pursue entrepreneurship and careers in tech and digital media. . \r\n"
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    We will measure the growth and progress of our member companies, including
    startups, as they scale up. One metric is how many internship opportunities
    they develop for local youth. Plug In South LA also has the ability to track
    the total number of local companies launching, local companies moving into
    the next round of funding as well as the number of local youth and residents
    pursuing opportunities in tech and digital media sectors. In addition, we
    can also evaluate our work through attendance at events hosted by the
    co-working space. 
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    There are many co-working spaces, accelerators, and incubators in Los
    Angeles County, but we are the first planned for South LA. We are also
    unique because social entrepreneurship is part of our mission. Although Plug
    In South LA is a for-profit organization, we seek to have a positive impact
    the local community by stimulating economic activity that transforms the
    area. In addition to bringing tech and digital media to an underserved part
    of Los Angeles, Plug In South LA will facilitate mentorship for local
    students and youth organizations such as the Network for Teaching
    Entrepreneurship.
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    Our partners are Verizon, General Assembly, LA Tech Digest, the Network for
    Teaching Entrepreneurship in Los Angeles, and the University of Southern
    California but the entire grant would go directly into Plug In South LA.
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': "We are estimating a total cost of around $350,000. We will cover the \r\nadditional costs through investors, memberships, sponsors, and \r\ncorporate partners."
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Operating manager at $78,000/year: Having an experienced, energetic operating manager is essential to meet the programming needs of South LA-based startups on a daily basis. This person ensures connectivity and engagement among Plug In South LA’s entrepreneurs, mentors, advisors, and the local community.\r\n\r\nAdministrative assistant at $20/hour: An administrative assistant will be necessary for managing day-to-day communications and operational tasks related to programming and the needs of Plug In South LA’s member entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nMarketing at $5,000: Primary marketing costs cover SEO as well as third party contractors or vendors to assist with marketing strategy across social and mobile media, driving awareness and engagement around our programming and mission to create a tech hub in South LA.\r\n\r\nOther expenses beyond grant to be covered with additional funding: Conferences, Transportation and travel-related expenses, Utilities, Technology Licenses, Insurance, Capital expenditures"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "Plug In South LA anticipates growing the number of attendees and program participants by 20-30% in our second year by increasing our partnerships with surrounding educational institutions as well as expanding our professional network and sphere of influence by inviting successful executives, venture capitalists and angel investors to speak at events. In addition, we plan to diversify our programing beyond tech and digital media to include areas such as financial literacy within an entrepreneurial context. Scaling up successfully for us also means offering workshops and events in more South LA neighborhoods such as Inglewood, Compton, Huntington Park, and South Gate. \r\n\r\nPlug In South LA will catalyze the growth of its member companies and startups with its mentorship program and connections to venture capital. As Plug In South LA members become successful and hire more employees they will move out to larger dedicated office spaces in the surrounding community increasing economic activity. After proving to be a successful business model for generating and growing businesses Plug In will seek to open more co-working locations branching out to the South and East. \r\n"
