Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "Glendora believes that volunteering plays a great role in creating a tight knit and socially aware community.  Volunteering is a great way to meet new people, learn a new skill, help others, and relieve physical and mental stress.  It is said that those who volunteer have a higher change of finding a job after being out of work than those who do not volunteer and that those who volunteer are more likely to participate in other civic engagements.  Volunteering also leaves a positive impression on our youth as it is said that those who volunteer in their youth are twice as likely to volunteer later in life as adults. \r\nGlendora has orchestrated many volunteering opportunities such as our Adopt-A-Park program that allows groups or individuals to clean up a park, donate a needed amenity such as a bench or drinking fountain, or even plant a tree.  We have also orchestrated a community build day through a grant from Kaboom! that brought hundreds of community members together to complete the construction of a new playground for our Gladstone Park.  \r\nIn addition to these opportunities, the City also works with the local Trails Volunteers to organize Trails Days where boy scouts, girl scouts and other community members come out to clean up the trails within our wilderness areas.  \r\nThe City's Parks Division has always done a great job in making sure that all of the tools for the job are available for each volunteering opportunity.  This often means that tools from their own day-to-day operations are provided for volunteers to use, however many times there are not enough to go around.  The City would like to be able to expand upon its current volunteer opportunities and in order to do so would like to purchase an enclosed trailer, fill it up with tools needed for volunteering and dedicate this trailer to the Volunteer Glendora! program.  The City would like to market this trailer as an easy all in one accessible option for volunteer groups, such as scout troops and other community organizations.  With this program we hope to really push our community to volunteer more, which we believe will create lasting connections between people as well as connections to nature within our wilderness areas and Glendora's rich culture.\r\n\r\nThis program will also coincide with our Healthy Glendora Program, which promotes healthy lifestyles, both mentally and physically.  We believe in the connection between nature and health is extremely important.   \r\n       \r\n \r\n"
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  The City will keep track of how many groups or individuals reserve and utilize
  the mobile tool shed and what type of work they intend to complete with the
  use of the tool shed.  We hope to increase the amount of volunteering requests
  by providing a ready to go trailer with all of the essentials.  We will use
  our social media platforms to market the program to our community and will
  keep track of how groups hear about the mobile tool shed to make sure that our
  media outlets are reaching our target audience. 
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
  - Money (financial capital)
  - Volunteers/staff (human capital)
  - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
  - Community outreach
