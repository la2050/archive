  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "Glendora believes that volunteering plays a great role in creating a tight knit and socially aware community.  Volunteering is a great way to meet new people, learn a new skill, help others, and relieve physical and mental stress.  It is said that those who volunteer have a higher change of finding a job after being out of work than those who do not volunteer and that those who volunteer are more likely to participate in other civic engagements.  Volunteering also leaves a positive impression on our youth as it is said that those who volunteer in their youth are twice as likely to volunteer later in life as adults. \r\nGlendora has orchestrated many volunteering opportunities such as our Adopt-A-Park program that allows groups or individuals to clean up a park, donate a needed amenity such as a bench or drinking fountain, or even plant a tree.  We have also orchestrated a community build day through a grant from Kaboom! that brought hundreds of community members together to complete the construction of a new playground for our Gladstone Park.  \r\nIn addition to these opportunities, the City also works with the local Trails Volunteers to organize Trails Days where boy scouts, girl scouts and other community members come out to clean up the trails within our wilderness areas.  \r\nThe City's Parks Division has always done a great job in making sure that all of the tools for the job are available for each volunteering opportunity.  This often means that tools from their own day-to-day operations are provided for volunteers to use, however many times there are not enough to go around.  The City would like to be able to expand upon its current volunteer opportunities and in order to do so would like to purchase an enclosed trailer, fill it up with tools needed for volunteering and dedicate this trailer to the Volunteer Glendora! program.  The City would like to market this trailer as an easy all in one accessible option for volunteer groups, such as scout troops and other community organizations.  With this program we hope to really push our community to volunteer more, which we believe will create lasting connections between people as well as connections to nature within our wilderness areas and Glendora's rich culture.\r\n\r\nThis program will also coincide with our Healthy Glendora Program, which promotes healthy lifestyles, both mentally and physically.

  Glendora believes that volunteering plays a great role in creating a tight
  knit and socially aware community. Volunteering is a great way to meet new
  people, learn a new skill, help others, and relieve physical and mental
  stress. It is said that those who volunteer have a higher change of finding a
  job after being out of work than those who do not volunteer and that those who
  volunteer are more likely to participate in other civic engagements.
  Volunteering also leaves a positive impression on our youth as it is said that
  those who volunteer in their youth are twice as likely to volunteer later in
  life as adults. 
   Glendora has orchestrated many volunteering opportunities such as our Adopt-A-Park program that allows groups or individuals to clean up a park, donate a needed amenity such as a bench or drinking fountain, or even plant a tree. We have also orchestrated a community build day through a grant from Kaboom! that brought hundreds of community members together to complete the construction of a new playground for our Gladstone Park. 
   In addition to these opportunities, the City also works with the local Trails Volunteers to organize Trails Days where boy scouts, girl scouts and other community members come out to clean up the trails within our wilderness areas. 
   The City's Parks Division has always done a great job in making sure that all of the tools for the job are available for each volunteering opportunity. This often means that tools from their own day-to-day operations are provided for volunteers to use, however many times there are not enough to go around.

   This program will also coincide with our Healthy Glendora Program, which promotes healthy lifestyles, both mentally and physically. We believe in the connection between nature and health is extremely important.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  One of our anticipated challenges will be to create a policy that dictates how
  the mobile tool trailer will be used within the community. Policies such as
  who utilizes the mobile tool trailer, where they can use it and for how long
  they can use it will be carefully considered to make sure that our program is
  as effective as possible. Another challenge is getting the word out that the
  trailer is available for use. To overcome this obstacle we will work with our
  social team to develop a positive eye catching campaign that reaches all ages
  within our community.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  The City will keep track of how many groups or individuals reserve and utilize
  the mobile tool shed and what type of work they intend to complete with the
  use of the tool shed. We hope to increase the amount of volunteering requests
  by providing a ready to go trailer with all of the essentials. We will use our
  social media platforms to market the program to our community and will keep
  track of how groups hear about the mobile tool shed to make sure that our
  media outlets are reaching our target audience.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  The Trails Volunteers currently have a small shed with small tools in it. It
  is not portable and contains a minimal amount of equipment. This mobile tool
  trailer would complement their volunteer efforts and actually help them to do
  additional work. 
   
   We believe this program is unique in that it will provide both the tools and a visual component to encourage our volunteers to enjoy their experience. By supplying all the tools necessary in a mobile trailer wrapped with positive images and designs we remove the difficulty of brining supplies to the day of event and create a fun atmosphere.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  At this time, the City will be the primary entity working on this project. The
  Glendora Trail Volunteers will be working closely with the City, but will not
  receive any direct funds.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  The initial purchase of the mobile trailer and marketing campaign will kick
  start the program. We will have the trailer at all our Special Events.
  Marketing funds will be used to prolong social outreach. The mobile trailer
  can be parked at strategic locations to encourage volunteerism. This will
  ensure that not only our community but to others outside of community who may
  want to participate.
