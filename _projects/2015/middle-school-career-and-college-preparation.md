  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "Career & College Clubs empowers middle school students to take charge of their success in high school, college, and life. The program uses a peer-to-peer learning model to create a schoolwide college and career success culture.  An evaluation by ACT, Inc. found that the odds of enrolling in college at 85% higher for Career & College Clubs students, than for a comparison group. \r\n\r\nWhile there are many college and career readiness programs for high school students, there are very few of these programs for the middle school years, a pivotal time in the development of student behaviors, attitudes, and work habits; and there are even fewer programs that address the total child as does Career & College Clubs – providing the content, resources, and support system needed for the development of both academic and social-emotional skills (including communication, collaboration, critical thinking, and creative innovation), so students at an earlier age have the knowledge, tools, motivation, aspiration, confidence, and drive to stay engaged in the learning process, enthusiastically plan for their future, and promote a college-going culture among peers schoolwide. \r\n\r\nSince 2008, Career & College Clubs has empowered more than 50,000 middle school students, including 91% of participants from racial/ethnic minorities, 71% Hispanic, and more than 60% of their parents having no postsecondary education. The program was recently recognized by the White House as a \"Bright Spot\" in Hispanic education. \r\n\r\nWe have 30 school sites in LA County, including 22 in LAUSD. \r\n\r\nIf approved, this proposal will allow us to expand to 20 more sites.   \r\nWe will focus the expansion on sites that have a high percentage of at-risk students, as measured by the % of students eligible for Free and Reduced Price Meals. We will recruit, train, and support these sites over the next three academic years as they engage int he materials and help their students achieve their dreams. \r\n\r\nOur first outreach will be to LA County school sites who have expressed interest int he program, but who are unable to share in the program's costs. There are well more than 20 of such sites. "

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "The single biggest challenge for the program is 'competing' with the myriad other initiatives, programs, directives, etc. that vie for educators' time. \r\n\r\nIn sum, working is a public school is incredibly difficult...even for the most gifted and dedicated educators. While the will is there, they often do not have the time or energy to implement Career & College Clubs. \r\n\r\nWe overcome this challenge by making the program as easy as possible to implement (2-3 hours per week for 1 teacher or counselor) and providing instant support for them when problems arise (and they always do).\r\n\r\nAlso, extending the implementation period for three years allows the sites to ease-in to the program. We've found that the first year is always rocky, the second year is when they start to feel confident, and by the third year most sites have made the program their own. "
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "We ask every student int he program to complete pre- and post- surveys designed to measure attitudinal and behavioral growth.\r\n\r\nWe also have an ongoing partnership with ACT, Inc. to measure the long-term impact of the program. ACT looks at student outcomes in high school, college enrollment and, eventually, college completion. So far, they found that Career & College Clubs has exactly the kind of impact we had hoped - more students are thinking about their futures, making plans for, and actually enrolling in, postsecondary education."
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "There are no organizations doing the same work - career and college preparation, in middle school, using peer-to-peer learning. \r\n\r\nCareer & College Clubs does compliment many other efforts - AVID, GEARUP, Linked Learning, etc., and we find our sites often implement them jointly"
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "We will first identify 40-50 target schools in LA County, based on their FRPM percentage. Starting with schools who have already indicated an interest in Career & College Clubs, we will then approach to let them know of the opportunity provided by LA2050.  If they agree to sign on, we will begin the process of training their staff and getting the program established. \r\n\r\nOther than fees to Career & College Clubs (which this grant would cover), the program is inexpensive for schools. Their costs are minimal."
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': "Total cost to ALL Management Corporation for adding 20 sites is approximately $420,000.  The additional costs will be born by ALL Management Corporation, using revenue derived from other education-related activities.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to have 200 sites, total, by 2019-20. ALL Management has committed the financial and human resources to achieve the goal. "
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Program fees for 20 schools for 2016-17:  $60,000\r\nProgram fees for same schools for 2017-18: $20,000\r\nProgram fees for same schools for 2018-19: $20,000\r\nTotal budget:  $100,000 or an average of $1,667 per school / per year. "
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    We continue to grow the program, with new sites added almost weekly. Those
    efforts will continue, the grant from LA2050 will accelerate that process
    and, most importantly, make the program available to LA County sites who
    want it but are unable to afford even $1,667 per year in fees.
