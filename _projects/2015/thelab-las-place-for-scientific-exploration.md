  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "TheLab has a three part proposal.\r\n\r\n1. We need to increase our research and safety equipment. TheLab will offer more workbench spaces to accommodate more members and classes with a larger number of participants. We will install more equipment to make the lab more functional and safer. Our goal is an open laboratory space with multiple workbenches and a common area for group events and presentations.  \r\n\r\n2.  TheLab is actively involved in mentoring youth scientists. Cory Tobin has volunteered countless hours personally mentoring students. His success is undeniable. All of his students have won science fairs at their schools, won awards at the LA County Science Fairs, and won awards at the California State Science Fairs. One of his students was selected to be a participant in the Broadcom Masters and had the opportunity to meet President Obama to honor his successes. Two of his students participated in the iGEM competition impressing graduate and post graduate level scientists with their presentation and knowledge. The successes of these youth scientists are amazing and will propel these students into incredible opportunities.  \r\n\r\nTheLab needs to expand to have a permanent program for student scientists. Without more resources this will not be possible. TheLab will provide the opportunity for students in the LA area to have a safe and resourceful laboratory where they can learn from other students and experienced scientists to conduct professional research experiments. \r\n\r\n3. TheLab will offer classes on topics ranging from sophisticated research such as CRISPR to beginner level topics such as tree grafting. We will accept suggestions to create classes to meet the needs of our community. We believe that these classes are our best way to engage with the community. Many of our classes require no prerequisite knowledge allowing beginners to become familiar with laboratory equipment and proper research and safety protocol. With these skills they can advance to independent research or meet with other members to form research teams.\r\n\r\nIn order to accomplish parts 2 and 3 of our proposal we are asking for your help to fund part 1.\r\n\r\nBiotechnology is expanding at an incredible rate. We are experiencing a wave of new DIY biologists that are doing research comparable to that of professionals. Our community is excited to learn how the world works and be part of the science of the future. With your help we will be able to expand TheLab and open our doors to all of LA."

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "Currently our biggest challenge is finding funding.  With your help we will finally have the financial resources necessary to purchase new equipment and repair existing equipment to make our laboratory safer and more functional.  One challenge we will face is find good quality equipment at discounted prices.  With our established network of connections we will work diligently to stretch the money as far as possible to acquire the most resources.\r\n\r\nOnce we have these new resources in place they will accommodate more members, more student programs, and more classes. It will be a challenge to manage these expanded programs.  We will be faced with needing new class curricula as well as needing classes to educate our members about how to properly use our new equipment and how to work safely in our laboratory.  We will rely on volunteer hours from our experienced members to execute these classes."
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "TheLab will evaluate our progress by keeping detailed records of our participants in each of our programs.\r\n\r\n1. For the youth program we will track how many students are involved. The students’ success in the program will be evaluated by our experienced members and the students’ placements at the local and state science fairs.  When possible we will assist students in publishing their research in professional peer reviewed scientific journals.\r\n\r\n2. For our classes we will track participation and provide surveys after each class for our students to give feedback. We will use the participation numbers and the surveys to determine the classes that are working best and which need to be revamped.\r\n\r\n3. We will also have routine meetings with our members to discuss their individual research work and get updates on their progress. From this we will know how we can assist our members, possibly through acquiring necessary equipment or teaching classes on skills needed to continue their research."
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "TheLab was formed in 2011 and is still the only organization of our kind open to the community of Los Angeles.  Similar organizations exist in other areas: Biocurious in Sunnyvale, Genspace in Brooklyn, HiveBio in Seattle, BUGGS in Baltimore, and others around the world.  Southern California and particularly Los Angeles has seen a recent growth in startup incubators but these facilities only offer opportunities to biotech companies.\r\n\r\nTheLab is very unique in that it offers any person with any level of education the opportunity to get involved with science.  We pride ourselves in serving the community with a wide range of science opportunities without discriminating based on academic pedigree or age."

    Since its formation, TheLab has been sustaining itself solely through
    donations.  We believe that with this money we will be able to increase the
    resources of TheLab allowing it to raise more money through educational
    programs.  All of the money from the award will go to TheLab to reach our
    goal of building a bigger and better community laboratory.  We do not intend
    to distribute the money to any partners.

We do not plan to exceed the budget. The execution of parts 2 and 3 of our proposal is not critically dependent on the acquisition of all the equipment listed.  For example, it is necessary that we increase our workbench space to accommodate larger classes.  However it is not immediately necessary that we purchase additional microscopes.\r\n\r\nWe will prioritize purchasing safety equipment to guarantee that we have a safe work environment.  Beyond that, we will prioritize equipment purchases based on the number of students who will benefit.

  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "With the purchase of our new equipment our lab will have the opportunity to continuously grow.  Our classes will use the new equipment and generate income which can be reinvested into the lab to maintain this equipment and expand the lab further.\r\n\r\nInstead of asking for money to cover operational expenses we choose to invest in capital equipment that will add value to our organization for many years.  We believe this to be the most sustainable and responsible way to use the gifts of our benefactors.\r\n"
