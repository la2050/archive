title: Art of Acting Studio 1 Week Theatre Intensives for Incarcerated Citizens
project_summary: >-
  AOA is using theatre to transform lives of some of LA’s most challenged
  citizens. Through AOA’s Outreach Division we are serving incarcerated women in
  partnership with Five Keys Charter School and Twin Towers Correctional
  Facility and men in the Pitchess Juvenile Detention Center.  Our incarcerated
  students receive training in Voice and Speech, Movement and Acting Technique

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: "Art of Acting Studio (AOA) is taking down the barriers that prevent all of LA’s citizens from participating in the city’s robust arts community. AOA will deliver 12 one-week Theatre Project residencies for adult female students currently residing in the custody of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department (LASD) and for male High School Students in the Pitchess Detention Center. These programs will be delivered by  professional instructor and a team of Ambassadors, current students and alumni from the Art of Acting Studio.\r\n\r\nHow does this work on a day to day basis? Each class begins with a progression of physical exercises to stretch and tone the body; voice and speech exercises designed to open their voice, expand the breath and develop strength and clarity in speaking; learning and practicing acting technique through scene work and storytelling. In the class, students will find an opportunity to share their training experience and discoveries in an “open class” setting with invited guests.\r\n\r\nThrough this work, the studio fulfills its mission of bringing world class faculty and training to those who cannot afford it, while also providing our full time tuition based students with a model for social engagement. This partnership also presents a unique opportunity to serve the mission of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department (LASD) and Five Keys Charter Schools by encouraging these students to embrace new language and bold ideas. AOA aims to empower participants through the rigorous study of craft. The final “open class” environment provides a ritual for success for students as as well as a moment to reflect, to acknowledge and dream for all participants and stakeholders, as the students receive validation from the peers and the professionals they look to each and every day. \r\n\r\nWhen students are released from the facility, they are invited to participate in a free, monthly, theatre re-entry program at their new artistic home - THE ART OF ACTING STUDIO. AOA will continue to nurture the growth of students both in their art and human growth as they re-enter society.\r\n"

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "One barrier is funding. The studio’s work in jails has recently begun to receive national recognition and several funders have expressed interest in our programs. We are confidant that the full scope of our work can be funded within the coming year.\r\n\r\nAnother barrier is access to the facility and to inmates. However, Director of Outreach Tommy Demenkoff has a track record of proven success with these sensitive partnerships. We are confidant that we have the team, diplomacy and experience to continue to navigate the nuances of jails, prisons and detention centers with success.\r\n\r\nAnother potential barrier is simply the day-to-day realities of working with these populations: unexpected facility lock-downs, dangerous conditions, etc. all could potentially disrupt the work. This is something our team has come to anticipate and respond to with flexibility.\r\n"
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Based on previous program delivery, the studio recommends evaluation based on 1) attendance 2) participation (in theatre class, for example, did the student write and/or perform during the course of the session) and 3) participation in re-entry program. Student feedback in narrative form is an essential aspect of program evaluation as is feedback from each facility's staff including corrections officers, wardens and program staff.\r\n"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "On the local and national spectrum, AOA's approach is utterly unique. First, we work primarily in jails. The distinction between jails and prisons is key. Jail is where inmates are held either while they are waiting to be sentenced OR where they are held for a term less than 365 days. Therefore this population is highly transitory and therefore difficult to serve as participants are constantly entering and leaving a program mid-course. To serve this population effectively a service organization must be sensitive to the nuances of the population. This is a challenge that many organizations are not able to apply their work to. However, AOA’s theatre classes are designed with this in mind. The course is structured so that consistently attending students can build on skills from one session to the next and experience progress in the acquisition of craft while new students are able to jump in mid-term and make a meaningful contribution.\r\n \r\nFurthermore, the theatre curriculum is designed to pass forward and invite participation in a great American tradition (i.e. the tradition of the Yiddish Theater, Group Theater, and Stella Adler’s contribution to the American theater) WHILE AT THE SAME TIME inviting students to express what is important to them now by writing new short plays and monologues. The combination of actor training with writing helps to personalize the participant's experience. In other words, we share an excellent technique that is both world-class and professionally recognized AND then we invite participants to use the technique to write, tell and perform their own unique life experiences. This combination is unprecedented.\r\n \r\nWe take inspiration from Sabra Wiliams' work at the Actors’ Gang Prison Project which brings commedia dell'arte to California prisons. However, our approach is quite different. First, we work primarily in jails while Actors’ Gang works primarily in prisons. Prison is where inmates stay once they have been sentenced; this is therefore a less transitory population. Actors’ Gang work also focuses exclusively on training in the classical commedia dell'arte form, a highly physical technique that is often accessible across social strata with little background in theatre. We look to Actors’ Gang Prison program as an excellent model, but a model from which we differ significantly when viewed with understanding of program particulars. "
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "Five Keys Charter Schools\r\nLos Angeles County Sheriff’s Department (LASD)\r\n\r\nAOA has funded pilots of the work at both Twin Towers and Pitchess. Our partners will provide access and curriculum support to the population we serve, but neither organization will receive funding because AOA employs the instructor and handles all facets of the instructional process. "
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': "A One Year Residency to Serve 300+ Students \r\n12 1-Week Residencies \r\n\r\n\r\nTOTAL BUDGET  = $88,500.00\r\n"
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Professional Instructor (Planning, Prep, Teaching) $2,500 per week @ 12 Weeks =  $30,000 \r\n\r\nTravel/Instructors/Guest Artists $500 per week @ 12 Weeks = $6,000 \r\n\r\nAdministrative (Curriculum/Marketing/Assessment) $2,500 per week @ 12 Weeks  = $30,000 \r\n\r\nMaterials (Scripts, Costumes & Props) $75 per student @ 300 Students = $22,500\r\n\r\nTOTAL BUDGET  = $88,500.00"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "The studio is deeply committed to the continuation of this programming. it is an essential part of the Stella Adler Outreach Division’s service and a unique expression of the studio’s mission. \r\n\r\nSince launching our work in jails in March 2014 we have consistently expanded the population of inmates served. We began exclusively serving adolescents at Rikers Island Correctional Facility in New York City. Over the course of one year we expanded our service to include male and female adult populations including high security populations. We have also expanded geographically. First we branched out to serve multiple facilities at Rikers and in June 2015, based on the success of our previous work, we received an invitation to provide a program at Twin Towers in Los Angeles. The relationships required for the successful delivery of this kind of program are key; once we engage successfully with a partner we are committed to a long-term relationship. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, sustainability is an important part of delivering a program in jail successfully. First, students must see that you are there consistently in order for them to believe that you are truly invested in their growth and well-being. Establishing trust is vital to a jail service program. Second, sustainability is also important to measuring the success of the program. A minimum of a year-long presence in jail is ideal to obtain the necessary evaluation and data materials and to continue to define excellent work with our community partners. The more time we spend in a location the more accessible it becomes to potential stakeholders. In short, we are in this for the long haul!"
