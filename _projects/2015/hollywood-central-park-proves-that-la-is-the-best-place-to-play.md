  Our proposal is to hold a design competition for LA-based architects and
  landscape designers to create an iconic design for the Hollywood Central Park.
  The goal is to create a 38-acre urban park that caps the Hollywood Freeway,
  and serves diverse, dense and disadvantaged communities separated for more
  than 60 years by the freeway. It should be a park that could exist only in
  Hollywood and is intrinsic to Los Angeles. It must connect the surrounding
  communities through innovative design.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  There are many exciting ways the Hollywood Central Park will make the LA the
  best place to play. It will offer myriad recreational amenities like
  children’s playgrounds, baseball diamond, library, amphitheater,
  walking/running trails, and picnic areas. 
   
   Most importantly, it will improve the quality of life for more than 150,000 residents, including 30,000 children, who live within a one-mile radius of HCP. HCP is located in Council District 13, which has among the lowest resident to park space ratios in the state. While the City Charter requires 2 acres of open space per 1000 residents, Hollywood only has 0.02 acres of open space per 1000 residents. Beyond the recreational benefits, the Hollywood Central Park will boost the economy by creating more than 40,000 direct and indirect jobs, while the vastly increased green space and trees will help clean the air and promote a healthier urban living environment.
   
   With this one project, Los Angeles will address the economy, the environment, the health of its residents and their quality of life. As a leader in sustainable cities and livable communities, LA will, without a doubt, be the best place to play.
   
   The Park design will be key in achieving these objectives. The best design for the Hollywood Central Park will only be achieved by utilizing the uniquely qualified, creative, and visionary talents of local architects and landscape architects who genuinely understand the complexities of designing open space for a city of 465 square miles. Our LA 2050 proposal seeks to identify the best and brightest architectural minds in Los Angeles through a design competition to guarantee that LA is the best place to play.
   
   The HCP Design Competition has 3 phases. Phase 1 is a conceptual proposal clearly describing the park design and its relationship to Hollywood. Phase 2 is a full-scale design of a fully realized public space that meets HCP Design Guidelines. Phase 3 is a Citywide Exhibition Event for the top 5 proposals. To ensure a diversity of ideas and to level the playing field for emerging architects, designers and smaller firms, proposers moving onto Phase 2 will be required to spend no more than $5000 on their submissions. Throughout this process, we will engage not only architects and park supporters, but also residents, businesses, and other stakeholders to collaboratively harness the talents and insights of all participants to optimize project results.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  A challenge for the Design Competition is ensuring the Park design meets our
  goals for recreational, environmental, and health benefits. The multi-phase
  process that engages a broad range of stakeholders will help overcome this
  challenge and ensure the Park meets residents’ needs.
   
   Gentrification will be a major challenge to the Park itself, which could push out existing low-income residents as property values increase. Friends of the Hollywood Central Park (FHCP) will overcome this obstacle with multiple strategies. The Design Guidelines for the Competition will require competitors to incorporate design elements that are inclusive of all LA residents, with a focus on engaging nearby low-income residents. FHCP has a commitment to preserving and expanding affordable housing around the park, and is actively working to create an Enhanced Infrastructure Financing District, apply for Cap and Trade funding, and other strategies designed to maintain Hollywood as a mixed income community.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  The Design Competition will be evaluated by a jury comprised of participants
  from the Mayor’s office, Council District 13, Planning Department, Recreation
  and Parks Department, Promise Zone, leaders from the architecture/landscape
  design community, community residents, stakeholders and FHCP representatives.
   
   The jury will evaluate Park designs using the following criteria. 
   1. Does the design meet the HCP Park Ethic of service to Community, Well-Being and Sustainability?
   2. Does the HCP Design enhance the unique characteristics of surrounding communities by investing in healthy, safe, and walkable neighborhoods?
   3. Does the HCP Design enhance and encourage such strategies as transit-oriented, mixed-use development and land recycling—to increase community revitalization, improve the efficiency of public works investments, and safeguard viewscapes/landscapes?
   4. Does the HCP Design prove that HCP could only exist in Hollywood, California?
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  In LA County, there are five deck parks in various stages of planning.
  However, the Hollywood Central Park is the furthest along in several important
  ways that are required to implement a park on this scale. Hollywood Central
  Park’s Draft Environmental Impact Report is scheduled to be released in fall
  of 2015. Unlike the others, Hollywood Central Park is already an official
  project of the City of Los Angeles (Case # NP-14-004-RP) and at 38 acres, is
  the largest deck park of the five proposed. 
   
   Our proposed Design Competition is unique in its plan to engage a broad array of stakeholders, as well as our commitment to implementing a Park Design created by an Angeleno, for Angelenos. The unique nature of the Hollywood Central Park demands a design that is developed by an architect or landscape designer who truly understands the context of Hollywood and Los Angeles.
   
   The vision for the Hollywood Central Park came from the surrounding community, the product of a collaborative participatory effort; bottom up planning as opposed to top down. Through a program of workshop meetings centered on the participation of a wide representation of members of the community, the project proponents have facilitated the creation of a concept plan. 
   
   Because the Hollywood Central Park is located in a dense urban environment, our park project is unique in that our affordable housing component is equally as important as building the park. We are truly committed to ensuring existing residents can remain in the community and enjoy the benefits of the Park. 
   
   The Hollywood Central Park Initiative focuses on creating sustainable communities by integrating polices related to land use, housing, transportation, human health, the economy and the environment. The Park serves as a demonstration project of the six livability principles and informs the work of President Obama’s mission to prioritize ecosystem restoration in urban areas and connect urban youth with the outdoors. 
   
   This catalytic project has broad community support from diverse stakeholders, including residents, businesses, state and local agencies and elected officials with goals and objectives that are in alignment with Mayor Garcetti’s priorities. Friends of the Hollywood Central Park is a perfect example of individuals and institutions working together to solve community problems and create successful change.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  FHCP is a partner of the Los Angeles Promise Zone, a federal initiative of the
  US Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Los Angeles Promise Zone
  was designated as one of the first five in the entire country in 2014 by
  President Obama, and in LA this effort is led by the Mayor’s Office and
  includes over 50 public and private partners. The goals of the LA Promise Zone
  are to transform poverty-stricken neighborhoods in central Los Angeles into
  communities of opportunity by preserving housing affordability, improving
  education and public safety, creating jobs and spurring economic development.
  The Hollywood Central Park is located directly within the boundaries of the
  Promise Zone and will contribute to many of the Promise Zone goals. FHCP works
  closely with the Mayor’s Office and other Promise Zone partners. 
   
   FHCP also collaborates with many local Hollywood nonprofit organizations, educational institutions and neighborhood councils and home owners’ associations. These include the Los Angeles Beautification Team, STEM Academy at Bernstein High School Complex, and Hollywood Community Housing Corporation. 
   
   For the Design Competition, FHCP intends to provide a $7,500 stipend to the Los Angeles Beautification Team for providing time and expertise to the Phase 2 finalists, as they are a leading nonprofit in the LA area for environmental and sustainable projects. FHCP has partnered with the LA Beautification Team on other projects to prepare for the building of the Hollywood Central Park, including recently planting 542 trees to create an urban forest on 10 streets leading into the Park. 
   
   FHCP partners with STEM Academy High School in Hollywood, which has an Engineering track. We will provide STEM Academy students with paid internships (total of $7,500 allocated for this) to assist FHCP in implementing the Design Competition. Interns will help with outreach to publicize the Competition, with behind-the-scenes organizing, and will serve on the jury. This builds on our current internship program for STEM Academy engineering students, where they have participated in activities like developing their own park designs and hosting community engagement events.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  The Hollywood Central Park Design Competition will cost no more than $100,000,
  but it will contribute significantly to advancing our timeline for building
  the Park. A portion of the LA2050 funding will help us prepare for the Design
  Competition, including providing paid internships for STEM Academy high school
  engineering students. The majority of the funds will be reserved to host the
  city-wide Hollywood Central Park Design Exhibition that comprises Phase 3 of
  the Competition. The top 10 finalists will install and showcase their designs
  to the public, and we will make a special effort to ensure local residents and
  other neighborhood stakeholders are engaged in the Exhibition.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
  $15,000 in funding will support partners LABT and STEM Academy as described in
  the partnerships section above. $15,000 is to prepare for the Design
  Competition, including documenting eligibility and design requirements,
  publicity, printing/copying, website, graphic design, and legal review. $5,000
  is for costs associated with Phases 1 and 2 of Competition, including proposal
  printing and review, eligibility check, jury meetings/review, and notification
  of top 10 proposals. $25,000 is for Competition Phase 3, which will be a
  city-wide exhibition event hosted at a venue in Hollywood. Funding will cover
  public relations/outreach for the Exhibition, signage, project
  installations/curation, and event costs like décor and food. $33,000 is for
  awards (1st, 2nd, 3rd, and two honorable mentions).
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  FHCP’s Design Competition will naturally be scaled since it links directly to
  building the Hollywood Central Park. At the conclusion of the Competition, we
  will have a park design that allows us to move forward on the next steps for
  building the Park. 
   
   In addition, throughout the LA2050 grant year, FHCP will document each step of the Design Competition, including challenges and best practices. This information will be available to other groups interested in deck parks, including the other four currently proposed in LA County. Our hope is that other deck parks can learn from FHCP’s Design Competition and the subsequent steps needed to build the park. Our focus on finding a design created by Angelenos for Angelenos can be replicated within LA, as well as for other cities considering deck parks. Local design will help ensure each future Park is built to meet the needs and context of the neighborhoods surrounding the Park.
