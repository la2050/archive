Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: >-
  People often feel like they don’t do enough to make the world a better place.
  It’s difficult to find the time to volunteer, and for the average person,
  vetting which charity to give to is extremely difficult and time-consuming. We
  must feel good about how we help our communities to be happy, but we don’t.
  ChallengeMaker fills that hole instantly. When someone receives a challenge,
  the choice is easy. Either accept a challenge (it could be something like
  hiking, eating healthier or simply reading to a child), or donate a small
  amount of money to a charity or nonprofit. Hit the accept button without even
  having to decide and you feel better already. Complete a challenge or donate
  and you feel great. Challenging others is a fun way to connect with friends.
  When your friends give it counts as part of your giving total and that feels
  great. The same goes for the people they challenge and so on. ChallengeMaker
  is the connection people are yearning for.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: 'Our goal is to raise $10,000,000 for nonprofits by the end of our first year. '
