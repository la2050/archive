  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: >-
    People often feel like they don’t do enough to make the world a better
    place. It’s difficult to find the time to volunteer, and for the average
    person, vetting which charity to give to is extremely difficult and
    time-consuming. We must feel good about how we help our communities to be
    happy, but we don’t. ChallengeMaker fills that hole instantly. When someone
    receives a challenge, the choice is easy. Either accept a challenge (it
    could be something like hiking, eating healthier or simply reading to a
    child), or donate a small amount of money to a charity or nonprofit. Hit the
    accept button without even having to decide and you feel better already.
    Complete a challenge or donate and you feel great. Challenging others is a
    fun way to connect with friends. When your friends give it counts as part of
    your giving total and that feels great. The same goes for the people they
    challenge and so on. ChallengeMaker is the connection people are yearning
    for.
  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: 'We need funding to finish the tech and soft launch our web app platform. '
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    Our goal is to raise $10,000,000 for nonprofits by the end of our first
    year. 
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    a few of the challenges on an iOS app called 'challenged' raise money for
    nonprofits. However there is no peer to peer sharing; there is now way to
    make a donation with in the app; their audience is very specific to tweens
    who don't donate. It's also really hard to invite an audience to a challenge
    using other media. 
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "Jason McCabe - Founder/ Bis Dev / Designer\r\nJack Conor - Head of Tech\r\nRachael Caine - Peer to Peer Marketing"
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    Getting us off the ground will cost over $100,000. However we will see
    revenue spike in just the second month with campaigns we have already began
    setting up. 
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Salaries $18750\r\nPayroll Tax & Benefits  $ 15795\r\nDigital Marketing Campaigns 3600\r\nHosting and Bandwith $1000\r\nawyers, accountants, CPAs $1800\r\nTravel, meals, conferences $7500\r\nPhone service $1350\r\nInsurance $300"
