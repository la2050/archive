  What if everyday professionals could help improve LA’s dropout rate, right
  from their desks? By pairing students with mentors in exciting workplaces like
  Google and Hulu, Spark connects the dots between school and a future career. 
   
   69% of LA students drop out in 9th grade, but if mentors can ignite a spark in them—in 7th and 8th grade—students would be motivated to stay in school. With less than 1% of the LA workforce serving as a mentor, Spark could reach every off-track 7th and 8th grader.
Please specify below: >-
  Spark is partnered with 6 LAUSD schools, as well as workplaces throughout the
  city.
category: all
'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  If LA is going to be the best place to learn, learning cannot be isolated to
  schools, and the task of educating our youth cannot be given only to teachers.
  Spark engages working professionals throughout the city to mentor middle
  school students at-risk of dropping out, to be the next generation of
  architects, computer programmers, scientists, and more.
   
   Spark LA takes traditional classroom education and expands it, connecting it with real-life workplaces. In the spring of 2010, Spark LA launched with 13 students and a big vision: to meaningfully impact LA’s education landscape. By 2050, Spark envisions every off-track LA student being matched with a mentor who inspires them to stay in school and graduate, effectively making LA the best place to learn.
   
   In the current academic year, Spark LA is serving 350 LA students across 6 schools in underserved neighborhoods, such as Boyle Heights, East Hollywood, MacArthur Park, and South LA. We are also engaging over 600 mentors from over 20 of LA’s top companies, including Hulu, Cornerstone OnDemand, HBO, Union Bank, Wells Fargo Capital, Gensler, Pandora, and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
   
   Not only do students and schools benefit, but LA’s top companies and their employees are directly engaged and supporting local education efforts. Spark provides companies with a turnkey employee engagement program. Mentors using Spark to build relationships across departments at their company, in addition to networking with mentors from other companies. 98% of mentors report that they are ‘proud’ their company partners with Spark, thus increasing employee brand loyalty and engagement.
   
   What’s more, the Spark Program works! Our results to date have shown that 89% of Spark students finish 8th grade on track for on time high school graduation, compared to 70% of their peers. Furthermore, 92% of Spark alumni have graduated high school on time, or are on track to do so, far surpassing local and national graduation rates of 70% and 80%, respectively.
    
   Spark LA is building a movement, with the goal of serving entire schools and neighborhoods by 2050. As more students see the relevance of their education through Spark, local graduation rates will improve, and youth will have the skills and career exposure that will help them succeed in their academic, professional, and personal lives. Imagine all at-risk LA students being matched with a mentor; what a great city in which to learn!
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  When Spark served less than 100 students, we were able to recruit mentors
  through cold-calls and word of mouth. As we have nearly quadrupled the number
  of students served—and seek to grow further—one challenge is recruiting enough
  mentors to support 2 apprenticeships per student. This year alone, Spark
  anticipates needing to recruit at least 600 mentors to serve 350 students. By
  2050, we will need to recruit exponentially higher numbers of mentors to
  achieve our vision of matching every off-track student with a mentor. Unless
  we are able to effectively grow our mentor base, we will be unable to scale.
   
   To overcome this challenge, we are building partnerships with companies that can provide high numbers of mentors, like companies such as Cornerstone OnDemand, with over 60 mentors, or Hulu, with over 30 mentors. We are also revamping our corporate outreach materials and raising brand awareness through events and public relations efforts.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  By 2050, Spark wants to match every struggling LA middle schooler with a
  mentor from a local workplace. To achieve this, we need to build long-term
  partnerships with more schools, as well as with the biggest companies in LA.
  We need to deepen our engagement with each of our current corporate partners
  by involving more employees each semester. Additionally, we need to launch new
  partnerships with companies that are excited about getting their employees
  involved. 
   
   By 2050, Spark wants every LA student to finish 8th grade on track for graduation. To do so, we help struggling 7th and 8th graders to improve their social/emotional and workforce skills, and school performance. To evaluate our progress, we have a data-sharing agreement with LAUSD through which we track students’ grades and attendance records. We also have students, parents, teachers, and mentors complete pre-, mid-, and post-program surveys geared towards tracking changes in students’ social/emotional and workforce skills.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There are many mentoring and education-focused nonprofits in LA and across the
  country. Many people confuse Spark’s program with internships or job shadowing
  programs; others compare it to one-day programs where employees talk about
  their careers to students. However, the learning that takes place between
  students and their mentors is much deeper than that.
   
   What makes Spark unique? Spark students are placed in one-on-one ‘apprenticeships’ with a working professional at the workplace. Together, they work on a hands-on project, like building an app or creating a business plan. This unique project-based component helps students draw connections between the workplace and the classroom, and keeps them engaged in their learning. Research shows that such hands-on learning improves students’ attitudes about learning, retention of content, and problem-solving and collaboration skills (Farrington, et al, 2012). Rather than many one-day career day programs, students meet with their mentor for 10 weeks each semester.
   
   Additionally, Spark has a sharp focus on middle school – the formative years that can determine whether or not a student graduates from high school. While many organizations focus on early childhood education and college prep, few target the middle school years; yet, research has shown that as many as 60% of students become “chronically disengaged” in these adolescent years (Klem and Connell, 2004).
   
   In addition to impacting individual students, Spark has created a simple way for companies and organizations to get involved in supporting education in the city by removing all the obstacles to volunteerism. Not only does Spark bring the students to the companies, we also train mentors and provide the ongoing support they need to be successful. Spark makes it easy for working professionals to give back to LA’s students, right from their desk, during the workday. Spark is creating a movement, with 600 volunteer mentors per year!
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Through a partnership with LAUSD, Spark partners with schools that serve
  predominantly low-income, minority students. Spark is currently partnered with
  6 LAUSD schools:
   - Bethune Middle School (South LA)
   - Camino Nuevo Charter Academy, Burlington (MacArthur Park)
   - Clinton Middle School (South LA)
   - Stevenson Middle School (Boyle Heights)
   - Le Conte Middle School (East Hollywood)
   - Nava Learning Academy (South LA)
   
   Through the partnership with LAUSD, Spark is also able to track students through high school, a key piece of understanding the long-term impact of our program
   
   Schools agree to pay a fee to bring Spark to their students; however, the school fees represent less than 15% of the actual cost to bring Spark to each school. As such, if awarded, Spark will allocate 100% of the grant towards serving these 6 schools.
   
   Spark’s partnership with LeConte Middle School is supported by funds from President Obama’s Promise Neighborhood’s initiative. The grant’s primary recipient, Youth Policy Institute, selected Spark LA as one of five partners with which to partner in order to provide positive programming for youth in the area. 
   
   While schools provide one side of the student-mentor equation, Spark LA’s workplace partners offer the other side: a reliable source of volunteer mentors. Spark’s corporate partners include LA’s top companies in a wide range of fields, including entertainment, technology, finance, architecture and engineering, and more. This year, Spark will partner with over 20 corporate partners. Spark’s corporate partners – Cornerstone OnDemand, Hulu, Warner Bros., HBO, Sony, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences, Union Bank, and others – provide transportation, monetary and in-kind donations, and over 14,000 volunteer hours throughout the program year.
   
   Finally, we are also partnered with Public Allies, which provides frontline program staff, allowing Spark to broaden its partnerships with other nonprofits while also minimizing program costs.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  To bring this impactful program to 350 students, Spark LA estimates it will
  cost $923,113. To cover the additional cost of $823,113, we will draw on our
  diverse and robust funding base, including foundation, corporate, government,
  and individual funders. Spark LA’s highly engaged executive and advisory
  boards also provide substantial fundraising support and were responsible for
  40% of revenue in the last fiscal year.
   
   In October 2015, we will host Spark A Dream, our annual fundraiser, for which we have set a fundraising goal of $400,000. Last year, the event raised more than $400,000 to support Spark’s work, and generated local philanthropic support and new corporate partnerships. This year, the event will be hosted by Judy Reyes, best known for her portrayal of Carla on the hit television show Scrubs. With this increased local attention and celebrity host, we are confident in our ability to again reach our fundraising goal.
   
   In addition to our annual fundraiser, we have developed a robust pipeline of foundation and corporate supporters to cover our additional expenses. This pipeline includes over $700,000 in foundation grants and corporate donations. Many corporate partners agree to pay the costs associated with the students placed at their companies, contributing to Spark’s diverse funding base. Finally, Spark has secured $95,000 in funding from school partners and government funding.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  Program Personnel Expenses: $67,500
   Spark relies on 3 experienced frontline program staff members to ensure an effective program. Spark has invested in strategies to lower personnel expenses, while maintaining a high quality program, such as moving labor intensive program components onto an online platform. As a result, this year, Spark will increase the number of students served by 34%, while decreasing the number of frontline program staff.
   
   ‘Discovery Night’ Expenses (Spark’s year-end project showcase): $10,000
   In May 2016, Spark will bring together students and mentors to share their hands-on projects with peers, family members, teachers, and the larger community. Spark’s Discovery Night are an exciting citywide event, and have even been featured in the LA Times (Dec 2014).
   
   Our additional expenses are:
   Travel and Meeting Expenses: $7,500
   Program Supplies: $5,000
   Volunteer Mentor Background Check Expenses: $5,000
   Marketing and Outreach Expenses: $5,000
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Currently, we estimate that there are over 46,000 7th and 8th grade LAUSD
  students who will enter high school underprepared or at-risk of dropping out.
  Spark LA is preparing to scale its programming, with the vision of serving
  every off-track LA middle school student by 2050. Spark is working to bring
  about this vision by:
   
    – Deepening and Expanding Spark’s presence within local corporations
   As previously mentioned, Spark is seeking to engage more mentors at each company, and build new partnerships. Spark is working to become an integral part of each company’s culture so that we have ample mentors for our students. We have found that the key to building partnerships with corporations is gaining support from the executives who can use their platform to encourage employees to participate. Our partnership with Cornerstone OnDemand is an example of how we have built connections at the executive level. Co-Founder and Chief Financial Officer, Perry Wallack, first got involved with Spark in 2012 when he was one of the three employees who volunteered to mentor. Thanks to Wallack’s ongoing support, the partnership has grown tremendously in only three years; Spark is engaging 64 Cornerstone OnDemand employees as mentors this semester alone. Additionally, Cornerstone OnDemand provides significant financial support, including paying for transportation for students completing apprenticeships at their company and providing free use of their software for our online platform. Spark is working to build more partnerships that follow this model in order to scale the program throughout the city.
   
   – Launching a technology platform, Spark Online
   Through a partnership with LA corporate partner Cornerstone OnDemand, Spark is launching an online platform, Spark Online. This online platform puts key resources directly into the mentor’s hands, like activity resources, a project library, and training videos. It also provides a place for teachers to collaborate on each student’s Spark experience. In future years, the online platform will provide an avenue for Spark to share its program with other organizations, allowing the Spark model to scale.
