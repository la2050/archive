  Given the issues facing our immigrant students in Los Angeles and with the
  announcement of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) in 2012, we are
  committed to increasing pathways for DACA recipients to join as Teach For
  America corps members teaching in Los Angeles public schools. We believe
  DACAmented corps members have the unique potential to serve as role models for
  students who share the same background.

  Los Angeles must deliver on the promise of an excellent education for all,
  including our immigrant children. Los Angeles County has the highest number of
  undocumented immigrants in the state and within the Los Angeles Unified School
  District there are reportedly 200,000 undocumented students (Public Policy
  Institute of California). However, numerous barriers exist for the
  undocumented community that limits their ability to access educational
  opportunities. For example, less than 2% of college-going students nationwide
  are undocumented according to the UndocuScholars Project at the University of
  California, Los Angeles. 
   
   Teach For America can help our city achieve its promise by providing a pipeline of impactful DACAmented educators. Implemented in August 2012, the DACA program allows undocumented young people who came to the U.S. before the age of 16 the opportunity to gain employment and defers any removal action for two years. 
   
   For the past 25 years, TFA LA has served as a talent pipeline of effective classroom teachers and leaders in the highest need public schools. Our corps members and alumni have a proven track record of leading students to excel. Last year , one of our teachers teaching chemistry at Ánimo College Preparatory Academy, led 75% of his students to score proficient or advanced in chemistry. In addition, KIPP Raíces, led by a Teach For America alumna, received the 2015 National Blue Ribbon Schools. This school has a student population that is 96% Latino and 90% of students qualify for free or reduced price lunch and yet is proving that all kids can achieve with school wide scores surpassing the state average 
   
   As part of our effort to develop more outstanding educators, we are committed to recruiting DACAmented teachers. Imagine if a undocumented student approached a teacher about the hardships of living as an undocumented child. Imagine if that teacher had the experience of navigating the education system from the same shoes. 
   
   One current corps member shared, “I wanted to ensure that there would be even just one less child who felt isolated and helpless because of his or her immigration status. I no longer felt afraid, limited, or ashamed because my story – and the story of many other undocumented immigrants – exemplifies perseverance, hard work, and strength, values that I hope to instill in my students.” This connection between teacher and student can bring limitless possibilities for undocumented children.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Teach For America’s recruitment model focuses heavily on college campuses and
  there is a small number of DACAmented college students. We believe we can play
  an important role in making sure that more of our K-12 undocumented students
  are aware of the opportunities that exist to attend college and apply for
  DACA. Moreover, we hope to deepen our partnerships with the AB540/Dream
  Centers in major college campuses in the greater Los Angeles area to ensure
  more DACA recipients are aware of the existing opportunities to become
  teachers. Even though we are early in our recruitment stage for next year’s
  teaching cohort, we already have nearly 20 applicants who are DACAmented from
  UCs or Cal State schools in the greater LA area.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We will evaluate our work by engaging in and assessing the following
  activities.
   • Fostering the leadership of our DACAmented teachers and maximizing their impact with students 
   • Increasing the pipeline of exceptional DACAmented teachers for LAUSD public schools
   • Increasing awareness on issues facing undocumented students for our staff and teachers 
   
   We aim to ensure we can recruit and place up to 10 additional DACAmented educators who will on average teach approximately 100 students beginning in fall 2016. We will measure our teachers' effectiveness by assessing their students' progress. We will also evaluate this project by the number of training opportunities we are able to provide to staff and corps members on issues facing undocumented students.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There are many important organizations working to address the injustices
  facing Los Angeles’ students impacted by their personal or family citizenship
  status and we strive to be a key partner among them. Specifically, there are
  many efforts to eliminate barriers to college for undocumented students. For
  example, Educators for Fair Consideration (E4FC) is aimed at empowering
  undocumented young people to pursue their dreams of college, career, and
  citizenship in the United States. They annually host a national conference to
  increase awareness for educators working with undocumented students. 
   
   Additionally, the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles (CHIRLA) has established a CHIRLA Dream Center in response to President Obama's announcement regarding Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) in June 2012 which aims to assist eligible immigrant youth and community members in applying for Deferred Acton. 
   
   IDEAS (Improving Dreams, Equality, Access, and Success) at UCLA aims to provide undocumented students with the resources and support needed to ensure their retention in higher education.
   They implement the AB540 Project which raises the awareness of undocumented youth, parents, educators, and the general Los Angeles community about the academic and financial resources available to undocumented students.
   
   In addition, Los Angeles Unified School District has consolidated resources to support students applying for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) status. The LAUSD school board also recently approved the program, Advocating for Youth Unaccompanied in Deportation Actions, which made the district the first in California to start fighting deportation cases for students who have immigrated without guardians. 
   
   While there are existing resources for undocumented youth, there does not seem to specific initiatives to recruit individuals with DACA status to serve as teachers. We are excited to serve as the only pipeline of DACAmented educators for Los Angeles public schools, specifically in low-income communities.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  We envision the potential to provide additional financial resources to corps
  members, students applying for DACA status, and advocacy and education
  community organizations. As part of this project, we will explore
  organizations who have expertise in training educators around issues impacting
  undocumented students so that our entire teaching cohort of approximately 180
  first and second-year teachers can deepen their ability to serve as allies to
  their students and families. We typically pay partner organizations an
  honorarium or fee for presentations throughout the year at a rate of
  approximately $2,000-$2,500. In addition, we intend to research local
  conferences or events led by key partners that we can send our staff and
  teachers to as well to supplement their professional development and increase
  their effectiveness as advocates for immigrant student issues. 
   
   Additionally, we can establish a scholarship fund to help students in our classrooms cover the fee ($465) for their DACA application. We could work with our DACAmented teachers to host a DACA clinic/info session and provide 5-10 scholarships for students in attendance that can be used to pay for their DACA application.
   
   Lastly, our corps members (teachers) who are essential to this project have the potential to directly benefit from this in the case that they experience unexpected financial hardship or legal fees. We currently have funding to provide up to $15,000 per corps member to provide the equivalent of the Americorps grant other corps members receive that they are ineligible for as well as legal fees. However, in the case that additional financial hardship occurs, this funding in part may be covered to address this in specific situations. For example, paying fees for their teaching certification can provide a financial barrier for many of our DACAmented teachers who cannot apply or receive federal financial aid. Funds for this project could in part be used in the form of up to $1,000 grants that can be provided to corps members to help pay for their certification.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  We anticipate this project will cost $227,000. We will seek additional
  foundation supporters as well as individual supporters to join our Sponsor A
  Teacher Campaign to help offset these costs with a donation of $5,000 and
  above.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
  This budget includes our efforts to recruit, train, and place up to 10 new
  DACAmented corps members to teach in LA public schools in the 2016-17 school
  year, as well as to coach, support, and provide professional development to
  the 14 corps members who are currently teaching as part of the TFA LA corps.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  In order to scale this project, we will need to deepen partnerships with key
  organizations both on college campuses and in the broader Los Angeles
  community to work together to recruit more DACAmented teachers by 1) expanding
  the pipeline and ensuring more eligible undocumented leaders are applying for
  deferred action and 2) cultivating more DACAmented college students and
  professionals to see the need for teachers with their background and apply to
  join the Teach For America Los Angeles corps. 
   Additionally, we hope to expand the training and professional development we aim to provide for our corps members (first and second year teachers) around issues facing undocumented students to our large Teach For America LA alumni base including the nearly 700 teachers and over 70 principals currently working in LA area schools. 
   
   Lastly, we see an opportunity to engage with other community service (such as other Americorps initiatives) and/or teaching pipeline programs to discuss how to collectively work to recruit from an expanded pool of DACAmented students and professionals to join the teaching profession.
