  MML4D is a 4 hour event featuring 4 programs that give all demographics in any
  city of any socio-economic status the ability to connect with their fellow Los
  Angeleno in fun, unique, effective ways. These three elements missing from the
  traditional forms of civic engagement is why participation is so low. 
   
   Life, Liberty & the Pursuit of Happiness will be discussed & displayed using the programs based on 4 popular human activities: music, self-expression, humanitarianism and health & wellness
