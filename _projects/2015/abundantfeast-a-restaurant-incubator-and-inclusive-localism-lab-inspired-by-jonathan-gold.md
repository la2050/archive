  of gentrification. Its board of directors comprise the conflicted stakeholders
  in urban development. The incubator is a modified startup launch process to

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "(Embedded video clip is from \"City of Gold\" by Laura Gabbert and not associated with this project)\r\n\r\n“Food is political here in a way that rock and roll hasn’t been for years,” Gold recently wrote in Saveur Magazine.  “It plugs into the rhythms of the city and the world, engaging all the important questions of social justice and health, diversity and inclusion.” - Jonathan Gold\r\n\r\nAbundantFeast is a for-benefit incubator of restaurants that plug into the rhythms of Los Angeles. It will connect diverse stakeholders in the wave of development in Los Angeles. It will connect existing residents in Highland Park with aspiring chefs who want to open a restaurant there. It will connect college students with real world experience of entrepreneurship intersecting with a social mission. It will connect questions of social justice, health, diversity and inclusion to the wave of development in the City.\r\n\r\nUnderneath the issues of gentrification is a disconnect among the groups it impacts. The systemic history is so vast, that the groups experience it as circumstance. AbundantFeast intervenes in that chasm. It brings representatives from the conflicted stakeholders together. It gives them a chance to discard the conventions that pair development with disconnection. It empowers them to make connections with each other and create new value on terms that include all of them.\r\n\r\nFrom the work of the board, two ways to make new connections have already emerged.  Our workforce training program will provide good, creative job opportunities to those who live near the incubator. Students from nearby Occidental College will connect to the neighborhood as volunteers. Shared governance makes new connections possible.\r\n\r\nEach restaurant AbundantFeast launches will testify to inclusionary localism and urbanism. The restaurants will have a sense of place that even extends to the realm of politics. The basis of inclusion for the members of each stakeholder group is co-creation. Dining at the incubator will be an opportunity to champion aspiring chefs seeking a common table. Jonathan Gold also said: to make his Best of LA list \"it has to be a restaurant that makes you look at Los Angeles in a new way.\" AbundantFeast is a restaurant that is a chance to imagine a new Los Angeles."

  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    We will compile a dashboard of key performance indicators. Performance
    indicators are measures of our operational effectiveness and progress toward
    our goals. On equity for instance, we can survey the equity impacts of
    recent new restaurants to make a baseline. The equity impact of each
    restaurant we incubate is the increment it exceeds the baseline. Beyond
    tracking performance, we can look at patterns in the indicators to find ways
    to improve the incubation process.
