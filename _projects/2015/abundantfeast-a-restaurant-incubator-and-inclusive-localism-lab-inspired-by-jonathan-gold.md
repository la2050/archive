  AbundantFeast is a for-benefit incubator of restaurants confronting the issues
  of gentrification. Its board of directors comprise the conflicted stakeholders
  in urban development. The incubator is a modified startup launch process to
  power-up new restaurants vetted by a criteria set by the board. It will be
  self-sustaining after startup costs. It will create new value to share among
  the stakeholders. It will evolve urban development toward equitable resolution
  of conflict and inclusion.

  Los Angeles faces major challenges as well as opportunities to evolve into a
  more equitable and sustainable city. In particular, with a new mobility plan
  in the City of Los Angeles and transit expansion underway countywide, there is
  an opportunity to create more equitable places through democratic and
  community-based planning for active transportation, transit, and more
  sustainable living patterns. Like many advocates, we see the need for changes
  in policy, plans and the built environment. But at this point in time, the
  change that it perhaps most needed is increased openness to change itself-tied
  to more democratic and creative ways to engage residents in planning,
  particularly low-income, communities of color that have traditionally been
  locked out of decision making processes. 
   
   The project will build on the Community Alternative 7 (CA7) as a case study of how residents are democratizing planning. A coalition of environmental justice organizations based in communities impacted by pollution from goods movement in that corridor organized to create their own serious alternative to this huge infrastructure plan. Our project will support advocacy for CA7 and we will host a training by CA7 advocates for residents interested in helping shape the future of transportation in their own areas.
   The project will identify and engage residents impacted by existing or proposed freeways and transit projects, using training workshops such as the Place It! workshops that facilitate residents expressing their experience how planning and design shape how we live, and to translate their dreams and ideas into physical forms. By conducting workshops, particularly small scale workshops focused on involving youth, women, and low income residents, the project will inspire more residents to support changes to their neighborhoods and to Los Angeles. 
   The project will simultaneously identify case studies of transformative city change linked to mobility to recommend policy and planning reforms that can make it easier for the City of Los Angeles to evolve. We will identify examples of activism on mobility from the Los Angeles region as well as how other cities have changed through shifts in mobility. We will showcase these on a website and in an exhibition. We will examine key procedures in the City Charter, general plan etc. that could be modified to open up more space for creative, democratic planning and the evolution of LA into a more sustainable, equitable city.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  There is widespread suspicion of development, change, and planning processes-
  some of it warranted due to past redevelopment, displacement, sprawl, and lack
  of transparency- and decision making have evolved to bake suspicion, delay and
  a lack of transformative thinking into land use and other processes. Our
  strategy for overcoming this suspicion is to link the need for more democratic
  and creative planning with structural reforms to allow positive community
  initiated or supported projects to move forward and catalyze wider change.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: |-
  - number of participants in workshops
   - number of views of project website
   - attendance at training and at exhibition
   -engagement with advocates, residents and policy makers on urban change opportunities and structural reforms
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There are a number of organizations conducting advocacy on aspects around
  mobility in the LA region. Move LA works on transit expansion and
  transportation funding. The LA County Bike coalition, Multicultural
  Communities for Mobility,and LA Walks work on active transportation. Investing
  in Place works on transportation funding and equity. Alliance for Community
  Transit (ACT-LA) focuses on transit and equity. Several local coalitions work
  on street changing initiatives and regional environmental justice movement
  advocate around pollution from freight and freeways. Our approach is unique
  because it combines a focus on mobility with exploration of models of planning
  and governance reforms that can facilitate change- on transportation issues
  and other topics.

How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  We will create a website as a living source of ideas for change and case
  studies of successful innovation, and continue to maintain the site past the
  initial community workshops and projects. 
   We will collect ideas from our workshops along with example of places around the world where change has successfully been implemented; and links to books, articles, blogs and opinions related to changing transportation and related urban change. The website will be searchable – and readable in different layers by our different audiences.
   We hope that the C7 case study, ideas from Place It! workshops, examples of transportation and mobility approaches, , will point to ideas for for planning and policy reform will add up to a wider and stronger constituency of residents seeking to affect transportation and mobility. in Los Angeles.

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "(Embedded video clip is from \"City of Gold\" by Laura Gabbert and not associated with this project)\r\n\r\n“Food is political here in a way that rock and roll hasn’t been for years,” Gold recently wrote in Saveur Magazine.  “It plugs into the rhythms of the city and the world, engaging all the important questions of social justice and health, diversity and inclusion.” - Jonathan Gold\r\n\r\nAbundantFeast is a for-benefit incubator of restaurants that plug into the rhythms of Los Angeles. It will connect diverse stakeholders in the wave of development in Los Angeles. It will connect existing residents in Highland Park with aspiring chefs who want to open a restaurant there. It will connect college students with real world experience of entrepreneurship intersecting with a social mission. It will connect questions of social justice, health, diversity and inclusion to the wave of development in the City.\r\n\r\nUnderneath the issues of gentrification is a disconnect among the groups it impacts. The systemic history is so vast, that the groups experience it as circumstance. AbundantFeast intervenes in that chasm. It brings representatives from the conflicted stakeholders together. It gives them a chance to discard the conventions that pair development with disconnection. It empowers them to make connections with each other and create new value on terms that include all of them.\r\n\r\nFrom the work of the board, two ways to make new connections have already emerged.  Our workforce training program will provide good, creative job opportunities to those who live near the incubator. Students from nearby Occidental College will connect to the neighborhood as volunteers. Shared governance makes new connections possible.\r\n\r\nEach restaurant AbundantFeast launches will testify to inclusionary localism and urbanism. The restaurants will have a sense of place that even extends to the realm of politics. The basis of inclusion for the members of each stakeholder group is co-creation. Dining at the incubator will be an opportunity to champion aspiring chefs seeking a common table. Jonathan Gold also said: to make his Best of LA list \"it has to be a restaurant that makes you look at Los Angeles in a new way.\" AbundantFeast is a restaurant that is a chance to imagine a new Los Angeles."
  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "Our next major challenge is cultivating persistent interest among aspiring chefs. Our strategy to do this will comprise three kinds of tactics: barter, evangelism, and alumni networks. \r\n\r\n1. Barter - We will make non-monetary trades for promotion with existing networks of aspiring chefs. For example, we can offer to host emerging chef event DinnerLab in our space in exchange for promoting the incubator to all their prior chefs. \r\n\r\n2. Evangelism - Our stakeholders are prominent in their spheres of influence and committed to promoting their participation. The issues we are confronting are newsworthy. From the broad audience engaged by these issues, we will inspire those with restaurant ambitions. \r\n\r\n3. Alumni Networks - The chefs we incubate will be role models for the next generation of aspiring chefs. Their restaurants will be meeting places for restaurant explorers in Los Angeles. Every plate they serve builds our brand as a place great new chefs get launched."
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    We will compile a dashboard of key performance indicators. Performance
    indicators are measures of our operational effectiveness and progress toward
    our goals. On equity for instance, we can survey the equity impacts of
    recent new restaurants to make a baseline. The equity impact of each
    restaurant we incubate is the increment it exceeds the baseline. Beyond
    tracking performance, we can look at patterns in the indicators to find ways
    to improve the incubation process.
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    The project draws on the success of three organizations outside Los Angeles
    County. Kitchen LTO, and the Trinity Groves project in Dallas it is a part
    of, demonstrates how restaurant incubation is a venue for balancing urban
    revitalization interests with the existing resident interests. Delancy
    Street and La Cocina in San Francisco incorporate equity considerations into
    their workforce development operations. Common Table in Philadelphia grew
    out of the philanthropist-funded food systems work of The Enterprise Center
    to raise a federal grant for a incubating low-income chefs. Now, the
    founding director of Common Table is on our Advisory Board. The plan for
    AbundantFeast incorporates lessons from all three of these organizations.
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    Our partners and collaborators are the stakeholders investing in it. None of
    them will receive any of the grant award.
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    This is a self sustaining venture after the startup costs. We expect
    additional startup up costs less than $650,000, based on a survey of similar
    projects. Our stakeholders will cover these additional costs with in-kind
    and cash investment.
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "up to $10,000 - Incorporation\r\nup to $40,000 - Restaurant design and technology\r\nup to $40,000 - Kitchen and Service staff training\r\nup to $10,000 - Administrative support"

  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    The impact of AbundantFeast scales by replication, adaptation, and evidence.
    Other neighborhood coalitions can replicate the model we are pioneering. The
    advantage for incubated restaurants remains the same, but the impact on the
    neighborhood will reflect the goals of each coalition. The incubator is a
    combination of a process for launching tech startups and inclusive
    governance. Organizers in other industries can adapt the AbundantFeast
    approach to challenge the norms they face. AbundantFeast will collect
    unprecedented data on the relationships involved in urban revitalization.
    The data will inform policy makers seeking smarter growth strategies. In
    fact, one reason these stakeholders are partnering with AbundantFeast is the
    chance to scale its impact of it in these ways.

    answer: "(Embedded video clip is from \"City of Gold\" by Laura Gabbert and not associated with this project)\r\n\r\n“Food is political here in a way that rock and roll hasn’t been for years,” Gold recently wrote in Saveur Magazine.  “It plugs into the rhythms of the city and the world, engaging all the important questions of social justice and health, diversity and inclusion.” - Jonathan Gold\r\n\r\nAbundantFeast is a for-benefit incubator of restaurants that plug into the rhythms of Los Angeles. It will connect diverse stakeholders in the wave of development in Los Angeles. It will connect existing residents in Highland Park with aspiring chefs who want to open a restaurant there. It will connect college students with real world experience of entrepreneurship intersecting with a social mission. It will connect questions of social justice, health, diversity and inclusion to the wave of development in the City.\r\n\r\nUnderneath the issues of gentrification is a disconnect among the groups it impacts. The systemic history is so vast, that the groups experience it as circumstance. AbundantFeast intervenes in that chasm. It brings representatives from the conflicted stakeholders together. It gives them a chance to discard the conventions that pair development with disconnection. It empowers them to make connections with each other and create new value on terms that include all of them.\r\n\r\nFrom the work of the board, two ways to make new connections have already emerged.  Our workforce training program will provide good, creative job opportunities to those who live near the incubator. Students from nearby Occidental College will connect to the neighborhood as volunteers. Shared governance makes new connections possible.\r\n\r\nEach restaurant AbundantFeast launches will testify to inclusionary localism and urbanism. The restaurants will have a sense of place that even extends to the realm of politics. The basis of inclusion for the members of each stakeholder group is co-creation. Dining at the incubator will be an opportunity to champion aspiring chefs seeking a common table. Jonathan Gold also said: to make his Best of LA list \"it has to be a restaurant that makes you look at Los Angeles in a new way.\" AbundantFeast is a restaurant that is a chance to imagine a new Los Angeles."

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Our next major challenge is cultivating persistent interest among aspiring chefs. Our strategy to do this will comprise three kinds of tactics: barter, evangelism, and alumni networks. \r\n\r\n1. Barter - We will make non-monetary trades for promotion with existing networks of aspiring chefs. For example, we can offer to host emerging chef event DinnerLab in our space in exchange for promoting the incubator to all their prior chefs. \r\n\r\n2. Evangelism - Our stakeholders are prominent in their spheres of influence and committed to promoting their participation. The issues we are confronting are newsworthy. From the broad audience engaged by these issues, we will inspire those with restaurant ambitions. \r\n\r\n3. Alumni Networks - The chefs we incubate will be role models for the next generation of aspiring chefs. Their restaurants will be meeting places for restaurant explorers in Los Angeles. Every plate they serve builds our brand as a place great new chefs get launched."

      We will compile a dashboard of key performance indicators. Performance
      indicators are measures of our operational effectiveness and progress
      toward our goals. On equity for instance, we can survey the equity impacts
      of recent new restaurants to make a baseline. The equity impact of each
      restaurant we incubate is the increment it exceeds the baseline. Beyond
      tracking performance, we can look at patterns in the indicators to find
      ways to improve the incubation process.

      The project draws on the success of three organizations outside Los
      Angeles County. Kitchen LTO, and the Trinity Groves project in Dallas it
      is a part of, demonstrates how restaurant incubation is a venue for
      balancing urban revitalization interests with the existing resident
      interests. Delancy Street and La Cocina in San Francisco incorporate
      equity considerations into their workforce development operations. Common
      Table in Philadelphia grew out of the philanthropist-funded food systems
      work of The Enterprise Center to raise a federal grant for a incubating
      low-income chefs. Now, the founding director of Common Table is on our
      Advisory Board. The plan for AbundantFeast incorporates lessons from all
      three of these organizations.

      The impact of AbundantFeast scales by replication, adaptation, and
      evidence. Other neighborhood coalitions can replicate the model we are
      pioneering. The advantage for incubated restaurants remains the same, but
      the impact on the neighborhood will reflect the goals of each coalition.
      The incubator is a combination of a process for launching tech startups
      and inclusive governance. Organizers in other industries can adapt the
      AbundantFeast approach to challenge the norms they face. AbundantFeast
      will collect unprecedented data on the relationships involved in urban
      revitalization. The data will inform policy makers seeking smarter growth
      strategies. In fact, one reason these stakeholders are partnering with
      AbundantFeast is the chance to scale its impact of it in these ways.
