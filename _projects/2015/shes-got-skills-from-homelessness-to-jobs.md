  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: "DWC will make LA the best place to create by placing 10 women, who have histories of homelessness and trauma, into paid employment through our social enterprise, MADE by DWC. Through this program, women will have the opportunity to gain hands-on work experience, harness their own creativity in the workplace, and contribute to the diversification of LA’s business community. \r\n\r\nIn 2010, DWC launched its social enterprise to provide transferable skills-training to women who have the hardest time securing employment. Over the past five years, DWC has solidified its job-training program, providing women with 12-week courses in inventory management, retail sales, and café sales. \r\n\r\nLast year, with funding from the LA2050 Grants Challenge, DWC established a coalition of socially conscious business partners, committed to employing women with histories of homelessness. As a result, DWC placed nearly 60 homeless and formerly homeless women into jobs. The program was an overwhelming success. DWC learned that for women who are job-ready, being placed into employment following a 12-week course or individualized case management sessions leads to long-term retention. However, for women who are not job-ready and are still coping with the effects of trauma, a more intensive and supportive program is essential. Thus, DWC will expand the current 12-week job training course into a 12-month transitional employment program, where women are employed in our two retail stores and compensated fairly. \r\n\r\nIn October of 2015, DWC will place its first cohort of five women into paid positions in our café and resale boutique. An additional five women will be placed in March of 2016. Women will be employed for 12 months in one of the following three positions: Café Associate, Resale Associate, and Inventory Associate. While working at DWC, participants will 1) receive industry-specific, high-quality training, 2) gain hands-on work experience, and 3) receive feedback on a monthly basis from a Case Manager. \r\n\r\nThrough this initiative, the aim is to prepare participants for future bridge and/or traditional employment opportunities. To secure future positions, participants will work with DWC’s Job Developer, who works closely with business partners in identifying opportunities and matching participants to those. Approximately three months before transitioning, each participant will be evaluated and scored against pre-determined job-readiness standards. "

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "One major barrier that we anticipate is the housing status of our participants. DWC’s goal to house women is driven by a community-wide effort to house the most vulnerable first. Typically, this means that the women who became housed during the grant period are extremely vulnerable and not able to work. Concurrently, homeless women who would be more likely to obtain employment remain on housing waiting lists. This presents significant difficulties because the search for shelter remains primary in the daily lives of our participants. \r\n\r\nTo respond, DWC will provide comprehensive support to all participants enrolled in our transitional employment program. Each woman will have access to case management support; the opportunity to enroll in the Coordinated Entry System to secure housing, if she does not have housing; and linkage to any other services, as needed. DWC is committed to providing services to the hardest-to-serve population, and will maintain its low-barrier approach. "
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "DWC’s project is one of six participating in the Los Angeles Regional Initiative for Social Enterprise (LA:RISE). As such, an external evaluation is being conducted by Social Policy Research Associate (SPR) to examine the impact of transitional employment services on program participants’ employment, earnings, and criminal justice involvement outcomes by comparing their outcomes with a control group, comprised of individuals eligible for, but not receiving, transitional employment services. \r\n\r\nThe program will be evaluated using a random assignment research design, meaning eligible individuals will be placed completely at random into either a program group (and receive all above-mentioned services) or into a control group (and not receive the transitional employment services). \r\n\r\nComparative outcomes will be tracked, interpreted, and analyzed by SPR. "
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "As mentioned, DWC is one of six agencies providing either transitional, bridge, or traditional employment services to hard-to-serve populations. The effort is led by the city’s Workforce Development Department and REDF, and funded by the Department of Labor. \r\n\r\nHowever, DWC is the only agency committed to exclusively serving women. That, in combination with our approach, render us unique in our community. The umbrella, evidence-based practice that we use is trauma-informed care. More than 70% of the women we serve at DWC have traumatic histories, and by acknowledging their trauma and incorporating this knowledge into all aspects of service-delivery, we create a culture of healing. Frequently, when survivors of trauma and violence re-enter the workplace, they are confronted with triggers that may remind them of past traumatizing events. In the 12-month transitional employment program, we will help our participants first identify those triggers, and then support them as they develop the skills to manage their trauma responses. This is essential to ensuring a woman’s long-term success. \r\n\r\nWe understand that each of our participants has unique needs and circumstances, which must be addressed through a comprehensive spectrum of services. Through our work, we recognize interconnectedness of the issues faced by our participants and have expanded and tailored our wide range of services to provide a holistic, systemic approach to meet their needs. This, along with the strong community organizing efforts that foster multi-sector partnerships, has helped us move from an understanding of the best practices in homeless service provision to a shared community commitment to implement them. We believe that this approach, along with our engagement in continuous research, learning, and innovation, will ensure our success in bringing an end to homelessness for women. "
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "The two major partners in this city-wide initiative are the Los Angeles Economic and Workforce Development Department and REDF. \r\n\r\nThe two are partnering with additional transitional employers, including, Chrysalis, CRCD Enterprise, Homeboy Industries, Goodwill SoCal, Weingart 360 Solutions, and LA Conservation Corps. The Department of Labor is contributing $6 million to the initiative, and DWC will receive $30,000. "
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': "For DWC, the total cost of the project is $376,983. Of that, $318,833 includes personnel expenses, including salaries and benefits; $53,300 includes wages for the participants, at $10.25/hr for 10 hours per week; and $4,850 includes operating costs, including materials, supplies, and other costs. \r\n\r\nThus far, DWC has received $30,000 from REDF to participate in the city-wide initiative, LA:RISE. We will cover additional costs by allocating a portion of the program-specific funds raised for our Job Readiness program to this project. We will continue to fundraise over the next 12 months to ensure all costs are full covered. "
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
    A $100, 000 grant from the Goldhirsh Foundation will cover the following
    expenses of the proposed project: $23,300 for participants wage; $3,029 for
    taxes and personnel-related expenses regarding participants’ wage; $71,171
    for project staff’s salaries and expenses, including DWC’s Director of
    Vocational Education and Social Enterprise, Workforce Development Manager,
    Job Developer, and Social Enterprise Store Managers & Associates (that will
    include 26% fringe benefits for eligible staff); and lastly, $2,500 for
    program materials and supplies. 
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "Following the evaluation conducted by SPR, DWC will develop a full implementation plan for scaling, based on recommendations from the report. We hope to elevate the best practices in job readiness for homeless and formerly homeless women. As a leader in the community and across the nation, we are prepared to advocate for the implementation of those best practices. \r\n\r\nDWC is recognized as a leader in the service field. In 2001, we spearheaded the Downtown Women's Action Coalition in gathering information on homeless women’s needs with the potential to affect positive change in policy. In 2005, we developed a national study of best practices in homeless women’s services. In 2011, DWC was deemed “Organization of the Year” by the Los Angeles Business Journal and was granted the Los Angeles Conservancy Preservation Award. In 2013, we were named “Nonprofit of the Year,” by the Office of the Governor and California Volunteers. "
