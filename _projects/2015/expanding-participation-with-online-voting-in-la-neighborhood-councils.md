title: Expanding Participation with Online Voting in LA Neighborhood Councils
project_summary: >-
  Data-driven research and recommendations for the 2016 online voting pilot of
  the Los Angeles Neighborhood Councils. We will evaluate the impact of the
  online voting pilot on voter turnout and engagement, and develop
  recommendations and best practices for maximizing participation in future
  online elections in LA that become a model for cities around the country.

  'In one sentence, please describe what your organization does': >-
    Based at the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, Civic
    Tech USC is an initiative exploring how new technologies can help to
    reimagine civic life and engage everyday people in improving their
    communities.
  'In one to three sentences, please describe your proposal.': >-
    Data-driven research and recommendations for the 2016 online voting pilot of
    the Los Angeles Neighborhood Councils. We will evaluate the impact of the
    online voting pilot on voter turnout and engagement, and develop
    recommendations and best practices for maximizing participation in future
    online elections in LA that become a model for cities around the country.
  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "We are planning a study of the planning, implementation, and effectiveness of the online voting option for Los Angeles Neighborhood Councils. Using surveys and interviews with voters and local officials, historical and real-time voter data, and website and user experience analytics, we plan to explore and answer the following questions:\r\n\r\n- Turnout and engagement - How does the option to vote online impact voter turnout in the 35 neighborhood councils that have signed on to use the system? What is the impact on turnout among young adults? What other kinds of local civic engagement are affected by the online voting option?\r\n\r\n- Design, implementation, and analytics - Map the process of voting to understand voter behavior and barriers to participation. How could the design and implementation of the voting platform, and the avenues through which users find and access it, be improved in future elections?\r\n\r\n- Best practices - Which neighborhood councils experienced the biggest boost in turnout because of the online option, and what can we learn from them? What are the best practices for other local, state, and national governments looking to implement online voting?"
  How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
    - Money (financial capital)
    - Volunteers/staff (human capital)
    - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
    - Community outreach
    - Network/relationship support
  How do you plan to use these resources to make change?:
    - Conduct research
    - Engage residents and stakeholders
    - Implement and track policy
  Where will you be working?:
    - Central LA
    - South LA
    - City of Los Angeles
  How will your proposal improve the following “Connect” metrics?:
    - Rates of volunteerism
    - Voting rates by race
    - Participation in neighborhood councils
    - Percentage of Angelenos that volunteer informally (Dream Metric)
    - Government responsiveness to residents’ needs (Dream Metric)
    - Attendance at public/open streets gatherings (Dream Metric)
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Successful outcomes for this project include:\r\n- Produce research and recommendations that are used by local officials across LA, and that contribute to expanded participation in neighborhood council elections.\r\n- Identify and distribute best practices for expanding voter turnout using easy-to-use online voting platforms that are as secure as possible given current technological limitations.\r\n- Help to test and refine online voting technologies in lower stakes elections like neighborhood councils before they are used in larger elections."

  We are planning a study of the planning, implementation, and effectiveness of
  the online voting option for Los Angeles Neighborhood Councils. Using surveys
  and interviews with voters and local officials, historical and real-time voter
  data, and website and user experience analytics, we plan to explore and answer
  the following questions:
   
   - Turnout and engagement - How does the option to vote online impact voter turnout in the 35 neighborhood councils that have signed on to use the system? What is the impact on turnout among young adults? What other kinds of local civic engagement are affected by the online voting option?
   
   - Design, implementation, and analytics - Map the process of voting to understand voter behavior and barriers to participation. How could the design and implementation of the voting platform, and the avenues through which users find and access it, be improved in future elections?
   
   - Best practices - Which neighborhood councils experienced the biggest boost in turnout because of the online option, and what can we learn from them? What are the best practices for other local, state, and national governments looking to implement online voting?
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  A major challenge with any proposal related to participation in local
  elections is the extremely low turnout rate. There are 96 neighborhood
  councils representing over 3.5 million residents across the City of Los
  Angeles, but turnout in most neighborhood council elections is <1%. Our
  strategy to overcome this challenge is not for this election cycle - which we
  will study, but not intervene in - but future cycles. By studying which
  neighborhood councils see significant increases in turnout related to online
  voting and comparing them with those that do not, we will identify best
  practices and develop election guides that help neighborhood councils maximize
  turnout in future elections.

  Successful outcomes for this project include:
   - Produce research and recommendations that are used by local officials across LA, and that contribute to expanded participation in neighborhood council elections.
   - Identify and distribute best practices for expanding voter turnout using easy-to-use online voting platforms that are as secure as possible given current technological limitations.
   - Help to test and refine online voting technologies in lower stakes elections like neighborhood councils before they are used in larger elections.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  According to our partners in the neighborhood councils, no one else has
  approached them about studying the impact of online voting on voter
  participation in neighborhood council elections.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Civic Tech USC will have sole responsibility for managing this project, but we
  have the strong support of numerous local officials including Grayce Liu,
  General Manager of EmpowerLA, the department that runs the neighborhood
  council system. Liu is excited about our proposal and has given us access to
  data, staff, and other resources to study the 2016 elections.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  The 2016 online voting pilot is in 35 of LA's 96 neighborhood councils, and we
  will work with EmpowerLA to distribute best practices and conduct training
  with neighborhood councils if and when the pilot expands in future years.
