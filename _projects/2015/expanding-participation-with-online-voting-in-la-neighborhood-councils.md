  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "We are planning a study of the planning, implementation, and effectiveness of the online voting option for Los Angeles Neighborhood Councils. Using surveys and interviews with voters and local officials, historical and real-time voter data, and website and user experience analytics, we plan to explore and answer the following questions:\r\n\r\n- Turnout and engagement - How does the option to vote online impact voter turnout in the 35 neighborhood councils that have signed on to use the system? What is the impact on turnout among young adults? What other kinds of local civic engagement are affected by the online voting option?\r\n\r\n- Design, implementation, and analytics - Map the process of voting to understand voter behavior and barriers to participation. How could the design and implementation of the voting platform, and the avenues through which users find and access it, be improved in future elections?\r\n\r\n- Best practices - Which neighborhood councils experienced the biggest boost in turnout because of the online option, and what can we learn from them? What are the best practices for other local, state, and national governments looking to implement online voting?"

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    A major challenge with any proposal related to participation in local
    elections is the extremely low turnout rate. There are 96 neighborhood
    councils representing over 3.5 million residents across the City of Los
    Angeles, but turnout in most neighborhood council elections is <1%. Our
    strategy to overcome this challenge is not for this election cycle - which
    we will study, but not intervene in - but future cycles. By studying which
    neighborhood councils see significant increases in turnout related to online
    voting and comparing them with those that do not, we will identify best
    practices and develop election guides that help neighborhood councils
    maximize turnout in future elections. 
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Successful outcomes for this project include:\r\n- Produce research and recommendations that are used by local officials across LA, and that contribute to expanded participation in neighborhood council elections.\r\n- Identify and distribute best practices for expanding voter turnout using easy-to-use online voting platforms that are as secure as possible given current technological limitations.\r\n- Help to test and refine online voting technologies in lower stakes elections like neighborhood councils before they are used in larger elections."
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    According to our partners in the neighborhood councils, no one else has
    approached them about studying the impact of online voting on voter
    participation in neighborhood council elections.
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    Civic Tech USC will have sole responsibility for managing this project, but
    we have the strong support of numerous local officials including Grayce Liu,
    General Manager of EmpowerLA, the department that runs the neighborhood
    council system. Liu is excited about our proposal and has given us access to
    data, staff, and other resources to study the 2016 elections.  
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    Our budget is $100,000, which includes original research; interviews,
    outreach to, and convenings with residents and local officials; and
    producing materials like a report on online election best practices for LA.
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Project Lead (1/3 time) - $20,000\r\n  Fringe (33.5%) - $6,700\r\n\r\n3 Graduate-Level Researchers (1/4 time) - $37,500\r\n3 Student Workers (200 hr each @ $12/hr) - $7,200\r\n\r\nMeetings & Events - $6,000\r\nReports & Website - $5,000\r\nTravel & Miscellaneous - $4,000\r\nFringe & Research Center F&A (15%) - $12,960\r\n\r\nTOTAL = $99,360"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    The 2016 online voting pilot is in 35 of LA's 96 neighborhood councils, and
    we will work with EmpowerLA to distribute best practices and conduct
    training with neighborhood councils if and when the pilot expands in future
    years.
