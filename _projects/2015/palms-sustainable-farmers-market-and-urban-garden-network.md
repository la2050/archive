project_summary: >-
  The Farmers Market and Urban Garden Network in Palms, one of the densest areas
  in L.A. instills environmental stewardship in our youth and the final bit of
  funding will ensure a successful completion of our network of school and
  community gardens. This initiative is action-oriented, builds public
  involvement, focuses on a root cause of our environmental/health crises, and
  partner’s school gardens with our farmers market and community gardens to
  address the lack of stable school garden programs

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to play.: "One of the proudest achievements of MAIA has been the opening of a Sunday’s Farmers Market at the corner of Motor Ave. and National Boulevard. This public outdoor neighborhood space provides our community with access to fresh locally grown fruits and vegetables, prepared foods, crafts, nutrition edu- cation, yoga, children’s activities, live music and more.\r\n\r\nMAIA is located in the middle of a food desert, meaning that residents have little to no access to affordable, organically grown healthy fruits and vegetables. In an effort to combat this serious issue that affects many marginalized communities, the Farmers’ Market provide residents with more affordable access to healthy food. The benefits of urban gardening is key in creating change and promoting healthier and equitable food choices, which is why the Urban Garden Network was developed as a perfect compliment to the Farmer’s Market.\r\n\r\nUrban Garden Network:\r\nExpanding on our interest in health education, recreational open space, and community building, MAIA developed the Urban Garden Network. This expansion allows us to not only give community members access to organic and healthy produce, but also educate our participants about the benefits and joys of growing their own produce through the use of urban gardens. By having students participate in these gardens, we have the opportunity to show them that learning does not exclusively happen in the classroom and, if they engage themselves, they can learn outdoors in nature.\r\n\r\nThe Urban Garden Network has six interconnected urban open space gardens: two parklets, a community garden on Motor Ave. and three local school gardens at Palms Elementary, Palms Middle School, and Overland Elementary. With the support of local officials, corporations, foundations and dedicated community members, our gardens are bringing joy and education to Palms residents. We are also equipping the gardens with new fruit and vegetable seeds and seedlings, planter boxes, tools, decomposed granite paths, shaded teaching areas, additional seating, a secure storage sheds, designated compost areas, and expanded drip irrigation.\r\n\r\n"

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    As with many school gardens, there are periods of time when the garden goes
    fallow due to breaks or when a founding teacher or parent leaves. As a
    result, we developed an interconnected network to ensure the gardens are
    properly maintained: participants of the urban gardens help tend to the
    school plots throughout the year and during spring, summer, fall and winter
    breaks. The students and community share responsibility for all the gardens
    and thus develop a sense of ownership for all gardens and for their
    community, while making sure these gardens do not suffer when students are
    unable to actively care for them.
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    In analyzing the success of our program, we will conduct pre and post tests
    with students on curriculum using the open space community gardens as an
    instructive tool as well as testing students on garden knowledge. Our
    intention in teaching multiple subjects via gardening is to increase the
    engagement and enthusiasm for knowledge that aids in data retention.
    Analysis will include comparing exam scores with those of previous years
    before the gardens were implemented. Objectives are also measured in terms
    of numbers and ages of participants, both at schools and at community garden
    plots. And lastly, we measure the production levels and quality of produce,
    just like any other farm.
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    Our urban garden network is unique to other urban garden organizations due
    to it's interconnected nature that incorporates the whole community, i.e.,
    supporters, community members, schools (faculty, staff, students, parents),
    garden plot owners, leaders. Our mission is to advance this multiple, or
    unified garden program in order to instill an environmental stewardship
    within the community as well as encourage such interconnected
    relationships.

    Currently we hold three partnerships with three local schools and LAUSD, The
    County of Los Angeles, Thee City of Los Angeles,And corporations like
    LaVictoria, and other corps . Our partnerships ensure our supported
    responsibility of each partner's school gardens. We will grant appropriate
    money to our schools in order to improve and advance our current garden
    spaces to meet California drought conditions (through current technological
    innovations) as well achieve a safe,sustainable, and fun place that
    encourages the growth of our students. All monies go directly to the
    gardens.
