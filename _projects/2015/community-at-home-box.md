project_summary: >-
  The Internet today divides communities by empowering remote network owners and
  information services to overpower local community businesses and resources. It
  creates a growing digital divide between those who can afford monopoly rents
  on broadband channel access versus those who cannot. Community at Home (Box)
  breaks that negative cycle by providing full connection and data services
  within each home, growing organically into neighborhood and community-wide
  networks, one household at a time.
Please specify below: Northeast Los Angeles (NELA)
category: all
'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  A lot of the open standards hardware and open source software required for
  these community mesh network deployments already exist today. We just need to
  package it all together, in a way that makes it easy for anyone without
  network expertise to install it in their own homes or offices. This will
  initially be in the form of the Community at Home Box -- a single package
  configured with everything needed to provide home and community data services
  over a small home network.
   
   We will also provide legal templates for communities to incorporate their own utility cooperatives or community welfare networks, all under existing IRS 501(c) nonprofit definitions, so that local experts can be paid for their professional services in connecting and maintaining these community networks. We have a pilot project starting in the Northeast Los Angeles region, NELA-Shares.Net, where we will test our templates and open source tools in real world deployments. We encourage all other LA County communities to start their own Local-Shares.Net cooperatives as well, to connect directly with each other. The downtown LA community in particular has great access to multiple global carrier transit providers, at carrier neutral facilities like One Wilshire, where connecting through neighbors directly will be much cheaper than through AT&T or Time Warner.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  FCC: an industry captured regulator since inception. FCC giveaways and
  auctions of our public commons spectrum resources have only hurt community
  mesh networks. We will use existing open spectrum license and "light license"
  structures to avoid proprietary exclusive spectrum, as previously allocated by
  the FCC. Our less politically restricted partners may petition their
  government to force spectrum regulators to act in our public interest, instead
  of for their post-regulator career.
   
   LA City officials have been begging cable and telco incumbents to install a new exclusive fiber franchise, in the guise of the LA CityLink RFP process. They may not approve our complementary network proposal, primarily due to lack of incumbent monopoly status.
   
   Herd mentality and market ignorance may keep LA residents and business owners from adopting community network ownership over perpetual rentier access. We need these existing Internet users to join our community networks.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  1. # new family homes with online access to local resources, where nonexistent
  or unaffordable prior.
   
   2. $ reductions amortized over life of network hardware, including local institutions and infrastructure.
   
   3. $ additional gross pay for local technology jobs.
   
   4. # of new startup businesses attracted.
   
   5. # civic, social business startups that declare community broadband networks as a primary reason for LA home office selection.
   
   6. # additional telecommuting and public transportation users.
   
   7. # additional annual tourists and technical conferences.
   
   8. Reduction in response times for government and emergency services.
   
   9. # more volunteers due to additional free time off commutes.
   
   10. $ more charitable donations per capita from better income reliability, via increases to local technology industry.
   
   11. # more voters turnout due to greater in-community discussion of issues
   
   12. # added square meters of public area where limited WiFi is freely available.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Any local nonprofit or government institution can transform their own offices,
  buildings, and campuses into institutional hubs for local community network
  mesh peer connections and online services today. Modern low cost and
  power-sipping hardware designed for laptops and tablets can easily be
  transformed into core router and data services infrastructure, all at lower
  gross long-term costs than any remote Internet cloud services. Community at
  Home Box is a project to package these competitive network technologies all
  into one easily installed hardware set.
   
   All these online services can be situated directly within the places where they are most used. This both lowers online request latency and increases service reliability. During disasters of any form, in situ renewable power generation and backup batteries can keep this community infrastructure operational, while competing metropolitan infrastructure is being restored. These institutions and services should always reside at the core of our community networks, not at remote data centers far north or east of Los Angeles County.
   
   Complementary open standards hardware and open source software vendors can each contribute to designs for low cost reliable community network infrastructure. Data Roads Foundation constituents in each community can serve as "standards groups", to determine the open standards most appropriate for implementation in each local area. Community at Home Box integrates all of these resources into a single package, making it is easier to procure and install.
   
   Data Roads Foundation is already partnering with several open source and mesh hardware projects like Internet-In-A-Box.org, Commotion Wireless, Freedom Stack, Freedom Box, Open Telco, Guardian Project, Calyx Institute, and more open source mesh routing software projects. We are currently negotiating collaborations with several California based network hardware and maintenance service vendors, including local job training programs. Anything that remote proprietary vendors refuse to provide can be created by and for ourselves, by using open technologies in our own communities.
   
   While Data Roads Foundation is a national nonprofit with international ambitions, our Steering Committee and pilot projects are all currently based in Los Angeles County. We consider ourselves and our organization to be native Angelenos.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Partner job training programs or their training constituents will be paid
  based on work performed. 
   
   Partner open hardware providers will be paid for all hardware provisioned.
   
   Partner open source and documentation projects will be paid for Data Roads project specific bounties, and in donations of excess funds after project completion.
   
   Proprietary technology vendors will be avoided, but will be paid at standard market rates when deemed absolutely necessary.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  This grant will cover Box integration and development costs for about a year,
  or more with additional volunteer and in-kind donation support via publicity.
  Purchasers of our Buy One Give One program will cover costs for 2 Box
  deployments -- their own home and for a family in need. Our LA CityLink
  complementary mesh network proposal will benefit from these development funds,
  and may thus lead to deployment contract funds. We are always applying to
  other grant programs to pay for ongoing projects and institutional costs.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
  This grant will primarily pay for project specific bounties for integrated
  open source technologies. Prototype Community at Home Boxes are projected to
  cost about $500 each. Our internal nonprofit and volunteer development
  services also cost about $840 per year.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Purchasers of our Buy One Give One program will cover costs for 2 Box
  deployments -- their own home and for a family in need. Once enough
  neighborhoods are exposed to Community at Home services, we expect growth to
  follow Reed's Law.

    answer: "A lot of the open standards hardware and open source software required for these community mesh network deployments already exist today. We just need to package it all together, in a way that makes it easy for anyone without network expertise to install it in their own homes or offices. This will initially be in the form of the Community at Home Box -- a single package configured with everything needed to provide home and community data services over a small home network.\r\n\r\nWe will also provide legal templates for communities to incorporate their own utility cooperatives or community welfare networks, all under existing IRS 501(c) nonprofit definitions, so that local experts can be paid for their professional services in connecting and maintaining these community networks. We have a pilot project starting in the Northeast Los Angeles region, NELA-Shares.Net, where we will test our templates and open source tools in real world deployments. We encourage all other LA County communities to start their own Local-Shares.Net cooperatives as well, to connect directly with each other. The downtown LA community in particular has great access to multiple global carrier transit providers, at carrier neutral facilities like One Wilshire, where connecting through neighbors directly will be much cheaper than through AT&T or Time Warner."

    answer: "FCC: an industry captured regulator since inception. FCC giveaways and auctions of our public commons spectrum resources have only hurt community mesh networks. We will use existing open spectrum license and \"light license\" structures to avoid proprietary exclusive spectrum, as previously allocated by the FCC. Our less politically restricted partners may petition their government to force spectrum regulators to act in our public interest, instead of for their post-regulator career.\r\n\r\nLA City officials have been begging cable and telco incumbents to install a new exclusive fiber franchise, in the guise of the LA CityLink RFP process. They may not approve our complementary network proposal, primarily due to lack of incumbent monopoly status.\r\n\r\nHerd mentality and market ignorance may keep LA residents and business owners from adopting community network ownership over perpetual rentier access. We need these existing Internet users to join our community networks."

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Any local nonprofit or government institution can transform their own offices, buildings, and campuses into institutional hubs for local community network mesh peer connections and online services today. Modern low cost and power-sipping hardware designed for laptops and tablets can easily be transformed into core router and data services infrastructure, all at lower gross long-term costs than any remote Internet cloud services. Community at Home Box is a project to package these competitive network technologies all into one easily installed hardware set.\r\n\r\nAll these online services can be situated directly within the places where they are most used. This both lowers online request latency and increases service reliability. During disasters of any form, in situ renewable power generation and backup batteries can keep this community infrastructure operational, while competing metropolitan infrastructure is being restored. These institutions and services should always reside at the core of our community networks, not at remote data centers far north or east of Los Angeles County.\r\n\r\nComplementary open standards hardware and open source software vendors can each contribute to designs for low cost reliable community network infrastructure. Data Roads Foundation constituents in each community can serve as \"standards groups\", to determine the open standards most appropriate for implementation in each local area. Community at Home Box integrates all of these resources into a single package, making it is easier to procure and install.\r\n\r\nData Roads Foundation is already partnering with several open source and mesh hardware projects like Internet-In-A-Box.org, Commotion Wireless, Freedom Stack, Freedom Box, Open Telco, Guardian Project, Calyx Institute, and more open source mesh routing software projects. We are currently negotiating collaborations with several California based network hardware and maintenance service vendors, including local job training programs. Anything that remote proprietary vendors refuse to provide can be created by and for ourselves, by using open technologies in our own communities.\r\n\r\nWhile Data Roads Foundation is a national nonprofit with international ambitions, our Steering Committee and pilot projects are all currently based in Los Angeles County. We consider ourselves and our organization to be native Angelenos."

      How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you
      cover the additional costs?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      This grant will cover Box integration and development costs for about a
      year, or more with additional volunteer and in-kind donation support via
      publicity. Purchasers of our Buy One Give One program will cover costs for
      2 Box deployments -- their own home and for a family in need. Our LA
      CityLink complementary mesh network proposal will benefit from these
      development funds, and may thus lead to deployment contract funds. We are
      always applying to other grant programs to pay for ongoing projects and
      institutional costs.

      This grant will primarily pay for project specific bounties for integrated
      open source technologies. Prototype Community at Home Boxes are projected
      to cost about $500 each. Our internal nonprofit and volunteer development
      services also cost about $840 per year.
