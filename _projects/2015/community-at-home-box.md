title: Community at Home Box
project_summary: >-
  The Internet today divides communities by empowering remote network owners and
  information services to overpower local community businesses and resources. It
  creates a growing digital divide between those who can afford monopoly rents
  on broadband channel access versus those who cannot. Community at Home (Box)
  breaks that negative cycle by providing full connection and data services
  within each home, growing organically into neighborhood and community-wide
  networks, one household at a time.

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "A lot of the open standards hardware and open source software required for these community mesh network deployments already exist today. We just need to package it all together, in a way that makes it easy for anyone without network expertise to install it in their own homes or offices. This will initially be in the form of the Community at Home Box -- a single package configured with everything needed to provide home and community data services over a small home network.\r\n\r\nWe will also provide legal templates for communities to incorporate their own utility cooperatives or community welfare networks, all under existing IRS 501(c) nonprofit definitions, so that local experts can be paid for their professional services in connecting and maintaining these community networks. We have a pilot project starting in the Northeast Los Angeles region, NELA-Shares.Net, where we will test our templates and open source tools in real world deployments. We encourage all other LA County communities to start their own Local-Shares.Net cooperatives as well, to connect directly with each other. The downtown LA community in particular has great access to multiple global carrier transit providers, at carrier neutral facilities like One Wilshire, where connecting through neighbors directly will be much cheaper than through AT&T or Time Warner."

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "FCC: an industry captured regulator since inception. FCC giveaways and auctions of our public commons spectrum resources have only hurt community mesh networks. We will use existing open spectrum license and \"light license\" structures to avoid proprietary exclusive spectrum, as previously allocated by the FCC. Our less politically restricted partners may petition their government to force spectrum regulators to act in our public interest, instead of for their post-regulator career.\r\n\r\nLA City officials have been begging cable and telco incumbents to install a new exclusive fiber franchise, in the guise of the LA CityLink RFP process. They may not approve our complementary network proposal, primarily due to lack of incumbent monopoly status.\r\n\r\nHerd mentality and market ignorance may keep LA residents and business owners from adopting community network ownership over perpetual rentier access. We need these existing Internet users to join our community networks."
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "1. # new family homes with online access to local resources, where nonexistent or unaffordable prior.\r\n\r\n2. $ reductions amortized over life of network hardware, including local institutions and infrastructure.\r\n\r\n3. $ additional gross pay for local technology jobs.\r\n\r\n4. # of new startup businesses attracted.\r\n\r\n5. # civic, social business startups that declare community broadband networks as a primary reason for LA home office selection.\r\n\r\n6. # additional telecommuting and public transportation users.\r\n\r\n7. # additional annual tourists and technical conferences.\r\n\r\n8. Reduction in response times for government and emergency services.\r\n\r\n9. # more volunteers due to additional free time off commutes.\r\n\r\n10. $ more charitable donations per capita from better income reliability, via increases to local technology industry.\r\n\r\n11. # more voters turnout due to greater in-community discussion of issues\r\n\r\n12. # added square meters of public area where limited WiFi is freely available.\r\n"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "Any local nonprofit or government institution can transform their own offices, buildings, and campuses into institutional hubs for local community network mesh peer connections and online services today. Modern low cost and power-sipping hardware designed for laptops and tablets can easily be transformed into core router and data services infrastructure, all at lower gross long-term costs than any remote Internet cloud services. Community at Home Box is a project to package these competitive network technologies all into one easily installed hardware set.\r\n\r\nAll these online services can be situated directly within the places where they are most used. This both lowers online request latency and increases service reliability. During disasters of any form, in situ renewable power generation and backup batteries can keep this community infrastructure operational, while competing metropolitan infrastructure is being restored. These institutions and services should always reside at the core of our community networks, not at remote data centers far north or east of Los Angeles County.\r\n\r\nComplementary open standards hardware and open source software vendors can each contribute to designs for low cost reliable community network infrastructure. Data Roads Foundation constituents in each community can serve as \"standards groups\", to determine the open standards most appropriate for implementation in each local area. Community at Home Box integrates all of these resources into a single package, making it is easier to procure and install.\r\n\r\nData Roads Foundation is already partnering with several open source and mesh hardware projects like Internet-In-A-Box.org, Commotion Wireless, Freedom Stack, Freedom Box, Open Telco, Guardian Project, Calyx Institute, and more open source mesh routing software projects. We are currently negotiating collaborations with several California based network hardware and maintenance service vendors, including local job training programs. Anything that remote proprietary vendors refuse to provide can be created by and for ourselves, by using open technologies in our own communities.\r\n\r\nWhile Data Roads Foundation is a national nonprofit with international ambitions, our Steering Committee and pilot projects are all currently based in Los Angeles County. We consider ourselves and our organization to be native Angelenos."
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "Partner job training programs or their training constituents will be paid based on work performed. \r\n\r\nPartner open hardware providers will be paid for all hardware provisioned.\r\n\r\nPartner open source and documentation projects will be paid for Data Roads project specific bounties, and in donations of excess funds after project completion.\r\n\r\nProprietary technology vendors will be avoided, but will be paid at standard market rates when deemed absolutely necessary."
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    This grant will cover Box integration and development costs for about a
    year, or more with additional volunteer and in-kind donation support via
    publicity. Purchasers of our Buy One Give One program will cover costs for 2
    Box deployments -- their own home and for a family in need. Our LA CityLink
    complementary mesh network proposal will benefit from these development
    funds, and may thus lead to deployment contract funds. We are always
    applying to other grant programs to pay for ongoing projects and
    institutional costs.
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
    This grant will primarily pay for project specific bounties for integrated
    open source technologies. Prototype Community at Home Boxes are projected to
    cost about $500 each. Our internal nonprofit and volunteer development
    services also cost about $840 per year.
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    Purchasers of our Buy One Give One program will cover costs for 2 Box
    deployments -- their own home and for a family in need. Once enough
    neighborhoods are exposed to Community at Home services, we expect growth to
    follow Reed's Law.
