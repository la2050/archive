title: LitRemix
project_summary: >-
  The world looks toward Los Angeles as the mecca of creativity and imagination,
  making it the perfect anchor city to pilot LitRemix. We are proposing a
  partnership to engage both HS and college students in a program that generates
  art inspired by specific classic books taught in school. Common-core
  compliant, LitRemix is based on 10 years of work through Artists for Literacy.
  It directly addresses the challenge teachers have to make the experience of
  reading books relevant to their students.

Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "LitRemix will energize the experience of studying literature in Los Angeles, with a unique tool that helps students delve more deeply into books they are required to read, through a genuine process where reading and writing are intertwined significantly and are expressed uniquely through visual art and songs. These resulting artifacts will be used to connect peers through the LitRemix network, where they may find new motivation to further explore the importance of reading and literature in today’s world.  \r\n\r\n•\tINCLUSIVITY: Thanks to the diversity and universality of art, all Angelinos can find a connection to books through LitRemix. The platform is designed to DEMOCRATIZE the user experience as much as possible - enabling a wide cross-section of students to engage, interact and learn - no matter how limited their access is to technology. LitRemix will be accessed through phones, tablets and desktops. Users will listen to songs, view art and watch videos - all inspired by the books that are active in the network.  This will be the first interactive database of art inspired by literature, to be enjoyed not only by students, but also by the millions of literature buffs who LOVE this conversation about books and the art they inspire.\r\n\r\n•\tEVENTS: Our vision for LA as the pilot city includes producing a series of LitRemix Events, to be held in neighborhood libraries all across the city, bringing much needed traffic to these under-appreciated community spaces. These concerts, film debuts and art shows will celebrate specific books, the art they inspire, and the young artists responsible for the creation of this new art.  These unique events will set an example for other cities that eventually choose to integrate LitRemix into their education system. Los Angeles will lead the way.\r\n\r\n•\tDIVERSITY: With its interactive, collaborative and modular nature, LitRemix holds the promise to become an essential tool for parents and educators in LA. It welcomes all users, regardless of their place of residence, nationality, religion, ideology, culture, education, gender and age. LitRemix is for those who struggle with reading and for those who are thriving readers looking for even more inspiration after they’ve read a book. Our site is completely bi-lingual – in English and Spanish.  It reflects the diversity of LA, and we hope the art it generates from Angelinos will be as powerful as the books that inspire its existence. \r\n"
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "In the last 10 years, teachers have reported back to Artists for Literacy informally, when they have used our Songs Inspired by Literature CDs in their classrooms. From this experience, we have watched how teachers (and parents) have seen an increase in interest, engagement and comprehension of the specific books our songs connect with. This history has formed the foundation of how we can begin to measure our impact in ELA, ESL, and other learning environments.\r\n\r\nFor the Los Angeles Pilot, would like to use 4 High Schools and 2 Local colleges.  We will evaluate the impact of the LitRemix Platform by studying: \r\n•\tstudent engagement numbers (metric from app itself) \r\n•\tstudent testimonials\r\n•\tteacher testimonials\r\n•\tquality of art created\r\n•\tfrequency of sharing\r\n•\tonline conversations\r\n•\tlesson plan downloads\r\n•\tattendance at LitRemix events\r\n•\tinterest in seeing other books added to the network\r\n•\tcommunity reaction – including media interest, literary community, parents \r\n"
