title: LitRemix
project_summary: >-
  The world looks toward Los Angeles as the mecca of creativity and imagination,
  making it the perfect anchor city to pilot LitRemix. We are proposing a
  partnership to engage both HS and college students in a program that generates
  art inspired by specific classic books taught in school. Common-core
  compliant, LitRemix is based on 10 years of work through Artists for Literacy.
  It directly addresses the challenge teachers have to make the experience of
  reading books relevant to their students.

    experience of reading books relevant to their students.
  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "LitRemix will energize the experience of studying literature in Los Angeles, with a unique tool that helps students delve more deeply into books they are required to read, through a genuine process where reading and writing are intertwined significantly and are expressed uniquely through visual art and songs. These resulting artifacts will be used to connect peers through the LitRemix network, where they may find new motivation to further explore the importance of reading and literature in today’s world.  \r\n\r\n•\tINCLUSIVITY: Thanks to the diversity and universality of art, all Angelinos can find a connection to books through LitRemix. The platform is designed to DEMOCRATIZE the user experience as much as possible - enabling a wide cross-section of students to engage, interact and learn - no matter how limited their access is to technology. LitRemix will be accessed through phones, tablets and desktops. Users will listen to songs, view art and watch videos - all inspired by the books that are active in the network.  This will be the first interactive database of art inspired by literature, to be enjoyed not only by students, but also by the millions of literature buffs who LOVE this conversation about books and the art they inspire.\r\n\r\n•\tEVENTS: Our vision for LA as the pilot city includes producing a series of LitRemix Events, to be held in neighborhood libraries all across the city, bringing much needed traffic to these under-appreciated community spaces. These concerts, film debuts and art shows will celebrate specific books, the art they inspire, and the young artists responsible for the creation of this new art.  These unique events will set an example for other cities that eventually choose to integrate LitRemix into their education system. Los Angeles will lead the way.\r\n\r\n•\tDIVERSITY: With its interactive, collaborative and modular nature, LitRemix holds the promise to become an essential tool for parents and educators in LA. It welcomes all users, regardless of their place of residence, nationality, religion, ideology, culture, education, gender and age. LitRemix is for those who struggle with reading and for those who are thriving readers looking for even more inspiration after they’ve read a book. Our site is completely bi-lingual – in English and Spanish.  It reflects the diversity of LA, and we hope the art it generates from Angelinos will be as powerful as the books that inspire its existence. \r\n"

  LitRemix will energize the experience of studying literature in Los Angeles,
  with a unique tool that helps students delve more deeply into books they are
  required to read, through a genuine process where reading and writing are
  intertwined significantly and are expressed uniquely through visual art and
  songs. These resulting artifacts will be used to connect peers through the
  LitRemix network, where they may find new motivation to further explore the
  importance of reading and literature in today’s world. 
   
   • INCLUSIVITY: Thanks to the diversity and universality of art, all Angelinos can find a connection to books through LitRemix. The platform is designed to DEMOCRATIZE the user experience as much as possible - enabling a wide cross-section of students to engage, interact and learn - no matter how limited their access is to technology. LitRemix will be accessed through phones, tablets and desktops. Users will listen to songs, view art and watch videos - all inspired by the books that are active in the network. This will be the first interactive database of art inspired by literature, to be enjoyed not only by students, but also by the millions of literature buffs who LOVE this conversation about books and the art they inspire.
   
   • EVENTS: Our vision for LA as the pilot city includes producing a series of LitRemix Events, to be held in neighborhood libraries all across the city, bringing much needed traffic to these under-appreciated community spaces. These concerts, film debuts and art shows will celebrate specific books, the art they inspire, and the young artists responsible for the creation of this new art. These unique events will set an example for other cities that eventually choose to integrate LitRemix into their education system. Los Angeles will lead the way.
   
   • DIVERSITY: With its interactive, collaborative and modular nature, LitRemix holds the promise to become an essential tool for parents and educators in LA. It welcomes all users, regardless of their place of residence, nationality, religion, ideology, culture, education, gender and age. LitRemix is for those who struggle with reading and for those who are thriving readers looking for even more inspiration after they’ve read a book. Our site is completely bi-lingual – in English and Spanish. It reflects the diversity of LA, and we hope the art it generates from Angelinos will be as powerful as the books that inspire its existence.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  LitRemix – the app - will initially only be coded for IOS phones and tablets.
  The DESKTOP version will be the most widely accessible portal. Therefore, we
  are going to ensure that students, parents, teachers and professors first
  engage with LitRemix.com before they decide engage with their mobile devices.
  We are going to create a strategy to ensure a seamless experience that works
  for different contexts – regardless of the device.
   
   For the pilot program, we will feature existing art inspired by Homer’s Odyssey. We chose this book because it taught in both HS and College. Our challenge will be not in the EXPLORATION of existing art we have curated – but in the SHARING of the students-created music, visual art and videos. Teachers must first vet the initial works of art, before they are uploaded to our galleries. We realize the importance of this step, to ensure good quality artifacts that later are matched with lesson plans. Again, we are going to work on a clear strategy for this.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  In the last 10 years, teachers have reported back to Artists for Literacy
  informally, when they have used our Songs Inspired by Literature CDs in their
  classrooms. From this experience, we have watched how teachers (and parents)
  have seen an increase in interest, engagement and comprehension of the
  specific books our songs connect with. This history has formed the foundation
  of how we can begin to measure our impact in ELA, ESL, and other learning
  environments.
   
   For the Los Angeles Pilot, would like to use 4 High Schools and 2 Local colleges. We will evaluate the impact of the LitRemix Platform by studying: 
   • student engagement numbers (metric from app itself) 
   • student testimonials
   • teacher testimonials
   • quality of art created
   • frequency of sharing
   • online conversations
   • lesson plan downloads
   • attendance at LitRemix events
   • interest in seeing other books added to the network
   • community reaction – including media interest, literary community, parents
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There are no direct competitors to LitRemix. There are several organizations
  who have embraced art and literature together. They do not specifically make
  the connection between books and the art they inspire, nor do they facilitate
  the creation and sharing of art about specific books taught in school For
  example:
   
   • The BIG READ, funded by the NEA is a strong example of how cities like LA are committed to taking the excitement and power of great books into a larger community forum. This program celebrates one book a year and hosts events to engage a diversity of supporters and participants. 
   
   • Organizations like 826 Valencia, Beyond Baroque Literary Arts, GetLit, PEN USA, and WriteGirl all celebrate the fusion of reading and writing here in LA and even across the country.
   
   • There are apps available that connect people together through the act of reading (LightSail, Subtext, LiquidTex). These do not leverage the strengths of students who express and learn differently – through sound, art and movement – instead of verbal or written book reports.
   
   What’s so striking about the power of art inspired by literature is how rich the resources truly are – but how DISPARATE they are. No one entity has yet to AGGREGATE the best movies, visual art and music inspired by specific books. Ironically, services like Amazon sell all these types of media but never offer a bundle to help inspire and educate people. That is not their core business – to cross reference – as logical as it might seem.
   
   LitRemix is extremely unique. What if all the art that one book inspires was aggregated for immediate access through a single source? It would be one of the richest resources on earth, where anyone could mine for stories, told through all modes of artistic expression - written, aural, visual, mixed-media.
   
   We're building LitRemix to ensure that a platform exists to introduce and celebrate literature through the art it inspires. It will sit at the nexus of rich media, mobile, and social growth, and will drive instant engagement and collaboration. While being a cultural phenomena in its own right, LitRemix will also help both striving and struggling readers engage meaningfully with literature - by meeting them on their 21st century map of the world. LitRemix will expand the traditionally isolating experience of reading into a realm of discovery, sharing, and creating.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  We are actively engaging students, teachers and parents to help inform every
  step of our development and pilot process. Specifically, we have a student
  from Santa Monica College (a graduate of Santa Monica High) who has been given
  some equity ownership in LitRemix. He is also the technology lead on the app
  development. Our lead designer is a student who lives in Spain (also an equity
  partner) and brings the bilingual element to our project. She has a degree in
  both design and education. 
   
   We are also in early conversations with teachers from Mozilla’s Hive network. They are just about to start a chapter in Los Angeles. Alexander Fishman is one of our advisors and has been tapped to lead the Hive. Hives are comprised of organizations (libraries, museums, schools and non-profit startups) and individuals (educators, designers, community catalysts and makers). Together, they create opportunities for youth to learn within and beyond the confines of traditional classroom experiences, design innovative practices and tools that build the field for greater impact, and contribute to their own professional development within an active community of practice. 
   
   Because of our 10 + years with Artists for Literacy, we also have collaborators in the library system. We will be reaching out to branch libraries all across the city, to ensure that they have the chance to participate with the first launch of the LitRemix – Odyssey version. We’ll be holding events at their locations, to increase traffic to their campuses and spread the word about our learning platform.
   
   Our use of the 100k will not be going directly to these collaborators. We will be discussing the use of the 100k in the next section.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Specific to our strategy and tactical plans for expansion, LitRemix will grow
  and scale based on how we plot out our expansion city-by-city. As stated
  earlier, our pilot schools – both HS and College will be our focus for the
  first 4-month pilot. With the feedback from these groups, we will take on more
  territories within LA and more sister-cities. We’ll expand out to Baldwin
  Hills, Culver City, Silver Lake, and the Valley. We also have teachers in San
  Francisco, Kansas, Arkansas, Florida and Chicago standing by. 
   
   Students in Venice High School reading “The Odyssey” might be given the chance to collaborate on a music video with students who live in Detroit. Also, a teacher in Florida sharing a teaching tip on how to include of particular work of art about The Odyssey into a lesson-flow, might be considering art created by a student from Westchester. This not only scales the variety of art – but expands the network’s ability to show differing perspectives – diversity of thought. Because our site is bi-lingual for Spanish speakers, we also hope to be expanding into Spanish-speaking populations within Los Angeles and sister cities. 
   
   The expansion of LitRemix is critical to its impact on each learner who participates in the network. The more books we integrate – with more calls for submissions for the art they inspire – the more powerful the LitRemix experience will be. Equally important are the increasing members of teachers who can contribute to the pedagogical direction of the platform. Teaching tips and lesson plans will be crowd-sourced, with partnerships with organizations like Graphite.org – a Common Sense Media community. We believe that as LitRemix scales and expands, student buzz and engagement around reading books will take on a new, enthusiastic vibe.
   
   While we scale our product over time, we will also focus on keeping it accessible to all students. Access to browse the platform will always be free. To fully participate, create a profile, exchange creative files – these activities will require log-in, which comes with premium access. This keeps the network safe, and enables us to curate the art as it comes in. Premium access to the network will be granted at the individual, group and district-wide levels, with associated fees subject to each context.
   
   The LitRemix vision is a fantastic mash-up of music, videos, and visual art from all over the world –celebrating some of the greatest works of both classic and modern literature.
