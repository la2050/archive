title: The Good Grief Garden
project_summary: "We envision a pilot community garden whose central purpose is to do what food has done for millennia: To satisfy not just empty stomachs and our need for physical health, but our social and emotional needs and our hunger for community. \r\n\r\nThe garden will serve as a center of healing for those navigating grief, where individuals of all ages can get their hands dirty with others walking the same paths, discovering over shared meals and shared experience that they are not alone. \r\n"

  'DESCRIBE IN GREATER DETAIL HOW YOU WILL MAKE LA THE HEALTHIEST PLACE TO LIVE: ': "The same places where we see food instability are the same places where we see disproportionate loss. Fifty percent of inner-city kids will experience the sudden loss of a family member before they're 21. We cannot talk about poverty, race, systems-failure, or opportunity without talking about grief. If we’re to build resilient communities, and to solve the problems we need to solve in LA, we need to start by building authentic relationships between the people who make up this city. That starts by choosing to share the things we typically avoid, beginning with loss and grief.\r\n\r\nHOW: \r\n- GROW: During the building phase, we will work with LA-based Hope After Project to design and custom-build four community service memorials. These memorials will invite those who have experienced grief to volunteer in memory of their loved ones. Teams may work on everything from painting the mural, to planting the garden, to building benches. The end result will not only be a thriving garden, but a series of living memorials within it: each a tribute to an extraordinary life lost. Moreover, building on LA’s thriving street art scene, we’ll commission a collaborative mural to honor and celebrate the ways in which the legacies of the dead endure through the living, and invite the public to join us in painting it.  \r\n- HARVEST: During a one-month span of the harvest season, we will bring together Angelenos of varying ages, creeds, and cultural and economic backgrounds for a dinner series and a chance to share in the foods of the garden, and to talk openly about our experiences of grief and loss and what it means to live well after. We'll invite dinner guests--chefs, storytellers, students & teachers, doctors & patients, police officers & those they serve--to learn about the stories beneath the stereotypes, about their respective roads traveled, and the losses and setbacks and sources of resilience that have made them who they are.  \r\n- SPREAD: We’ll film the series & share it as an episode on The Kitchen Widow, & develop a downloadable toolkit for others looking to create their own Grief Gardens. The toolkit will include everything from the science of food rituals & grief, to community gardening 101, to tips/suggested conversation-starters for facilitating a conversation about loss & life after over a meal. Finally, we’ll use the conversation series to create several accompanying toolkits, such as exercises & tips for parents/educators to talk to kids about grief and loss. "

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "The biggest challenge is securing a site for the garden. We are currently in exploratory conversations with the Library Foundation of LA, building on the role of LA's libraries as curators of conversations that matter and as one of the few remaining gathering places that reflect the unique makeup of the communities of which they are a part. However, we are exploring various options, including schools situated in a neighborhood where both food insecurity and chronic loss are endemic, or in a public park or similar location. We are aiming for a space that can house a medium-sized garden, capable of holding at least six-ten raised beds, and a farm table available for use via sign-up by families, community groups and individuals looking for a chance to share a meal together.  \r\n\r\nA part-time gardener, together with a team of volunteers, will ensure that the garden is well-tended and welcoming throughout the year."
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "We will measure our success on three levels: \r\n- Direct engagement, as measured through number of volunteers, number of visitors and frequency of use by members of the local community (with a focus on those with limited access to healthy food), number of meals served, and diversity among participants. \r\n- Cultural reach, as measured by number and reach of press hits and social media shares, number of toolkit downloads, etc. \r\n- Self-perception & perception of others: Through surveys & facilitated reflections with dinner guests/visitors throughout the year, we will examine the garden’s impact on participants’ feelings of physical and emotional well-being, mindset and feelings of agency, and empathy toward others both within and outside their own schools and communities. \r\n\r\nWe aim to realize a day in which those who have experienced trauma and loss are recognized not as objects of pity, but as better listeners and better leaders, characterized by profound empathy, resilience & agency."
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "When it comes to tackling food insecurity, there’s no such thing as competition: We’re all in this together. Our ability to build authentic community and to elevate a broader cultural change depends on our ability to secure a wide array of partners, and working hand-in-hand with existing community gardening programs and other grassroots organizations working in LA’s high-poverty neighborhoods.\r\n\r\nAlready, school and community gardens are increasingly commonplace, thanks in large part to organizations like LA Green Grounds, Enrich LA, The LA Community Garden Center, The Kitchen Community, Pacoima Beautiful, The Collaborative Eagle Rock Beautiful, Occidental College's FEAST Organic Garden and Edible Schoolyard. Efforts like Michelle Obama’s Let’s Move campaign have highlighted the need for fresh fruit and vegetables in public school lunches, and recognized school gardening programs as a tool to fight childhood obesity. \r\n\r\nLess common are memorial gardens: Spaces designed so that grieving individuals and families can gather to remember loved ones, and for a few hours, focus their attention on growing new things. To our knowledge, no such community garden exists in LA. What’s more, few of these efforts make the conversations around the table, and the connections, empathy, and healing gained there, the explicit focal point of the garden. \r\n\r\nThe Good Grief Garden will be unique in doing all three: Addressing and raising awareness of food insecurity in high-poverty areas, creating an accessible and rejuvenating space for healing after loss--particularly among those subject to chronic trauma--and using the dinner table to create a unique bridge-builder across demographic lines. \r\n"

    Our current budget estimates come to $107,600, however, we believe that many

    will depend on the size of the garden. We plan to cover any expenses
    exceeding $100,000 through joint fundraisers in partnership with local LA

    dinner table for free, we will occasionally rent out the space for private
    events in order to generate sustaining revenue.
