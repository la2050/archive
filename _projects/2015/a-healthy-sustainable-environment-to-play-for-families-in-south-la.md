  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to play.: "Tickleberry Place was designed to meet the unique needs of South LA. Historically, South LA has a lack of access to safe play spaces and limited healthy food choices. This limits opportunities for children to play and for parents to connect in a public space. Tickleberry caters to Families of color (POC) with young children. Tickleberry begins in South LA as it is the highest need region for issues of food access and play space. However, the location of Tickleberry makes it accessible to the greater Los Angeles’ Community and welcomes participation from families across the city. Eventually, it is the goal of the founders to expand Tickleberry into other regions of the city, so families have healthful play spaces.\r\n\r\nOur environment is changing everyday and it is a mission for us to create a sustainable environment in our play space. Local businesses and corporations have a huge impact on the environment with large amounts of energy and water usage, as well as producing a large amount of waste. The daily operations and equipment will be sustainable by using energy efficient appliances in the kitchen, reusable utensils, and minimal paper waste. Tickleberry Place wants to be a solution by being a sustainable business that also educates the community on our practices and encourages the community to take on these practices at home.\r\n \r\nOur children are exposed to a large number of harsh chemicals and toxic materials. Tickleberry Place will be a play space made from environmentally friendly materials. In addition, we will use products and methods to keep the play space toxic free. This is particularly important as about 1 in 11 children have asthma in Los Angeles. To reduce the amount of germs on our equipment and toys, we will ensure that there is regular cleaning and disinfecting throughout the day.\r\n \r\nAnother important aspect about Tickleberry Place is its food. There is a strong need in the community; Very few local restaurants provide organic, and healthier alternatives. In the facility, will be a full service kitchen that will be serving food made from fresh, clean, local, and organic ingredients. Tickleberry Place will offer a variety of choices that are fresh and modern, opposed to the large number of fast food restaurants in the area. Our menu will address the growing demand for healthier options in South Los Angeles. "

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "The major challenge that Tickleberry Place faces is gaining access to funds to open our play space. It’s particularly difficult for small organizations such as Tickleberry Place to obtain capital to operate, especially when founded by People of Color (POC). To overcome that challenge we will continue to participate in the community to increase our following. For example, we do monthly activities for kids at the Baldwin Hills Farmers’ Market, as well as actively participating at the annual Community Garden Council Event. These events give us the support for when we go to investors.\r\n"
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Tickleberry Place will be nothing less than a top quality facility and will raise the value of the community. We will evaluate our work in the areas of Health, Sustainability, as well as Social and Economic Growth. \r\n\r\nHealth will be evaluated by the number of families we impact, obesity rating of Los Angeles community overtime, relationships and an increased demand for healthier food options in our community. \r\n\r\nWe will evaluate our sustainability work based on the number of families and organizations that take on more sustainable practices at home and in our community. Through education we will positively impact behavior where more local businesses, families, and communities are recycling materials and using toxic-free products.   \r\n\r\nLastly, we will measure the number of children enrolled in our education programs, participation at community events, increase in employment opportunities, and expansion in various small business and services available in South LA. \r\n\r\n"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "Direct Local Competitors:\r\nChuck E.

Tickleberry Place has competition from Giggles N Hugs, Kiddie City LA, and Under the Sea Playground.\r\n\r\nWhat is unique about Tickleberry Place is that we will provide an improved experience for the entire family by having a clean and toxic-free indoor play space with a full service organic food restaurant. Having an indoor space is an alternative to outdoor parks when Los Angeles experiences climate change and during nighttime hours. In addition, upkeep for parks is not consistent. Our play space will be regularly monitored to insure a clean space and will be accessible throughout the day. \r\n\r\nWhat is also unique about our approach is that we are conducive to the environment, familiar with the community’s needs, and will be in a location that serves progressive families with lack of play spaces. Having Tickleberry Place located in the South Los Angeles area gives us of advantage of providing for an underserved community. Most importantly, Tickleberry Place will act as a community partner for families in South Los Angeles."
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-

    from our work and impacting our community. For example, we have a
    partnership with the Baldwin Hills Farmers’ Market  where the community
    benefits from our presence by bringing more families to the the farmers
    market. We also will be be providing childcare and activities for Los
    Angeles Community Garden Council at their annual Community Garden event.
