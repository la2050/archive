project_summary: >-
  Tickleberry Place is looking for support with opening a healthy play space for
  kids and families of South LA that fosters creativity, encourages independent
  thinking, promotes community engagement, and introduces a new method of social
  play. Our space will create this experience by offering a healthy sustainable
  environment that includes active jungle gyms, toys, enriched classes,
  educational activities, community events, and a space to enjoy organic and
  locally sourced food.
Please specify below: 'Baldwin hills, Leimert Park, Inglewood, and Mid-City'

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Tickleberry Place was designed to meet the unique needs of South LA.
  Historically, South LA has a lack of access to safe play spaces and limited
  healthy food choices. This limits opportunities for children to play and for
  parents to connect in a public space. Tickleberry caters to Families of color
  (POC) with young children. Tickleberry begins in South LA as it is the highest
  need region for issues of food access and play space. However, the location of
  Tickleberry makes it accessible to the greater Los Angeles’ Community and
  welcomes participation from families across the city. Eventually, it is the
  goal of the founders to expand Tickleberry into other regions of the city, so
  families have healthful play spaces.
   
   Our environment is changing everyday and it is a mission for us to create a sustainable environment in our play space. Local businesses and corporations have a huge impact on the environment with large amounts of energy and water usage, as well as producing a large amount of waste. The daily operations and equipment will be sustainable by using energy efficient appliances in the kitchen, reusable utensils, and minimal paper waste. Tickleberry Place wants to be a solution by being a sustainable business that also educates the community on our practices and encourages the community to take on these practices at home.
    
   Our children are exposed to a large number of harsh chemicals and toxic materials. Tickleberry Place will be a play space made from environmentally friendly materials. In addition, we will use products and methods to keep the play space toxic free. This is particularly important as about 1 in 11 children have asthma in Los Angeles. To reduce the amount of germs on our equipment and toys, we will ensure that there is regular cleaning and disinfecting throughout the day.
    
   Another important aspect about Tickleberry Place is its food. There is a strong need in the community; Very few local restaurants provide organic, and healthier alternatives. In the facility, will be a full service kitchen that will be serving food made from fresh, clean, local, and organic ingredients. Tickleberry Place will offer a variety of choices that are fresh and modern, opposed to the large number of fast food restaurants in the area. Our menu will address the growing demand for healthier options in South Los Angeles.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  The major challenge that Tickleberry Place faces is gaining access to funds to
  open our play space. It’s particularly difficult for small organizations such
  as Tickleberry Place to obtain capital to operate, especially when founded by
  People of Color (POC). To overcome that challenge we will continue to
  participate in the community to increase our following. For example, we do
  monthly activities for kids at the Baldwin Hills Farmers’ Market, as well as
  actively participating at the annual Community Garden Council Event. These
  events give us the support for when we go to investors.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Tickleberry Place will be nothing less than a top quality facility and will
  raise the value of the community. We will evaluate our work in the areas of
  Health, Sustainability, as well as Social and Economic Growth. 
   
   Health will be evaluated by the number of families we impact, obesity rating of Los Angeles community overtime, relationships and an increased demand for healthier food options in our community. 
   
   We will evaluate our sustainability work based on the number of families and organizations that take on more sustainable practices at home and in our community. Through education we will positively impact behavior where more local businesses, families, and communities are recycling materials and using toxic-free products. 
   
   Lastly, we will measure the number of children enrolled in our education programs, participation at community events, increase in employment opportunities, and expansion in various small business and services available in South LA.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: |-
  Direct Local Competitors:
   Chuck E. Cheese
   Parks
   California Science Center
   Kiddie City LA
   
   Direct Competitors:
   Giggles N Hugs
   Under the Sea Playground
   The Coop LA
   
   There are a few places that are doing similar work in the Los Angeles area. Tickleberry Place has competition from Giggles N Hugs, Kiddie City LA, and Under the Sea Playground.
   
   What is unique about Tickleberry Place is that we will provide an improved experience for the entire family by having a clean and toxic-free indoor play space with a full service organic food restaurant. Having an indoor space is an alternative to outdoor parks when Los Angeles experiences climate change and during nighttime hours. In addition, upkeep for parks is not consistent. Our play space will be regularly monitored to insure a clean space and will be accessible throughout the day. 
   
   What is also unique about our approach is that we are conducive to the environment, familiar with the community’s needs, and will be in a location that serves progressive families with lack of play spaces. Having Tickleberry Place located in the South Los Angeles area gives us of advantage of providing for an underserved community. Most importantly, Tickleberry Place will act as a community partner for families in South Los Angeles.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  We do not have direct collaborators for the LA2050 Grant challenge that will
  receive portions of the funding. We currently have partnerships that benefit
  from our work and impacting our community. For example, we have a partnership
  with the Baldwin Hills Farmers’ Market where the community benefits from our
  presence by bringing more families to the the farmers market. We also will be
  be providing childcare and activities for Los Angeles Community Garden Council
  at their annual Community Garden event.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
