title: LIFT-LA Member2Member Project
project_summary: >-
  LIFT-LA’s model is predicated on the belief that poverty is complicated,
  getting help should not be-- more connected families are more likely to manage
  crises and move out of poverty. We will augment our current model by
  sharpening our focus to work with parents with young children to truly break
  the cycle of poverty. We will build the formal and informal supports necessary
  to get resources directly into their hands.

  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "LIFT measures Member progress in two ways:\r\n\r\n1. We track financial progress (employment, housing) in our online case management system, Link.\r\n\r\n2. Second, we utilize Constituent Voice (CV), a system that utilizes micro-surveys to capture participant feedback about service quality and personal and social foundations after each Member meeting. Similar to the way that for-profit organizations use consumer feedback to improve product quality and service, CV enables LIFT to solicit feedback on its services from our members' rating.\r\n\r\nLIFT was one of the first non-profits in the country to implement CV. Our data shows that individuals that score high on the personal and social factors are twice as likely to sustain progress on their financial goals. We have also learned that social connectedness may be the most predictive indicator of economic success. Using this information, we implement program refinements that, through CV, our members are telling us make a difference in their lives."

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  In building a dual generation approach to poverty alleviation, LIFT-LA will
  build on its model to connect parents with children to the resources needed to
  address short term financial crisis. We recognize that stability is about more
  than income. At LIFT, they are connected with a volunteer advocate who
  provides sustained support helping community members navigate a host of
  resources from public benefits enrollment to eviction prevention. Building
  trusting relationships and partnering to achieve goals, like better employment
  and education, are foundational elements that impact children’s long-term
  outcomes. Patty came to us homeless, living in her car with her son. In one
  month, they found a home that they love plus health care, job training, and
  transportation assistance for her son to get to school. Since 2013, LIFT-LA
  has created positive outcomes almost 3,000 families like Patty’s- in 2014 we
  put over a half million dollars back into the pockets of the members we serve
  and has established itself as a model for more effective and human-centered
  service. 
   
   In Our Kids, Putnam asserts that strong community bonds and social networks results in increased health, happiness, economic success, and child welfare. We all count on others to get ahead often utilizing the 3 f’s—family, friends, and Facebook. Like financial capital, social capital (including that afforded by social media) is distributed unevenly with higher income families having a more robust network than poorer families. Member2Member delivers goods and services from those who are well-connected and wanting to be of help to those who are socially isolated with a myriad of barriers to access support. We know that a $3,000 increase in parents’ income during a child’s early years is associated with a 17 percent increase in the child’s future earnings. A 2006 trial in Vietnam gave one-off handouts to 550 households; two years later, local poverty rates had fallen by 20 percentage points. We also know that intervening early to support the development of a high-quality relationship between parent and child mitigates the negative impact of toxic stress, a risk factor for lifelong health and social problems. Imagine the returns if we invested in this type of resource exchange. How might we fundamentally alter the trajectory of children’s lives? Our hope is that we can create a brighter and richer childhood for the next generation and, in doing so, make LA a healthier place to live.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Our focus on parents presents us the opportunity to optimize limited time and
  resources to make the greatest impact. However, we will need to reshape our
  model to break the cycle of intergenerational poverty. New considerations will
  include: How should we differently design our physical space (childcare space,
  lactation rooms)? Which partners best support parents? What outcomes will we
  need to track parental AND child-level progress? We have embarked in a process
  that will allow us to define, hypothesize, design, and test key levers that
  will be the most impactful. A specific activation includes cash/resource
  transfers, our Member2Member program. In order to make this successful, we
  need to build the ideal platform for the transaction and develop rules for
  selecting and engaging members. We have developed a minimally viable product-
  a low tech outreach to well-resourced stakeholders and their networks- to
  apply our design process detailed above.

  LIFT measures Member progress in two ways:
   
   1. We track financial progress (employment, housing) in our online case management system, Link.
   
   2. Second, we utilize Constituent Voice (CV), a system that utilizes micro-surveys to capture participant feedback about service quality and personal and social foundations after each Member meeting. Similar to the way that for-profit organizations use consumer feedback to improve product quality and service, CV enables LIFT to solicit feedback on its services from our members' rating.
   
   LIFT was one of the first non-profits in the country to implement CV. Our data shows that individuals that score high on the personal and social factors are twice as likely to sustain progress on their financial goals. We have also learned that social connectedness may be the most predictive indicator of economic success. Using this information, we implement program refinements that, through CV, our members are telling us make a difference in their lives.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  After a site visit, a Program Officer from the Ahmanson Foundation stated “I
  have been with the foundation for 26 years and I thought I saw everything LA
  has to offer, but today you showed me that I haven’t.” LIFT-LA capitalizes on
  the strength of existing community resources by creating reciprocal
  partnerships with strong social service organizations. We are well-positioned
  to partner with a wide variety of organizations that may do one, but not all
  of the aspects of what we are able to do. Reputable organizations providing
  strong services are excited to partner with LIFT-LA knowing that their model
  does not replicate nor duplicate, but rather adds to the capacity to perform
  great work in a world of limited funding and lean staff. That said, Imagine
  LA’s model also works with volunteers to help families out of poverty. We have
  found that with technology, and a different subset of volunteers, we have been
  able to reach much greater volume (less than 100/year vs. over 900/year) with
  much less cost. We also seeking to learn from other organizations that have
  developed direct resource exchange such as Benevolent, Chrysalis, and the
  Family Independence Initiative, but again, feel that there are aspects of our
  model—scale, the import on relationship, the type of resource being
  exchanged—that differentiate our work and will add to a growing base of
  knowledge around disruptive solutions to poverty alleviation. In addition,
  while constituent voice well-established among nonprofits in the developing
  world, LIFT is leading the way for this work in the U.S. as one of the first
  American social service providers to incorporate CV into its evaluation
  framework.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  LIFT works with a variety of partners – housing programs, youth organizations,
  health clinics – to ensure clients are able to access resources. LIFT receives
  thousands of referrals from its partners, who lean on LIFT to provide
  complementary support to their case managers who cannot provide personalized
  services due to strict eligibility and scarce resources. LIFT builds the
  capacity of its partners, changing the landscape of the social service system
  and encouraging more organizations to work together to fight poverty.
  Accordingly, we are a select member of LA:Rise administered by REDF and the
  City of LA’s Department of Economic and Workforce Development to provide
  support services to families enrolled in social enterprises like Chrysalis,
  Homeboy Industries, and others. As we shift to a two-generation frame, we will
  continue to grow our partners strategically, focusing on organizations that
  deliver child-centered outcomes.The Magnolia Place Community Initiative (MCI)
  unites 75+ organizations to create scalable community improvement. As many of
  the organizations in the MCI are focused on supporting children, LIFT fills
  the gap in helping parents to support their family unit. LIFT-LA is truly the
  partner that MCI has been waiting for- the connective tissue mobilizing the
  network, and ensruing that community members understand, access, and utilize
  the resources available. UCLA Center for Healthier Children, Families, and
  Communities will be working with LIFT-LA to codify its goal planning process
  to develop road maps for families to bring about increased outcomes in health,
  education, economic stability, and parental bonding. As part of the
  Member2Member program, we have developed relationships with SoLA rentals to
  prioritize apartments for LIFT-LA families to be matched with a $2,000 fund
  for each family to use to reach stability. We are also working with an
  investor to develop a JFLA LIFT fund to provide funds for members who earn
  enough to pay the rent but not the security deposit in a move into a safe and
  affordable home. LIFT-LA benefits from nationwide participation in
  organizations working to tackle the cycle of poverty, including:
   • The Aspen Ascend Network working to address two-generation poverty
   • The Fund for Shared Insight using the voice of participants as an evaluative measure
   • America Forward: social entrepreneurs and policymakers influencing national change 
   • Service Nation deploying young people in service to improve communities.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  LIFT is focused on changing the systems that stifle social mobility for
  millions of vulnerable families. 
   At the heart of this work is perception change – in order to create a social service system that successfully supports families’ progress, those who are designing the system must fundamentally understand what the poor need, and that it is no different than the supports the middle and upper classes need to thrive. LIFT is currently developing an influence strategy to share its results and stories with key influencers, leveraging our position to shift perceptions and drive meaningful change for families in the social service system. 
   
   As we learn from our work with families, we hope to refine our message and approach to more specifically drive shifts that will create a more enabling environment for parents and their children to achieve mobility. Examples of this could be partnering with a technology company to bring aspects of our model to scale for millions of low-income Angelinos. The support from LA2050 will help us build the foundation upon which we can create a broader platform to amplify our insights and impact for low-income families. 
   
   LIFT engages its cohort of advocates (mainly college students) in direct service every year. Simultaneously, the LIFT experience also pushes our advocates to grapple with the US’s most challenging issues related to poverty, race, inequality, and policy. Many of our advocates are transformed by the LIFT experience and continue to dedicate themselves to fighting poverty, whether through their chosen career, serving on nonprofit boards, or advocating in their communities. 
   
   We recognize that by delivering excellent outcomes, we can become an influential demonstration model that speaks to what works. From this platform we can persuade leaders across the philanthropic, for-profit, nonprofit, and government sectors to adapt best practices that can interrupt the cycle of poverty at scale and create a brighter future for the next generation of children.
