title: LIFT-LA Member2Member Project
project_summary: >-
  LIFT-LA’s model is predicated on the belief that poverty is complicated,
  getting help should not be-- more connected families are more likely to manage
  crises and move out of poverty. We will augment our current model by
  sharpening our focus to work with parents with young children to truly break
  the cycle of poverty. We will build the formal and informal supports necessary
  to get resources directly into their hands.

Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "LIFT measures Member progress in two ways:\r\n\r\n1. We track financial progress (employment, housing) in our online case management system, Link.\r\n\r\n2. Second, we utilize Constituent Voice (CV), a system that utilizes micro-surveys to capture participant feedback about service quality and personal and social foundations after each Member meeting. Similar to the way that for-profit organizations use consumer feedback to improve product quality and service, CV enables LIFT to solicit feedback on its services from our members' rating.\r\n\r\nLIFT was one of the first non-profits in the country to implement CV. Our data shows that individuals that score high on the personal and social factors are twice as likely to sustain progress on their financial goals. We have also learned that social connectedness may be the most predictive indicator of economic success. Using this information, we implement program refinements that, through CV, our members are telling us make a difference in their lives."

  - Money (financial capital)
