  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: "PortTech helps entrepreneurs transform high-aspiration ideas into high-performance companies to solve pressing global challenges by supporting innovative technology startups linked to the ports/goods movement industry. \r\n\r\nThrough the PortTech Pitch program, PortTech identifies emerging technologies that address transportation, energy and environmental challenges. Many of these solutions address the impacts of port operations on local communities. The PortTech Pitch program is comprised of three phases – entrepreneur mentoring followed by the Pitch competition and EXPO.\r\n\r\nFirst, PortTech prepares startup companies for growth. The months-long Pitch program provides entrepreneurs with one-on-one coaching, constructive critiques and mock judging sessions to prepare them to vie for markets, audiences and resources to grow.\r\n\r\nSecond, PortTech’s Pitch Competition Finals readies startups for real-world competition. Finalists chosen from startups participating in the mentoring program present their companies to a panel of experts who judge their viability. The day-long contest draws hundreds of participants – entrepreneurs and investors, industry and civic leaders, students and researchers – who view the event live or via webcast. For many entrepreneurs, it’s the moment they pull the wraps off their idea and launch their company into the real world. \r\n\r\nThird, the PortTechEXPO engages Los Angeles-Long Beach port communities through top-notch speakers, tech demonstrations and industry panels. The EXPO attracts media attention and 600 professionals annually. Through the EXPO, PortTech provides meaningful education opportunities for local students and community members to learn about technology and innovation during panel discussions, guided tours, and conversations with entrepreneurs and port leaders.\r\n\r\nThis comprehensive three-pronged program is key to PortTech’s success and the growth of the entrepreneurial ecosystem in the region. It embodies the important work we do as we coach startup companies, showcase their good works publicly and explain to the broader community what our work is about.\r\n\r\nAs our entrepreneurs succeed they contribute to the local economy by creating jobs in marginalized communities adjacent to the Ports. By 2050, PortTech will be the nexus of a thriving technology and advanced manufacturing-based business cluster. The Ports will run cleaner, greener and more efficient. And the Harbor area will be an economic development engine in the L.A. region. "
