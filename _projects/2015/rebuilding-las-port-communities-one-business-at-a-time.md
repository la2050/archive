  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: "PortTech helps entrepreneurs transform high-aspiration ideas into high-performance companies to solve pressing global challenges by supporting innovative technology startups linked to the ports/goods movement industry. \r\n\r\nThrough the PortTech Pitch program, PortTech identifies emerging technologies that address transportation, energy and environmental challenges. Many of these solutions address the impacts of port operations on local communities. The PortTech Pitch program is comprised of three phases – entrepreneur mentoring followed by the Pitch competition and EXPO.\r\n\r\nFirst, PortTech prepares startup companies for growth. The months-long Pitch program provides entrepreneurs with one-on-one coaching, constructive critiques and mock judging sessions to prepare them to vie for markets, audiences and resources to grow.\r\n\r\nSecond, PortTech’s Pitch Competition Finals readies startups for real-world competition. Finalists chosen from startups participating in the mentoring program present their companies to a panel of experts who judge their viability. The day-long contest draws hundreds of participants – entrepreneurs and investors, industry and civic leaders, students and researchers – who view the event live or via webcast. For many entrepreneurs, it’s the moment they pull the wraps off their idea and launch their company into the real world. \r\n\r\nThird, the PortTechEXPO engages Los Angeles-Long Beach port communities through top-notch speakers, tech demonstrations and industry panels. The EXPO attracts media attention and 600 professionals annually. Through the EXPO, PortTech provides meaningful education opportunities for local students and community members to learn about technology and innovation during panel discussions, guided tours, and conversations with entrepreneurs and port leaders.\r\n\r\nThis comprehensive three-pronged program is key to PortTech’s success and the growth of the entrepreneurial ecosystem in the region. It embodies the important work we do as we coach startup companies, showcase their good works publicly and explain to the broader community what our work is about.\r\n\r\nAs our entrepreneurs succeed they contribute to the local economy by creating jobs in marginalized communities adjacent to the Ports. By 2050, PortTech will be the nexus of a thriving technology and advanced manufacturing-based business cluster. The Ports will run cleaner, greener and more efficient. And the Harbor area will be an economic development engine in the L.A. region. "

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "One major challenge is recruiting entrepreneurs. PortTech’s unique port/maritime focus is a market sector unfamiliar to many tech startups. The entrepreneurs often underestimate the business opportunities in this demanding and complex industrial environment.\r\n\r\nTo overcome this challenge, we educate entrepreneurs about the challenges and opportunities in and around ports worldwide. We broadcast this message globally to attract and engage innovators.\r\n\r\nAs we succeed in overcoming the first challenge, the second challenge is funding. PortTech is in an entrepreneurial stage of growth. We are expanding programs to serve an increasing number of portfolio clients. And we support entrepreneurs through the long process of business-building – from R&D to production to market acceptance. \r\n\r\nWe continue to raise our organization's profile, forge strong relationships, and support entrepreneurs to attract supporters. The Pitch program embodies all of these efforts to support fundraising."
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "In the short term, we measure success as follows:  \r\n1.\tOutreach: We track the level of participation in social media, attendance at events (professionals and students) and the number of applicants to the PortTech Pitch program.\r\n2.\tEducation: We analyze the quality of our programs and events through surveys, allowing us to continually refine and improve our offerings.\r\n3.\tMentoring: We videotape the entrepreneur presentations and mentor comments so that presenters can review their performance and incorporate feedback. We also video the final competition presentations. The “before vs after” presentations verify the tremendous improvements of entrepreneurs and validate the efficacy of the program.\r\n4.\tStudent Participation: Follow-up interviews are conducted with teachers to solicit feedback for program improvement.\r\n\r\nOver the long term, we measure progress using the following metrics:\r\n-\tJobs created\r\n-\tDollars invested\r\n-\tPilot projects initiated\r\n-\tBusinesses established in the Harbor area"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "According to the National Business Incubator Association, in 2012 there were more than 1,250 incubators in the U.S. In the Los Angeles area alone, there are countless accelerators, incubators, and innovation opportunities – everything from Silicon Beach startup communities to the co-working spaces across the region, to the L.A. Cleantech Incubator downtown. PortTech is actively involved in this tech community collaborating with these organizations to build a network that supports entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nYet, we are unique because PortTech is the ONLY clean tech incubator in the world focused on the port and maritime industry sectors. And we are the only tech incubator in L.A. using a customer/market-centric approach to connect entrepreneurs with business opportunities at ports worldwide.\r\n\r\nMany pitch events are held each year throughout the region. These activities allow entrepreneurs a chance to present their ideas in front of an audience. At the same time, they help connect the tech community and give entrepreneurs much needed opportunities to practice their presentations. But they don't involve the in-depth coaching sessions provided by PortTech’s program, nor do they connect entrepreneurs with port executives and potential customers.\r\n\r\nThe PortTechEXPO also embodies our unique customer/market-centric approach. There are numerous networking and technology showcase events scattered around the region and throughout the year. Los Angeles is also host to countless trade shows and expos focused on every industry imaginable. But the PortTechEXPO brings the best of both of these activities together by attracting entrepreneurs and investors as well as potential customers and collaborators from the port/maritime industry. In our collaborative fashion, we actively encourage participation from incubators and entrepreneurs involved in other competitions such as the Cleantech Open and Ocean Exchange. Many of the Pitch applicants come to us through the research departments at Southern California’s leading universities.\r\n\r\nAnd last but not least, we seek out student participation. Through our connection with ITEP (International Trade Education Programs) and direct outreach to area high schools and community colleges such as POLAHS (Port of Los Angeles High School), LA Harbor College and Long Beach City College, we establish connections to the future tech-savvy skilled workforce. By bringing the Pitch program to students we hope to foster the next generation of entrepreneurs. "
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "Collaboration is critical to successfully support entrepreneurs.  We work with the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, as well as numerous port tenants including terminal operators and trucking companies to connect entrepreneurs to pilot project opportunities. Volunteer professional advisors provide entrepreneurs with expert advice across a wide range of topics from intellectual property to finance to marketing. Relationships with government agencies, elected officials, industry and community groups, and business incubator organizations all make up the ecosystem of resources that help entrepreneurs thrive. Through our partnerships with major Southern California universities, including USC, UCLA and Caltech, we connect student and faculty researchers with real-world business opportunities to support technology commercialization. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the existing collaborative efforts listed above, we will be partnering with two student organizations to increase youth participation in the PortTech Pitch events and plant seeds in developing future entrepreneurs and a skilled local workforce.\r\n•\tITEP – A nonprofit that develops innovative programs integrating internships and career mentoring with the curriculum of high schools throughout Southern California\r\n•\tPOLAHS – A college prep charter high school located in San Pedro with a strong environmental and port technology education program\r\n\r\nLA2050 Grants Challenge funding of $100,000 will be allocated as follows:\r\n•\tEntrepreneur Mentoring: $80,000 PortTech\r\n•\tStudent Activities: $20,000 Total; $17,000 ITEP, $3,000 POLAHS\r\n\r\nDue to budget limitations, in past years, students from three area schools were invited to participate in the PortTechEXPO. With funding from this grant, we will be able to double the number of schools participating, reaching more than 200 at-risk youth from the Harbor area. With ITEP’s assistance, we will develop activities and student guides aimed at increasing students’ understanding of entrepreneurism and the technologies that will help solve the challenges they face every day living in the shadow of the country’s largest port complex.\r\n\r\nStudent participation goals include: \r\n•\tDeveloping Los Angeles and Harbor area students on a path of entrepreneurial thinking\r\n•\tExpanding on school STEM curricula to connect students to real world problems \r\n•\tEncouraging students to connect to a broad entrepreneurial community \r\n•\tInspiring curiosity and awareness of challenges worth solving "
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': "The total budget for the PortTech Pitch program is as follows:\r\n\r\nProfessional Services:  $134,000\r\n•\tMentors/entrepreneur advisors:  $76,000\r\n•\tCommunity outreach:  $36,000\r\n•\tPitch volunteer coaches:  $10,000 (in-kind support)\r\n•\tProgram coordination:  $12,000\r\n\r\nEvent Production (Pitch Finals & EXPO):  $153,000\r\n•\tVenues:  $12,000\r\n•\tCatering:  $42,000\r\n•\tA/V equipment / services:  $22,000\r\n•\tProduction services:  $16,000\r\n•\tAdvertising / design / printing:  $9,000\r\n•\tCommunity outreach:  $20,000\r\n•\tVolunteer docents / judges:  $4,000 (in-kind support)\r\n\r\nStudent Participation at EXPO:  $20,000\r\n•\tSchool coordination:  $4,000\r\n•\tActivities planning:  $8,000\r\n•\tStudent transportation:  $5,000\r\n•\tLunch, materials:  $3,000\t\r\n\r\nPortTech’s total Pitch program budget is just over $300,000. \r\nThis budget supports:\r\n•\t3,000+ entrepreneurs learning about opportunities at Southern California ports\r\n•\t80-100 startup applications reviewed and pitch feedback received\r\n•\t20-25 entrepreneur teams provided in-depth mentoring services\r\n•\t150 attendees at the Pitch Competition Finals and Awards Celebration\r\n•\tCountless attendees (professionals and students) viewed Pitch presentations via webcast\r\n•\t600 professionals attend EXPO\r\n•\t200 high school students participate in EXPO\r\n\r\nFunding from the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, along with additional corporate sponsorships and ticket sales help support the two events (Pitch Competition Finals and the PortTechEXPO) associated with the Pitch program. LA2050 grant funding will support the professional service needs of the program. Grant funding is critical to provide the caliber of entrepreneur support that the Pitch program is known for. If fundraising falls short of the budget, the choices are to support fewer entrepreneur teams, provide fewer mentorship hours to each team, or eliminate the student outreach expansion efforts.\r\n"
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "LA2050 Grants Challenge funding of $100,000 will be used as follows:\r\nProfessional Services:  $80,000\r\n•\tMentors/entrepreneur advisor:  $56,000\r\n    o\tpresentation review entrepreneur pitches\r\n    o\tone-on-one entrepreneur mentoring \r\n    o\ttechnical support: video recording and editing\r\n•\tCommunity outreach:  $18,000\r\n    o\tspeaking engagements: outreach presentations to entrepreneurs\r\n    o\tcommunication: email, social media, website content, press release development \r\n•\tProgram coordination:  $6,000\r\n\r\nStudent Participation at EXPO:  $20,000\r\n•\tSchool coordination:  $4,000\r\n•\tActivities planning:  $8,000\r\n•\tStudent transportation:  $5,000\r\n•\tLunch, materials:  $3,000\r\n"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "In the past three years, PortTech has continuously improved and expanded the Pitch program to reach more entrepreneurs, provide better and more in-depth coaching to the entrepreneurs, and attract the right audience to hear the presentations and attend the EXPO. \r\n\r\nWe can scale the program’s success in the following ways:\r\n\r\n•\tIncrease the number of entrepreneur applicants \r\n    o\tExpand outreach globally using more remote video coaching sessions and presentations\r\n    o\tBroaden applicant focus to include more digital entrepreneurs focused in the transportation and goods movement sector\r\n    o\tIncrease collaborative efforts with organizations such as Cleantech Open and Ocean Exchange to provide an opportunity for entrepreneurs to participate in multiple competitions\r\n\t\r\n•\tIncrease the number of attendees (at events and virtually)\r\n    o\tLeverage our network of incubators, universities and industry professionals to attract more attendees, particularly those outside of the LA area\r\n    o\tBuild relationships beyond Southern California, first along the West Coast and then nationally and internationally to attract a broader geographical audience\r\n\r\n•\tExpand student participation in the Pitch program\r\n    o\tLeverage the video webcast to expand outreach to schools in the greater Los Angeles area to increase student viewing of entrepreneur pitches\r\n    o\tWork with additional partners to introduce the entrepreneurial development process to high school students\r\n    o\tExpand the Pitch program to include a student entrepreneur pitch competition"
