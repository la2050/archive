  'DESCRIBE IN GREATER DETAIL HOW YOU WILL MAKE LA THE HEALTHIEST PLACE TO LIVE: ': "Patterns are among the most powerful structures in nature, in the arts, in our daily lives.\r\n\r\nThe patterns we have followed to house our homeless weren't designed to assist thirteen thousand newly homeless every month amid the worst housing affordability crisis in memory.\r\n\r\nNew patterns are needed. Our program demonstrates a simple pattern that any agency that houses displaced people can use to create low-cost housing for the future.\r\n\r\nIt would teach homeless veterans to convert empty lots into working farms, making use of recent initiatives by the City and County of Los Angeles that encourage urban agriculture. \r\n\r\nFor two years, these veterans would grow healthy, organic food, work full-time, save up a down, and graduate from the program by purchasing their own starter home. \r\n\r\nWhen they no longer want to live there, each veteran would sell this starter home, at the price he or she paid for it, to a housing-trust-approved agency that has made a contractual commitment to not raise the price or the rent either.\r\n\r\nThat's our program. Now here's the pattern.\r\n\r\n1) A housing program, a homeless person and a housing trust, agree to work cooperatively to increase the yield of the system. \r\n\r\n2) The housing program greatly reduces or eliminates that person's cost of living and helps them get a job.\r\n\r\n3) The formerly homeless person works, saves, and buys a starter home. Some people cannot work but receive financial assistance, you could do it that way.\r\n\r\n4) A housing trust eventually facilitates the sale of that home to a housing program, on the condition that its price or rental cost will never go up.\r\n\r\nSome version of each of these elements is in use now, in Los Angeles, but this idea coordinates them, using existing resources to maximize the good we can do.\r\n\r\nYour vote would help four homeless veterans turn empty lots into farms in Los Angeles this year, and then again in two years, and so on, forever. \r\n\r\nThe immediate result is that healthy organic food would start showing up on tables in neighborhoods where few can now afford that luxury. \r\n\r\nBut the pattern can be repeated by every agency that wants to help remove housing cost inflation from the panoply of issues that make solving homelessness such a heavy lift.\r\n\r\nAnd they will, when they see it work.\r\n\r\nIf information is the currency of the twenty first century, then Los Angeles will be defined by the patterns we choose to replicate."

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    Homelessness in Los Angeles is inextricably linked to local government
    policies that have prioritized low density development and made it difficult
    and expensive to build housing for our poorest residents.  Our program
    envisions helping each participant construct a tiny house on a trailer which
    will be placed at an urban farm site. We will advocate that the city allow
    these trailers on these sites; however, if necessary, thanks to recent court
    cases, it is currently legal for Los Angeles residents to reside in trailers
    parked on city streets. 
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "We have developed a checklist of markers that demonstrate each veteran's progress toward self-sufficiency and home ownership. The ultimate measure of the success of this program is that four veterans will purchase starter housing under the terms of an agreement that will preserve each property from cost increases by the end of the pilot program.\r\n\r\n"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    Elements of our approach are currently in use by many other agencies, but
    none are using them to address the rising costs of permanent housing to
    which homeless veterans will need to return.  
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': None.
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    This will be a small-scale pilot model of a much bigger vision, which can be
    reviewed on our website.  The $100,000 will provide start-up funding to
    build tiny homes for four veterans and begin conversion of vacant urban lots
    for agricultural use.  Additional funding for administering and expanding
    the program will come through fundraising, grantwriting and private
    investment.
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Construction Materials $20,000 x 4 veterans = $80,000\r\nMaterials for Urban Garden Site:  $5,000 x 4 sites = $20,000"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    This program is designed to be perpetuated and expanded.  It would require
    additional money for the revolving loan fund, but once in place will
    continue to produce affrdable housing units and opportunities for homeless
    individuals to move to permanent housing and home ownership.
