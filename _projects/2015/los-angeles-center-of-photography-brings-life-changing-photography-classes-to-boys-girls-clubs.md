  Los Angeles Center of Photography Brings Life Changing Photography Classes to

project_summary: >-
  LACP will bring a year-long digital photography program to four Boys & Girls
  Clubs in LA County.  Youngsters from 10-18 learn basic digital photography
  skills, followed by portrait, street photography and documentary classes,
  focused on their lives and communities--but also exposing them to careers. 
  LACP will host a final exhibit for each group in Hollywood—heightening student
  self-esteem by following through with a long-term creative project and helping
  mount the show.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  LACP Founder/Executive Director Julia Dean has volunteered her time to launch
  a pilot program at the Variety Boys & Girls Club in Boyle Heights. There are
  four classes of ten weeks each: Basic Photography, Portrait, Street Shooting
  and Documentary Photo classes. Each serves 15 students, and ideally every
  student would take the sequence. But there’s some attrition. So “the basics”
  are built into all classes, letting new students join later classes. Besides
  technique, the curriculum teaches communication skills, shows the meaning of
  long-term commitment to a project, and enhances pride as students help mount
  the show at LACP’s gallery in Hollywood--where family and friends go to the
  opening. 
   The history of Boyle Heights, where gangs were prevalent, meant youngsters were often forced to stay indoors after school for safety. According to Boys & Girls Club staff, many have a parent who is an alcoholic, drug abuser, or simply working too hard to supervise their kids after school. Boys & Girls Club is a refuge where students are dropped off after school and picked up at 8:00 pm. For LACP, the club is a perfect venue: structured, yet students can participate based on their interests. Through networking with other B&G Clubs in LA County, Julia has targeted three other neighborhoods that are similarly disadvantaged, and contacted the Executive Directors. All are enthusiastic about hosting the program. Besides continuing in Boyle Heights, LACP would use the grant to expand to clubs in Lincoln Heights, Venice and Long Beach in 2016. The program meets the metric of making Los Angeles “a better place to create,” as well as “a better place to learn” in overlapping ways. Instructors will introduce students to many career opportunities in professional photography. LACP adult workshops cover a gamut of classes focusing on photography’s applications to many creative industry specializations--advertising/graphic design, editorial/journalistic, older entertainment forms (film, television, music) and digital ones (gaming, website design and more). Photography is involved in LA’s premier manufacturing industries—fashion, food, furniture, toys and products of all kinds. Students learn about fine art photography, and its ecosystem of schools, galleries and publications. The introduction can inspire students to explore many routes into LA’s creative economy--after high school or through higher education in LA’s community colleges, universities or art schools.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  By funding LACP’s photography program at the proposed four Boys & Girls Club
  in 2016, the LA2050 grant will help us make a definite impact on 60 or more
  individual students, whose success we can evaluate. This will allow us to make
  adjustments as needed to the general approach, curriculum and logistical
  issues that may arise. We hope to strengthen our bonds with current and
  prospective partners within that network as well. Of course, challenges will
  remain in continuing the work by raising funds in subsequent years. LACP is
  already seeking out many sources of support, and will continue to do so. With
  programs established in different parts of Los Angeles County, we hope to
  identify potential local funders and sponsors in addition to ones we have
  already identified. We will be sensitive to do so without encroaching on our
  partners at the Boys & Girls Clubs.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Though cameras (especially phone cameras) are everywhere, serious digital
  photography is still a skill to be taught, mastered and perfected. So LACP’s
  program assumes no prior knowledge, and covers basic photo concepts and skills
  first. Pre- and post-tests on this “book knowledge” will be administered for
  each class in the sequence. Equally important, instructors will continuously
  evaluate the creative work done by each student—a process that will culminate
  at the end of 2016 as student photos from each club are selected for the final
  exhibitions. The program director, Julia Dean, will observe classes from time
  to time, to monitor the effectiveness of the instructors and the students’
  progress. A final, extremely useful source of evaluation will be the staff at
  each Boys & Girls Club location. They will observe classes as well, and will
  be in frequent contact with Julia to share their insights over the course of
  the year.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  LACP clearly isn't the only organization offering photography classes to young
  people in Los Angeles County. However, many middle and high schools have seen
  arts education offerings (in general) cut severely, and have only taken small,
  incremental steps toward restoring them in recent years. Community centers and
  some youth-oriented nonprofit arts organizations offer instruction, and some
  Boys & Girls clubs do as well. (We don’t want to encroach on their work, and
  are targeting clubs that do not yet have photography programs.) LACP itself
  offers digital photography courses for teens. For students who already aspire
  to study photography in art school, institutions like Art Center College of
  Design and Otis College of Art and Design have pre-college and portfolio
  preparation classes. But at LACP itself, as well at the colleges, programs are
  fee-based and students need their own transportation to attend.
   
   Several things combine to create LACP’s unique approach. First, we are reaching out to youngsters where they already are: in their own neighborhoods, at a safe, trusted after-school site where they can receive the highest-level instruction in an art form with many possible career opportunities. The in-depth, four-class sequence is unusually comprehensive. It speaks to their current lives and needs for expression by encouraging them to observe—and honor—their own families, friends and neighborhoods. Yet instructors will be drawn from LACP’s unique pool of dedicated teachers, who are also committed photographers pursuing their own careers across art and professional photography. We believe this can have a immediate and potentially life-changing impact on the young people we serve.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  LACP’s partnership with the Boys & Girls Clubs is integral to the mission of
  this outreach program. Leading up to this commitment, LACP has worked in
  collaboration with Spark and Hollywood Heart (organizations that work with
  underserved youth), KidSave (a group that addresses the special needs of
  foster children) and Pablove Shutterbug (a group serving children with
  cancer)—but these were shorter-term activities. LACP has decided to focus on
  these four Boys & Girls Clubs representing a variety of geographic areas in
  Los Angeles County, and they are enthusiastic about hosting the program. LACP
  will administer the funds, and the clubs will provide their venues free of
  charge.

  The cost of the four-class sequence at four Boys & Girls Clubs (including the
  director’s, instructors’ and instructional assistants’ time, digital cameras,
  computers, projectors, software and instructional materials comes to $88,480.
  We estimate the cost of four exhibitions at LACP’s Hollywood galleries to be
  around $2,500, for an additional $10,000 total. This venue will be free, and
  LACP staff will assist instructors and student volunteers in mounting the
  exhibit. The requested amount will cover direct costs for matting and framing
  photos, miscellaneous exhibition supplies and refreshments for each reception
  for students, their families and friends. So all LA2050 funds will be spent
  directly on the students’ experience.

How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  With LACP’s own pool of instructors to draw on, it is easy to envision scaling
  up the program quite rapidly. And with 26 Boys & Girls Clubs in Los Angeles
  County, LACP’s program could be offered to any club that doesn’t already have
  a photography program. The Mar Vista Club has already expressed interest, and
  longer-term plans call for expansion into the San Fernando Valley and South
  Los Angeles. We have already applied to offer a shorter version of the program
  to the LA Unified School District, and are awaiting notification.
   
   At the same time, LACP believes it is important to put the Boys & Girls Clubs where we have already made a commitment on a firm financial basis. If we receive the LA2050 grant in 2016, it will not only allow us to launch the program at four clubs across LA County, we believe the recognition will aid our fundraising for these programs in 2017—as well as plan for further expansion.

    answer: "LACP Founder/Executive Director Julia Dean has volunteered her time to launch a pilot program at the Variety Boys & Girls Club in Boyle Heights.  There are four classes of ten weeks each: Basic Photography, Portrait, Street Shooting and Documentary Photo classes.  Each serves 15 students, and ideally every student would take the sequence.  But there’s some attrition.  So “the basics” are built into all classes, letting new students join later classes.  Besides technique, the curriculum teaches communication skills, shows the meaning of long-term commitment to a project, and enhances pride as students help mount the show at LACP’s gallery in Hollywood--where family and friends go to the opening.  \r\nThe history of Boyle Heights, where gangs were prevalent, meant youngsters were often forced to stay indoors after school for safety.  According to Boys & Girls Club staff, many have a parent who is an alcoholic, drug abuser, or simply working too hard to supervise their kids after school.  Boys & Girls Club is a refuge where students are dropped off after school and picked up at 8:00 pm.  For LACP, the club is a perfect venue: structured, yet students can participate based on their interests.  Through networking with other B&G Clubs in LA County, Julia has targeted three other neighborhoods that are similarly disadvantaged, and contacted the Executive Directors.  All are enthusiastic about hosting the program.  Besides continuing in Boyle Heights, LACP would use the grant to expand to clubs in Lincoln Heights, Venice and Long Beach in 2016.  The program meets the metric of making Los Angeles “a better place to create,” as well as “a better place to learn” in overlapping ways.  Instructors will introduce students to many career opportunities in professional photography.  LACP adult workshops cover a gamut of classes focusing on photography’s applications to many creative industry specializations--advertising/graphic design, editorial/journalistic, older entertainment forms (film, television, music) and digital ones (gaming, website design and more).  Photography is involved in LA’s premier manufacturing industries—fashion, food, furniture, toys and products of all kinds.  Students learn about fine art photography, and its ecosystem of schools, galleries and publications. The introduction can inspire students to explore many routes into LA’s creative economy--after high school or through higher education in LA’s community colleges, universities or art schools.  \r\n"

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      By funding LACP’s photography program at the proposed four Boys & Girls
      Club in 2016, the LA2050 grant will help us make a definite impact on 60
      or more individual students, whose success we can evaluate.  This will
      allow us to make adjustments as needed to the general approach, curriculum
      and logistical issues that may arise.  We hope to strengthen our bonds
      with current and prospective partners within that network as well.  Of
      course, challenges will remain in continuing the work by raising funds in
      subsequent years.  LACP is already seeking out many sources of support,
      and will continue to do so.  With programs established in different parts
      of Los Angeles County, we hope to identify potential local funders and
      sponsors in addition to ones we have already identified.  We will be
      sensitive to do so without encroaching on our partners at the Boys & Girls
      Clubs.  
  - name: Please explain how you will evaluate your work.
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      Though cameras (especially phone cameras) are everywhere, serious digital
      photography is still a skill to be taught, mastered and perfected.  So
      LACP’s program assumes no prior knowledge, and covers basic photo concepts
      and skills first.  Pre- and post-tests on this “book knowledge” will be
      administered for each class in the sequence. Equally important,
      instructors will continuously evaluate the creative work done by each
      student—a process that will culminate at the end of 2016 as student photos
      from each club are selected for the final exhibitions.  The program
      director, Julia Dean, will observe classes from time to time, to monitor
      the effectiveness of the instructors and the students’ progress.  A final,
      extremely useful source of evaluation will be the staff at each Boys &
      Girls Club location.  They will observe classes as well, and will be in
      frequent contact with Julia to share their insights over the course of the
      year.

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "LACP clearly isn't the only organization offering photography classes to young people in Los Angeles County.  However, many middle and high schools have seen arts education offerings (in general) cut severely, and have only taken small, incremental steps toward restoring them in recent years.  Community centers and some youth-oriented nonprofit arts organizations offer instruction, and some Boys & Girls clubs do as well. (We don’t want to encroach on their work, and are targeting clubs that do not yet have photography programs.)  LACP itself offers digital photography courses for teens.  For students who already aspire to study photography in art school, institutions like Art Center College of Design and Otis College of Art and Design have pre-college and portfolio preparation classes.  But at LACP itself, as well at the colleges, programs are fee-based and students need their own transportation to attend.\r\n\r\nSeveral things combine to create LACP’s unique approach.  First, we are reaching out to youngsters where they already are: in their own neighborhoods, at a safe, trusted after-school site where they can receive the highest-level instruction in an art form with many possible career opportunities.  The in-depth, four-class sequence is unusually comprehensive.  It speaks to their current lives and needs for expression by encouraging them to observe—and honor—their own families, friends and neighborhoods.  Yet instructors will be drawn from LACP’s unique pool of dedicated teachers, who are also committed photographers pursuing their own careers across art and professional photography.  We believe this can have a immediate and potentially life-changing impact on the young people we serve.  \r\n"

    label: ''

    answer: >-
      The cost of the four-class sequence at four Boys & Girls Clubs (including
      the director’s, instructors’ and instructional assistants’ time, digital
      cameras, computers, projectors, software and instructional materials comes
      to $88,480.  We estimate the cost of four exhibitions at LACP’s Hollywood
      galleries to be around $2,500, for an additional $10,000 total.  This
      venue will be free, and LACP staff will assist instructors and student
      volunteers in mounting the exhibit. The requested amount will cover direct
      costs for matting and framing photos, miscellaneous exhibition supplies
      and refreshments for each reception for students, their families and
      friends.  So all LA2050 funds will be spent directly on the students’

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "With LACP’s own pool of instructors to draw on, it is easy to envision scaling up the program quite rapidly.  And with 26 Boys & Girls Clubs in Los Angeles County, LACP’s program could be offered to any club that doesn’t already have a photography program.  The Mar Vista Club has already expressed interest, and longer-term plans call for expansion into the San Fernando Valley and South Los Angeles.  We have already applied to offer a shorter version of the program to the LA Unified School District, and are awaiting notification.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, LACP believes it is important to put the Boys & Girls Clubs where we have already made a commitment on a firm financial basis.  If we receive the LA2050 grant in 2016, it will not only allow us to launch the program at four clubs across LA County, we believe the recognition will aid our fundraising for these programs in 2017—as well as plan for further expansion.   \r\n"
