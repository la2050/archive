Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: "LACP Founder/Executive Director Julia Dean has volunteered her time to launch a pilot program at the Variety Boys & Girls Club in Boyle Heights.  There are four classes of ten weeks each: Basic Photography, Portrait, Street Shooting and Documentary Photo classes.  Each serves 15 students, and ideally every student would take the sequence.  But there’s some attrition.  So “the basics” are built into all classes, letting new students join later classes.  Besides technique, the curriculum teaches communication skills, shows the meaning of long-term commitment to a project, and enhances pride as students help mount the show at LACP’s gallery in Hollywood--where family and friends go to the opening.  \r\nThe history of Boyle Heights, where gangs were prevalent, meant youngsters were often forced to stay indoors after school for safety.  According to Boys & Girls Club staff, many have a parent who is an alcoholic, drug abuser, or simply working too hard to supervise their kids after school.  Boys & Girls Club is a refuge where students are dropped off after school and picked up at 8:00 pm.  For LACP, the club is a perfect venue: structured, yet students can participate based on their interests.  Through networking with other B&G Clubs in LA County, Julia has targeted three other neighborhoods that are similarly disadvantaged, and contacted the Executive Directors.  All are enthusiastic about hosting the program.  Besides continuing in Boyle Heights, LACP would use the grant to expand to clubs in Lincoln Heights, Venice and Long Beach in 2016.  The program meets the metric of making Los Angeles “a better place to create,” as well as “a better place to learn” in overlapping ways.  Instructors will introduce students to many career opportunities in professional photography.  LACP adult workshops cover a gamut of classes focusing on photography’s applications to many creative industry specializations--advertising/graphic design, editorial/journalistic, older entertainment forms (film, television, music) and digital ones (gaming, website design and more).  Photography is involved in LA’s premier manufacturing industries—fashion, food, furniture, toys and products of all kinds.  Students learn about fine art photography, and its ecosystem of schools, galleries and publications. The introduction can inspire students to explore many routes into LA’s creative economy--after high school or through higher education in LA’s community colleges, universities or art schools.  \r\n"
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Though cameras (especially phone cameras) are everywhere, serious digital
  photography is still a skill to be taught, mastered and perfected.  So LACP’s
  program assumes no prior knowledge, and covers basic photo concepts and skills
  first.  Pre- and post-tests on this “book knowledge” will be administered for
  each class in the sequence. Equally important, instructors will continuously
  evaluate the creative work done by each student—a process that will culminate
  at the end of 2016 as student photos from each club are selected for the final
  exhibitions.  The program director, Julia Dean, will observe classes from time
  to time, to monitor the effectiveness of the instructors and the students’
  progress.  A final, extremely useful source of evaluation will be the staff at
  each Boys & Girls Club location.  They will observe classes as well, and will
  be in frequent contact with Julia to share their insights over the course of
  the year.          
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
  - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
  - Education/training
  - 'Technical infrastructure (computers, etc.)'
  - Community outreach
  - Network/relationship support
