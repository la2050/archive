  Our "School is Cool" initiative is designed to help our community receive all
  they need to create a base of knowledge, a love of education, and adopt the
  tools needed to thrive in and out of the classroom. We make attendance at
  school a priority and promote academic excellence to all students. By teaching
  students to value the importance of education, we aim to increase their
  overall interest while helping to bridge the gap between the educational
  inequities that currently exist.

  Our “School is Cool” initiative is a prime example of how to positively
  influence and encourage at-risk students to value education! Along with our
  programs targeted to motivate ALL students to achieve academic success, we
  reach out to the entire community promoting the importance of building a
  positive school environment. This, in turn, promotes academic achievement with
  the end result of high school graduation, college and career readiness. 
   
   So far, our program has demonstrated significant improvements in Proficient/Advanced attendance rates at the school wide, K-12, level including both gender and ethnicity. Involving families and members of the community helps to create an overall excitement and buzz among the students and their schools! In the past, we've been able to donate laptops to students graduating from high school who pursue a college education and we have currently added a reward for perfect attendance with wireless tablets that are PERFECT for continued learning while away from school. Creating the desire to learn by providing opportunities for at-risk students to win cool prizes motivates our students to work hard and earn their reward with respect and dignity! 
   
   Thinking about Tomorrow is an organization committed to excellence and holding true to a clear vision and passion for delivering outstanding results with every effort we undertake. Over the years, we have proven the effectiveness of youth leadership development. Our community led programs, developed and managed by a community for a community, make a striking impact on our students. We believe in alternative education and youth leadership development, especially for those from underrepresented minority communities.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Any organization's main barrier when it comes to fully implementing a project
  is secruing the funds necessary to operate at full capacity. Every year, we’ve
  expanded our efforts to cover an increasing amount of students in schools,
  therefore, the need arises to find and secure additional funds! Additionally,
  as we progress through the year, student enrollment increases as students
  begin to attend school more often and qualify to join us in celebrating
  excellent and perfect attendance! Although that is a GREAT problem to have, it
  is still a problem that needs to addressed! One of the easiest ways for us to
  overcome this challenge is to create various online campaigns generating a
  source of income outside of the traditional grassroots efforts. As an example,
  we send out newsletters, promote via social media, and engage our community
  partners in helping to spread the message. Not only are we (directors and
  volunteers) out there collecting donations, but have friendly support nation
  wide.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Working directly with LAUSD's schools, counselors, and teachers allows us to
  maintain record of any given student's attendance in any school! We track
  progress daily, weekly, monthly and annually as students' attendance rates
  progressively increase. Tying this metric of measurement to the students that
  receive backpacks with school supplies provides further proof of our program's
  success. 
   
   It is only through the collaboration of many, that the relationships we've built with the schools, students and their families will have the most impact. We want to make school a fun and safe place, not a place that our students dread. We strive to provide a place that feels like "home away from home." TaT aims to keep kids off the streets and out of trouble. The more students attend school regularly, the easier their transitions will become between elementary school to middle school, middle school to high school, and high school into college and eventually into a career!
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  The difference between Thinking about Tomorrow and the similar other
  organizations that promote the improvement of our educational system is that
  they focus solely on one single aspect. However, the problem is, these
  organizations can't build a pyramid without the base! A pyramid isn't complete
  without it's pointy top! We, at TaT, understand that to see effective change
  we must focus on the overall picture, figure out the underlying causes and
  address both issues with proper solutions. We strive to see the base, the tip,
  and everything in the middle of the pyramid. Our programs are designed to
  target all involved parties - students, teachers, schools, communities, AND
  families! Most of similar organizations only focus on one aspect and not the
  whole. Of course, one of the positive aspects about other organizations that
  do similar work are the opportunities to work with each other to ensure all
  children have the best opportunities to learn to love and value their
  education.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Over the years, TaT has established many community partners along the way, but
  none have been as integral to the success of our School is Cool initiative as
  the Los Angeles Dodgers, Keystone Press, Build-a-Bear, Wal-Mart, Kroger,
  Ralph's and Panera Bread. Together, we have built a solid foundation around
  shared values focused on improving our communities today, for tomorrow.
   
   Our partnership with the LA Dodgers creates a huge opportunity for at risk students as well as their families! Through our program, students with excellent and perfect attendance throughout the year are invited to Dodger Stadium to enjoy a day at the ballpark. Free tickets for the family, $10 vouchers to be used for (food), hats, pennants and tshirts provide the ultimate experience for our students and their families! This past year, we celebrated attendance with over 20,000 at-risk students in 28 of LAUSD's schools.
   
   Keystone Press is another highly significant partnership that provides TaT with our perfect and excellent attendance certificates given to students for consistent attendance. Keystone also provides the certificates of appreciation and all other promotional materials for TaT, including brochures and one-sheet printouts. In total, we've handed out over 50,000 certificates for attendance!
   
   Partnerships with Build-a-Bear, Walmart, Kroger, Ralph's and Panera Bread help get students excited about coming to school EVERYDAY! Through our partnership with these organizations, our program challenges our students weekly, monthly, and annually by providing constant motivation through various in-kind and monetary donations. These businesses provide a wide variety of incentives and rewards for each student eligible by simply going to school!
   
   Above all, one of the most critical factors to the success of our organization's message is the ability to reach as many members of our community as possible. It is often difficult to offset the costs of promotional advertising and we are grateful to our sponsors who provide opportunities to help cover the costs of such materials.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  Roughly, our project costs $50,000; as we expand and more students qualify,
  our costs will increase.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-

   > "Back to School" Supply Drive:
   *Our yearly goal is to collect 500 backpacks filled with an ENTIRE school year of school supplies. Th
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  To achieve desired results to any give task, communication and goals must be
  clear and direct. One must not assume that all involved parties know what is
  expected. This is not realistic. Communication is an important key factor when
  it comes to executing a project or event. When all parties are not on the same
  page, it takes longer for the goal to be achieved.
   
   Working with the entire community can be a daunting task. Often times, unlimited amounts of pressure build, especially when thousands of students and their families are trusting TaT to come through! The advantage of our programming is that we make communication a priority. Communication between the schools and students as well as their families, along with communication between commercial and residential representatives is imperative to a smoothly functioning program. We have learned that it is the disconnection between the members of the community that halt further advancement and success of our programs. However, creating an opportunity for the entire community to celebrate each other builds an unbreakable bond amongst all members of the community!
   
   Additionally, we have learned that people, not just children, need to be excited about learning. Modern technology has both excelled our civilization beyond belief while at the same time has prevented many from eventually reaching their full potential. For many, it has ruined their ability to interact socially and has increased behavioral anxiety. While we realize that we award students at the end of the year with free wifi tablets that can often perpetuate the lack of social behavior, we also realize the tablet's amazing motivating factors for children and we strive to provide our students with the education needed to learn how to use it with moderation. 
   
   So, while we "incentivize" and get our students excited about going to school everyday, we also give them to the tools needed for success in both school and life! We establish within each student a solid foundation of values that are taken home to families and are carried with them forever. We believe that learning NEVER ends and getting people excited about valuing their education isn't just about improving attendance rates or graduation rates, it's about improving their future!
