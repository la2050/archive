  826LA and Young Storytellers will partner to inspire students to discover the
  power of their voice by helping them share their stories with the world. To
  encourage students to develop creative learning behaviors and English &
  Language Arts skills, L.A. must first show our youngest citizens that these
  skills matter by reinforcing that their voices matter. 826LA and Young
  Storytellers will engage volunteers to help today’s students become tomorrow’s

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Los Angeles is the entertainment capital of the world, but the marginalized
  populations that 826LA and Young Storytellers work with do not often have the
  opportunity to share their stories widely. To encourage students to develop
  their English & Language Arts skills and creative learning behaviors that
  encourage lifelong learning, L.A. must first show our youngest citizens that
  these skills matter, that their voices are important, and that their stories
  are valued. By identifying their stories and helping them share those stories
  publicly through writing, 826LA and Young Storytellers will empower young
  people to increase their literacy skills through meaningful self-expression.
  Students will gain important communication skills that will help them succeed
  beyond school as confident, engaged members of their community. Last year, 95%
  of students reported that working with 826LA in their classrooms helped them
  increase their confidence about writing, and 90% of teachers reported a marked
  improvement in their students' writing skills as the result of an 826LA
  project. In the 2014 school year, 97% of Young Storytellers mentors observed a
  growth in their writer’s ability to think creatively, 98% of mentors observed
  a growth in their writer’s confidence, and 88% of parents noticed an
  improvement in the creativity of their children.
   
   Through this project, 826LA and Young Storytellers will partner with local Title I LAUSD schools and teachers to help 2,000 severely disadvantaged students to write their stories. Through a variety of storytelling mediums including but not limited to personal essay, fiction, graphic novels, and screenplays, 826LA and Young Storytellers will provide a safe space for students to develop their literacy skills and give them a platform to share their stories with the world. To help develop the next generation of storytellers, some of today’s entertainment professionals including writers, artists, producers, and filmmakers will mentor students as they write and edit their stories. The culmination of this project will be a book, jointly published by 826LA and Young Storytellers, collecting stories written by students for wide distribution. 826LA and Young Storytellers will celebrate the publication of this book during a public event. Featuring students reading their own words and professional actors dramatizing their screenplays, this public event will provide both a figurative and a literal stage for students to share their stories.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  826LA and Young Storytellers rely on specially trained volunteers, many of who
  are writers, artists, and creative professionals, to support students. While
  projects during school hours enables these organizations to reach high needs
  students, it can be a challenge to engage volunteers during regular school
  hours. To overcome this obstacle, 826LA and Young Storytellers plans to engage
  corporate volunteers from the entertainment industry to mentor the next
  generation of storytellers. These organizations have existing partnerships
  with Bad Robot, Disney, Sony Pictures, Participant Media, Verve, HBO, and AEG
  and will draw upon these partnerships and others to provide support for
  students. Exposure to the entertainment industry is often minimal or
  nonexistent in underserved communities, despite this industry’s role as a
  major economic force in California. These partnerships will not only make this
  project more viable, but will also grow the social capital of the students
  involved.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  826LA and Young Storytellers aim to serve 2,000 students total from Title I
  LAUSD schools (1,000 students per organization). To evaluate the effectiveness
  of this project, the organizations will track the number of students served as
  well as the overall effectiveness of the writing support. 826LA will track its
  effectiveness using qualitative and quantitative surveys for students and
  teachers. Young Storytellers’ evaluation approach takes two distinct forms:
  Outcome and Process Evaluation.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  In Los Angeles, there are other organizations including Write Girl and Get Lit
  that use creative writing to empower students, but 826LA and Young
  Storytellers will uniquely focus on storytelling and mentoring to help
  students find their voice and to express that voice with creativity and
  confidence. 826LA and Young Storytellers have different but complimentary core
  competencies, which they will bring to the project. Young Storytellers, for
  example, excels in bringing students’ writing to life through performance of
  student work by professional actors (on stage and film), whereas 826LA
  showcases student writing in over 250 publications each year. Both
  organizations have more than ten years of experience bringing specially
  trained, creative volunteers into public schools to support students and
  teachers at no cost to the school.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  826LA and Young Storytellers will collaborate on this project, dividing the
  grant evenly between each organization. Both organizations will partner with
  corporate volunteer programs at entertainment and creative companies.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  826LA and Young Storytellers estimates that it was cost approximately $500,000
  to provide support to 2,000 students, to publish a collection of their work,
  and to celebrate their stories at a public event. Expenses beyond the grant
  from the Goldhirsh Foundation would be covered by grants from foundations and
  donations from corporate partners and individual donors. 826LA receives grants
  to support its in-school program from the City of Los Angeles, Department of
  Cultural Affairs and the Los Angeles Dodgers Foundation; Young Storytellers
  receives grant to support its work in schools from the Annenberg Foundation,
  the Dwight Stuart Youth Fund, and the Ralph M. Parsons Foundation, among
  others.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  In-School work (826LA): $41,750
   In-School work (Young Storytellers): $41,750
   Publication: $10,000
   Design: $4,000
   Event: $2,500
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  With the success of this project, 826LA and Young Storytellers will increase
  the public’s knowledge of not only young people’s stories, but also the
  support that these two organizations provide for free to local students and
  schools. As a result, the organizations will be able to increase their
  volunteer partnerships, attracting more volunteers to support projects like
  this. The organizations will also be able to use the publication as tools for
  engaging more school partnerships, increasing their reach in Los Angeles.
  826LA aims to increase the number of students served through its in-school
  program by 36% over the next three years. Young Storytellers is actively
  working to develop programs at the middle school and high school levels,
  aiming within the next four years to offer continuing program opportunities to
  every elementary school participant in a Young Storytellers program.

    answer: "Los Angeles is the entertainment capital of the world, but the marginalized populations that 826LA and Young Storytellers work with do not often have the opportunity to share their stories widely. To encourage students to develop their English & Language Arts skills and creative learning behaviors that encourage lifelong learning, L.A. must first show our youngest citizens that these skills matter, that their voices are important, and that their stories are valued. By identifying their stories and helping them share those stories publicly through writing, 826LA and Young Storytellers will empower young people to increase their literacy skills through meaningful self-expression. Students will gain important communication skills that will help them succeed beyond school as confident, engaged members of their community. Last year, 95% of students reported that working with 826LA in their classrooms helped them increase their confidence about writing, and 90% of teachers reported a marked improvement in their students' writing skills as the result of an 826LA project. In the 2014 school year, 97% of Young Storytellers mentors observed a growth in their writer’s ability to think creatively, 98% of mentors observed a growth in their writer’s confidence, and 88% of parents noticed an improvement in the creativity of their children.\r\n\r\nThrough this project, 826LA and Young Storytellers will partner with local Title I LAUSD schools and teachers to help 2,000 severely disadvantaged students to write their stories. Through a variety of storytelling mediums including but not limited to personal essay, fiction, graphic novels, and screenplays, 826LA and Young Storytellers will provide a safe space for students to develop their literacy skills and give them a platform to share their stories with the world. To help develop the next generation of storytellers, some of today’s entertainment professionals including writers, artists, producers, and filmmakers will mentor students as they write and edit their stories. The culmination of this project will be a book, jointly published by 826LA and Young Storytellers, collecting stories written by students for wide distribution. 826LA and Young Storytellers will celebrate the publication of this book during a public event. Featuring students reading their own words and professional actors dramatizing their screenplays, this public event will provide both a figurative and a literal stage for students to share their stories."

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      826LA and Young Storytellers rely on specially trained volunteers, many of
      who are writers, artists, and creative professionals, to support students.
      While projects during school hours enables these organizations to reach
      high needs students, it can be a challenge to engage volunteers during
      regular school hours. To overcome this obstacle, 826LA and Young
      Storytellers plans to engage corporate volunteers from the entertainment
      industry to mentor the next generation of storytellers. These
      organizations have existing partnerships with Bad Robot, Disney, Sony
      Pictures, Participant Media, Verve, HBO, and AEG and will draw upon these
      partnerships and others to provide support for students. Exposure to the
      entertainment industry is often minimal or nonexistent in underserved
      communities, despite this industry’s role as a major economic force in
      California. These partnerships will not only make this project more
      viable, but will also grow the social capital of the students involved.

      826LA and Young Storytellers aim to serve 2,000 students total from Title
      I LAUSD schools (1,000 students per organization). To evaluate the
      effectiveness of this project, the organizations will track the number of
      students served as well as the overall effectiveness of the writing
      support. 826LA will track its effectiveness using qualitative and
      quantitative surveys for students and teachers. Young Storytellers’
      evaluation approach takes two distinct forms: Outcome and Process
      Evaluation.

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "In Los Angeles, there are other organizations including Write Girl and Get Lit that use creative writing to empower students, but 826LA and Young Storytellers will uniquely focus on storytelling and mentoring to help students find their voice and to express that voice with creativity and confidence. 826LA and Young Storytellers have different but complimentary core competencies, which they will bring to the project. Young Storytellers, for example, excels in bringing students’ writing to life through performance of student work by professional actors (on stage and film), whereas 826LA showcases student writing in over 250 publications each year. Both organizations have more than ten years of experience bringing specially trained, creative volunteers into public schools to support students and teachers at no cost to the school.\r\n"

      With the success of this project, 826LA and Young Storytellers will
      increase the public’s knowledge of not only young people’s stories, but
      also the support that these two organizations provide for free to local
      students and schools. As a result, the organizations will be able to
      increase their volunteer partnerships, attracting more volunteers to
      support projects like this. The organizations will also be able to use the
      publication as tools for engaging more school partnerships, increasing
      their reach in Los Angeles. 826LA aims to increase the number of students
      served through its in-school program by 36% over the next three years.
      Young Storytellers is actively working to develop programs at the middle
      school and high school levels, aiming within the next four years to offer
      continuing program opportunities to every elementary school participant in
      a Young Storytellers program.
