  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "Los Angeles is the entertainment capital of the world, but the marginalized populations that 826LA and Young Storytellers work with do not often have the opportunity to share their stories widely. To encourage students to develop their English & Language Arts skills and creative learning behaviors that encourage lifelong learning, L.A. must first show our youngest citizens that these skills matter, that their voices are important, and that their stories are valued. By identifying their stories and helping them share those stories publicly through writing, 826LA and Young Storytellers will empower young people to increase their literacy skills through meaningful self-expression. Students will gain important communication skills that will help them succeed beyond school as confident, engaged members of their community. Last year, 95% of students reported that working with 826LA in their classrooms helped them increase their confidence about writing, and 90% of teachers reported a marked improvement in their students' writing skills as the result of an 826LA project. In the 2014 school year, 97% of Young Storytellers mentors observed a growth in their writer’s ability to think creatively, 98% of mentors observed a growth in their writer’s confidence, and 88% of parents noticed an improvement in the creativity of their children.\r\n\r\nThrough this project, 826LA and Young Storytellers will partner with local Title I LAUSD schools and teachers to help 2,000 severely disadvantaged students to write their stories. Through a variety of storytelling mediums including but not limited to personal essay, fiction, graphic novels, and screenplays, 826LA and Young Storytellers will provide a safe space for students to develop their literacy skills and give them a platform to share their stories with the world. To help develop the next generation of storytellers, some of today’s entertainment professionals including writers, artists, producers, and filmmakers will mentor students as they write and edit their stories. The culmination of this project will be a book, jointly published by 826LA and Young Storytellers, collecting stories written by students for wide distribution. 826LA and Young Storytellers will celebrate the publication of this book during a public event. Featuring students reading their own words and professional actors dramatizing their screenplays, this public event will provide both a figurative and a literal stage for students to share their stories."

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    826LA and Young Storytellers rely on specially trained volunteers, many of
    who are writers, artists, and creative professionals, to support students.
    While projects during school hours enables these organizations to reach high
    needs students, it can be a challenge to engage volunteers during regular
    school hours. To overcome this obstacle, 826LA and Young Storytellers plans
    to engage corporate volunteers from the entertainment industry to mentor the
    next generation of storytellers. These organizations have existing
    partnerships with Bad Robot, Disney, Sony Pictures, Participant Media,
    Verve, HBO, and AEG and will draw upon these partnerships and others to
    provide support for students. Exposure to the entertainment industry is
    often minimal or nonexistent in underserved communities, despite this
    industry’s role as a major economic force in California. These partnerships
    will not only make this project more viable, but will also grow the social
    capital of the students involved.   
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    826LA and Young Storytellers aim to serve 2,000 students total from Title I
    LAUSD schools (1,000 students per organization). To evaluate the
    effectiveness of this project, the organizations will track the number of
    students served as well as the overall effectiveness of the writing support.
    826LA will track its effectiveness using qualitative and quantitative
    surveys for students and teachers. Young Storytellers’ evaluation approach
    takes two distinct forms: Outcome and Process Evaluation. 
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "In Los Angeles, there are other organizations including Write Girl and Get Lit that use creative writing to empower students, but 826LA and Young Storytellers will uniquely focus on storytelling and mentoring to help students find their voice and to express that voice with creativity and confidence. 826LA and Young Storytellers have different but complimentary core competencies, which they will bring to the project. Young Storytellers, for example, excels in bringing students’ writing to life through performance of student work by professional actors (on stage and film), whereas 826LA showcases student writing in over 250 publications each year. Both organizations have more than ten years of experience bringing specially trained, creative volunteers into public schools to support students and teachers at no cost to the school.\r\n"
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    826LA and Young Storytellers will collaborate on this project, dividing the
    grant evenly between each organization. Both organizations will partner with
    corporate volunteer programs at entertainment and creative companies. 
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    826LA and Young Storytellers estimates that it was cost approximately
    $500,000 to provide support to 2,000 students, to publish a collection of
    their work, and to celebrate their stories at a public event. Expenses
    beyond the grant from the Goldhirsh Foundation would be covered by grants
    from foundations and donations from corporate partners and individual
    donors. 826LA receives grants to support its in-school program from the City
    of Los Angeles, Department of Cultural Affairs and the Los Angeles Dodgers
    Foundation; Young Storytellers receives grant to support its work in schools
    from the Annenberg Foundation, the Dwight Stuart Youth Fund, and the Ralph
    M. Parsons Foundation, among others. 
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "In-School work (826LA): $41,750\r\nIn-School work (Young Storytellers): $41,750\r\nPublication: $10,000\r\nDesign: $4,000\r\nEvent: $2,500 \r\n"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    With the success of this project, 826LA and Young Storytellers will increase
    the public’s knowledge of not only young people’s stories, but also the
    support that these two organizations provide for free to local students and
    schools. As a result, the organizations will be able to increase their
    volunteer partnerships, attracting more volunteers to support projects like
    this. The organizations will also be able to use the publication as tools
    for engaging more school partnerships, increasing their reach in Los
    Angeles. 826LA aims to increase the number of students served through its
    in-school program by 36% over the next three years. Young Storytellers is
    actively working to develop programs at the middle school and high school
    levels, aiming within the next four years to offer continuing program
    opportunities to every elementary school participant in a Young Storytellers
    program.
