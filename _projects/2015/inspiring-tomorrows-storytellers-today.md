    To encourage students to develop creative learning behaviors and English &
    Language Arts skills, L.A. must first show our youngest citizens that these
    skills matter by reinforcing that their voices matter. 826LA and Young
    Storytellers will engage volunteers to help today’s students become
    tomorrow’s storytellers.
  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "Los Angeles is the entertainment capital of the world, but the marginalized populations that 826LA and Young Storytellers work with do not often have the opportunity to share their stories widely. To encourage students to develop their English & Language Arts skills and creative learning behaviors that encourage lifelong learning, L.A. must first show our youngest citizens that these skills matter, that their voices are important, and that their stories are valued. By identifying their stories and helping them share those stories publicly through writing, 826LA and Young Storytellers will empower young people to increase their literacy skills through meaningful self-expression. Students will gain important communication skills that will help them succeed beyond school as confident, engaged members of their community. Last year, 95% of students reported that working with 826LA in their classrooms helped them increase their confidence about writing, and 90% of teachers reported a marked improvement in their students' writing skills as the result of an 826LA project. In the 2014 school year, 97% of Young Storytellers mentors observed a growth in their writer’s ability to think creatively, 98% of mentors observed a growth in their writer’s confidence, and 88% of parents noticed an improvement in the creativity of their children.\r\n\r\nThrough this project, 826LA and Young Storytellers will partner with local Title I LAUSD schools and teachers to help 2,000 severely disadvantaged students to write their stories. Through a variety of storytelling mediums including but not limited to personal essay, fiction, graphic novels, and screenplays, 826LA and Young Storytellers will provide a safe space for students to develop their literacy skills and give them a platform to share their stories with the world. To help develop the next generation of storytellers, some of today’s entertainment professionals including writers, artists, producers, and filmmakers will mentor students as they write and edit their stories. The culmination of this project will be a book, jointly published by 826LA and Young Storytellers, collecting stories written by students for wide distribution. 826LA and Young Storytellers will celebrate the publication of this book during a public event. Featuring students reading their own words and professional actors dramatizing their screenplays, this public event will provide both a figurative and a literal stage for students to share their stories."

Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  826LA and Young Storytellers rely on specially trained volunteers, many of who
  are writers, artists, and creative professionals, to support students. While
  projects during school hours enables these organizations to reach high needs
  students, it can be a challenge to engage volunteers during regular school
  hours. To overcome this obstacle, 826LA and Young Storytellers plans to engage
  corporate volunteers from the entertainment industry to mentor the next
  generation of storytellers. These organizations have existing partnerships
  with Bad Robot, Disney, Sony Pictures, Participant Media, Verve, HBO, and AEG
  and will draw upon these partnerships and others to provide support for
  students. Exposure to the entertainment industry is often minimal or
  nonexistent in underserved communities, despite this industry’s role as a
  major economic force in California. These partnerships will not only make this
  project more viable, but will also grow the social capital of the students
  involved.

  teachers. Young Storytellers’ evaluation approach takes two distinct forms:
  Outcome and Process Evaluation.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  In Los Angeles, there are other organizations including Write Girl and Get Lit
  that use creative writing to empower students, but 826LA and Young
  Storytellers will uniquely focus on storytelling and mentoring to help
  students find their voice and to express that voice with creativity and
  confidence. 826LA and Young Storytellers have different but complimentary core
  competencies, which they will bring to the project. Young Storytellers, for
  example, excels in bringing students’ writing to life through performance of
  student work by professional actors (on stage and film), whereas 826LA
  showcases student writing in over 250 publications each year. Both
  organizations have more than ten years of experience bringing specially
  trained, creative volunteers into public schools to support students and
  teachers at no cost to the school.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  826LA and Young Storytellers will collaborate on this project, dividing the
  grant evenly between each organization. Both organizations will partner with
  corporate volunteer programs at entertainment and creative companies.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  With the success of this project, 826LA and Young Storytellers will increase
  the public’s knowledge of not only young people’s stories, but also the
  support that these two organizations provide for free to local students and
  schools. As a result, the organizations will be able to increase their
  volunteer partnerships, attracting more volunteers to support projects like
  this. The organizations will also be able to use the publication as tools for
  engaging more school partnerships, increasing their reach in Los Angeles.
  826LA aims to increase the number of students served through its in-school
  program by 36% over the next three years. Young Storytellers is actively
  working to develop programs at the middle school and high school levels,
  aiming within the next four years to offer continuing program opportunities to
  every elementary school participant in a Young Storytellers program.
