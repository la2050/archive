    Just like any other fast growing individual and/or non-traditional sport,
    Freerunning is currently taking place throughout LA in the streets or across
    rooftops. We’ve opened up already two Tempest Academies in LA to share our
    love of movement, but now we’d like to share our passion with your
    community. All age groups and skill levels can use our Action Parks and our
    goal is to provide free easy access to fun fitness. From aspiring stuntman,
    to athletes, or the next American Ninja Warrior, TMPST Action Parks are fun
    for anyone who’s excited to face the challenge of overcoming obstacles. Find
    your path and take action!

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    One major barrier/challenge that we anticipate is getting your community
    excited about how to use a TMPST Action Park. Our strategy is to provide
    signage within the park showing basic exercise movements for each obstacle
    proposed along with offering free public workshops from our already trained
    staff on how to navigate throughout the course. 
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    Our work will be evaluated through our already existing Tempest Academy
    instructional programs. 
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    To our knowledge, there is no other organization that is providing a free
    easy access/fun fitness environment within a community park for public
    outdoor usage. What is unique about our approach is that we will be offering
    a safe and secure environment for those who like to practice Freerunning or
    Parkour, along with calisthenics, Crossfit, obstacle course racing, general
    fitness, yoga, etc. all in an outdoor park setting where everyone can enjoy
    the weather that LA has to offer!
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': N/A.
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    First, we would meet with the community and all stakeholder’s involved to
    design the overall park. From there a project specific cost estimate will be
    created itemizing all labor and materials needed for the park. If the cost
    of the park exceeds 100K, then we would work with the city to see if there
    are any matching grants available, research California state grants that
    apply to play and or/fitness categories, and fundraise through our two Los
    Angles based Tempest Academies to help cover the difference.
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Preliminary Cost for TMPST Action Park = $100,000.00\r\n\r\nMobilization/General Conditions = $2,500.00\r\nClearing & Grubbing = $2,500.00\r\nRough/Fine Grading = $2,000.00\r\nPlayground Surfacing = $40,000.00\r\nConcrete Obstacles = $40,000.00\r\nBar Systems = $10,000.00\r\nSignage = $3,000.00\r\n"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    We envision that this will be the first flagship TMPST Action Park
    strategically located within LA for the community to enjoy. Based upon the
    success of the project we will then focus on building smaller parks
    throughout the city in neighborhoods so that everyone will have an
    opportunity to enjoy a TMPST Action Park. These Action Parks can also be a
    destination for local schools to help teach physical education and bring fun
    through fitness!
