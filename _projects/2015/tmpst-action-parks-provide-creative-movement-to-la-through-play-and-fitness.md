partners: ''
project_summary: >-
  TMPST Action Parks are uniquely designed to bring creative movement to
  communities everywhere through play, fitness, and overcoming obstacles. Our
  Action Parks are perfect for freerunning, great for calisthenics, crossfit,
  and fun for anyone who’s excited to face the challenge of overcoming
  obstacles. Find your path and take action!
Please specify below: ''
category: learn
'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Just like any other fast growing individual and/or non-traditional sport,
  Freerunning is currently taking place throughout LA in the streets or across
  rooftops. We’ve opened up already two Tempest Academies in LA to share our
  love of movement, but now we’d like to share our passion with your community.
  All age groups and skill levels can use our Action Parks and our goal is to
  provide free easy access to fun fitness. From aspiring stuntman, to athletes,
  or the next American Ninja Warrior, TMPST Action Parks are fun for anyone
  who’s excited to face the challenge of overcoming obstacles. Find your path
  and take action!
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  One major barrier/challenge that we anticipate is getting your community
  excited about how to use a TMPST Action Park. Our strategy is to provide
  signage within the park showing basic exercise movements for each obstacle
  proposed along with offering free public workshops from our already trained
  staff on how to navigate throughout the course.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Our work will be evaluated through our already existing Tempest Academy
  instructional programs.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  To our knowledge, there is no other organization that is providing a free easy
  access/fun fitness environment within a community park for public outdoor
  usage. What is unique about our approach is that we will be offering a safe
  and secure environment for those who like to practice Freerunning or Parkour,
  along with calisthenics, Crossfit, obstacle course racing, general fitness,
  yoga, etc. all in an outdoor park setting where everyone can enjoy the weather
  that LA has to offer!
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': N/A.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  First, we would meet with the community and all stakeholder’s involved to
  design the overall park. From there a project specific cost estimate will be
  created itemizing all labor and materials needed for the park. If the cost of
  the park exceeds 100K, then we would work with the city to see if there are
  any matching grants available, research California state grants that apply to
  play and or/fitness categories, and fundraise through our two Los Angles based
  Tempest Academies to help cover the difference.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  Preliminary Cost for TMPST Action Park = $100,000.00
   
   Mobilization/General Conditions = $2,500.00
   Clearing & Grubbing = $2,500.00
   Rough/Fine Grading = $2,000.00
   Playground Surfacing = $40,000.00
   Concrete Obstacles = $40,000.00
   Bar Systems = $10,000.00
   Signage = $3,000.00
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  We envision that this will be the first flagship TMPST Action Park
  strategically located within LA for the community to enjoy. Based upon the
  success of the project we will then focus on building smaller parks throughout
  the city in neighborhoods so that everyone will have an opportunity to enjoy a
  TMPST Action Park. These Action Parks can also be a destination for local
  schools to help teach physical education and bring fun through fitness!

      Just like any other fast growing individual and/or non-traditional sport,
      Freerunning is currently taking place throughout LA in the streets or
      across rooftops. We’ve opened up already two Tempest Academies in LA to
      share our love of movement, but now we’d like to share our passion with
      your community. All age groups and skill levels can use our Action Parks
      and our goal is to provide free easy access to fun fitness. From aspiring
      stuntman, to athletes, or the next American Ninja Warrior, TMPST Action
      Parks are fun for anyone who’s excited to face the challenge of overcoming
      obstacles. Find your path and take action!

      One major barrier/challenge that we anticipate is getting your community
      excited about how to use a TMPST Action Park. Our strategy is to provide
      signage within the park showing basic exercise movements for each obstacle
      proposed along with offering free public workshops from our already
      trained staff on how to navigate throughout the course.

      To our knowledge, there is no other organization that is providing a free
      easy access/fun fitness environment within a community park for public
      outdoor usage. What is unique about our approach is that we will be
      offering a safe and secure environment for those who like to practice
      Freerunning or Parkour, along with calisthenics, Crossfit, obstacle course
      racing, general fitness, yoga, etc. all in an outdoor park setting where
      everyone can enjoy the weather that LA has to offer!

      First, we would meet with the community and all stakeholder’s involved to
      design the overall park. From there a project specific cost estimate will
      be created itemizing all labor and materials needed for the park. If the
      cost of the park exceeds 100K, then we would work with the city to see if
      there are any matching grants available, research California state grants
      that apply to play and or/fitness categories, and fundraise through our
      two Los Angles based Tempest Academies to help cover the difference.

      We envision that this will be the first flagship TMPST Action Park
      strategically located within LA for the community to enjoy. Based upon the
      success of the project we will then focus on building smaller parks
      throughout the city in neighborhoods so that everyone will have an
      opportunity to enjoy a TMPST Action Park. These Action Parks can also be a
      destination for local schools to help teach physical education and bring
      fun through fitness!
