  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to play.: >-
    Just like any other fast growing individual and/or non-traditional sport,
    Freerunning is currently taking place throughout LA in the streets or across
    rooftops. We’ve opened up already two Tempest Academies in LA to share our
    love of movement, but now we’d like to share our passion with your
    community. All age groups and skill levels can use our Action Parks and our
    goal is to provide free easy access to fun fitness. From aspiring stuntman,
    to athletes, or the next American Ninja Warrior, TMPST Action Parks are fun
    for anyone who’s excited to face the challenge of overcoming obstacles. Find
    your path and take action!

Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  One major barrier/challenge that we anticipate is getting your community
  excited about how to use a TMPST Action Park. Our strategy is to provide
  signage within the park showing basic exercise movements for each obstacle
  proposed along with offering free public workshops from our already trained
  staff on how to navigate throughout the course.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Our work will be evaluated through our already existing Tempest Academy
  instructional programs.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  To our knowledge, there is no other organization that is providing a free easy
  access/fun fitness environment within a community park for public outdoor
  usage. What is unique about our approach is that we will be offering a safe
  and secure environment for those who like to practice Freerunning or Parkour,
  along with calisthenics, Crossfit, obstacle course racing, general fitness,
  yoga, etc. all in an outdoor park setting where everyone can enjoy the weather
  that LA has to offer!
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': N/A.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  We envision that this will be the first flagship TMPST Action Park
  strategically located within LA for the community to enjoy. Based upon the
  success of the project we will then focus on building smaller parks throughout
  the city in neighborhoods so that everyone will have an opportunity to enjoy a
  TMPST Action Park. These Action Parks can also be a destination for local
  schools to help teach physical education and bring fun through fitness!
