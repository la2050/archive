title: L.A. Flag Redesign
project_summary: >-
  Los Angeles is a great city, and every great city deserves a great flag. Our
  current flag is neither good nor effective and, consequently, has all but
  faded into obscurity; people don’t know it, and because they don’t know it,
  they don’t fly it. A well-designed flag, however, will serve as an emblem of
  unity and pride; it will bring together millions of otherwise disconnected
  Angelenos by restoring a sense of civic pride and strengthening LA’s ‘brand’
  identity throughout the world at large.

'In one sentence, please describe what your organization does': >-
  Los Angeles Flag is a non-profit organization dedicated to uniting our city by
  establishing a strong civic identity and fostering a sense of civic pride
  amongst Angelenos throughout the city and around the world.
Where will you be working?:
  - City of Los Angeles
How do you plan to use these resources to make change?:
  - Conduct research
  - Engage residents and stakeholders
  - Implement a pilot or new project
  - Mobilize for systems change
How will your proposal improve the following “Connect” metrics?:
  - Rates of volunteerism
  - Attendance at cultural events
  - Participation in neighborhood councils
  - Percentage of Angelenos that volunteer informally (Dream Metric)
  - Government responsiveness to residents’ needs (Dream Metric)
  - Total number of local social media friends and connections (Dream Metric)
  - Attendance at public/open streets gatherings (Dream Metric)
Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "Los Angeles is currently undergoing an incredible transformation: Development is booming, neighborhoods are thriving, and the very heart of our city is growing and adapting to meet the needs of an ever-changing 21st century. We are in the midst of a stunning revival and, as such, are the frontrunner to host the Olympic games in 2024. We are on the cusp of something big and all eyes are upon us. \r\n\r\nYet many people – residents and outsiders alike – still consider us to be a fragmented, disconnected city with no heart. But while Los Angeles may not have one central destination, there are scores of individual neighborhoods and enclaves teeming with art, culture, history, and beauty, from Sylmar to San Pedro, Ventura Blvd. to Venice Beach. These urban gems might be separated by miles of broken road and crowded freeways, but they are all part of what makes Los Angeles a complex, unique, and truly unparalleled city. \r\n\r\nOur goal, then, is to connect these individual, segregated pockets with a powerful, unifying flag – a simple and distinct emblem that bonds the east siders and the west siders, the rich and the poor, the old and the young; a symbol that belongs to every Angeleno, regardless of neighborhood, race, background, or socio-economic status.\r\n\r\nA new flag – one that we can all rally behind – will serve as a symbol for all of Los Angeles, promoting and representing the city itself, while uniting millions of Angelenos around the world. As we continue to lead the way through the 21st century, a new flag will help show the world that, despite our expansiveness and our often-frustrating idiosyncrasies, we are not a disjointed suburban metropolis, but rather an awesome, nuanced, and self-respecting city.\r\n\r\nWe are focused on connecting Angelenos, raising awareness, and gathering broad support to convince city officials to approve our proposal. Once the initiative is passed, we plan to launch a citywide design competition in search of a new flag – a contest that will undoubtedly connect Angelenos, not only with each other, but with the city as a whole, investing them in the future of Los Angeles by empowering them to participate in the rebranding of their city.\r\n"
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "We can simply and easily track our progress and support through the metrics built into our website and our community Facebook page. We will be able to further evaluate our progress based on support we garner through change.org. \r\n\r\nOur mission is to constantly engage the public, gaining support and attempting to connect with everyone everywhere. Therefore, the effectiveness of this project will be evaluated partially by our ability to target as many neighborhoods, communities, organizations, festivals, etc. as possible. The wider the broadcast, the stronger the message. \r\n\r\nThe overall success of this project hinges solely on getting the initiative passed – until that happens we can’t officially call for design submissions or adopt a new flag. Therefore, we will constantly be evaluating our work in regards to how many people we’ve reached. Our work will not be done until the city approves our proposal and every single Angeleno is united under a great new flag. \r\n"
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
  - Money (financial capital)
  - Volunteers/staff (human capital)
  - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
  - Community outreach
  - Network/relationship support
