title: L.A. Flag Redesign
project_summary: >-
  Los Angeles is a great city, and every great city deserves a great flag. Our
  current flag is neither good nor effective and, consequently, has all but
  faded into obscurity; people don’t know it, and because they don’t know it,
  they don’t fly it. A well-designed flag, however, will serve as an emblem of
  unity and pride; it will bring together millions of otherwise disconnected
  Angelenos by restoring a sense of civic pride and strengthening LA’s ‘brand’
  identity throughout the world at large.

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "Los Angeles is currently undergoing an incredible transformation: Development is booming, neighborhoods are thriving, and the very heart of our city is growing and adapting to meet the needs of an ever-changing 21st century. We are in the midst of a stunning revival and, as such, are the frontrunner to host the Olympic games in 2024. We are on the cusp of something big and all eyes are upon us. \r\n\r\nYet many people – residents and outsiders alike – still consider us to be a fragmented, disconnected city with no heart. But while Los Angeles may not have one central destination, there are scores of individual neighborhoods and enclaves teeming with art, culture, history, and beauty, from Sylmar to San Pedro, Ventura Blvd. to Venice Beach. These urban gems might be separated by miles of broken road and crowded freeways, but they are all part of what makes Los Angeles a complex, unique, and truly unparalleled city. \r\n\r\nOur goal, then, is to connect these individual, segregated pockets with a powerful, unifying flag – a simple and distinct emblem that bonds the east siders and the west siders, the rich and the poor, the old and the young; a symbol that belongs to every Angeleno, regardless of neighborhood, race, background, or socio-economic status.\r\n\r\nA new flag – one that we can all rally behind – will serve as a symbol for all of Los Angeles, promoting and representing the city itself, while uniting millions of Angelenos around the world. As we continue to lead the way through the 21st century, a new flag will help show the world that, despite our expansiveness and our often-frustrating idiosyncrasies, we are not a disjointed suburban metropolis, but rather an awesome, nuanced, and self-respecting city.\r\n\r\nWe are focused on connecting Angelenos, raising awareness, and gathering broad support to convince city officials to approve our proposal. Once the initiative is passed, we plan to launch a citywide design competition in search of a new flag – a contest that will undoubtedly connect Angelenos, not only with each other, but with the city as a whole, investing them in the future of Los Angeles by empowering them to participate in the rebranding of their city.\r\n"

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "Our greatest challenge will be convincing city leaders to make the change. Government officials are often resistant to change; they are busy people with a catalogue of extremely important issues (e.g. homelessness; joblessness; education) constantly vying for their attention. In the face of such important issues, this initiative might be seen as trivial, or frivolous. Our strategy is to obtain popular support at the grass roots level in order to convince decision makers that a well-designed flag will give LA a banner under which to rally in order to face those ‘more important’ issues. Popular support brings about change; we intend to maximize the power of the people.\r\n\r\nWe also intend to focus on the future. Lots of resources are being poured into unifying and beautifying LA (e.g. the restoration of DTLA; the revival of the LA River; the Olympic bid). We will make clear that the best way to march towards this bright future is to do so as a single unified city, under a great new banner."
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "We can simply and easily track our progress and support through the metrics built into our website and our community Facebook page. We will be able to further evaluate our progress based on support we garner through change.org. \r\n\r\nOur mission is to constantly engage the public, gaining support and attempting to connect with everyone everywhere. Therefore, the effectiveness of this project will be evaluated partially by our ability to target as many neighborhoods, communities, organizations, festivals, etc. as possible. The wider the broadcast, the stronger the message. \r\n\r\nThe overall success of this project hinges solely on getting the initiative passed – until that happens we can’t officially call for design submissions or adopt a new flag. Therefore, we will constantly be evaluating our work in regards to how many people we’ve reached. Our work will not be done until the city approves our proposal and every single Angeleno is united under a great new flag. \r\n"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "No, there are no other organizations doing similar work. \r\n\r\nWhile New Zealand and Fiji are in the midst of redesigning their country flags, and other American cities, such as Milwaukee and San Francisco, are currently campaigning to redesign their city flags, no other organization in Los Angeles is championing this cause. \r\n\r\nThe truth is, the vast majority of Angelenos don’t know what the LA flag looks like – in fact, most don’t even realize that we have a city flag. But whether they realize it or not, people care about flags. Flags are important and people get passionate about them, for better or worse, as evident by the recent controversy with the confederate flag, or the boom of U.S. flag sales after 9/11, or even the unification Chicagoans feel over their ubiquitous city flag. \r\n\r\nOur approach will be unique in that we intend to raise overall awareness about design and how effective it can be when incorporated properly into the framework of our city. Laying this foundation will enabling Angelenos to think about the future of LA as a more connected, well-designed, and cutting-edge city of tomorrow.\r\n"
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': There are currently no other partners involved in this project.
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    Right now, the project is budgeted at $100,000 based on the amount of this
    grant, and the majority of this money is earmarked for advertising with the
    sole purpose of raising awareness, gathering popular support and convincing
    city leaders to approve our proposal.
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
    $18,000 will be used to produce a stunning campaign video that will serves
    as a pillar of our campaign – a powerful call-to-action, designed to
    educate, galvanize, and inspire. $40,000 will be spent on advertising via
    local radio (e.g. KCRW) and print publications (e.g. LA Weekly, Los Angeles
    Magazine, LA Times). It will also cover the cost of grassroots advertising
    (e.g. renting booths at CicLAvia and other local festivals; engaging
    artists, designers, and students throughout every district; attending
    conferences such as Future of Cities). $42,000 will be dedicated to boosting
    social media awareness through platforms such as Facebook and in-app
    advertising. This aspect of the campaign will focus on obtaining citywide
    support to pass our initiative. It will also serve to connect and engaging
    as many Angelenos as possible via social media, while educating them on the
    importance of city flags and the benefits of a new, well-designed Los
    Angeles flag. 
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "The first step will be to produce the campaign video and advertising materials.\r\n\r\nThen, we will review all upcoming events and advertising opportunities in Los Angeles throughout the next 6 to 8 months and budget for those.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the funds will be allocated on a month-to-month basis based on the conversion rates we get through the various advertising outlets. We’ll start small in advertising pockets, and determine which markets and platforms are most successful and scale our budget accordingly. \r\n\r\nShould the city accept our proposal before our entire budget is spent, the remainder of the funds will go towards increasing enthusiasm and support for the new, redesigned LA flag!\r\n"
