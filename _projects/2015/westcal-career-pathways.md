    Student success is primarily measured in terms of high school and college
    completion rates. There are elements that do not recognize student success
    as identifying a career field of major and securing employment in that
    field. Society is graduating students from high school and college who are
    unable to secure gainful employment. This serious issue especially pertains
    to academic college majors who graduate with degrees that do not correlate
    with the job(s) they are able to secure. Helping students identify their
    career pathway with the assistance of industry mentors helps guide the
    student to the appropriate academic and/or vocational program that helps
    them secure gainful employment. Students who identify their career pathway
    are more likely to complete their schooling/training and at a faster pace as
    they elect career relevant courses.

Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  The greatest challenge for WestCal Academy is primarily administrative
  resistance to change from the college and high school level. Instructors of
  record have partnered with WestCal Academy to directly reach students.
  Furthermore, the organization has proactively sought and secured relationships
  with leaders of the CTA, NEA, AFT, CFT, and multiple labor organizations that
  include Teamsters, AFSCME, and LIUNA! WestCal Academy helps students identify
  their career pathway, whether it is academic and/or vocational.

Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  ProjectGradLA runs a program that specifically targets Hispanic students of
  lower socioeconomic means who attend Middle School and High School. The
  program is dedicated to helping these students enroll in college and assuring
  they graduate. It is a very good program. What is missing is the connection
  with industry mentors who help students identify their career pathway. WestCal
  Academy also works with the instructor of record to integrate our "Career
  Pathway" and "Linked Learning" curriculum with their courses to help students
  identify potential career opportunities related with the class subject
  material.

How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  WestCal Academy has successfully proven our concept with students attending
  Los Angeles Trade Technical College and Los Angeles Mission College. Many of
  our students are dual-enrollment / concurrent enrollment students (attending
  high school and community college at the same time). WestCal Academy is
  scheduled to expand our program at Ventura Community College and Cal State
  Long Beach. WestCal Academy has twenty industry speakers / educators who are
  committed to the program. The issue for WestCal Academy is how to secure
  additional funds to assure successful scalability.
