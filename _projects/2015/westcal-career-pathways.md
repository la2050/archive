    Student success is primarily measured in terms of high school and college
    completion rates. There are elements that do not recognize student success
    as identifying a career field of major and securing employment in that
    field. Society is graduating students from high school and college who are
    unable to secure gainful employment. This serious issue especially pertains
    to academic college majors who graduate with degrees that do not correlate
    with the job(s) they are able to secure. Helping students identify their
    career pathway with the assistance of industry mentors helps guide the
    student to the appropriate academic and/or vocational program that helps
    them secure gainful employment. Students who identify their career pathway
    are more likely to complete their schooling/training and at a faster pace as
    they elect career relevant courses.

    The greatest challenge for WestCal Academy is primarily administrative
    resistance to change from the college and high school level. Instructors of
    record have partnered with WestCal Academy to directly reach students.
    Furthermore, the organization has proactively sought and secured
    relationships with leaders of the CTA, NEA, AFT, CFT, and multiple labor
    organizations that include Teamsters, AFSCME, and LIUNA! WestCal Academy
    helps students identify their career pathway, whether it is academic and/or
    vocational.
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    WestCal Academy curriculum follows the platform standards of student success
    from the United States Department of Education, and the Office of the
    President for "Career Pathways" and "Linked Learning." Our standard of
    success is measured in three ways: students identify their career pathway;
    students complete high school, college, and/or vocational training; and
    students secure employment in their field of major. WestCal Academy promotes
    "Career Pathways" and "Linked Learning" approaches that connects industry
    mentors with classroom instruction to motivate students towards a career
    pathway. WestCal Academy also assists with connecting students with
    potential mentors who work in their field of major. WestCal Academy
    curriculum measures student success with rubric evaluations of submissions
    and the curriculum follows Student Learning Outcome protocols and the
    organization maintains Institutional Learning Outcomes.
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    ProjectGradLA runs a program that specifically targets Hispanic students of
    lower socioeconomic means who attend Middle School and High School. The
    program is dedicated to helping these students enroll in college and
    assuring they graduate. It is a very good program. What is missing is the
    connection with industry mentors who help students identify their career
    pathway. WestCal Academy also works with the instructor of record to
    integrate our "Career Pathway" and "Linked Learning" curriculum with their
    courses to help students identify potential career opportunities related
    with the class subject material.

    WestCal Academy collaborates with a strong academic advisory board that
    oversees our curriculum and actively participates. They are unpaid. Their
    sole purpose for participating is to help students achieve success. They

    College; Mohamed A. El-Tawansy, P.E., Engineering, Cal State Long Beach, Los

  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    WestCal Academy has successfully proven our concept with students attending
    Los Angeles Trade Technical College and Los Angeles Mission College. Many of
    our students are dual-enrollment / concurrent enrollment students (attending
    high school and community college at the same time). WestCal Academy is
    scheduled to expand our program at Ventura Community College and Cal State
    Long Beach. WestCal Academy has twenty industry speakers / educators who are
    committed to the program. The issue for WestCal Academy is how to secure
    additional funds to assure successful scalability.
