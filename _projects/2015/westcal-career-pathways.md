  WestCal Academy identifies student success in three ways: identifying a career
  pathway; completing high school, college, and/or vocational training; and
  securing employment in their field of major. WestCal Academy promotes "Career
  Pathways" and "Linked Learning" approaches that connects industry mentors with
  classroom instruction to motivate students towards a career pathway. WestCal
  Academy also assists with connecting students with potential mentors who work
  in their field of major.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Student success is primarily measured in terms of high school and college
  completion rates. There are elements that do not recognize student success as
  identifying a career field of major and securing employment in that field.
  Society is graduating students from high school and college who are unable to
  secure gainful employment. This serious issue especially pertains to academic
  college majors who graduate with degrees that do not correlate with the job(s)
  they are able to secure. Helping students identify their career pathway with
  the assistance of industry mentors helps guide the student to the appropriate
  academic and/or vocational program that helps them secure gainful employment.
  Students who identify their career pathway are more likely to complete their
  schooling/training and at a faster pace as they elect career relevant courses.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  The greatest challenge for WestCal Academy is primarily administrative
  resistance to change from the college and high school level. Instructors of
  record have partnered with WestCal Academy to directly reach students.
  Furthermore, the organization has proactively sought and secured relationships
  with leaders of the CTA, NEA, AFT, CFT, and multiple labor organizations that
  include Teamsters, AFSCME, and LIUNA! WestCal Academy helps students identify
  their career pathway, whether it is academic and/or vocational.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  WestCal Academy curriculum follows the platform standards of student success
  from the United States Department of Education, and the Office of the
  President for "Career Pathways" and "Linked Learning." Our standard of success
  is measured in three ways: students identify their career pathway; students
  complete high school, college, and/or vocational training; and students secure
  employment in their field of major. WestCal Academy promotes "Career Pathways"
  and "Linked Learning" approaches that connects industry mentors with classroom
  instruction to motivate students towards a career pathway. WestCal Academy
  also assists with connecting students with potential mentors who work in their
  field of major. WestCal Academy curriculum measures student success with
  rubric evaluations of submissions and the curriculum follows Student Learning
  Outcome protocols and the organization maintains Institutional Learning
  Outcomes.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  ProjectGradLA runs a program that specifically targets Hispanic students of
  lower socioeconomic means who attend Middle School and High School. The
  program is dedicated to helping these students enroll in college and assuring
  they graduate. It is a very good program. What is missing is the connection
  with industry mentors who help students identify their career pathway. WestCal
  Academy also works with the instructor of record to integrate our "Career
  Pathway" and "Linked Learning" curriculum with their courses to help students
  identify potential career opportunities related with the class subject
  material.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-

'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 â€“ how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  WestCal Academy connects with the instructor of record who teaches multiple
  subjects (political science, anthropology, engineering, sociology, psychology,
  etc.) $100,000 will allow us to expand our program to multiple classes in all
  nine campuses of the Los Angeles Community College District. WestCal Academy
  will then link with feeder high schools of those campuses to connect high
  school students with our program. Additional costs to maintain WestCal Academy
  operations come from private donations and in-kind contributions (facilities,
  food, internet, phones, etc.)
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  Yearly Budget For Proposal
   
   1. Twelve months administrative oversight (supervising and instructional support): $40,000
   2. Twelve months dedicated space In Gardena headquarters (including utilities - $500 per month) $6000.00
   3. Twelve months - Four Part-time WestCal Student Ambassadors ($960 per month per employee) $46,080 
   4. 20,000 4 panel programs: $2,001.29
   5. Traveling expenses for transportation of speakers to schools: $5,918.71
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  WestCal Academy has successfully proven our concept with students attending
  Los Angeles Trade Technical College and Los Angeles Mission College. Many of
  our students are dual-enrollment / concurrent enrollment students (attending
  high school and community college at the same time). WestCal Academy is
  scheduled to expand our program at Ventura Community College and Cal State
  Long Beach. WestCal Academy has twenty industry speakers / educators who are
  committed to the program. The issue for WestCal Academy is how to secure
  additional funds to assure successful scalability.
