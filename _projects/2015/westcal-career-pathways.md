  Student success is primarily measured in terms of high school and college
  completion rates. There are elements that do not recognize student success as
  identifying a career field of major and securing employment in that field.
  Society is graduating students from high school and college who are unable to
  secure gainful employment. This serious issue especially pertains to academic
  college majors who graduate with degrees that do not correlate with the job(s)
  they are able to secure. Helping students identify their career pathway with
  the assistance of industry mentors helps guide the student to the appropriate
  academic and/or vocational program that helps them secure gainful employment.
  Students who identify their career pathway are more likely to complete their
  schooling/training and at a faster pace as they elect career relevant
  courses. 
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
