  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "Participation will be the biggest barrier to our program’s success. We need to get people in rooms together for the events to be impactful and on the website for our resources to be used. Not only will we need simply attendance but and engages community with projects to set inaction.\r\n\r\nWe will overcome this obstacle by partnering with Loyola Marymount University and Youth Justice Coalition to help bridge gaps between disparate communities. Diversity will be built by collaborating with stakeholders in the artist, activist, and entrepreneurial sectors and extending that outreach to a range of geographic and cultural groups.\r\n\r\nAdditionally we will make a concerted effort to target women and minorities, and a directly engage with formerly incarcerated\r\n\r\nAn example would be to work with an organization that creates jobs for the previously incarcerated and co-produce an event that draws parallels between entrepreneurial basics and skills needed to find employment."
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Success is defined  for us by the:\r\n\r\n- Attendee participation expectation versus actual for each event.\r\n\r\n- Feedback from After Event Reviews by attendees (attendee rating system)\r\n\r\n- Analytics regarding impressions of content\r\n\r\n- Collection of useable data set regarding obstacles to entrepreneurial initiation and success (Why people are not starting businesses and why they are failing when they do.)\r\n\r\n- # Of business plans and new enterprises begun as a result of program.\r\n\r\n- Amount of Local and Major Press coverage gained\r\n"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "We are inspired by organizations like Catalyst Creative, General Assembly, and Creative Mornings that help entrepreneurs and creatives succeed but none have devoted the time and resource to seeking out so many that have yet to self identify as entrepreneurial.\r\n\r\nWhat makes Citizens Of Culture unique is its commitment to diversity and a broad definition of entrepreneur to include high growth start-up, small business, and sustainable non-profit.  Our program not only services existing creatives but seeks out those who have yet to unlock their creativity.\r\n\r\nThis counters the popular notion that entrepreneurs are always wealthy and well funded, when there are more than one form of capital that can be used to start an enterprise."

  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "Through the use and design of the web platform we will publish valuable content that is shareable and useful.\r\n\r\nThis program is a catalyst. We hope to use the grant to initiate the first year of program but to not let it end at the end of the grant. With funds from the first year helping launch the first year sales from events and exposure establishing a base for following years of the program.\r\n\r\nThrough the use of web, social media, and strategic marketing it is likely that the second year of the program could be even bigger than the first.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to reach 10,000 people in one year through event attendance and print, utilizing web and social medial to scale the impact across the web."
