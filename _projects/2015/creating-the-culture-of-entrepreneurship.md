project_summary: >-
  Citizens Of Culture will develop a cross platform community of artists,
  entrepreneurs and everyday citizens that extends to web, print, and live
  events. We are establishing a culture of entrepreneurship that moves people to
  start their own firms and gives them resource to be successful, specifically
  surviving the first year in business.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Culture is a powerful educational vehicle. It transmits our values, and
  ethics, and wraps us in a shared perspective about our environment. Citizens
  Of Culture harnesses the power of culture to communicate the values of
  critical thinking,problem solving, and instill a sense of efficacy and
  entrepreneurship through our events, platform and content. 
   
   We’ve developed a series of programs dedicated to helping people transition from consumers to creators by recognizing problems, their potential solutions, and developing an entrepreneurial skill set that will make their efforts sustainable into the year 2050 and beyond. 
   
   Through partnership with experts in the fields of entrepreneurship at Loyola Marymount College of Business, civic leaders of the Youth Justice Coalition, and individuals who have started successful enterprises we will create and active community that moves from ideation and prototyping, to refinement and revenue. 
   
   We are taking the principles put to use in incubators and classrooms across the field and embedding them into the culture of our city through various communities in the transcending geography, age, and economic status.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Participation will be the biggest barrier to our program’s success. We need to
  get people in rooms together for the events to be impactful and on the website
  for our resources to be used. Not only will we need simply attendance but and
  engages community with projects to set inaction.
   
   We will overcome this obstacle by partnering with Loyola Marymount University and Youth Justice Coalition to help bridge gaps between disparate communities. Diversity will be built by collaborating with stakeholders in the artist, activist, and entrepreneurial sectors and extending that outreach to a range of geographic and cultural groups.
   
   Additionally we will make a concerted effort to target women and minorities, and a directly engage with formerly incarcerated
   
   An example would be to work with an organization that creates jobs for the previously incarcerated and co-produce an event that draws parallels between entrepreneurial basics and skills needed to find employment.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: |-
  Success is defined for us by the:
   
   - Attendee participation expectation versus actual for each event.
   
   - Feedback from After Event Reviews by attendees (attendee rating system)
   
   - Analytics regarding impressions of content
   
   - Collection of useable data set regarding obstacles to entrepreneurial initiation and success (Why people are not starting businesses and why they are failing when they do.)
   
   - # Of business plans and new enterprises begun as a result of program.
   
   - Amount of Local and Major Press coverage gained
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  We are inspired by organizations like Catalyst Creative, General Assembly, and
  Creative Mornings that help entrepreneurs and creatives succeed but none have
  devoted the time and resource to seeking out so many that have yet to self
  identify as entrepreneurial.
   
   What makes Citizens Of Culture unique is its commitment to diversity and a broad definition of entrepreneur to include high growth start-up, small business, and sustainable non-profit. Our program not only services existing creatives but seeks out those who have yet to unlock their creativity.
   
   This counters the popular notion that entrepreneurs are always wealthy and well funded, when there are more than one form of capital that can be used to start an enterprise.

How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Through the use and design of the web platform we will publish valuable
  content that is shareable and useful.
   
   This program is a catalyst. We hope to use the grant to initiate the first year of program but to not let it end at the end of the grant. With funds from the first year helping launch the first year sales from events and exposure establishing a base for following years of the program.
   
   Through the use of web, social media, and strategic marketing it is likely that the second year of the program could be even bigger than the first.
   
   Our goal is to reach 10,000 people in one year through event attendance and print, utilizing web and social medial to scale the impact across the web.
