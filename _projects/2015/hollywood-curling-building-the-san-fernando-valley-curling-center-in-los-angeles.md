  Hollywood Curling- Building the San Fernando Valley Curling Center in Los
  Angeles
project_summary: >-
  Since 2007, we have grown the sport of curling in Los Angeles under poor ice
  conditions and limited availability from local hockey rinks.  We are in the
  process of building the San Fernando Valley Curling Center by adapting an
  existing building that would be dedicated to the specific requirements of this
  sport.  A dedicated facility will enable us to realize our mission of being
  inclusive, expanding youth and wheelchair programs, as well as promote lasting
  social connections in the community.

  We are the only place in Los Angeles to participate in the Olympic sport of

  national level.

How will your proposal improve the following “Connect” metrics?:
  - Rates of volunteerism

Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "Curling is one of the fastest growing sports in the world. Last year, we taught over 1500 people how to curl during and after the 2014 Olympics, with most of our events selling out, and the demand outpaced our limited ice availability from local hockey rinks. \r\n\r\nAccessibility & Equality\r\n\r\nAccessibility is what makes the sport of curling uniquely social, connecting people from all walks of life. Anyone can learn how to curl, including kids, seniors, men, women, and those that are wheelchair bound. The unique social aspect of the sport encourages connections with fellow league players in your own community, as well as fellow curlers from across the country at various tournaments. Curling is a sport where a CEO can be captained by a college student, where men and women play on equal footing, and wheelchair curlers can play alongside those who are not. A person who learned to play last week can end up playing with an Olympian in a tournament next week. Curling is a catalyst to enable people to come together, gain emotional support, and create lifelong friendships and bonds.\r\n\r\nYouth Initiatives\r\n\r\nIn our dedicated facility, we plan on expanding our School of Rocks program, where we first teach the game to kids in school gymnasiums using a floor curling set up, and then we get them on the ice to participate in a safe, challenging, and rewarding sport. In our current arrangement with local hockey rinks, we lack the ability to offer after school programming at times suitable for our younger members. A dedicated facility would allow us to offer youth leagues, family programming, and afterschool mentorship programs to local kids and young adults. \r\n\r\nVolunteerism\r\n\r\nAs a volunteer run, 501-(c)-3 non-profit organization, we rely on our members to volunteer their time and energy to promote the sport through teaching beginner Learn to Curl classes, assisting with corporate events, and assisting with community outreach events. Past community events where we have brought our portable street curling set up include CicLAvia and the recent inaugural San Fernando Chile Festival. Additionally, our volunteers will be encouraged to participate in activities with partner organizations, via community outreach, youth coaching and supervision, and accessibility programs."
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Goals:\r\nOpen a dedicated curling facility. The completion of this task is our first evaluation marker.\r\n\r\nIntroduction and exposure of the sport to local Angelenos. Success of this goal will be measured quantitatively by:\r\n- The number of members\r\n- The number of active leagues\r\n- Attendance at tournaments & intro lessons\r\n- Learn to curl attendance\r\n- Number of private events\r\n- National and regional events hosted\r\n\r\nIncreased Annual Growth: Goal of 400+ members within 5 years through marketing and outreach efforts. \r\n\r\nExpansion of Specialty Leagues: In addition to our open and skills specific leagues, we plan to have youth, college, LGBT, municipal, and studio leagues. Additionally, corporate team building events and private parties.  This goal will be evaluated based on the variety of programming achieved within the first 3-5 years with outreach into those respective communities."
