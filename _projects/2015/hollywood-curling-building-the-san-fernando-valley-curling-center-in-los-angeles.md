  Hollywood Curling- Building the San Fernando Valley Curling Center in Los
  Angeles

project_summary: >-
  Since 2007, we have grown the sport of curling in Los Angeles under poor ice
  conditions and limited availability from local hockey rinks. We are in the
  process of building the San Fernando Valley Curling Center by adapting an
  existing building that would be dedicated to the specific requirements of this
  sport. A dedicated facility will enable us to realize our mission of being
  inclusive, expanding youth and wheelchair programs, as well as promote lasting
  social connections in the community.
Please specify below: 'San Fernando Blvd, City of San Fernando; Los Angeles County'
category: learn
'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Curling is one of the fastest growing sports in the world. Last year, we
  taught over 1500 people how to curl during and after the 2014 Olympics, with
  most of our events selling out, and the demand outpaced our limited ice
  availability from local hockey rinks. 
   
   Accessibility & Equality
   
   Accessibility is what makes the sport of curling uniquely social, connecting people from all walks of life. Anyone can learn how to curl, including kids, seniors, men, women, and those that are wheelchair bound. The unique social aspect of the sport encourages connections with fellow league players in your own community, as well as fellow curlers from across the country at various tournaments. Curling is a sport where a CEO can be captained by a college student, where men and women play on equal footing, and wheelchair curlers can play alongside those who are not. A person who learned to play last week can end up playing with an Olympian in a tournament next week. Curling is a catalyst to enable people to come together, gain emotional support, and create lifelong friendships and bonds.
   
   Youth Initiatives
   
   In our dedicated facility, we plan on expanding our School of Rocks program, where we first teach the game to kids in school gymnasiums using a floor curling set up, and then we get them on the ice to participate in a safe, challenging, and rewarding sport. In our current arrangement with local hockey rinks, we lack the ability to offer after school programming at times suitable for our younger members. A dedicated facility would allow us to offer youth leagues, family programming, and afterschool mentorship programs to local kids and young adults. 
   
   Volunteerism
   
   As a volunteer run, 501-(c)-3 non-profit organization, we rely on our members to volunteer their time and energy to promote the sport through teaching beginner Learn to Curl classes, assisting with corporate events, and assisting with community outreach events. Past community events where we have brought our portable street curling set up include CicLAvia and the recent inaugural San Fernando Chile Festival. Additionally, our volunteers will be encouraged to participate in activities with partner organizations, via community outreach, youth coaching and supervision, and accessibility programs.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Start up expenses represent the largest hurdle. To build our facility, we need
  approximately $645K. 
   
   We have a multifaceted plan to obtain the funds we need to retrofit an existing space for curling, involving capital equipment purchases and construction. We have been actively fundraising for several years, including raffles, tournaments, and auctions. Using our connections within the national and international curling community, we plan on casting a large viral net to capture the support of other curlers and clubs around the globe. Additionally, we plan on approaching local business and corporations to attract valuable sponsorship dollars and in-kind donations.
   
   Hollywood Curling operates with the philosophy that every event or action should yield a positive net return, or at least be revenue neutral. This philosophy is being carried over into our dedicated ice initiatives and fundraising plans with a mindful eye to responsible fiscal decisions.

Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: |-
  Goals:
   Open a dedicated curling facility. The completion of this task is our first evaluation marker.
   
   Introduction and exposure of the sport to local Angelenos. Success of this goal will be measured quantitatively by:
   - The number of members
   - The number of active leagues
   - Attendance at tournaments & intro lessons
   - Learn to curl attendance
   - Number of private events
   - National and regional events hosted
   
   Increased Annual Growth: Goal of 400+ members within 5 years through marketing and outreach efforts. 
   
   Expansion of Specialty Leagues: In addition to our open and skills specific leagues, we plan to have youth, college, LGBT, municipal, and studio leagues. Additionally, corporate team building events and private parties. This goal will be evaluated based on the variety of programming achieved within the first 3-5 years with outreach into those respective communities.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There are a number of other sports leagues in the city, including venue
  specific sports such as ice rinks and bowling alleys. There are NO other
  curling organizations in Los Angeles; we are the only place to curl and our
  own building would ensure we remain the only league in place for an extended
  period of time. 
   
   That said, we do compete with other entertainment and sporting opportunities which can make it challenging to break through the clutter. We get a tremendous boost every four years during the Olympics, and in 2018 there will be another curling event added to the Olympic roster. We believe that a facility of our own, at that time, will have a massive impact on the scope of people we are able to reach.
   
   Curling may not be the first thing that comes to mind when you think of sports in Los Angeles. It is a grass roots sport that has taken off here, and in other cities in temperate climates across the country, including Phoenix, San Francisco, San Diego and Las Vegas. The fact that Los Angeles is already known for its Olympic legacy and future Olympic aspirations strengthens the desire to showcase this increasingly popular and unique sport.
   
   Testimonials:
   
   “I attended one of the "Learn to Curl" events, and it was stupendously fun! Who knew? Everyone there was incredibly friendly, and the group I was in had a great time laughing and cheering each other on. Super supportive environment. I'm only sad I don't live closer because I think I'd be inclined to go more often if I did.” - yelp review by K.A.
   
   “This might have been the most fun thing I’ve done in the last 5 years.” - yelp review by Roman S.
   
   “Everyone was really welcoming and made learning the sport fun. And what's great is that it can be for anyone (young, old, short, tall).” - yelp review by G.S.
   
   “I met the love of my life at Hollywood Curling, and made her my wife. For that, I am forever grateful.”- Chris Olander, Hollywood Curling Member.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  100% of the grant funding will go toward our capital campaign allowing us to
  build. Though we do not have any other partners or collaborators on the
  start-up of this project, funding from the grant would allow us to achieve our
  goal, and therefore indirectly benefit those community partners with whom we
  have existing relationships with.
   
   Below are a list of non-financial community partners with whom we have worked and continue to nurture relationships with. 
   
   USA Curling - hosting national events, clinics, and seminars
   LA84 - Expansion of youth initiatives
   Triumph Foundation - Expansion of our wheelchair & accessibility programs
   
   Target community partners include local stakeholder agencies and organizations:
   City of San Fernando Parks Department
   San Fernando Chamber of Commerce
   Pacoima Beautiful
   Boys and Girls Club
   Youth Speak Collective
   YMCA
   Local public, private, and charter schools
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  The estimate for moving into our own facility is approximately $645,000. This
  includes permitting & professional fees, ice making equipment and
  installation, HVAC requirements, construction & build out costs, rent deposit
  to secure the lease, and contingency. To cover this amount we’ve got a
  multi-faceted approach to our fundraising:
   
   General Fund - $90K on hand. Through fundraising specific tasks such as our recent Viking River Cruise raffle, as well as leagues, lessons and corporate parties.
   
   Solicited Donations/ Member Contributions - $200K. Pledges from our 100+ members, as well as solicited donations from other clubs.
   
   Crowdfunding - Goal: $90-100K. Using a site like Indiegogo, we will appeal to the wider curling community in Canada and the US, and plan on utilizing our network within the high performance curling community around the globe to help spread the word and make the campaign go viral.
   
   Corporate Sponsorship - Goal: $50-100K. With the number of people who will come through the door, particularly during the Olympic years, we plan to utilize our non-profit status to sell sponsorship opportunities
   
   Presales - $25K. Through group sales sites such as Groupon or Living Social we can offer advanced deals for learn to curl classes. 
   
   Loans- $50-100K (max $250K available) - Utilizing an interest-free loan program from World Curling Federation, with funds earmarked for the building of new brick & mortar facilities. 
   
   In Kind Donations- $30-50K. From construction materials, furniture, office equipment, contractor fees, and professional fees.
   
   Total Estimated Fundraising Goals: $545K
   
   The LA2050 grant would help us bridge that last gap to get us to our goal, and allow us to build the curling club that Los Angeles deserves.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
  $100,000 will go towards the facility start up budget, approximately $645,000.
  This money will ensure the implementation of the programming and further
  fundraising required to reach our goals.
   
   Allocation of grant funds:
   $50,000 professional and permitting fees*
   $20,000 rent deposit
   $20,000 Ice maintenance equipment
   $10,000 toward build-out costs (construction materials and/or contractor fees)
   
   *In the event that we are able to obtain pro bono work from some of our vendors, any balance will be applied toward buildout and ice plant costs.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: |-
  Success will be measured by our ability:
   - To offer the benefits of five sheets of quality, curling specific ice to all who access Hollywood Curling
   - To expand our capacity of use with inclusive, accessible programming
   - To encourage further corporate opportunities to invest in our vision. 
   - To engage Angelenos in a unique and rewarding social experience
   
   Our plan is for five sheets of curling ice. This will already be an expansion of ice capacity from our current use. We will have ample opportunity to expand our programing as needed, including adding tournaments and private events. Expanding our marketing reach will be critical to capitalizing on the additional scheduling opportunities we will be able to offer. A facility of this size is suitable for hosting national championship events in the future, making Los Angeles a destination for tournaments, workshops, skills clinics and other training events.
   
   San Fernando is also strategically located so that if we are successful, we can expand to other areas of the county, such as San Gabriel Valley, the harbor cities, or west side. During the next Olympic cycles, we will be able to introduce curling at local ice rinks in these locations with the support and equipment provided by our dedicated facility and volunteers as a home base.
   
   With your generous assistance will reach our goal of offering the game of curling to the local community, foster the social and competitive spirit of curling, and teach and develop curlers to compete at a local and national level. This grant opportunity comes at a crucial time in our fundraising campaigns and will ensure the growth of the organization and sport of curling in Los Angeles.
