  Students, community-based organizations, and colleges all are working toward
  the same goal: students graduating from college. Since their goals are
  aligned, these groups should not work outside of each other; instead, SoCal
  CAN proposes the coordination of these entities to ensure effective and
  efficient supports are available for all students.
