  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "By 2050, we envision all low-income, first generation students receiving the support they need to not only attend but also graduate from college. We imagine a Los Angeles where students, community-based organizations and colleges work together to ensure that all students are able to access the strongest support services their campus has to offer. \r\n\r\nSince 2009, over 1500 students have supported each other to graduation through SoCal CAN’s Level Up program. Within Level Up, students form teams that advocate for each other’s needs and direct each other to valuable on-campus support resources. However, sometimes there are not resources available to meet these needs or those resources are challenging to access. So, we propose that organizations and colleges act more like our students: we propose “teaming up” to better support college students. \r\n\r\nTo make LA the best place to learn, we will add to our more than 15 community-based organizations that are working in concert to identify effective practices in college success and leverage their collective power to effect institutional change. In the six years of our program, we have seen extraordinary benefits for participants and their students. Coordinated action allows organizations to focus on and build upon their core competencies, not wasting organizational capacity on projects that do not align with their strengths. Coordinated action also yields stronger results as organizations are integrating their core competencies into a collaborative program. Finally, and most importantly, more students can be more effectively served by a coordinated action, as more effective programming means more capacity to serve more people. In order to make our idea a reality, SoCal CAN proposes to integrate 15 new organizations (which translates to 1500 students) into some aspect of the Level Up program. \r\n\r\nCommunity-based organizations should not have to do this work on their own. In order for our idea to succeed, community-based organizations should stop working outside of colleges and rather work in concert with them. Through this partnership, community-based organizations will learn how to effectively prepare students for their time on campus and institutions will learn about the on-the-ground plight of students. In order to make our idea a reality, we will partner with 4 local colleges. "

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "In order to effectively engage a college in a collaboration, partnerships must be formed at various levels of the institution. The partnership must be led by high-level university leadership and their involvement will be leveraged to engage the other offices that have an effect on a students’ success. Engaging all of these institutional departments is a daunting task. However, we have two strategies for overcoming this challenge.\r\n\r\nThe first stems from our idea itself: by collaborating with other organizations, we expand our collective networks. The second strategy will require SoCal CAN to build our staff capacity to have firsthand knowledge of institutional politics. While SoCal CAN has had success in institutional and statewide advocacy, our knowledge is more rooted in low-income students and families. We seek to add a staff member who was previously employed by a college who can support SoCal CAN in effectively navigating on campus partnerships. "
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "The success of these collaborations must be measured by their effect on the students we serve. In order to ensure that our outcomes are being met, we will track students’ persistence through college by matching our students against the National Student Clearing House. Beyond this basic metric of student success, we will track a series of intermediate data points that we believe will signal whether students are going to successfully persist. We will not solely test how students are rating on these indicators; we will also analyze whether these indicators are effected by our collaborations with community-based organizations and colleges.  \r\n\r\nSuccess in this project will also be measured by the number of new partnerships SoCal CAN forms. As a network that thrives when collaboration is deep and purposeful, we will also track a series of data points that ensure that we are not only creating partnerships in name but instead purposeful, productive partnerships.  "
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "As more low-income students are accessing college, more of our field is turning their attention to college success. Both community-based organizations and institutions are crafting programming designed to support students’ persistence through college. We are thrilled about all the great work happening in our field and—as our unique value proposition—seek to harness that energy to craft effective, collaborative responses to the challenge. \r\n\r\nThis collaborative, networked approach to ensuring the college success of low-income, first generation students has multiple advantages that render it unique compared to other approaches. First, by engaging partners in the crafting of programming, we are able to source the most effective practices from the field and integrate them into one program. Also, through a collaboration, organizations and institutions that do not have the bandwidth to take on programming alone can offer supports, as each singular organization contributes only a portion of the work.\r\n\r\nFinally and most importantly, our collaborative approach allows for more students to be served more effectively. Not all students can be served by community-based organizations, especially when those organizations are being asked to take on new bodies of work with limited resources. Institutions also have limited resources and would benefit from the support of community-based organizations and their insights. "
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "To make this idea a reality, we will require many partners in our work. To date, over 15 community-based organizations have already joined together to collaboratively support students’ success through college. Those organizations are: Alliance College-Ready Public Schools, Bresee Foundation, Bright Prospect, College Access Plan, College Match, Fulfillment Fund, GEAR UP 4 LA, Heart of Los Angeles, Inner City Struggle, KIPP LA, Los Angeles Education Partnership, META Foundation, MOSTE, One Voice, Posse Foundation, Project GRAD LA, United Friends of the Children, and USC Neighborhood Academic Initiative.  \r\n\r\nThrough this project, we seek to add 15 organizations as Level Up collaborators. Collaborators must be involved in the design or implementation of Level Up in some manner. These organizations will be integrated into the Level Up Planning Committee, which meets every other month to discuss program happenings, progress, and future work. Our collaborators will continue to help design our student-to-student program and will have an additional responsibility to support the expansion of our partnerships. \r\n\r\nWe also seek to collaborate with four colleges or universities on this project. We will begin by targeting those local institutions that serve a large percentage of low-income students. As part of this project, we will target one University of California campus, two California State University campuses, and one community college campus. \r\n\r\nSince the program’s inception, partners have denounced the idea of any singular organization receiving funding for their participation. Partners have seen their contributions as equal—even when those contributions are of different types—and foresee challenges to the collaboration should funds be available. Moreover, the funding will be used for the facilitation of the collaboration, the synthesis of the ideas, the implementation of the program, and the coordination amongst partners, all of which SoCal CAN will take on. "
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': "The cost of this initiative will include both the cost of the student-facing portion of program as well as the cost of the collaborative program design and inclusion of new partners. We plan to cover the student-facing program costs through our current fundraising methods—both foundation funding and individual fundraising efforts. \r\n\r\nThe cost of expanding our college success partnerships will be approximately 100,000 dollars. The major cost will be the hiring of an additional SoCal CAN staff member, who would be well versed in forming collaborations with colleges and universities. We would rely on that new staff member to introduce us to the nuances of a college administration that would allow our Executive Director to use her advocacy skills effectively.\r\n\r\nAlso, as we increase our number of collaborators, we would like to add more opportunities for those partners to interact and uplift their contributions. Along with our six Level Up committee meetings, we will host an end of year “Collaborations in College Success” summit, where students, community-based organizations, and colleges and universities can come together to celebrate their work, integrate new collaborative partners, and set forth a vision for collaboration in the coming year. "
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "$70,000 – Strategic Partnerships Director\r\n$10,000 – Relationship building meetings with organizations and campus administrators \r\n$10,000 – Six stakeholders’ meetings + 1 Collaborations in College Success Summit to present the work of the group to all entities\r\n$8,000 – Stipend for 2 student liaisons at each of the campuses we partner with \r\n$2,000 – Group communications"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "As a network of multiple organizations that serve thousands of students, SoCal CAN always has scaling at the front of our mind. For six years, we have been evaluating and enhancing our program model, with an eye toward scalability and cost effectiveness. We believe our model has solidified to the point that we are ready to scale. In fact, this proposal is our plan to scale the success of our model.   \r\n\r\nMoreover, we see the scaling of this proposal as integral to the idea’s success. In order for our idea to take flight, we must leverage the success of our collaboration and our partnerships to add more partnerships. Each successful collaboration will add entry points for other collaborators. "
