title: Game Changing Marketplace to Source Hourly Jobseekers
project_summary: >-
  Our mission at JobCouch is not only to help match jobseekers with hourly job
  listings but also connect them with local job training programs. By partnering
  with LA non-profits, government (Workforce Investment Board) & community
  organizations, our goal is to close the talent-divide between employers and
  jobseekers (young adults (16-24), formerly incarcerated individuals &
  immigrants). We're not just focused on hourly jobs, but to help LA residents
  discover a career & opportunities to succeed.

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: "LA is a city of opportunity. From minority-owned small businesses, corporate retail & restaurant chains, to warehouses, jobseekers have access to thousands of hourly jobs. Not only are these local businesses a source of income for jobseekers, but a stepping stone to a better future.\r\n\r\nWith Mayor Garcetti's current agenda to strengthen L.A.'s economy, LA is the best place for JobCouch to collaborate with city leaders to improve the process of discovering hourly jobs & career opportunities. Currently, city council members Mayor Eric Garcetti, Supervisors Don Knabe, Hilda Solis, Sheila Kuehl, Mark Ridley-Thomas, and Councilmember Gil Cedillo, have all been strong advocates of HIRE L.A.'s Youth program which provides career exploration opportunities to low-income youth between the ages of 14 and 24.  This is only one of several running programs in LA that is helping bridge the gap of employment for young adults.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the collaboration with city leaders, potential partnership opportunities with the L.A. Opportunity Youth Collaborative, LAUSD, the Alliance for Children’s Rights, and the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce, Youth Workforce Development System in the City and County of Los Angeles, and other organizations will allow JobCouch to narrow the gap of unemployed youth.\r\n\r\nNot only are we targeting young adults in discovering opportunities to succeed, we're also targeting immigrants.  According to the 2008-2010 American Community Survey, more than one-third of residents in Los Angeles County are immigrants (More than 3.4 million immigrant residents in the County). Immigrants comprise nearly half of the labor force in Los Angeles County (45%). Our goal is to help the immigrant residents (citizens) in Los Angeles County discover hourly jobs and access to job training programs to help advance their careers.\r\n\r\nLastly, in Los Angeles, 1 in 4 has an arrest or conviction record. We will work with Center for Employment Opportunities, LA county Parole Divisions, and other Re-Entry councils to help guide jobseekers with criminal records get back on their feet with a hourly job or connect them with a job training program to help start a career.\r\n\r\n "

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "One major challenge I anticipate is signing up employers that can hire jobseekers with criminal records.  Although California has adopted the ban-the-box policy (laws to ban the prior-conviction box on job applications), many businesses still run criminal background checks on potential employees.\r\n\r\nFortunately, there are many fast casual restaurants and warehouses that accept applicants regardless of criminal background history.  We've worked with several businesses in SF where we've placed formerly incarcerated jobseekers into employment.   Potential partnerships with the Center for Employment Opportunities & Parole Divisions will help us identify which businesses in LA hire jobseekers with a criminal record.\r\n\r\nWe're are also fortunate to have an advisor with over 20 years of experience working with formerly incarcerated individuals to guide us on job placement."
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "JobCouch will evaluate the success of our work by measuring the following factors:\r\n\r\n1) Partner with 24 non-profit organizations to narrow the gap of unemployed young adults, immigrants, and jobseekers with criminal records.\r\n\r\n2) Sign up 10,000 active jobseekers (young adults, immigrants, & jobseekers with criminal records)\r\n\r\n3) Post 36,000 active hourly job listings   \r\n\r\n4) Average of 10% hire rate with employers"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "Organizations like Leadersup.org is complimentary, and we've discussed the possibility of collaboration with the CEO.  Competitors like Workpop.com, Apploi.com, Snagajob.com & Craigslist.org, all help with the search for hourly jobs. \r\n\r\nJobCouch is unique as we're not a job search engine or a job board, but a hourly job matching platform.  We're implementing the matching model from dating sites to deliver hourly job listings to jobseekers.  Rather than searching for a job, we match jobseekers to job listings posted by an employer.  Once the jobseeker applies, and the employer expresses interest, an interview is scheduled.  Only job listings that he jobseeker qualifies for (based on profile), will be delivered to their dashboard.  Lastly, besides Leadersup.org, we are the only private company to match jobseekers with local job training programs."
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    We will be working with United Way, Workforce Development Center, Workforce
    Investment Board, and other organizations.  We will also be working with
    employers like Specialty's Cafe & Bakery, The North Face, Creative Baby
    Warehouse, and other hourly employers.  None of the grant will be going to
    the partners.
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    Our projected cost is $250,000 for 2016.  We will cover the additional cost
    from generating revenue from employers.  If we are unable to generate
    revenue, we will seek angel investment.
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "$30,000 - Outsource development of iOS & Android app\r\n$12,000 - Community donations to High Schools, and youth centers for             brand awareness campaigns\r\n$36,000 - Office Rent & Supplies\r\n$22,000 - Social Media Advertisement (Facebook & Twitter Ads) to drive sign ups & brand awareness"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    With collaboration with city leaders and partnerships with local job
    training centers & job assistance organizations, we will have distribution
    channels to help us spread the word of our mission.  By partnering with
    major retail stores, we will be able to expand into multiple store locations
    to implement JobCouch as their main applicant tracking system. By proving
    results for the small business community, we will be able to help drive
    applicants and help deliver quality candidates to stores that have never had
    a system to track and source new applicants.
