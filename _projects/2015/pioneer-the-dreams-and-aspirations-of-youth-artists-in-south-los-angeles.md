title: Pioneer the Dreams and Aspirations of Youth & Artists in South Los Angeles
project_summary: >-
  Every year, the dreams and aspirations of many youth living in Los Angeles
  wanting to express their artistic talents come to a screeching halt due to a
  lack of creative outlets. According to the South LA Work Source Center, 4 out
  of 10 under privileged youth between the ages of 16-24 years old seek work
  experience and interest in the creative/art profession. As Otis College of Art
  and Design Alumni, we recognize the void and plan to fulfill it through an
  established community engaged art house.

Our project provides a platform for young artists to show their creations while networking with people in the creative circuit. \r\n\r\nAnother aspect of our mission is to increase involvement between artists and the community through community engagements, collaboration and mentorship with local elementary students. We propose creating a well-rounded organization that creates opportunities for new artists, discovers new talent from local youths, as well as generates successful fundraising events to provide for underprivileged families in the area during the holiday season. \r\n\r\nThe first event that launched Dreamhaus was its annual Toy Drive Benefit on December 13th, 2014, an event that served students at Saturn Elementary School by gifting toys during Christmas season. In addition, the benefit included a concert in collaboration with The OPM Company and Dom Kennedy. The event was open to the public and attendees were asked to either pay a $10 donation or donate a toy of at least that same value. We had over 400 attendees who came to support our cause and the event was deemed a success. In Toy Drive Benefits to come, the students who receive the toys will be mentored and collaborate with artists who participate in the Artist-Run Space to build out installations for viewing at the Toy Drive event. The Dreamhaus mission will come full circle by artists gaining experience in hosting successful gallery shows, exposing young students to a career in the arts and developing a deeper sense of community in the District 9 area.\r\n"

  Our “Artist Run Space” aims to respond to the lack of opportunity, by
  magnifying these artists’ works. Our project provides a platform for young
  artists to show their creations while networking with people in the creative
  circuit. 
   
   Another aspect of our mission is to increase involvement between artists and the community through community engagements, collaboration and mentorship with local elementary students. We propose creating a well-rounded organization that creates opportunities for new artists, discovers new talent from local youths, as well as generates successful fundraising events to provide for underprivileged families in the area during the holiday season. 
   
   The first event that launched Dreamhaus was its annual Toy Drive Benefit on December 13th, 2014, an event that served students at Saturn Elementary School by gifting toys during Christmas season. In addition, the benefit included a concert in collaboration with The OPM Company and Dom Kennedy. The event was open to the public and attendees were asked to either pay a $10 donation or donate a toy of at least that same value.

The Dreamhaus mission will come full circle by artists gaining experience in hosting successful gallery shows, exposing young students to a career in the arts and developing a deeper sense of community in the District 9 area.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  One major barrier Dreamhaus will face is the issue of connecting the artistic
  and the local community. The “Artist Run Space” inhabits the 90037 zip code in
  the District 9 area. The ever-changing neighborhood of USC and Exposition Park
  serves as a prime example of wealth disparity in the community and exemplifies
  the visual image of Los Angeles. Dreamhaus aims to unite fine art and folk art
  by utilizing our storefront window, which faces Vermont Avenue right across
  from the LA Coliseum. To have commissioned art installations in our storefront
  window will be a perfect way to interface with the community and demonstrate
  our artistic mission. A second challenge that Dreamhaus will face is the
  collaboration between young children and artists. To overcome this obstacle,
  Dreamhaus will sponsor programs that enable artists to give back to the
  community by teaching art workshops at local partnering schools within our
  neighborhood.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Dreamhaus will foster an educational & artistic platform by accomplishing the
  following goals:
   (1) Showcase 20 artists; new in the professional art circuit, to help them gain experience and build their CV. These artists will have the opportunity to communicate their vision on an open forum artist discussion, showcase their artworks for a month in the Dreamhaus space, and leave with a physical catalogue that can be utilized in advancing their careers outside of Dreamhaus.
   (2) We will Track the number of attendees for every event. Our current (250) person core audience will increase 15-20% each quarter, reaching an audience of 400-450 by the end of the year.
   (3) 12 workshops that cultivate a core group of 10 kids into realizing the possibilities of art as a career. We will focus on their specific and unique ideas to help them establish a body of artwork for their art career.
   (4) Ensure 640 kids receive at least 5 donated gifts for the Christmas season.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  SPARC, also known as Social and Public Art Resource Center, is an organization
  that focuses on educating at-risk youth, and is complementary to Dreamhaus and
  its mission. Its work focuses on community engagement to provide empowerment
  to the residents of the neighborhood outside of civic debate. While SPARC
  focuses on the significance of the process in creating the artwork, Dreamhaus
  intends on measuring the value of the work based on its relativity to the
  neighborhood. However, both programs show the significant transformative
  impact that art can have on the important social problems of our generation.
   
   
   Another organization that does similar work is Elephant Gallery in Glassell Park, CA. This organization is also an “Artist-Run Space” and allows artists to submit proposals, yet they do not have any community-related projects. Elephant Gallery solely presents a platform where artists can showcase their work, however Dreamhaus integrates the surrounding neighborhood with the artists’ vision. Our organization is unique because we believe that we can make a change within the South Los Angeles community by transforming the way the public perceives the career of an artist and to motivate young students who are interested in technical or conceptual arts to pursue a professional art career.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Collaboration bridges common goals between separate entities. The OPM Company
  is a successful independent record company dedicated to giving a platform to
  aspiring musicians. Dom Kennedy, a Los Angeles-born rapper, is an advocate for
  Dreamhaus and is a partner. In addition, Pacific Dissent is a local, Los
  Angeles-based contemporary art magazine that features photographers, painters,
  and writers from around the globe. Their publication is a platform that allows
  artists to be discovered in cities such as Los Angeles and New York. In this
  way, Pacific Dissent is a magazine version of what Dreamhaus aspires to be.
  Both companies hope to shape the future perception of artists, and uncover
  unprecedented artistic talent. 
   
   Both partner organizations will gain benefit of this grant through the renovated space and its artists. Dreamhaus, The OPM Company and Pacific Dissent will all share resources and create opportunities by opening the doors to innovative and risk-taking individuals willing to push boundaries as we (together) shape Los Angeles to become the best place to learn, create, connect and live.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Since our proposal outlines our mission to construct an “Artist-Run Space,”
  the first method of scaling success would be simply having a fully-functional
  facility, one that houses art events. Moreover, by sustaining a consistent
  schedule of artist showcases in our studio, our effect can be measured. The
  projected start date for renovations to the studio will be January 2016.
  Meanwhile, we will be reviewing proposals of artists with art collections that
  are ready to show. These candidates will have the opportunity to explain their
  concept, and, in addition, they will commit to leading a month-long workshop
  in alignment with the Dreamhaus mission to establish community engagement
  between artists and youth. As we reach the six-month mark, we hope to discuss
  the possibility of opening up the studio to displaying two artists per month
  in order to maintain a level of productivity in the organization. By slowly
  expanding the operation in this natural fashion, and growing our number of art
  events consistently (to compete with schedules of certain reputable museums),
  scaling will be self-evident.
   
   Another phase of our plan to measure the success of our proposal is the work we will do with elementary school students. Our co-founders have a history of working with Saturn Elementary School and we would like to expand our work by holding art workshops for small groups of students. We believe that involving a younger generation of students in learning about technical and conceptual art skills will better acclimate them with their studies in school. To give an example- in a classroom setting, we will limit students to a specific color palette where they will be instructed to create an abstract piece. Once they are finished, we will ask them to explain their thought process and the reasoning behind their creation. We will scale the success by knowing that the children have a strong grasp on conscious decision-making in the art marking process. Our hope is to help students realize the connection between their imagination and their success in everyday classroom setting (and beyond). 
   
   Finally, back to the “Artist Run Space,” we hope that in five years time, Dreamhaus will be a point of reference for corporations to connect with artists. Funding from this grant challenge will allow us to work towards a better Los Angeles as a place to create, connect and live.
