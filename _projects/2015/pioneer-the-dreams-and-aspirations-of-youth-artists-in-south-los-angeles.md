title: Pioneer the Dreams and Aspirations of Youth & Artists in South Los Angeles
project_summary: >-
  Every year, the dreams and aspirations of many youth living in Los Angeles
  wanting to express their artistic talents come to a screeching halt due to a
  lack of creative outlets. According to the South LA Work Source Center, 4 out
  of 10 under privileged youth between the ages of 16-24 years old seek work
  experience and interest in the creative/art profession. As Otis College of Art
  and Design Alumni, we recognize the void and plan to fulfill it through an
  established community engaged art house.

Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: "Our “Artist Run Space” aims to respond to the lack of opportunity, by magnifying these artists’ works. Our project provides a platform for young artists to show their creations while networking with people in the creative circuit. \r\n\r\nAnother aspect of our mission is to increase involvement between artists and the community through community engagements, collaboration and mentorship with local elementary students. We propose creating a well-rounded organization that creates opportunities for new artists, discovers new talent from local youths, as well as generates successful fundraising events to provide for underprivileged families in the area during the holiday season. \r\n\r\nThe first event that launched Dreamhaus was its annual Toy Drive Benefit on December 13th, 2014, an event that served students at Saturn Elementary School by gifting toys during Christmas season. In addition, the benefit included a concert in collaboration with The OPM Company and Dom Kennedy. The event was open to the public and attendees were asked to either pay a $10 donation or donate a toy of at least that same value. We had over 400 attendees who came to support our cause and the event was deemed a success. In Toy Drive Benefits to come, the students who receive the toys will be mentored and collaborate with artists who participate in the Artist-Run Space to build out installations for viewing at the Toy Drive event. The Dreamhaus mission will come full circle by artists gaining experience in hosting successful gallery shows, exposing young students to a career in the arts and developing a deeper sense of community in the District 9 area.\r\n"
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Dreamhaus will foster an educational & artistic platform by accomplishing the following goals:\r\n(1)\tShowcase 20 artists; new in the professional art circuit, to help them gain experience and build their CV. These artists will have the opportunity to communicate their vision on an open forum artist discussion, showcase their artworks for a month in the Dreamhaus space, and leave with a physical catalogue that can be utilized in advancing their careers outside of Dreamhaus.\r\n(2)\tWe will Track the number of attendees for every event. Our current (250) person core audience will increase 15-20% each quarter, reaching an audience of 400-450 by the end of the year.\r\n(3)\t12 workshops that cultivate a core group of 10 kids into realizing the possibilities of art as a career. We will focus on their specific and unique ideas to help them establish a body of artwork for their art career.\r\n(4)\tEnsure 640 kids receive at least 5 donated gifts for the Christmas season."
