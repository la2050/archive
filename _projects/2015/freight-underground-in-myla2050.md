title: Freight Underground in MYLA2050
project_summary: >-
  GRID proposes a Demand-Risk Public Private Partnership whereby private
  investment replaces traditional tax-payer backed securities to build large
  scale transportation infrastructure. We connect port containers with inland
  freight distribution hubs comprising of a 3-pronged systems platform;
  1)SuperDock, a new platform to load and unload container ships, 2)Freight
  Pipeline; an underground container shuttle under existing freeways connecting
  four counties, and 3)last mile truck feeder terminals.

    GRID's mission is to handle future anticipated increases in freight volume
    while simultaneously reducing our carbon and traffic footprints.  How?
    First, by linking clean large scale infrastructure to sustainable job
    growth; by-products, particularly healthcare provided by gainful employment
    brings great benefit our targeted communities.  Jobs creation has a direct
    impact to quality of life in community households to include quality
    healthcare.  The ability to provide healthy foods and regular healthcare
    checkups are more common practice in homes with higher incomes. 15% of all
    highway traffic deaths involve big rig trucks.  By sending freight
    underground, we create a safer driving environment for commuters to use our
    extensive freeway networks with a reduced risk of accidents.  Trucks have a
    10 to 1 traffic congestion impact on freeway gridlock.  The reduction of
    freight frees up congestion having two tremendous impacts on millions of
    people both driving on freeways and those living within one mile of them. 
    The reduced congestion reduces time driving.  The average LA County commuter
    spends nearly 24 hours a month in their cars commuting. Stresses associate
    with commuting are a genuine factor of life here in Southern California. 
    Air pollution including particulate matter from rubber tires and brakes
    along with emissions create the worst air quality for those living along
    traffic corridors.  Particularly impacted are those under-represented
    communities that exist along freight corridor freeway networks.  Freeways
    where most freight travels to and from our port complexes and into the
    south, southeast and eastern regions of Los Angeles are most heavily.  The
    impacts are felt even worse as the freight travels east to the Inland Empire
    where again, under represented communities are most effected with dirty air
    and unbearable freeway congestion. This is the first comprehensive solution
    with the ambition and vision to improve the quality of life for millions of
    people living and commuting in the region.  Los Angeles is the ideal city to
    lead this effort.  An effort that impacts all commuters using bikes, trains,
    cars, and walking to get where they need to go each and every day.  Without
    clean air, these means of transportation will continue to be an unhealthy
    factor to our daily activities, even those thought to be healthy!

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    COLLABORATION among stakeholders. Many times, people refer to organizations
    as silos and thus the term silo mentality. For example, port authorities are
    focused on port infrastructure and have no influence on where freight goes
    once it leaves the port infrastructure.  Municipal transportation
    authorities are focused on road and rail for commuters and freight becomes a
    burdensome "freeload" to the cost road infrastructure as it shares roads
    with cars.  There are council's of governments that focus on their specific
    regions, politicians who serve local constituents (as they should). The
    solution to future transportation is not in the hands of this proposer, it
    is in the hands of decision makers who must break down silos both public and
    private in nature.  The overcoming strategy is ultimately in the hands of
    the people.  Grassroots support from those who become aware that new ideas
    to improve transportation are out there. Programs like MYLA2050 are an ideal
    portal to create awareness.
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    GRID is an infrastructure project proposal.  The first step is to evaluate
    the project. An example is to perform a project feasibility study, an
    environmental impact report, simulations and scoping. Once the data is
    collected, stakeholders will determine if the innovations are worthy of
    development.  If so, outreach to the communities the infrastructure is
    mainly constructed will be an important and early "evaluating body" in the
    process. These studies will come with specific milestones to measure the
    increasing or decreasing feasibility of the projects. Evaluation is best
    described as a public private partnership decision.  The public sector will
    provide entitlement as the project meets or exceeds milestones.  The private
    sector will be evaluating other factors like build-ability and
    profitability. It is our mission to connect with champions who will lead
    this effort.  They will come from communities of business, labor,
    environment, elected leaders, and everyday people.
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    No other organization we know of has ever taken this approach.  GRID takes
    two fundamental problems; port congestion created by next generation
    ultra-large container ships and freeway traffic congestion brought on by
    semi trucks and trains travelling to and from ports and distribution
    warehousing, and applies a comprehensive freight supply chain solution
    bringing 21st Century transportation to the table. GRID co-founders are a
    duo of underground pipeline development and port operations to create a
    scale-able and seamless transportation system that is as benign as possible
    to the communities currently impacted negatively by a fifty year old system
    of intermodal transportation.  We had the foresight of five years to build a
    startup company dedicated to new cleantech infrastructure and established
    proprietary rights five years ago to create the most successful cleantech
    company in California's history with international application potential. 
    Port cities around the world could benefit from this truly Los Angeles born
    and raises startup.  During our journey, we've come to discover that the
    success or failure of our endeavor rests in the hands of the regions
    stakeholders who are impacted by urban transportation.  We've identified
    them as public and private entities who all have priorities to achieve in
    their own right. Our approach is to bring all stakeholders perceived to be
    either small or large to the table. Our platform comprises of job creation,
    improved environmental conditions, transportation, and our ability to
    compete in the worldwide arena of global trade. However, there are an
    abundance of complementary players who will be vital in our mission. Zero
    emission truck, rail, and container moving platform manufacturers are one
    example.  Energy providers building new alternative energy infrastructure to
    make our fully electric platforms zero or near zero emissions capable.
    Private sector financing to replace tax-payer funded transportation
    infrastructure is among the most important unique solutions that decision
    makers and stakeholders must embrace for our proposals to become implemented
    for this opportunity to become realized. 
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    GRID Is a Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator portfolio company and will have
    the critical resource of building our startup vision at the $40M LaKretz
    Innovation Campus. Here, we will have a hub of support in the form of
    networks, financing, engineering, design, and project development.  50% of
    the grant will go to human resources who will work on the project as we have
    been a pre-revenue company for nearly 5 years.  Sustaining startup human
    resources is the most challenging aspect to startups who are bringing
    genuine game-changing innovation to major markets. The remaining half will
    go primarily to operational expenses and consultant partners to include
    business and project development (computer design), legal, and costs to
    participate in events that will bring networking and trade connections.
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "The program will commence at the La Kretz Innovation Campus where GRID will be further developed by a team of full time and part time intern staff and supported by the centers availability of world class research facilities and equipment.  All printed materials come at no cost to the business.  The program begins with continuing our campaign outreach to stakeholders.  This award will bolster our ability to gain acceptance of the new Office of Extraordinary Innovation created by LAMTA and just opened on October 5th as we will apply as a project participant. In July Governor Brown issued executive order B-32-15 to create pilot projects \"to ensure progress towards a sustainable freight system, these entities initiate work this year on corridor-level freight pilot projects within the State's primary trade corridors that integrate advanced technologies, alternative fuels, freight and fuel infrastructure, and local economic development opportunities.\" Please see the executive order at https://www.gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=19046\r\nThis executive order seeks widespread collaboration to achieve a sustainable freight transportation system.  The MYLA2050 award will sustain our companies efforts to connect with the state, federal, regional, and local stakeholders to move this proposal forward.  We intend to scale the proposal by engaging with private firms interested in investing in our transportation infrastructure, however, we must collaborate with local stakeholders first to ensure that the project is in demand from communities near the freight supply chain.  We seek support from both public and private interests to engage with these \"grassroots\" and under represented constituencies. The ultimate success of failure of this project lies within our ability to evaluate the project for feasibility.  This is what the core mission is of the proposers and the MYLA2050 award is a means to start the process.\r\n"
