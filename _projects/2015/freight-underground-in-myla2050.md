project_summary: >-
  GRID proposes a Demand-Risk Public Private Partnership whereby private
  investment replaces traditional tax-payer backed securities to build large
  scale transportation infrastructure. We connect port containers with inland
  freight distribution hubs comprising of a 3-pronged systems platform;
  1)SuperDock, a new platform to load and unload container ships, 2)Freight
  Pipeline; an underground container shuttle under existing freeways connecting
  four counties, and 3)last mile truck feeder terminals.

  GRID's mission is to handle future anticipated increases in freight volume
  while simultaneously reducing our carbon and traffic footprints. How? First,
  by linking clean large scale infrastructure to sustainable job growth;
  by-products, particularly healthcare provided by gainful employment brings
  great benefit our targeted communities. Jobs creation has a direct impact to
  quality of life in community households to include quality healthcare. The
  ability to provide healthy foods and regular healthcare checkups are more
  common practice in homes with higher incomes. 15% of all highway traffic
  deaths involve big rig trucks. By sending freight underground, we create a
  safer driving environment for commuters to use our extensive freeway networks
  with a reduced risk of accidents. Trucks have a 10 to 1 traffic congestion
  impact on freeway gridlock. The reduction of freight frees up congestion
  having two tremendous impacts on millions of people both driving on freeways
  and those living within one mile of them. The reduced congestion reduces time
  driving. The average LA County commuter spends nearly 24 hours a month in
  their cars commuting. Stresses associate with commuting are a genuine factor
  of life here in Southern California. Air pollution including particulate
  matter from rubber tires and brakes along with emissions create the worst air
  quality for those living along traffic corridors. Particularly impacted are
  those under-represented communities that exist along freight corridor freeway
  networks. Freeways where most freight travels to and from our port complexes
  and into the south, southeast and eastern regions of Los Angeles are most
  heavily. The impacts are felt even worse as the freight travels east to the
  Inland Empire where again, under represented communities are most effected
  with dirty air and unbearable freeway congestion. This is the first
  comprehensive solution with the ambition and vision to improve the quality of
  life for millions of people living and commuting in the region. Los Angeles is
  the ideal city to lead this effort. An effort that impacts all commuters using
  bikes, trains, cars, and walking to get where they need to go each and every
  day. Without clean air, these means of transportation will continue to be an
  unhealthy factor to our daily activities, even those thought to be healthy!
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  COLLABORATION among stakeholders. Many times, people refer to organizations as
  silos and thus the term silo mentality. For example, port authorities are
  focused on port infrastructure and have no influence on where freight goes
  once it leaves the port infrastructure. Municipal transportation authorities
  are focused on road and rail for commuters and freight becomes a burdensome
  "freeload" to the cost road infrastructure as it shares roads with cars. There
  are council's of governments that focus on their specific regions, politicians
  who serve local constituents (as they should). The solution to future
  transportation is not in the hands of this proposer, it is in the hands of
  decision makers who must break down silos both public and private in nature.
  The overcoming strategy is ultimately in the hands of the people. Grassroots
  support from those who become aware that new ideas to improve transportation
  are out there. Programs like MYLA2050 are an ideal portal to create awareness.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  GRID is an infrastructure project proposal. The first step is to evaluate the
  project. An example is to perform a project feasibility study, an
  environmental impact report, simulations and scoping. Once the data is
  collected, stakeholders will determine if the innovations are worthy of
  development. If so, outreach to the communities the infrastructure is mainly
  constructed will be an important and early "evaluating body" in the process.
  These studies will come with specific milestones to measure the increasing or
  decreasing feasibility of the projects. Evaluation is best described as a
  public private partnership decision. The public sector will provide
  entitlement as the project meets or exceeds milestones. The private sector
  will be evaluating other factors like build-ability and profitability. It is
  our mission to connect with champions who will lead this effort. They will
  come from communities of business, labor, environment, elected leaders, and
  everyday people.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  No other organization we know of has ever taken this approach. GRID takes two
  fundamental problems; port congestion created by next generation ultra-large
  container ships and freeway traffic congestion brought on by semi trucks and
  trains travelling to and from ports and distribution warehousing, and applies
  a comprehensive freight supply chain solution bringing 21st Century
  transportation to the table. GRID co-founders are a duo of underground
  pipeline development and port operations to create a scale-able and seamless
  transportation system that is as benign as possible to the communities
  currently impacted negatively by a fifty year old system of intermodal
  transportation. We had the foresight of five years to build a startup company
  dedicated to new cleantech infrastructure and established proprietary rights
  five years ago to create the most successful cleantech company in California's
  history with international application potential. Port cities around the world
  could benefit from this truly Los Angeles born and raises startup. During our
  journey, we've come to discover that the success or failure of our endeavor
  rests in the hands of the regions stakeholders who are impacted by urban
  transportation. We've identified them as public and private entities who all
  have priorities to achieve in their own right. Our approach is to bring all
  stakeholders perceived to be either small or large to the table. Our platform
  comprises of job creation, improved environmental conditions, transportation,
  and our ability to compete in the worldwide arena of global trade. However,
  there are an abundance of complementary players who will be vital in our
  mission. Zero emission truck, rail, and container moving platform
  manufacturers are one example. Energy providers building new alternative
  energy infrastructure to make our fully electric platforms zero or near zero
  emissions capable. Private sector financing to replace tax-payer funded
  transportation infrastructure is among the most important unique solutions
  that decision makers and stakeholders must embrace for our proposals to become
  implemented for this opportunity to become realized.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  GRID Is a Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator portfolio company and will have the
  critical resource of building our startup vision at the $40M LaKretz
  Innovation Campus. Here, we will have a hub of support in the form of
  networks, financing, engineering, design, and project development. 50% of the
  grant will go to human resources who will work on the project as we have been
  a pre-revenue company for nearly 5 years. Sustaining startup human resources
  is the most challenging aspect to startups who are bringing genuine
  game-changing innovation to major markets. The remaining half will go
  primarily to operational expenses and consultant partners to include business
  and project development (computer design), legal, and costs to participate in
  events that will bring networking and trade connections.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 â€“ how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  $100,000 dollars was the first infusion to Google Inc. Seed capital is the
  life blood to startups. It gives the startup the ability to operate as a
  functioning organization while no income is a standard reality. MYLA2050 is
  seen by us similar to a "seed investor". We believe we will bring a
  significant return on investment that will one day be measure by economic
  value for Los Angeles. This award represents a bridge to funding this startup
  as we have already begun talks with potential strategic partners and venture
  capitalists who will bring the next round of investment capital to build the
  company. The award from MYLA2050 will buy our startup time and energy to
  create a stellar team of interns and project supporter in a way that every
  small startup must experience. Without seed funding, new startups could not
  exist. To summarize, the $100,000 serves as a bridge to acquire series A
  funding. The award itself would trigger a tremendous milestone to attracting
  venture capital from all over the world. To the proposers of this competition,
  the value to winning the MYLA2050 award is equal in value to us as the
  $100,000 prize.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
  $50% goes to two full time human resources to financially sustain their work
  and commuting costs for a period of 1 year. President will receive $30k spread
  over one year and Vice President $20K over one year. $5K to transportation and
  participation to relevant events for participation. $20k will be allocated for
  consultants. $10k computer designers who will work to develop the project on a
  contract basis. $10k legal expenses over one year. $2.5k will be required to
  pay rent at the LaKretz Innovation Campus. $2.5k held for any and all
  unforseen expenses that could be incurred over a period of one year.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  The program will commence at the La Kretz Innovation Campus where GRID will be
  further developed by a team of full time and part time intern staff and
  supported by the centers availability of world class research facilities and
  equipment. All printed materials come at no cost to the business. The program
  begins with continuing our campaign outreach to stakeholders. This award will
  bolster our ability to gain acceptance of the new Office of Extraordinary
  Innovation created by LAMTA and just opened on October 5th as we will apply as
  a project participant. In July Governor Brown issued executive order B-32-15
  to create pilot projects "to ensure progress towards a sustainable freight
  system, these entities initiate work this year on corridor-level freight pilot
  projects within the State's primary trade corridors that integrate advanced
  technologies, alternative fuels, freight and fuel infrastructure, and local
  economic development opportunities." Please see the executive order at
  https://www.gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=19046
   This executive order seeks widespread collaboration to achieve a sustainable freight transportation system. The MYLA2050 award will sustain our companies efforts to connect with the state, federal, regional, and local stakeholders to move this proposal forward. We intend to scale the proposal by engaging with private firms interested in investing in our transportation infrastructure, however, we must collaborate with local stakeholders first to ensure that the project is in demand from communities near the freight supply chain. We seek support from both public and private interests to engage with these "grassroots" and under represented constituencies. The ultimate success of failure of this project lies within our ability to evaluate the project for feasibility. This is what the core mission is of the proposers and the MYLA2050 award is a means to start the process.
