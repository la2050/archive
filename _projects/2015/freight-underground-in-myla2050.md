title: Freight Underground in MYLA2050
project_summary: >-
  GRID proposes a Demand-Risk Public Private Partnership whereby private
  investment replaces traditional tax-payer backed securities to build large
  scale transportation infrastructure. We connect port containers with inland
  freight distribution hubs comprising of a 3-pronged systems platform;
  1)SuperDock, a new platform to load and unload container ships, 2)Freight
  Pipeline; an underground container shuttle under existing freeways connecting
  four counties, and 3)last mile truck feeder terminals.

Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  GRID is an infrastructure project proposal.  The first step is to evaluate the
  project. An example is to perform a project feasibility study, an
  environmental impact report, simulations and scoping. Once the data is
  collected, stakeholders will determine if the innovations are worthy of
  development.  If so, outreach to the communities the infrastructure is mainly
  constructed will be an important and early "evaluating body" in the process.
  These studies will come with specific milestones to measure the increasing or
  decreasing feasibility of the projects. Evaluation is best described as a
  public private partnership decision.  The public sector will provide
  entitlement as the project meets or exceeds milestones.  The private sector
  will be evaluating other factors like build-ability and profitability. It is
  our mission to connect with champions who will lead this effort.  They will
  come from communities of business, labor, environment, elected leaders, and
  everyday people.
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
  - Money (financial capital)
  - Volunteers/staff (human capital)
  - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
  - Community outreach
  - Network/relationship support
