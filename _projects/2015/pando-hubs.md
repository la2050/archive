title: PANDO HUBS
project_summary: >-
  The intention of this proposal is to transform Los Angeles by identifying and
  networking its existing hubs of ecological civilization – places where healthy
  living and education extends to social relations and the biosphere.  This
  pilot grant will allow us to take a series of small, bold moves in nurturing
  relationships among the hubs, and to develop plans for our next step, to
  create and support new centers of ecological living, work and innovation.  We
  call these places Pando Hubs.
