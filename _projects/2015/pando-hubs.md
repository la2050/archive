title: PANDO HUBS
project_summary: >-
  The intention of this proposal is to transform Los Angeles by identifying and
  networking its existing hubs of ecological civilization – places where healthy
  living and education extends to social relations and the biosphere.  This
  pilot grant will allow us to take a series of small, bold moves in nurturing
  relationships among the hubs, and to develop plans for our next step, to
  create and support new centers of ecological living, work and innovation.  We
  call these places Pando Hubs.

  'DESCRIBE IN GREATER DETAIL HOW YOU WILL MAKE LA THE HEALTHIEST PLACE TO LIVE: ': "This is a 9-mo. pilot project that lays the foundation for building ecological civilization in LA -- one urban hub at a time.\r\n\r\nWe will identify a network of locations and orgs throughout LA where a new way of living is taking root; learn what makes these places of ecological innovation work; discover how best we can nurture their development, and apply what we learn to developing a plan for scaling growth.\r\n\r\nWe call these places Pando Hubs. “Pando” is the name of the oldest and largest life form on the planet -- a massive aspen grove connected by a single root, with every part nourishing the rest.\r\n\r\nThere are lots of possible Pando Hub models. Perhaps an urban eco-village or intentional community. Environmental magnet school. Urban farm. Neighborhood vegan restaurant/supply chain. Eco-homeless shelter. Green incubator. Or a combination.\r\n\r\nHubs are places that reflect an ecological worldview. Sites of innovation, resilience and community for a diverse range of people. Where life is being rethought from the ground up, with the planet’s health and the health of each other in mind. They bring bold ideas about the shape of the future down to Earth.\r\n\r\nLA already has places like this. But they often exist in isolation from each other. If they focus on different areas, they don’t necessarily recognize the connective tissue that runs between them.  We do.\r\n\r\nLaunching Pando Hubs, we will: \r\n\r\n1) Identify and connect a network of already-existing locations of ecological civilization in LA -- businesses, services, NGOs.\r\n\r\n2) Understand and document the important features that make them work. Draft 3 case studies.\r\n\r\n3) Conceive small-bet opportunities tailored to help Hubs thrive – in terms of community, learning, and new development. \r\n\r\nSmall bets let us think wrong, be bold, invent, see what works. John Bielenberg leads our Blitz process to generate small-bet ideas, from testing pop-up Hub prototypes and events to transforming would-be Hubs into something greener/healthier to tech and social media ideas for connecting.\r\n\r\n4) Launch 5-7 small-bet Pando Hub initiatives based on a matrix of do-ability vs. impact. Network over social media. \r\n\r\n5) Critically assess. Draw up next-step plans that build on success and create opportunities for further Hub development and growth.\r\n\r\nWe aim to have Pando Hubs in every City Council district citywide. \r\n\r\nWe launch under City Councilmember Paul Koretz's campaign, “Decade: Climate Safe (2016-25).”\r\n"

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "How do we get buy-in across diverse communities?\r\n\r\nWe have pulled together a “Pando Corps” from our base to help us in this process. Our base draws from those who attended our inaugural conference at Pomona College in June 2015, focused on rethinking civilization along ecological lines (2,000 attendees, across 80 areas of specialty), as well as the groups that co-sponsored our press conference and rally at USC last month in support of the pope’s call for “integral ecology.” Many of these environmental, social justice, civic, business, interfaith and educational groups have joined with us to create Pando Hubs.  We develop our work within this broad coalition of support.\r\n\r\nMany also recognize the value of linking a particular cause (say, obesity) to other issues (say, climate change or issues of equity) that, while connections may not be obvious at first, gives all groups strength. \r\n\r\nDiverse groups have already expressed strong interest in becoming a Pando Hub.\r\n"
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Qualitatively, success means we will develop critical intelligence to foster a Hub network across LA where healthy food can be accessed, air pollution and carbon footprint levels are reduced, opportunities for green jobs arise and self-sufficiency increases, obesity, mental illness and addiction are addressed in more holistic ways, homeless people come to know less alienation, and living in closer relationship to LA-area plants and animals is valued.\r\n\r\nQuantitatively, we will:\r\n\r\no\tID and describe some 10-12 locations of ecological civilization in LA.\r\no\tWrite 3 case studies seeking to understand successful Hub models.\r\no\tAssess small-bets success in nurturing Hub development and growth.\r\no\tDevelop detailed next-step plans based on above research and assessments.  \r\no\tCreate a workable next-steps plan.\r\no\tDemonstrate concept buy-in over social media, including online conversations. \r\no\tIdentify at least 10 opportunities for next-step funding from among a diverse range of funders.\r\n"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "Our overall orientation and roots offer us special opportunities:\r\n\r\n-- We have relations with many excellent environmental organizations in the city. But we likely hold a singular position in LA among those who are interested in the intersection of big ideas and the Earth.  This emphasis allows us to link a broader diversity of subjects, people, and organizations than groups that focus on a single set of issues. Our inaugural conference in Claremont in June featured more than 80 fields of specialty exploring fundamental assumptions of culture, on behalf of the Earth.  The relationship between broad, transdisciplinary subjects and the planet has been the main focus of our founding chairperson, John B. Cobb, Jr., since at least 1971. \r\n\r\n--Many diverse faith-based organizations are also concerned about creating a healthier LA, broadly conceived. We are collaborating with a number of them, from major world religions to interfaith organizations to those of no faith tradition. Within Los Angeles, however, we have singular opportunities for deep interfaith relations.  Our founding chairperson, at a very active 90 years of age, has unique standing in the field as one of the leading philosophers of religion alive today, in addition to pioneering the intersection of philosophy/religion, ethics, and the environment.  \r\n\r\n--Educational institutions also are interested in a healthier and environmentally stronger Los Angeles, with UCLA as one example among many. The focus of great research institutions, however, tends to be highly specialized. Our focus is very broad, such that a healthy life cannot be understood without reference to economics, philosophy, urban planning and environmental policy as well as to biology, medicine, psychology, and on.\r\n\r\n--Within the art and design community, excellent organizations are taking advantage of LA’s forward-edge position and creating pioneering efforts in the design-for-good movement with a holistic vision in mind.  GOOD Magazine is a wonderful example. The art and design team affiliated with Pando Populus, headed by John Bielenberg, has also long been involved in design for good, with Project M as one example.  Tucker Nichols, formerly artist-in-residence at Facebook, is an example of one with whom we collaborated recently in developing images for branding and social media. World Studio Foundation has a strong track record in national programs as well. \r\n"

Some additional growth will be achieved organically as we extend the Corps network and ideas spread. \r\n\r\nThe next stage of significant growth will be achieved as we create development models that respond to the most promising range of funding opportunities.  These funding opportunities likely include a full range of for-profit, non-profit, and government sources. \r\n\r\nOne model of a Pando Hub, for instance, might appeal to millennials interested in an urban intentional community; another might offer a low-cost veteran housing solution; another might function more as an urban farm and organic food-producing center. The examples are less important than the fact that each likely offers the opportunity for a different kind of funding structure and/or different model of ownership. The top tier opportunities (assessed according to feasibility and need) will be developed and tested in further pilot projects.\r\n\r\nEventually, Pando Hubs will scale on a franchise model of growth, by which we would provide the branding, a planbook(s) for implementation, and a specialist network. \r\n"
