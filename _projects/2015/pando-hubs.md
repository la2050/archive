  The intention of this proposal is to transform Los Angeles by identifying and
  networking its existing hubs of ecological civilization – places where healthy
  living and education extends to social relations and the biosphere. This pilot
  grant will allow us to take a series of small, bold moves in nurturing
  relationships among the hubs, and to develop plans for our next step, to
  create and support new centers of ecological living, work and innovation. We
  call these places Pando Hubs.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  This is a 9-mo. pilot project that lays the foundation for building ecological
  civilization in LA -- one urban hub at a time.
   
   We will identify a network of locations and orgs throughout LA where a new way of living is taking root; learn what makes these places of ecological innovation work; discover how best we can nurture their development, and apply what we learn to developing a plan for scaling growth.
   
   We call these places Pando Hubs. “Pando” is the name of the oldest and largest life form on the planet -- a massive aspen grove connected by a single root, with every part nourishing the rest.
   
   There are lots of possible Pando Hub models. Perhaps an urban eco-village or intentional community. Environmental magnet school. Urban farm. Neighborhood vegan restaurant/supply chain. Eco-homeless shelter. Green incubator. Or a combination.
   
   Hubs are places that reflect an ecological worldview. Sites of innovation, resilience and community for a diverse range of people. Where life is being rethought from the ground up, with the planet’s health and the health of each other in mind. They bring bold ideas about the shape of the future down to Earth.
   
   LA already has places like this. But they often exist in isolation from each other. If they focus on different areas, they don’t necessarily recognize the connective tissue that runs between them. We do.
   
   Launching Pando Hubs, we will: 
   
   1) Identify and connect a network of already-existing locations of ecological civilization in LA -- businesses, services, NGOs.
   
   2) Understand and document the important features that make them work. Draft 3 case studies.
   
   3) Conceive small-bet opportunities tailored to help Hubs thrive – in terms of community, learning, and new development. 
   
   Small bets let us think wrong, be bold, invent, see what works. John Bielenberg leads our Blitz process to generate small-bet ideas, from testing pop-up Hub prototypes and events to transforming would-be Hubs into something greener/healthier to tech and social media ideas for connecting.
   
   4) Launch 5-7 small-bet Pando Hub initiatives based on a matrix of do-ability vs. impact. Network over social media. 
   
   5) Critically assess. Draw up next-step plans that build on success and create opportunities for further Hub development and growth.
   
   We aim to have Pando Hubs in every City Council district citywide. 
   
   We launch under City Councilmember Paul Koretz's campaign, “Decade: Climate Safe (2016-25).”
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: |-
  How do we get buy-in across diverse communities?
   
   We have pulled together a “Pando Corps” from our base to help us in this process. Our base draws from those who attended our inaugural conference at Pomona College in June 2015, focused on rethinking civilization along ecological lines (2,000 attendees, across 80 areas of specialty), as well as the groups that co-sponsored our press conference and rally at USC last month in support of the pope’s call for “integral ecology.” Many of these environmental, social justice, civic, business, interfaith and educational groups have joined with us to create Pando Hubs. We develop our work within this broad coalition of support.
   
   Many also recognize the value of linking a particular cause (say, obesity) to other issues (say, climate change or issues of equity) that, while connections may not be obvious at first, gives all groups strength. 
   
   Diverse groups have already expressed strong interest in becoming a Pando Hub.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Qualitatively, success means we will develop critical intelligence to foster a
  Hub network across LA where healthy food can be accessed, air pollution and
  carbon footprint levels are reduced, opportunities for green jobs arise and
  self-sufficiency increases, obesity, mental illness and addiction are
  addressed in more holistic ways, homeless people come to know less alienation,
  and living in closer relationship to LA-area plants and animals is valued.
   
   Quantitatively, we will:
   
   o ID and describe some 10-12 locations of ecological civilization in LA.
   o Write 3 case studies seeking to understand successful Hub models.
   o Assess small-bets success in nurturing Hub development and growth.
   o Develop detailed next-step plans based on above research and assessments. 
   o Create a workable next-steps plan.
   o Demonstrate concept buy-in over social media, including online conversations. 
   o Identify at least 10 opportunities for next-step funding from among a diverse range of funders.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: |-
  Our overall orientation and roots offer us special opportunities:
   
   -- We have relations with many excellent environmental organizations in the city. But we likely hold a singular position in LA among those who are interested in the intersection of big ideas and the Earth. This emphasis allows us to link a broader diversity of subjects, people, and organizations than groups that focus on a single set of issues. Our inaugural conference in Claremont in June featured more than 80 fields of specialty exploring fundamental assumptions of culture, on behalf of the Earth. The relationship between broad, transdisciplinary subjects and the planet has been the main focus of our founding chairperson, John B. Cobb, Jr., since at least 1971. 
   
   --Many diverse faith-based organizations are also concerned about creating a healthier LA, broadly conceived. We are collaborating with a number of them, from major world religions to interfaith organizations to those of no faith tradition. Within Los Angeles, however, we have singular opportunities for deep interfaith relations. Our founding chairperson, at a very active 90 years of age, has unique standing in the field as one of the leading philosophers of religion alive today, in addition to pioneering the intersection of philosophy/religion, ethics, and the environment. 
   
   --Educational institutions also are interested in a healthier and environmentally stronger Los Angeles, with UCLA as one example among many. The focus of great research institutions, however, tends to be highly specialized. Our focus is very broad, such that a healthy life cannot be understood without reference to economics, philosophy, urban planning and environmental policy as well as to biology, medicine, psychology, and on.
   
   --Within the art and design community, excellent organizations are taking advantage of LA’s forward-edge position and creating pioneering efforts in the design-for-good movement with a holistic vision in mind. GOOD Magazine is a wonderful example. The art and design team affiliated with Pando Populus, headed by John Bielenberg, has also long been involved in design for good, with Project M as one example. Tucker Nichols, formerly artist-in-residence at Facebook, is an example of one with whom we collaborated recently in developing images for branding and social media. World Studio Foundation has a strong track record in national programs as well.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  PROGRAM PARTNERS are those which, in addition to the Applicants and their
  staff, will be conducting program work. They include:
   
   o Future Partners (John Bielenberg and team): 10%
   o Marc O'Brien: 6.5%
   o The Millennial Project: 4%
   o CA College of the Arts: 0%
   
   COLLABORATING PARTNERS are those who have agreed to advise the Applicants in the development of Pando Hubs pilot project, help us reach within their networks, and help us identify already-existing locations. In this advisory role, 15 collaborators will be offered an honorarium of $500 each to thank them for their dedicated commitment (7.5% of the budget). 
   
   We anticipate that some collaborators will likely participate in the 5-7 small bets this project will initiate, and be funded accordingly, but we will not be limited to initiating small bets within this pool. 
   
   31.5% of the grant award will be reserved for 5-7 small-bet initiatives, any one of which may or may not include one of the collaborators. The nature of small-bet initiatives, and collaborator involvement, will be determined entirely by the program partners following the process outlined in this proposal. 
   
   Collaborators include: 
   
   Design for good
   o Encounter LA
   o LA Trade Tech (architecture)/Urban LAbs and River LAbs
   
   Environment/Social Justice
   o Amigos de los Rios
   o Global Business Incubator
   o Jobs Create Peace
   o Martin Luther King Coalition of Greater Los Angeles
   o Natural Ivy Foundation
   
   Educational and Interfaith
   o Bayan Claremont Islamic Graduate School
   o Ecological Civilization International
   o Hatchery LA
   o Progressive Christians Uniting
   o Southern California Committee for the Parliament of the World’s Religions
   o United Methodist Church: California-Pacific Conference (Office of Justice and Compassion; the Eco-Justice Taskforce)
   o University of Southern California (USC) Office of Religious Life
   o Valley Interfaith Council
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  We have budgeted this Pando Hubs pilot initiative at $100,000. The track
  records of Applicants and Program Partners, and the nature of the project as a
  whole (including its small bets), indicate we will stay within budget. Budget
  overruns would likely be due to attempting premature scale, which is not
  considered within the scope of this proposal.
   
   The World Studio Foundation has a roughly 20-year track record of operations. Pando Populus is a new organization that has been independently funded to date and will continue to seek sources to support its operational costs outside of any amounts received from this award. Eugene Shirley, project manager and co-founder of Pando Populus, has a long track record in startup ventures, first in the non-profit PBS arena, then in the for-profit tech field. 
   
   Most importantly, we have conceived the programs of this initiative in a way which, by nature, are designed to allow for careful cost control. 
   
   We will not extend beyond the funding approved for this pilot phase of Pando Hubs development.

How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  We are launching a pilot project to explore how best to create an ecological
  civilization in LA, one Pando Hub at a time. 
   
   We scale from 0 to 10 by identifying locations that are currently on the LA landscape, understanding the key features that make them work (as well as the features that don't), testing out small-bet ideas for nurturing them, and then developing models for Pando Hubs that are both meaningful in terms of creating an ecological civilization and flexible enough to meet the diversity of opportunity. 
   
   This growth can be achieved during the pilot period by working with the Pando Corps collaborators we've identified, along with others within our network. Some additional growth will be achieved organically as we extend the Corps network and ideas spread. 
   
   The next stage of significant growth will be achieved as we create development models that respond to the most promising range of funding opportunities. These funding opportunities likely include a full range of for-profit, non-profit, and government sources. 
   
   One model of a Pando Hub, for instance, might appeal to millennials interested in an urban intentional community; another might offer a low-cost veteran housing solution; another might function more as an urban farm and organic food-producing center. The examples are less important than the fact that each likely offers the opportunity for a different kind of funding structure and/or different model of ownership. The top tier opportunities (assessed according to feasibility and need) will be developed and tested in further pilot projects.
   
   Eventually, Pando Hubs will scale on a franchise model of growth, by which we would provide the branding, a planbook(s) for implementation, and a specialist network.
