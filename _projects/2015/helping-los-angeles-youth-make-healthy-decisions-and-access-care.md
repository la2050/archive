  'DESCRIBE IN GREATER DETAIL HOW YOU WILL MAKE LA THE HEALTHIEST PLACE TO LIVE: ': "Affordable reproductive health services and education remain out of reach for many teens in L.A. Pregnancy is the leading cause of high school dropout, and less than half of teens who give birth before the age of 18 graduate high school. Children born to teen parents are more likely to have poorer health, educational, and behavioral outcomes than children of older parents who planned their pregnancies. \r\n\r\nIn response, we are working with students, schools, and parents to ensure that the environment surrounding youth is supportive of healthy behaviors and choices. Our approach reduces rates of teen pregnancy, STIs, and reproductive system cancers while building a generation of confident and competent youth who are able to engage in conversations about consent, sexuality and gender, healthy relationships, and safe sex.\r\n\r\nOur High School program includes the following elements:\r\n-A 12-week classroom curriculum that addresses gender roles and power dynamics in relationships and emphasizes sexual rights, in addition to including content on anatomy, pregnancy, STIs, and contraception;\r\n-Education workshops for parents on adolescent sexuality, teen pregnancy, STIs, healthy relationships, values, and parent-teen communication;\r\n-An after-school Peer Advocates leadership program;\r\n-Access to confidential and youth-friendly reproductive health services on school campuses. \r\n\r\nPeer Advocates convene community events and conduct outreach in their schools through classroom presentations, lunch tabling, after-school outreach activities and community events. They have also harnessed the power of social media by creating original content designed to engage youth outside the classroom, including a Tumblr page called Keep It Real, Keep it 100 and videos on topics such as LGBT inclusivity, talking to your partner about getting tested, and the services available to youth at PPLA health clinics. As more youth turn to the internet to answer their questions about sexual and reproductive health, PPLA aims to provide accurate, inclusive, and culturally competent educational materials that appeal to teens.\r\n\r\nStudents participating in the Peer Advocates program gain valuable skills that translate into their personal and professional lives- they are trained to be leaders, communicators, activists, educators, innovators, and critical thinkers. Many of the Peer Advocates go on to continue their advocacy work in college and beyond. \r\n"

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    In 2003, California passed the California Comprehensive Sexual Health and
    HIV/AIDS Prevention Education Act (SB71). The passage of SB71 was a key step
    in ensuring the health of California youth, but there is much work to be
    done to ensure proper implementation. California’s financial crisis has
    eroded much of its network of preventive health programs, making schools one
    of the last strongholds for providing sex education. Many schools still
    provide abstinence-only programs despite policies forbidding them. While the
    state does evaluate school districts for compliance, its capacity is
    limited. Research has shown little to no training for sex educators and a
    significant number of districts with policies not in compliance with the
    California Education Code. To address this, we will work closely with LAUSD
    to advocate for comprehensive sex education. At the state level, we will
    advocate for a state-wide comprehensive sex education mandate in support of
    teen health and pregnancy prevention.
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    PPLA will work to increase knowledge related to reproductive health and
    wellness, family planning, the key elements of healthy family communication
    and the importance of seeking health services. The longer term goal of our
    program is to reduce the incidence of unintended pregnancy, STIs and
    reproductive system cancers. PPLA education staff utilize our Sex Education
    Knowledge System (SEKS) to track information on all of our educational and
    outreach presentations and visits. This data management system tracks the
    number of presentations, participants, educational contact hours,
    presenters, and sites. Pre and post-tests of the Peer Advocates program
    measure changes in attitudes and knowledge of program participants. PPLA has
    also contracted with the University of Southern California and the Public
    Health Institute to evaluate our multi-pronged education program.
    Researchers found significant results regarding changes in attitudes,
    knowledge and behaviors after program participation.
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    Many schools in L.A. County choose to use their own staff to teach sex
    education courses. These courses are often taught by teachers who are
    unprepared or uncomfortable with the subject matter, and the courses are
    often not inclusive of gender, sexuality, and cultural differences. What is
    unique about the PPLA Sex Education program is the comprehensive, inclusive,
    rights-based approach to sexual and reproductive health. The program does
    not end in the classroom- PPLA staff work with educators, families and
    community members to improve the dialogue surrounding sexual health, and
    Peer Advocates work in their communities and online to promote PPLA’s
    inclusive, rights-based curriculum and serve as advocates and educators for
    fellow students and youth. Anecdotally, the results of our approach are
    striking- one year after the implementation of our multi-pronged approach in
    one Los Angeles high school, reported positive pregnancy tests dropped from
    32 during the Spring term in the first year to 3 in the second year. 
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    PPLA works closely with both the Los Angeles Unified School District and
    Green Dot Charter Schools to deliver our sex education curriculum in their
    schools. Currently, we provide education programs in over 35 high schools
    throughout L.A. County. The schools would not receive grant money directly,
    but would continue to receive the education and healthcare services provided
    by PPLA. 
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': "For the current fiscal year, PPLA’s school-based sex education program budget is $620,012. Below is a breakdown of costs:\r\n\r\nSalaries and Benefits: $482,753\r\nProfessional Fees: $22,600\r\nOffice Supplies: $3,073\r\nMinor Equipment: $500\r\nAdvertising/Marketing: $4,413\r\nIncentives: 17,391\r\nPurchased Services: $1,500\r\nRepairs and Maintenance: $2,476\r\nEducational Materials: $7,005\r\nTravel and Training: $45,111\r\nPostage and Printing: $10,173\r\nDues and Subscriptions: $1,000\r\nTelephone: $3,002\r\nUtilities: $11,858\r\nMiscellaneous: $7,157\r\n\r\nThe additional cost is covered by gifts from individual donors as well as grants from foundation partners. Current grantors for our school-based sexual education programs include the Ford Foundation, the California Endowment, and the S. Mark Taper Foundation, among others. \r\n"
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "If PPLA receives this grant award, we would distribute funds as follows:\r\n\r\n$58,000- Salaries & Wages\r\n$15,000- Incentives\r\n$5,000- Advertising and Marketing\r\n$4,000- Summer Peer Advocate Retreat (including transportation)\r\n$5,000- Educational materials\r\n$2,000- Branded outreach material\r\n$1,000- T-shirts for Peer Advocates\r\n$10,000- Mileage\r\n\r\n"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "We currently provide our full range of High School programs in over 30 high schools across L.A. County. We have 66 trained Peer Advocates across 6 schools in Boyle Heights (Roosevelt High School, Mendez High School, and Hollywood High School) and South Los Angeles (King Drew Medical Magnet High School, Animo Pat Brown Charter High School, and Ralph Bunche High School). In 2015, we saw the incorporation of one additional school- Hollywood High School- to the Peer Advocates program.\r\n\r\nIn order to scale the success of our proposal, PPLA aims to do the following:\r\n\r\n-Continue to elevate the youth voice by working with Peer Advocates to create and disseminate original social media content.\r\n\r\n-Engage Peer Advocates in activities of the District 2 STD Collaborative, the Community Advisory Coalition, which aims to decrease the high rates of Gonorrhea and Chlamydia among youth of color in South Los Angeles. \r\n\r\n-Work with Peer Advocates to get articles published in local online newspapers, such as the Boyle Heights Beat and the LA Times.\r\n\r\nOn a broader scale, PPLA is currently in the process of leveraging the results of rigorous research on our sexual education programs by engaging the voice of our Peer Advocates to promote access to comprehensive, rights-based, gender aware sexuality education and services for their friends, communities and teens across the country. PPLA will strengthen the youth voice to influence and advance the public conversation around comprehensive sexuality education via: \r\n\r\n-Strategic communications/social media targeting youth, parents, colleague agencies, school administration and other key decision makers.\r\n\r\n-Youth and parental engagement and creation of a cohort of advocates and leaders around comprehensive sexuality education. \r\n\r\nPPLA will utilize the program evaluation results to influence the public conversation and increase policymaker support of comprehensive sexuality education via: \r\n\r\n-Policy analysis and recommendations to local and national audiences; \r\n\r\n-Local and national dissemination and communications activities and\r\n \r\n-Publication of the research results in a variety of fora. \r\n"
