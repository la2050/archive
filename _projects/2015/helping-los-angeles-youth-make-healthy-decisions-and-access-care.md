project_summary: >-
  Now more than ever, PPLA is working to empower students to advocate for their
  own health by giving them the knowledge and skills to make positive decisions
  about their reproductive and sexual lives. We wrap around schools and
  communities through a multi-pronged approach that includes delivering an
  innovative classroom curriculum, teaching parents to effectively communicate,
  providing reproductive healthcare in schools, and training a cadre of
  dedicated high school student advocates. 
Please specify below: >-
  PPLA’s comprehensive work with high school-aged youth takes place primarily in
  South L.A. and Boyle Heights high schools.

  Affordable reproductive health services and education remain out of reach for
  many teens in L.A. Pregnancy is the leading cause of high school dropout, and
  less than half of teens who give birth before the age of 18 graduate high
  school. Children born to teen parents are more likely to have poorer health,
  educational, and behavioral outcomes than children of older parents who
  planned their pregnancies. 
   
   In response, we are working with students, schools, and parents to ensure that the environment surrounding youth is supportive of healthy behaviors and choices. Our approach reduces rates of teen pregnancy, STIs, and reproductive system cancers while building a generation of confident and competent youth who are able to engage in conversations about consent, sexuality and gender, healthy relationships, and safe sex.
   
   Our High School program includes the following elements:
   -A 12-week classroom curriculum that addresses gender roles and power dynamics in relationships and emphasizes sexual rights, in addition to including content on anatomy, pregnancy, STIs, and contraception;
   -Education workshops for parents on adolescent sexuality, teen pregnancy, STIs, healthy relationships, values, and parent-teen communication;
   -An after-school Peer Advocates leadership program;
   -Access to confidential and youth-friendly reproductive health services on school campuses. 
   
   Peer Advocates convene community events and conduct outreach in their schools through classroom presentations, lunch tabling, after-school outreach activities and community events. They have also harnessed the power of social media by creating original content designed to engage youth outside the classroom, including a Tumblr page called Keep It Real, Keep it 100 and videos on topics such as LGBT inclusivity, talking to your partner about getting tested, and the services available to youth at PPLA health clinics. As more youth turn to the internet to answer their questions about sexual and reproductive health, PPLA aims to provide accurate, inclusive, and culturally competent educational materials that appeal to teens.
   
   Students participating in the Peer Advocates program gain valuable skills that translate into their personal and professional lives- they are trained to be leaders, communicators, activists, educators, innovators, and critical thinkers. Many of the Peer Advocates go on to continue their advocacy work in college and beyond.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  In 2003, California passed the California Comprehensive Sexual Health and
  HIV/AIDS Prevention Education Act (SB71). The passage of SB71 was a key step
  in ensuring the health of California youth, but there is much work to be done
  to ensure proper implementation. California’s financial crisis has eroded much
  of its network of preventive health programs, making schools one of the last
  strongholds for providing sex education. Many schools still provide
  abstinence-only programs despite policies forbidding them. While the state
  does evaluate school districts for compliance, its capacity is limited.
  Research has shown little to no training for sex educators and a significant
  number of districts with policies not in compliance with the California
  Education Code. To address this, we will work closely with LAUSD to advocate
  for comprehensive sex education. At the state level, we will advocate for a
  state-wide comprehensive sex education mandate in support of teen health and
  pregnancy prevention.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  PPLA will work to increase knowledge related to reproductive health and
  wellness, family planning, the key elements of healthy family communication
  and the importance of seeking health services. The longer term goal of our
  program is to reduce the incidence of unintended pregnancy, STIs and
  reproductive system cancers. PPLA education staff utilize our Sex Education
  Knowledge System (SEKS) to track information on all of our educational and
  outreach presentations and visits. This data management system tracks the
  number of presentations, participants, educational contact hours, presenters,
  and sites. Pre and post-tests of the Peer Advocates program measure changes in
  attitudes and knowledge of program participants. PPLA has also contracted with
  the University of Southern California and the Public Health Institute to
  evaluate our multi-pronged education program. Researchers found significant
  results regarding changes in attitudes, knowledge and behaviors after program
  participation.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Many schools in L.A. County choose to use their own staff to teach sex
  education courses. These courses are often taught by teachers who are
  unprepared or uncomfortable with the subject matter, and the courses are often
  not inclusive of gender, sexuality, and cultural differences. What is unique
  about the PPLA Sex Education program is the comprehensive, inclusive,
  rights-based approach to sexual and reproductive health. The program does not
  end in the classroom- PPLA staff work with educators, families and community
  members to improve the dialogue surrounding sexual health, and Peer Advocates
  work in their communities and online to promote PPLA’s inclusive, rights-based
  curriculum and serve as advocates and educators for fellow students and youth.
  Anecdotally, the results of our approach are striking- one year after the
  implementation of our multi-pronged approach in one Los Angeles high school,
  reported positive pregnancy tests dropped from 32 during the Spring term in
  the first year to 3 in the second year.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  PPLA works closely with both the Los Angeles Unified School District and Green
  Dot Charter Schools to deliver our sex education curriculum in their schools.
  Currently, we provide education programs in over 35 high schools throughout
  L.A. County. The schools would not receive grant money directly, but would
  continue to receive the education and healthcare services provided by PPLA.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  For the current fiscal year, PPLA’s school-based sex education program budget
  is $620,012. Below is a breakdown of costs:
   
   Salaries and Benefits: $482,753
   Professional Fees: $22,600
   Office Supplies: $3,073
   Minor Equipment: $500
   Advertising/Marketing: $4,413
   Incentives: 17,391
   Purchased Services: $1,500
   Repairs and Maintenance: $2,476

   Dues and Subscriptions: $1,000
   Telephone: $3,002
   Utilities: $11,858
   Miscellaneous: $7,157
   
   The additional cost is covered by gifts from individual donors as well as grants from foundation partners. Current grantors for our school-based sexual education programs include the Ford Foundation, the California Endowment, and the S. Mark Taper Foundation, among others.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  If PPLA receives this grant award, we would distribute funds as follows:
   
   $58,000- Salaries & Wages
   $15,000- Incentives
   $5,000- Advertising and Marketing
   $4,000- Summer Peer Advocate Retreat (including transportation)
   $5,000- Educational materials
   $2,000- Branded outreach material
   $1,000- T-shirts for Peer Advocates
   $10,000- Mileage
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  We currently provide our full range of High School programs in over 30 high
  schools across L.A. County. We have 66 trained Peer Advocates across 6 schools
  in Boyle Heights (Roosevelt High School, Mendez High School, and Hollywood
  High School) and South Los Angeles (King Drew Medical Magnet High School,
  Animo Pat Brown Charter High School, and Ralph Bunche High School). In 2015,
  we saw the incorporation of one additional school- Hollywood High School- to
  the Peer Advocates program.
   
   In order to scale the success of our proposal, PPLA aims to do the following:
   
   -Continue to elevate the youth voice by working with Peer Advocates to create and disseminate original social media content.
   
   -Engage Peer Advocates in activities of the District 2 STD Collaborative, the Community Advisory Coalition, which aims to decrease the high rates of Gonorrhea and Chlamydia among youth of color in South Los Angeles. 
   
   -Work with Peer Advocates to get articles published in local online newspapers, such as the Boyle Heights Beat and the LA Times.
   
   On a broader scale, PPLA is currently in the process of leveraging the results of rigorous research on our sexual education programs by engaging the voice of our Peer Advocates to promote access to comprehensive, rights-based, gender aware sexuality education and services for their friends, communities and teens across the country. PPLA will strengthen the youth voice to influence and advance the public conversation around comprehensive sexuality education via: 
   
   -Strategic communications/social media targeting youth, parents, colleague agencies, school administration and other key decision makers.
   
   -Youth and parental engagement and creation of a cohort of advocates and leaders around comprehensive sexuality education. 
   
   PPLA will utilize the program evaluation results to influence the public conversation and increase policymaker support of comprehensive sexuality education via: 
   
   -Policy analysis and recommendations to local and national audiences; 
   
   -Local and national dissemination and communications activities and
    
   -Publication of the research results in a variety of fora.

      Now more than ever, PPLA is working to empower students to advocate for
      their own health by giving them the knowledge and skills to make positive
      decisions about their reproductive and sexual lives. We wrap around
      schools and communities through a multi-pronged approach that includes
      delivering an innovative classroom curriculum, teaching parents to
      effectively communicate, providing reproductive healthcare in schools, and
      training a cadre of dedicated high school student advocates.

    answer: "Affordable reproductive health services and education remain out of reach for many teens in L.A. Pregnancy is the leading cause of high school dropout, and less than half of teens who give birth before the age of 18 graduate high school. Children born to teen parents are more likely to have poorer health, educational, and behavioral outcomes than children of older parents who planned their pregnancies. \r\n\r\nIn response, we are working with students, schools, and parents to ensure that the environment surrounding youth is supportive of healthy behaviors and choices. Our approach reduces rates of teen pregnancy, STIs, and reproductive system cancers while building a generation of confident and competent youth who are able to engage in conversations about consent, sexuality and gender, healthy relationships, and safe sex.\r\n\r\nOur High School program includes the following elements:\r\n-A 12-week classroom curriculum that addresses gender roles and power dynamics in relationships and emphasizes sexual rights, in addition to including content on anatomy, pregnancy, STIs, and contraception;\r\n-Education workshops for parents on adolescent sexuality, teen pregnancy, STIs, healthy relationships, values, and parent-teen communication;\r\n-An after-school Peer Advocates leadership program;\r\n-Access to confidential and youth-friendly reproductive health services on school campuses. \r\n\r\nPeer Advocates convene community events and conduct outreach in their schools through classroom presentations, lunch tabling, after-school outreach activities and community events. They have also harnessed the power of social media by creating original content designed to engage youth outside the classroom, including a Tumblr page called Keep It Real, Keep it 100 and videos on topics such as LGBT inclusivity, talking to your partner about getting tested, and the services available to youth at PPLA health clinics. As more youth turn to the internet to answer their questions about sexual and reproductive health, PPLA aims to provide accurate, inclusive, and culturally competent educational materials that appeal to teens.\r\n\r\nStudents participating in the Peer Advocates program gain valuable skills that translate into their personal and professional lives- they are trained to be leaders, communicators, activists, educators, innovators, and critical thinkers. Many of the Peer Advocates go on to continue their advocacy work in college and beyond. \r\n"

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      In 2003, California passed the California Comprehensive Sexual Health and
      HIV/AIDS Prevention Education Act (SB71). The passage of SB71 was a key
      step in ensuring the health of California youth, but there is much work to
      be done to ensure proper implementation. California’s financial crisis has
      eroded much of its network of preventive health programs, making schools
      one of the last strongholds for providing sex education. Many schools
      still provide abstinence-only programs despite policies forbidding them.
      While the state does evaluate school districts for compliance, its
      capacity is limited. Research has shown little to no training for sex
      educators and a significant number of districts with policies not in
      compliance with the California Education Code. To address this, we will
      work closely with LAUSD to advocate for comprehensive sex education. At
      the state level, we will advocate for a state-wide comprehensive sex
      education mandate in support of teen health and pregnancy prevention.

      PPLA will work to increase knowledge related to reproductive health and
      wellness, family planning, the key elements of healthy family
      communication and the importance of seeking health services. The longer
      term goal of our program is to reduce the incidence of unintended
      pregnancy, STIs and reproductive system cancers. PPLA education staff
      utilize our Sex Education Knowledge System (SEKS) to track information on
      all of our educational and outreach presentations and visits. This data
      management system tracks the number of presentations, participants,
      educational contact hours, presenters, and sites. Pre and post-tests of
      the Peer Advocates program measure changes in attitudes and knowledge of
      program participants. PPLA has also contracted with the University of
      Southern California and the Public Health Institute to evaluate our
      multi-pronged education program. Researchers found significant results
      regarding changes in attitudes, knowledge and behaviors after program
      participation.

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      Many schools in L.A. County choose to use their own staff to teach sex
      education courses. These courses are often taught by teachers who are
      unprepared or uncomfortable with the subject matter, and the courses are
      often not inclusive of gender, sexuality, and cultural differences. What
      is unique about the PPLA Sex Education program is the comprehensive,
      inclusive, rights-based approach to sexual and reproductive health. The
      program does not end in the classroom- PPLA staff work with educators,
      families and community members to improve the dialogue surrounding sexual
      health, and Peer Advocates work in their communities and online to promote
      PPLA’s inclusive, rights-based curriculum and serve as advocates and
      educators for fellow students and youth. Anecdotally, the results of our
      approach are striking- one year after the implementation of our
      multi-pronged approach in one Los Angeles high school, reported positive
      pregnancy tests dropped from 32 during the Spring term in the first year
      to 3 in the second year.

      PPLA works closely with both the Los Angeles Unified School District and

    explanation: ''
    answer: "We currently provide our full range of High School programs in over 30 high schools across L.A. County. We have 66 trained Peer Advocates across 6 schools in Boyle Heights (Roosevelt High School, Mendez High School, and Hollywood High School) and South Los Angeles (King Drew Medical Magnet High School, Animo Pat Brown Charter High School, and Ralph Bunche High School). In 2015, we saw the incorporation of one additional school- Hollywood High School- to the Peer Advocates program.\r\n\r\nIn order to scale the success of our proposal, PPLA aims to do the following:\r\n\r\n-Continue to elevate the youth voice by working with Peer Advocates to create and disseminate original social media content.\r\n\r\n-Engage Peer Advocates in activities of the District 2 STD Collaborative, the Community Advisory Coalition, which aims to decrease the high rates of Gonorrhea and Chlamydia among youth of color in South Los Angeles. \r\n\r\n-Work with Peer Advocates to get articles published in local online newspapers, such as the Boyle Heights Beat and the LA Times.\r\n\r\nOn a broader scale, PPLA is currently in the process of leveraging the results of rigorous research on our sexual education programs by engaging the voice of our Peer Advocates to promote access to comprehensive, rights-based, gender aware sexuality education and services for their friends, communities and teens across the country. PPLA will strengthen the youth voice to influence and advance the public conversation around comprehensive sexuality education via: \r\n\r\n-Strategic communications/social media targeting youth, parents, colleague agencies, school administration and other key decision makers.\r\n\r\n-Youth and parental engagement and creation of a cohort of advocates and leaders around comprehensive sexuality education. \r\n\r\nPPLA will utilize the program evaluation results to influence the public conversation and increase policymaker support of comprehensive sexuality education via: \r\n\r\n-Policy analysis and recommendations to local and national audiences; \r\n\r\n-Local and national dissemination and communications activities and\r\n \r\n-Publication of the research results in a variety of fora. \r\n"
