    PPLA will work to increase knowledge related to reproductive health and
    wellness, family planning, the key elements of healthy family communication
    and the importance of seeking health services. The longer term goal of our
    program is to reduce the incidence of unintended pregnancy, STIs and
    reproductive system cancers. PPLA education staff utilize our Sex Education
    Knowledge System (SEKS) to track information on all of our educational and
    outreach presentations and visits. This data management system tracks the
    number of presentations, participants, educational contact hours,
    presenters, and sites. Pre and post-tests of the Peer Advocates program
    measure changes in attitudes and knowledge of program participants. PPLA has
    also contracted with the University of Southern California and the Public
    Health Institute to evaluate our multi-pronged education program.
    Researchers found significant results regarding changes in attitudes,
    knowledge and behaviors after program participation.
