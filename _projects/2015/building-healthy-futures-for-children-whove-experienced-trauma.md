  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "At CII, our services are evaluated by our dedicated Research Evaluation Center (REC). CII’s research staff members gather and analyze the data from our evidence-based clinical services. Each clinical service is evaluated, based upon specific metrics for that particular evidence-based practice (EBP). \r\n\r\nCII provides 12 mental health EBPs and several traditional treatments. Each treatment has its own evaluation criteria, which determines how effectively it is reducing trauma symptoms for a given patient. Some interventions are for older children, some are for younger children, some are dyadic (intended for parent and child), and some are delivered in a group therapy setting. \r\n\r\nCII also measures the acquisition and improvement of social and emotional skills through our community services and youth development programs, using the SEARS (Social Emotional Assets and Resilience Skills) index, a behavior rating scale.\r\n"
