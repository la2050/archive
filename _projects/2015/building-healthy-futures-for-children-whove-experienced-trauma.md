  The more Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) to which a child is exposed,
  including: abuse, incarceration of parents, and exposure to family and
  community violence, the more likely the child is to suffer from negative
  physical and mental health in adulthood —from heart disease to depression.
  CII’s Integrated Services Model addresses trauma through services in:
  evidence-based mental health, early childhood, youth development, and family
  support to treat the whole child and the entire family.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  CII is working to make Los Angeles the healthiest place to live by helping our
  future generations of residents be the healthiest they can be. Serving today’s
  children and tomorrow’s adult Angelenos through a comprehensive, integrated
  model, CII is working toward a vision of a healthy and productive Los
  Angeles. 
   
   CII has developed 3 organization-wide outcomes: Recovery from trauma and other Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs); Resiliency to cope with past, present, and future adversity; and Readiness for success in school, work, and life. Understanding that no single service can achieve these goals, CII is proud to do “whatever it takes,” providing each child with the unique combination of services he/she needs to thrive. 
   
   The ultimate goals of CII’s work are to reduce the symptoms resulting from ACEs through clinical intervention and to equip the child with the skills and confidence to bounce back through non-clinical programs. CII aims both to decrease the immediate symptoms of trauma and to achieve the long-term recovery, resiliency, and readiness, which will equip traumatized children to become healthy and productive members of our community as adults. 
   
   Moreover, CII believes that services must be available for the whole child and the entire family to make a positive and lasting impact. Thus CII offers services to the parents of children receiving services, including: parenting education, support groups, financial literacy, fatherhood programming, and workforce development. In some cases, the agency also offers mental health services to parents, most commonly through dyadic clinical services, such as Parent-Child-Interaction Therapy (PCIT). In PCIT, a parent/caregiver is coached to interact with their children by a therapist, speaking to the parent via a microphone in the ear, behind a one-way mirror. 
   
   By comprehensively treating the whole child and the entire family, CII’s services both reduce the symptoms of ACEs now and build a protective factor around parent and child to diminish the impact of ACEs later. 
   
   In addition to making LA the best place to Live, CII is working to make LA the best place to Learn, through increasing the percentage of children enrolled in early education programs across our 29 Head Start sites; to Play, through our afterschool enrichment programs in the arts and sports; and to Connect, through meaningful volunteer engagement opportunities that bring Angelenos together to contribute to their communities.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  One of the greatest challenges CII anticipates in reducing the symptoms from
  ACEs and traumatic experiences is serving children and their families who are
  un-insured, under-insured, or ineligible for MediCal.
   
   The need in our diverse County is great—almost 60% of children in Los Angeles County have at least one parent who immigrated to the U.S. This increases the likelihood that these individuals do not qualify for government programs, including MediCal. While CII has contracts to provide mental health services, these do not cover individuals who are MediCal-ineligible. 
   
   Thus, while CII may be able to address a child’s early education needs through its Head Start program, the agency may not be able to cover that child’s clinical needs, an integral component of CII’s Model, through existing contracts. Since expanding its early education programs, CII has seen a 20.5% increase in mental health referrals in children ages 0-5, confirming a significant need for these services.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  At CII, our services are evaluated by our dedicated Research Evaluation Center
  (REC). CII’s research staff members gather and analyze the data from our
  evidence-based clinical services. Each clinical service is evaluated, based
  upon specific metrics for that particular evidence-based practice (EBP). 
   
   CII provides 12 mental health EBPs and several traditional treatments. Each treatment has its own evaluation criteria, which determines how effectively it is reducing trauma symptoms for a given patient. Some interventions are for older children, some are for younger children, some are dyadic (intended for parent and child), and some are delivered in a group therapy setting. 
   
   CII also measures the acquisition and improvement of social and emotional skills through our community services and youth development programs, using the SEARS (Social Emotional Assets and Resilience Skills) index, a behavior rating scale.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  While there are other agencies that deliver mental health services in Los
  Angeles County, the majority of these providers only specialize in older
  children or adults. Additionally, agencies typically offer just one service,
  such a clinical therapy. 
   
   CII is unique because of the agency’s expertise in early childhood mental health for children ages 0-5. As a longtime grantee of the National Child Traumatic Stress Network, CII has extensive experience in early childhood trauma and in training professionals, specifically in secondary traumatic stress. Through this work, CII is committed to ensuring that mental health professionals, at both CII and agencies nationwide, do not become burned out and leave the field, where children desperately need their services. 
   
   CII is also unique in its approach—the Integrated Services Model demonstrates CII’s philosophy that clinical services, no matter how high-quality, may not be enough to help a child move from triage to triumph. But, perhaps with a combination of other services, ones that allow the child to develop new skills and build confidence, and with programing for parents that helps to ensure a child’s home is a place of calm rather than chaos, a child will truly be able to recover, build resiliency, and be ready for whatever challenges lay ahead. 
   
   While other agencies may use a few evidence-based practices, CII’s team of experienced and highly qualified mental health professionals enable the agency to offer 12 EBPs. For one of these, Child-Parent Psychotherapy (CPP), CII is the only agency in L.A. County certified to train other agencies in this effective intervention. 
   
   Thus it is CII’s Integrated Services Model, expertise, and commitment to providing the highest quality, evidence-based interventions that make our agency unique among other service providers in Los Angeles.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  CII collaborates with many community organizations in County Service Planning
  Areas (SPAs) 4, 6, and 8; Los Angeles County agencies (including Department of
  Mental Health-DMH and Department of Children and Family Services-DCFS); the
  Faith-Based Community; and the Philanthropic Community on a variety of
  projects. 
   
   CII is also active in the SPA 4 Coalition of service providers and regularly seeks opportunities to work with other agencies.
   
   The work and services outlined in this proposal, however, will only be delivered by CII. Thus, we intend that the full $100,000 of the grant award will be used to support CII’s core operating activities
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  As LA 2050 understands, recovering from trauma and Adverse Childhood
  Experiences is an ongoing process. “Prevalence of adverse childhood
  experiences” is likely a Dream Metric for the organization, due to the
  difficult nature of quantifying both mental health and the effectiveness of
  the services to treat it. 
   
   At minimum, a child receives 6 months of services from CII. Depending on the child’s experiences, the severity of the trauma, and a number of other factors, a child may need longer. CII’s services are not time-limited, nor is the opportunity to move from clinical to community services. 
   
   Because CII is committed to providing the combination and duration of services each child needs to look to the future and leave their trauma behind, the cost for treating each child is just as individual as that child’s circumstances. On average, however, a child receives 6 months of services, which breaks down to 1 hour of services per week—at 26 weeks and a cost of $150 per session, this comes out to approximately $4,000 per child in clinical services. 
   
   CII provides between $500,000 and $1,000,000 in "uncompensated care" to individuals ineligible for government programs, such as MediCal, each year. But there are still many children and family members who we are not able to comprehensively serve, due to a limited availability in funds.
   
   To cover additional costs, CII works to secure public funding because of its long-term sustainability. We have contracts for treating victims of Child Abuse and Neglect (California State), Community Mental Health (LA County), Early Education (Head Start), and Fatherhood programming (Federal). 
   
   CII also seeks private money to supplement its public contracts and to help the agency provide its Edge of Excellence, which allows CII to go above and beyond what standard contracts cover. Through this Edge, CII is able to offer the range of services that are so critical to helping a child recover and thrive. 
   
   CII also has a development department, dedicated to securing funding that sustains our agency and its programming. The department includes professionals who oversee individual, foundation, and corporate solicitation.

How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  CII developed a Business Plan for 2012-2017, laying out the agency’s vision
  for the future: To transform the lives of thousands of children who have been
  affected by violence or other Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) by helping
  them recover from trauma, build resiliency, and become ready for success in
  school, work, and life. 
   
   To carry out this vision, CII established three strategic imperatives:
   
   1. Scale up CII’s Integrated Services Model: At the end of 5 years, CII will fill the gaps in program services to ensure that double the number of children and families receive multiple (3+) coordinated services.
   
   2. Replicate the CII model in Watts: At the end of 5 years, CII will have replicated its Integrated Services Model in Watts and begun construction on a state-of-the-art facility that will reach 5,000 children and caregivers a year in CA’s highest-need community. 
   
   3. Expand research and training efforts to improve practice and influence policy: At the end of 5 years, CII will have developed and disseminated a body of evidence documenting the effectiveness of CII’s Integrated Services Model. 
   
   Through these imperatives, and with the support of funders like LA 2050, CII will expand its services to reach 25,000 children and caregivers a year. CII will also build a body of evidence on the effectiveness of the “whole child, entire family” model— which will contribute significantly to knowledge in the field. 
   
   To achieve this vision, CII will focus on building capacity in:
   Program and Organizational Management (specifically related to integrated service delivery, program performance, human resources, facilities, and program evaluation and measurement); Marketing, Communications, and Development (specifically related to external relations and fundraising capacity and planning for the Watts campaign); and Financial Management and Resources (specifically related to enhancing staff and systems to manage more complex and competitive contracts and business processes.) 
   
   CII is proud of the agency’s achievement in each of these three strategic imperatives thus far. 
   
   In September, CII achieved a milestone in Watts, unveiling plans for the future Campus, designed pro-bono by world-renowned architect Frank Gehry. CII will continue evaluating our Model’s effectiveness at reducing the symptoms of Adverse Childhood Experiences and we will bring the most successful aspects of this proposal to Watts.
