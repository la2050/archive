  What
   We’re building an app that makes it fast, fun, and easy to become informed in any election. Simply answer a few questions and find out which politicians truly have your best interests at heart, and have a track record to back it up.
   
   Our mission is to take the friction out of becoming an informed voter, displaying the candidates and propositions that align with your beliefs, as well as where to go to vote, when to be there, and what to bring. We aim to be a one-stop-shop for election information.
   
   We were recently featured on 790 KABC, Built In LA, and The Washington Post.
   
   
   Why
   Last year, LA county had the lowest voter participation of any county in the state, with local election turnout dropping as low as 8%.
   
   Information is greatly lacking when it comes to local elections. When people are uninformed, they don’t vote, or worse, they vote on issues they don’t know about. In both scenarios, we end up with a government that is not representative of its people.
   
   According to Pew, 57% of 18-to-29 year olds get political news from social networking apps and nowhere else. The stage is primed to engage millennials and younger generations on their turf.
   
   
   How
   We've designed an experience that is fast, fun and engaging, while the real magic happens under the hood. Our matching algorithm does all the heavy lifting, weighing millions of data points to find the perfect candidates for you.
   
   Thanks to new open data initiatives, we now have access to up-to-the-minute governmental and political data. This allows us to take an unbiased, numbers-based approach.
   
   Voter weighs a politician’s voting record, public agenda, personal views, talking points, and several other variables to arrive at a match. The app presents this information as a percentage, describing how closely your views align with each candidate.
   
   
   Who
   Our team has extensive experience in the fields of graphic design and user interfaces, mobile app development, policy and data analysis, and start-up user growth. We recently launched in beta, and just brought marketing and public relations experience on board.
   
   
   When
   Voter launched in the App Store on Citizenship Day (Sept.17) 2015, and will be available on web and Android January 1st, 2016. Local election data will be available for Los Angeles county starting in 2016.
   
   
   Where
   Based in sunny Los Angeles, California :) We will begin curating local elections in the Los Angeles area this Winter-Spring.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Most local candidates don’t have track records that we can pull data from, so
  it requires more effort to curate the information. However, between our
  growing user base (24k as of 9/28), and the support of local officials,
  candidates have been very enthusiast to help us build their presence on Voter.
  We are planning to work with Dean Logan (LA County Registrar), who has offered
  to assist with local data, to make sure we deliver fast, accurate results to
  Los Angeles voters.
   
   We have relationships with several local universities, including Chapman, Loyola, Pepperdine, USC, and UCLA, to bring poli-sci interns on board to assist with candidate outreach and data culling.
   
   To create a sustainable system for curating local election information, our goal is to attract enough users that candidates for local office are incentivized to build their own profile, or risk missing a large percentage of the voting population.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Voting by race - We’ll use demographic data from Facebook logins to track
  users’ voting rates by ethnicity, age, gender, and location. We respect
  privacy, and all data is anonymous in that we can never identify it to a
  specific user.
   
   Rates of volunteerism - Compare the NCoCs (National Conference on Citizenship) annual volunteer metrics from the past to track progress in LA county. We will survey users at regular intervals, comparing our own results with the NCoCs.
   
   Neighborhood council participation - We plan to curate information on Los Angeles’s 96 neighborhood council elections. We will encourage and track neighborhood council participation by connecting users with councils in their area, and allowing them to check-in via social media.
   
   Government responsiveness - Periodically survey our user-base to gauge whether they feel responsiveness has improved. Our impact will be magnified by giving politicians insight into the issues their constituents prioritize most.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  The only platform with the same core concept, is iSideWith, though their
  target audience and execution are much different than ours. We are targeting
  millennials and younger voters, and aim to make the experience fun, fast, and
  fact-based.
   
   iSideWith does not have local information, and only matches users to national candidates. We are planning to curate data all the way down to local elections, beginning in Los Angeles.
   
   Additionally, the iSideWith quiz is akin to a test one would take in high school. It’s not something people are going out of their way to participate in.
   
   By contrast, we've designed Voter to be fast and engaging. We prioritize usability, focusing on making the experience fun and intuitive. We feature a tinder-inspired layout, in which users simply swipe on issues to indicate their position.
   
   We consider iSideWith complementary rather than competitive. We are big fans of anything that helps foster civic engagement!
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  We have incredible partners and resources that allow us to automate most of
  our data aggregation, including: GovTrack.us, the Sunlight Foundation, Follow
  the Money, OpenSecrets, and Project Votesmart. Each organization is a
  nonprofit, and has been generous to offer their resources for free.
   
   We were accepted into Google's new startup support program this month, which includes $100,000 of cloud services credits, and $20,000 of AdWords credits. We are also using Google’s Civic API (free to access) to tailor election data based on a user’s location.
   
   Additionally, we have free office space in Santa Monica for the next year and half through the Stubbs Alderton accelerator program, located above the 3rd Street Promenade.
   (1453 3rd Street Promenade, Suite 300, Santa Monica, CA 90401)

'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  We expect the LA local election builds to cost between $100k-125k. We have an
  investor committed for $50k, and several others interested in helping bring
  Voter to local elections in Los Angeles.
   
   As detailed above, we have several generous partners and resources that have allowed us to avoid many significant costs, including office space, as well as the bulk of cloud computing costs.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  35k - Programming / Development
   27k - Marketing / Communications
   18k - Candidate Outreach team - We have relationships with several local universities, including Chapman, Loyola, Pepperdine, USC, and UCLA, to bring poli-sci interns on board.
   10k - Data culling
   7k - Cloud computing & web servers (AWS) - AWS is required for certain services, the rest is covered by Google.
   3k - Administrative / misc.
   0k - Office Rent - We have free office space in Santa Monica for the next year and half through the Stubbs Alderton accelerator program, located above the 3rd Street Promenade.
   (1453 3rd Street Promenade, Suite 300, Santa Monica, CA 90401)
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Our outreach team will be curating data for the first several elections;
  however, our long term goal for sustained growth, is to attract enough users
  that candidates for local office are incentivized to build their own profile,
  or risk missing a large percentage of the voting population.
   
   We are also building an outreach program for social science and government classes at high schools and colleges. Aside from helping inform young voters, this accomplishes two important goals for the scalability of our proposal:
   1. It guarantees a strong group of local users in new municipalities.
   2. It builds the foundation for an outreach team to contact local candidates in that area.
   
   We will focus on Los Angeles County and it’s 88 municipalities before scaling to other areas in Southern California. With proven success in Los Angeles, we plan to duplicate our program in neighboring areas, including Orange County and Ventura County.
