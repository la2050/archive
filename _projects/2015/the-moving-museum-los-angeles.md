  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: "While LA has always been a go-to destination for the art world, there has been a shift in the international community of artists from across the world that recognize the city as an important epicentre for creation and production of new work. The city has inspired a new generation of artists to migrate there for production and ideas. \r\n\r\nThe Moving Museum Los Angeles is offering this opportunity in bringing an influential group of international and local artists and collectives together in an intervention that will encourage social interaction and participation, empower communities, and activate a new chapter of development for LA as the most significant and accessible place to create. \r\n\r\nParticipating artists will receive a budget towards producing their commissioned work and will be supported in the professional development of their practice throughout an intensive residency period involving in-depth dialogue around research, conceptualization and production of their work. \r\n\r\nThe residency component and inclusion of artists with a social practice are an important catalyst to form a lasting dialogue between these diverse and currently fragmented voices across the globe at an important moment for LA’s position within a shifting international context. \r\n\r\nWe will run a public and educational program geared towards engaging the artists within local schools and universities and offering students across all ages to learn from established contemporary artists. The Moving Museum will a develop Curatorial Fellowship program as part\L of the LA project to offer recent graduates a rare opportunity to gain valuable first-hand professional experience with artists production, curators, exhibition production, running a residency.\r\n\r\nWe will find diverse ways of including artist within the project as producers, collaborators and advisors. The Moving Museum will deliver an intensive public program, initiated by the participating artists and in collaboration with local institutions and non-profit spaces, which aims to engage local audiences and offer a point of access to art and artists that is more direct and less didactic, focusing on Food, Performance, Workshops, and Performative lectures. The program will also be made accessible for international audiences through an online platform. \r\n"

  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "We hope to create meaningful and socially engaged projects that have a lasting impact on the communities affected. We will track the development of those participating in the project, the number of Fellows who have been offered employment or developed their own projects, the quantity and success of future LA projects from our partners, the art spaces and projects formed across the city. The commissioned artworks will be measured on how they materialized during the residency and exhibition period, and the impact they have made. We will follow international artists on-going relationship with LA, whether through production of artwork, museum or institutional interest, or continued talks or events with the artists.\r\n\r\nOur aim is to create a dynamic events program that engages local and international audiences and successfully bridges the gap between disparate communities. We will collect data on audience numbers and the types of communities represented, on the ground and online. \r\n"
