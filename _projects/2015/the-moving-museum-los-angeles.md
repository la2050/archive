  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: "While LA has always been a go-to destination for the art world, there has been a shift in the international community of artists from across the world that recognize the city as an important epicentre for creation and production of new work. The city has inspired a new generation of artists to migrate there for production and ideas. \r\n\r\nThe Moving Museum Los Angeles is offering this opportunity in bringing an influential group of international and local artists and collectives together in an intervention that will encourage social interaction and participation, empower communities, and activate a new chapter of development for LA as the most significant and accessible place to create. \r\n\r\nParticipating artists will receive a budget towards producing their commissioned work and will be supported in the professional development of their practice throughout an intensive residency period involving in-depth dialogue around research, conceptualization and production of their work. \r\n\r\nThe residency component and inclusion of artists with a social practice are an important catalyst to form a lasting dialogue between these diverse and currently fragmented voices across the globe at an important moment for LA’s position within a shifting international context. \r\n\r\nWe will run a public and educational program geared towards engaging the artists within local schools and universities and offering students across all ages to learn from established contemporary artists. The Moving Museum will a develop Curatorial Fellowship program as part\L of the LA project to offer recent graduates a rare opportunity to gain valuable first-hand professional experience with artists production, curators, exhibition production, running a residency.\r\n\r\nWe will find diverse ways of including artist within the project as producers, collaborators and advisors. The Moving Museum will deliver an intensive public program, initiated by the participating artists and in collaboration with local institutions and non-profit spaces, which aims to engage local audiences and offer a point of access to art and artists that is more direct and less didactic, focusing on Food, Performance, Workshops, and Performative lectures. The program will also be made accessible for international audiences through an online platform. \r\n"

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "While LA has a burgeoning art scene, the scale of it geographically is such that creative communities are spread out and often remain within their own districts. One of the biggest challenges will be ensuring that we reach and engage with the multitude of LA communities in a meaningful way that aligns with their cultural interests and vision for the city. We aim to activate projects citywide, housing artists in different areas and engaging local and international audiences from various communities and backgrounds. \r\n\r\nThe Public Program will serve as the backbone to the residency as an active interface, a more organic, less institutional meeting ground for interested publics. We will invite a local curator\L to lead the Public Program and will collaborate with local institutions and non-profit spaces. We will host events, focused around a culinary or performative gesture held in different venues spread throughout LA.  \r\n"
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "We hope to create meaningful and socially engaged projects that have a lasting impact on the communities affected. We will track the development of those participating in the project, the number of Fellows who have been offered employment or developed their own projects, the quantity and success of future LA projects from our partners, the art spaces and projects formed across the city. The commissioned artworks will be measured on how they materialized during the residency and exhibition period, and the impact they have made. We will follow international artists on-going relationship with LA, whether through production of artwork, museum or institutional interest, or continued talks or events with the artists.\r\n\r\nOur aim is to create a dynamic events program that engages local and international audiences and successfully bridges the gap between disparate communities. We will collect data on audience numbers and the types of communities represented, on the ground and online. \r\n"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "There are currently only a small number of international artists residency programs active in LA and this project will aim to mark one of the largest, coordinated influxes of international resident artists in LA’s recent history.\r\n\r\nThere is a need for a cultural and educational program that actively nurtures the development of new work and ideas in a more progressive and impactful way, both in supporting the professional development of local and international arts practitioners and to re-imagine the transferal of cultural information through a less institutional context. As a result, The Moving Museum Los Angeles will provide a catalyst to activate a new chapter of development within the Los Angeles creative community. \r\n\r\nThe Moving Museum identifies a real and pressing opportunity to encourage collaborations between industries, cultures and voices, and to connect the culturally disparate social and ethnic communities across LA by exchanging ideas from leading artistic voices around the world. The intensive public program aims to engage artists with local audiences more directly through social and performance based activities.\r\n\r\nAs the role of the artist and arts practitioner shifts within the changing institutional landscape, so do the requirements, experience and skills. The Moving Museum has identified areas that are vital for this development and offers the type of stimulating environment, which is fundamental to deliver rich and diverse work. \r\n\r\nThe Moving Museum aims for its activities to be sustainable and beneficial to artists and the communities in which they take place - offering a lasting, daring, and unparalleled international platform for artists and new ideas.\r\n\r\nThe Moving Museum is a catalyst for thought around the changing spaces of art production. Through artist residencies, commissions, partnerships with local institutions, publications, educational and public programming, The Moving Museum is committed to supporting and presenting innovative research and discourse wherever we go."
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "The 40 participating artists will all be commissioned to develop new projects alongside the residency as a means to articulate their practice within an exhibition that marks an important moment for Los Angeles’s position within a shifting international context. Each artist will be provided a stipend towards the production of their work. This stipend, for the most part will be used on manufactures and other practitioners within Los Angeles to support the production of the artists work. Thus, indirectly these funds will also be reinvested into other industries within the LA community. \r\n\r\nThe Moving Museum will provide a Curatorial Fellowship as part\Lof the program to offer recent graduates an opportunity to work closely with the Directors to oversee various aspects of the project including artwork production, exhibition production, running a residency. This type of engagement within the contemporary art field is not one that can be taught through art colleges or traditional education. There are few opportunities to gain such first hand and expansive experience. \r\n\r\nWe will work with local designers on aspects of our marketing campaign including publication and brand development. We will engage with local writers to develop the publication text and anthologies for the online journal. We will work with craftsmen and practitioners across different industries to help with the exhibition production, with local film makers and photographers on the documentation of the project.\r\n\r\nWe will partner with local arts organizations and non-profit spaces to facilitate and host the residencies and public program."
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "The Moving Museum aims to make long-term impressions through temporary interventions, with an experimental format that responds in a unique way to each local context.\r\n \r\nAlthough Los Angeles has a wealth of artists and enterprising start-ups, the city is populated with culturally disparate social and ethnic islands and the current arts activities tend to be independently produced. As the city enters the 21st century, there is a real and pressing opportunity to connect these local communities with each other within an international context to encourage collaborations between these pockets of the city, with other industries, cultures and voices and exchange ideas from leading artistic voices around the world.\r\n\r\nThe Moving Museum will continue to advocate for Los Angeles as a visionary city at the forefront of artistic ingenuity and will draw on this newly positioned global arts hub, to cultivate and re-define the contemporary art landscape.\r\n\r\nFollowing the residency, public program and exhibition period we would hope that a number of the discussions, commissioned works and other projects initiated would continue to develop and be taken on by future partners, collaborators and the local community. Inspiring a new generation of residency models, artist networks and spaces to take the lead, we would see outside industries attracted by the scope to collaborate and drive their presence through artistic innovation and ideas.\r\n\r\nWe would develop our online platform to provide an opportunity for continuing the development of digital and interactive works as well as host webcast talks built from topics addressed during the project to extend on LA’s influence with an online audience as an increasingly important arena for the arts.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the success of this project would be used as a model example of how to transform artistic communities in other cities that desperately require a program of this nature to survive, evolve and become part of the global dialogue."
