title: SBSM Healthy Tomorrow Initiative
project_summary: >-
  $100,000 will supply two LAUSD high schools with state-of-the-art fitness
  centers, the SBSM curriculum and professional development training for the
  school’s physical education department.  Following an eight-week
  implementation of the SBSM Curriculum, we expect to improve student passing
  rates by a minimum 25% on the Fitnessgram assessment (California State
  proficiency test for student physical fitness) as well as improve student’s
  perception of fitness and exercise at these high schools.

Where will you be working?:
  - LAUSD
How do you plan to use these resources to make change?:
  - Conduct research
  - Engage residents and stakeholders
  - Mobilize for systems change
How will your proposal improve the following “Live” metrics?:
  - Obesity rates
  - Prevalence of adverse childhood experiences (Dream Metric)
  - Percentage of LA communities that are resilient (Dream Metric)
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Following installation of the fitness centers and completion of the teacher
  trainings, each school implements the SBSM curriculum for an eight-week period
  in their classes for a minimum of 100 students.  Before and after the
  eight-week program, we require each physical education staff to collect
  student Fitnessgram data for the 100 students.  The Fitnessgram is a
  state-mandated test that measure fitness levels in students, and for our
  purposes, evaluates the overall impact of SBSM programming and curriculum on
  student health.  Along with the Fitnessgram we require the physical education
  staff to collect survey data measuring student attitudes toward exercise, body
  image, and fitness knowledge.  After collection of the two sets of data, we
  conduct comparative analysis of the pre and post fitness center and curriculum
  implementation.
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
  - Money (financial capital)
  - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
  - Education/training
  - 'Technical infrastructure (computers, etc.)'
  - Community outreach
  - Network/relationship support
  - Quality improvement research
