project_summary: >-
  With the cost of education going up and the economic fortunes of families
  going down, students need a break. We’re working with LA Metro and community
  colleges in LA County to build support for prepaid fare-free student transit
  passes to: 1) make it easier and cheaper for students to get to school and
  jobs; 2) reduce traffic, driving and GHG emissions; 3) fill empty seats on
  transit and reduce the operating cost per ride; 4) encourage life-long
  ridership, and 5) make it easier to learn!
