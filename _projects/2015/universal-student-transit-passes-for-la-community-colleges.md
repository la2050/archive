title: Universal Student Transit Passes for LA Community Colleges
project_summary: >-
  With the cost of education going up and the economic fortunes of families
  going down, students need a break. We’re working with LA Metro and community
  colleges in LA County to build support for prepaid fare-free student transit
  passes to: 1) make it easier and cheaper for students to get to school and
  jobs; 2) reduce traffic, driving and GHG emissions; 3) fill empty seats on
  transit and reduce the operating cost per ride; 4) encourage life-long
  ridership, and 5) make it easier to learn!

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "LA is building transformational transit projects—an effort in which Move LA plays a significant role—and we are interested in creating a “transit-responsive” culture where people think about transit when deciding where to live, work, shop and play. Fertile ground for this lies with college students, so we are proposing a campaign to provide students with fare-free universal transit passes that are pre-paid from the state’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF), possibly air quality programs, and a very small increase in student registration fees.\r\n\r\nThis is a win-win-win-win! Programs like this across the US have demonstrated dramatic increases in student transit ridership and significant reductions in student driving, the need for campus parking, traffic congestion, air pollution and GHG emissions. Because students can fill empty seats on transit, these transit passes would boost overall ridership and reduce the cost per rider for the transit agency. With our transit expansion, a program like this now could create transit riders for life! \r\n\r\nWe’d like all 26 transit operators in LA County to offer universal transit passes to all college and university students. But community colleges may be the best place to start because most students commute, would likely use transit and stay local after graduation. More than 400,000 students attend 21 community colleges in LA County. Many come from the poorest neighborhoods and some commute as much as 30 hours a week to several campuses to get the classes they need. 75% work at least part-time and don’t carry a full load of classes, so they don’t qualify for LA Metro’s discounted student pass, which requires fulltime status. That leaves the students with the biggest financial challenges paying full fare ($1.75/ride or $100/month).\r\n\r\nOur project would address several LEARN metrics. By making it easier and cheaper to get to school and work, it could increase matriculation rates and the number of students who complete college in 6 years. For students who must choose between spending the little money they have on either bus fare or lunch, a transit pass could save them from getting a ticket and a big fine, which might lead to quitting school. By putting more jobs within geographic reach, it could address unemployment and under-employment. If more students walk in groups between school and transit stops, it could enhance safety. School is hard enough. Move LA believes getting to and from school shouldn’t make it harder. "

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    Convincing LA Metro to provide universal student passes will be difficult.
    First, Metro has a discounted transit pass program for full-time students
    that costs $43/month, but it hasn’t attracted many new riders. Second,
    subsidies are always difficult to justify. Third, while there are many
    programs like this in the U.S., none are in a place as big and densely
    populated as LA County. But we have 4 advantages: 1) There’s new money
    available. The state’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) is growing and
    new revenues are not committed yet, and student transit passes are an
    eligible expense; 2) Metro’s ridership has fallen some since the recession
    and last year’s fare increase, and the agency wants to boost ridership; 3)
    Move LA helped convince the LA Metro board to unanimously pass the motion to
    study student transit passes on Sept. 24; 4) Move LA’s Denny Zane helped
    develop the highly successful “Any Line, Any Time” program at Santa Monica
    College with the Big Blue Bus. 
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "We will consider our work a success if LA Metro institutes a pilot project on pre-paid, fare-free, universal, student transit passes with at least three community colleges. We will also evaluate our process of bringing students, colleges and transit agencies together to craft a pilot project that works for all of them. For example, we would expect to:\r\n•\tMeet with at least five community college student body presidents\r\n•\tMeet with at least five community college leadership staff\r\n•\tDraw at least 150 students to the conference in January \r\n•\tHold briefings on at least two campuses (at the joint request of students and administration)  \r\n•\tHold at least three meetings of a coordinating body of at least 10 people to chart strategy together\r\n•\tDevelop and maintain a strong working relationship with LA Metro staff\r\n•\tCreate a “Street Team” of 10 students at three to five campuses to use social media to increase interest in transit passes. \r\n"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "No organizations are working specifically on student transit pass programs but there are many advocating for better pedestrian and bike access to stations — efforts that are highly complementary. This is especially true now because college students are living with their parents longer, fewer own or have access to cars, and more and more get to school on foot, bike, skateboard or transit. Among the organizations we work with on improving these “first-last-mile” connections to transit are the LA County Bicycle Coalition, LA Walks, Investing in Place, CicLAvia, Community Health Councils, the Westside Center for Independent Living, and Communities Actively Living Independent & Free. We’ve also been working with community colleges, state universities, UCLA, USC and other private schools, as well as Dr. Donald Shoup, who with several UCLA colleagues has authored studies on the success of similar programs across the U.S.\r\n \r\nBut we may be uniquely qualified to do this work. First, we have demonstrated success with the Santa Monica College program, implemented in 2008 with the result that 40% of all students, faculty and staff now arrive on campus by bus. Second, because of our interest in student transit passes we’ve developed relationships with student leaders, educators and trustees around LA County. Within one week in September we were able to mobilize resolutions and letters of support for student transit passes from four community college districts representing 17 colleges in LA County as well as 20 nonprofit organizations — from the American Lung Association to Housing California to the California State Students Association. Third, we already have close working relationships with LA Metro’s CEO, Board of Directors, and staff.  Finally, we have been working with legislators and the statewide coalition of nonprofit organizations to build support for setting aside $25 million of Greenhouse Gas Reduction Funds (GGRF) for student transit pass programs and active transportation statewide. This would be in addition to the GGRF money allocated to Metro through the Low Carbon Transit Operations Program. The state will probably decide on the $25 million set-aside when the Legislature reconvenes in January. Because of this work we also understand the political dynamics around this discussion, and the arguments likely to convince LA Metro that a student transit pass program is a wise use of funds. \r\n"
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "Our partners in this effort are college students and student leaders, trustees and administrators, and key leaders at Metro, including LA County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas, who chairs Metro’s board. We have developed strong relationships with the presidents of LA Trade Tech and other colleges, and with LA Community College District (LACCD) Trustee Mike Eng, a former Assemblymember who is also on Move LA’s Leadership Board. Mr. Eng worked with us to convince the Metro Board to direct staff to study the issue and is promoting the idea with LACCD leadership at each of the 9 colleges in the district. We also have close and long-term relationships with: LA Trade Tech President Larry Frank; Danny Tabor, the executive director of the Los Angeles Southwest College Foundation (LASC is an LACCD college) and former mayor of Inglewood, who is also on Move LA’s board; and Michael Woo, who is the dean of the College of Environmental Design at Cal Poly Pomona and also interested in working with us to institute a student transit pass program.\r\nWe plan to work more broadly with student body governments at community college campuses to gain their participation in this initiative. We also plan to create a “Street Team” of 10 students at 3-5 community college campuses who will use social media to drum up interest in a student transit pass program and get student feedback on the idea. We will dedicate $12,000 of the grant for stipends for members of the Street Team over a six-month period. We are also rekindling our relationship with CalPIRG, who will help us reach out to students from 4-year colleges, and we are working with the California State Student Association.\r\nFinally, Move LA has a long-term partnership with LA Metro, which we greatly value. It was the chair of Metro’s board, Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas, who authored the motion directing staff to study and report back on the feasibility of a student transit pass program. Move LA will meet with Metro staff to share our research and ideas for program design and to hear their ideas and concerns about moving forward. For us, this is about designing a program with Metro that can help the transit system succeed by increasing ridership within a fiscally sound framework that can also make it easier for students to do well in school.\r\n"
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    This project will cost just over $103,000 and will cover the cost of Move LA
    staff time to: research and write a policy paper on student transit passes;
    arrange and conduct meetings with student leaders, college administrators
    and LA Metro Staff; develop a proposal for discussion and a follow-up action
    agenda; organize a conference; organize and staff a “coordinating
    committee”; convene the coordinating committee at least three times; create
    sign-on letters and other public expressions of support; recruit and
    coordinate the student “Street Team.” The budget includes $12,000 for
    stipends for the “Street Team.” The graphic designer will work on the policy
    paper and video and other graphics for social media. Move LA will cover the
    $3,000 from our corporate contributions. 
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "$  58,729  Move LA Staff\t \r\n$  11,746  Benefits & Taxes @ 20%\t \r\n$  12,000  Street Team Stipends\t \r\n$    7,150  Graphic design\t \r\n$    4,481  Rent, phones, computers, etc @ 5%\t \r\n$    8,963  Fiscal Sponsor (Community Partners )10%\t \r\n$103,069  Total\t \r\n"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "Because of the scale and complexity of implementing a countywide program with LA Metro and other municipal transit providers, we will urge Metro to begin with a pilot program at 3-5 community colleges in order to figure out how to scale up — ideally to all community colleges first, then state universities, and eventually UCLA, USC and the private schools. We are recommending the pilot include one community college in each of the five county supervisorial districts, with a variety of urban, suburban and exurban locations,  a campus that would require Metro to coordinate with another municipal transit provider, and a campus where passes would also be provided to faculty and staff. We believe a pilot would help LA Metro understand how to scale-up by helping:\r\n•\tIdentify the best partners for a broader program;\r\n•\tNegotiate the right share of funding from the GGRF and/or student registration fees;\r\n•\tAssess the real program costs and the cost per rider;\r\n•\tDetermine if a program would require addition of more buses or trains and what this would cost;\r\n•\tDetermine how and whether to involve the municipal transit operators;\r\n•\tUnderstand how the use of TAP cards could help with data collection and monitoring;\r\n•\tModel reductions in VMT (vehicle miles traveled) and GHG emissions;\r\n•\tConsider if this program should be included in the next round of county wide transportation investments. \r\n\r\nThere’s a good chance that the 40% of the GHG Reduction Fund that has not yet been “continuously allocated” to other programs can provide additional funding for a bigger program in LA County as well as across the state. Last year we worked hard with a broad coalition of interests to make student transit passes an “eligible use” of this funding. Metro board has expressed interest in funding student passes to increase ridership and we’d like to see a program like this called out in the next round of transit investments. \r\n\r\nThis grant would allow us to: work with LA Metro, students and colleges on formulating the program using best practices; work with the colleges and students on organizing and demonstrating broad and enthusiastic support at Metro board meetings, and; reach out to engage students via social media including email, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
