Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to play.: >-
  We will make L.A. the best place to play by traveling to every
  community/area/district/town to provide residents/friends/visitors an
  opportunity to engage in hours of free community play.  Whether a
  park/field/parking lot/gymnasium/etc. we'll set up a vast array of
  athletically inspired play equipment and encourage everyone to be physically
  active, have fun, make new friends and build a bigger community network.
  According to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, “communities with … safe
  places to play are healthier than those that don't.”  The pLAy Bus will allow
  communities to gather together to play and experience their public space like
  never before.  At each stop of the pLAy Bus we’ll also have partners with
  health services (Vision to Learn, community health organizations, etc.) to
  provide free health screenings and work with community organizations (Rotary
  Clubs, Whole Foods, Etc.) to provide additional support and services.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Although there is no measure for the smiles and laughs that will be had by the participants, we plan on asking participants to take a survey before leaving. Our questions will be based around our primary objectives:\r\n•What were your favorite games/activities?\r\n•How long did you stay and play?\r\nDid you interact with people outside of the group you can with?\r\n•Had you been to this particular space before (park, school, community center)?\r\n•Do you plan on returning now that you been to this space?\r\n•Did you enjoy the activities provided by the Play Bus?\r\n•Would you return to a Play Bus event?\r\n•What was your favorite part of the day?\r\n\r\nFinally, we will collaborate with community/area/district/town official government offices & health initiatives along with the UCLA Center for World Health to help figure out what activities/services/organizations the community would love to implement. We'll conduct this research: Pre Event, Time of Event and Post Event."
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
  - Money (financial capital)
  - Volunteers/staff (human capital)
  - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
  - 'Infrastructure (building/space/vehicles, etc.)'
  - Community outreach
  - Network/relationship support
