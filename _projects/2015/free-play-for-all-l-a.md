project_summary: >-
  We want to create a traveling play program in communities across L.A.
  utilizing parks, community centers and other public spaces to increase
  awareness, health, fitness and fun! We’ll create the pLAy Bus, fill it with
  athletically inspired equipment, travel each weekend to new a location (park,
  parking lot, gymnasium, etc.) in a different community/area/district/town
  throughout L.A. County, unload the equipment, set up in the space provided and
  engage the greater community in hours of free play!
Please specify below: 'Throughout all of L.A. County and, if possible, beyond.'
category: all
'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  We will make L.A. the best place to play by traveling to every
  community/area/district/town to provide residents/friends/visitors an
  opportunity to engage in hours of free community play. Whether a
  park/field/parking lot/gymnasium/etc. we'll set up a vast array of
  athletically inspired play equipment and encourage everyone to be physically
  active, have fun, make new friends and build a bigger community network.
  According to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, “communities with … safe
  places to play are healthier than those that don't.” The pLAy Bus will allow
  communities to gather together to play and experience their public space like
  never before. At each stop of the pLAy Bus we’ll also have partners with
  health services (Vision to Learn, community health organizations, etc.) to
  provide free health screenings and work with community organizations (Rotary
  Clubs, Whole Foods, Etc.) to provide additional support and services.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  We have targeted two main challenges. The first is our desire to not have a
  large environmental impact due to pLAy Bus emissions. We want to ensure we
  leave every area we play in a healthy position than before we left. Therefore,
  our aim is to convert the bus’ engine to a biofuel engine. Vehicles that run
  on biodiesel achieve 30% fuel economy than petroleum based diesel engines. Our
  other challenge we’ve identified would be how to best spread the word about
  where and when the pLAy Bus will be in a community’s area and encourage
  participation. In order to overcome this we will start a strong social media
  campaign, reach out to local news and media organizations and work with
  community groups, recreation departments, schools and other local social
  services outlets to have them make the community aware.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Although there is no measure for the smiles and laughs that will be had by the
  participants, we plan on asking participants to take a survey before leaving.
  Our questions will be based around our primary objectives:
   •What were your favorite games/activities?
   •How long did you stay and play?
   Did you interact with people outside of the group you can with?
   •Had you been to this particular space before (park, school, community center)?
   •Do you plan on returning now that you been to this space?
   •Did you enjoy the activities provided by the Play Bus?
   •Would you return to a Play Bus event?
   •What was your favorite part of the day?
   
   Finally, we will collaborate with community/area/district/town official government offices & health initiatives along with the UCLA Center for World Health to help figure out what activities/services/organizations the community would love to implement. We'll conduct this research: Pre Event, Time of Event and Post Event.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Our proposal is totally unique. Knucklebones started in Boston in 2007,
  providing programs to thousands of participants throughout New England. We
  know how much fun, engagement and social outreach this Play Bus can
  accomplish. This approach will encourage people who might not have used the
  public spaces before to visit for the first time and fall in love as well as
  meet new people in the area and get active – all in one event! After
  Knucklebones expansion to L.A. in early 2015 we realized that a pLAy Bus can
  be successfully undertaken and accepted as a unique alternative to being
  sedentary.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Follows are our partners and how much they will receive from the awarded
  grant: 
   •Homeboy Industries (http://www.homeboyindustries.org) will receive $0 but their staff who are employed on the pLAy Bus will receive hourly compensation
   •Let’s Move (http://www.letsmove.gov) will receive $0
   •NFL Play60 (http://www.nflrush.com/play60) - will receive $0
   •Vision to Learn (http://visiontolearn.org) will receive $0
   •Rotary Clubs of District 5280 (http://portal.clubrunner.ca/50010) will receive $0
   •Whole Foods in L.A. County will receive $0
   •Each community/area/district/town official government office and healthy initiative within L.A. Country will receive $0
   •UCLA Center for World Health (worldhealth.med.ucla.edu) will receive $0
   •Scores of Manufacturers of the products the pLAy Bus will use will receive, if not free, greatly reduced compensation
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  The $100,000 should cover all costs associated with the pLAy Bus. As we are an
  established company we plan to utilize our existing connections with the
  manufactures of the products we’ll use for reduced rate or sponsorship for the
  equipment. This will ensure that all the funds received by the grant will go
  into the bus (customization or exterior/interior), staffing for events,
  maintenance of equipment, travel expenses, etc. However, the more funds we are
  able to save allows us to provide more events to the public.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  •pLAy Bus - $45,000 (used Ford Transit 450 – bio-diesel engine)
   •Marketing - $5,000 (business cards, signage, marketing on the bus)
   •Equipment - $20,000 (upon acceptance of the grant a complete list will be provided but will include Imagination Playground, Innova Disc Golf, Gonge, Backyard Games (Baggo, Ladderball, Kubb, KanJam, Poleish Horseshoes, etc), Classic Games (Bocce, Croquet, Teatherball, etc), Swingball, Pugg Nets, Coach Cliff Gaga Pit, etc.
   •Insurance - $8,500 (this will be in addition to the Workers Comp, General Lib, etc Knucklebones currently carries)
   •Cost of Events - $21,500 (the remaining funds will cover ~ 30, 3 hour events; paying staff, travel costs, maintenance, etc). If we are able to partner with an organization that provides volunteers to assist with the oversight, setup, cleanup, etc. we can significantly increase the number of events.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Once the pLAy Bus has been established, a majority of the costs will be
  covered through this grant. After we are able to show the community and
  corporate sponsors the success of said events, through videos and our strong
  social media following, we will receive sponsorship packages from
  corporations/grants/etc to continue providing the pLAy Bus throughout L.A.,
  including additional pLAy Buses. We will also work with the national partners
  to bring 'Play' Buses to other cities across America. Of course, as we were
  founded in Boston we know for sure that our strong following in the Greater
  Boston area would be very appreciative to have a Play Bus.
