    The Bruce Lee’s Little Dragons program will provide life confidence skills
    and martial arts training to at-risk and underprivileged youth in the Los
    Angeles County area, using Bruce Lee as a vehicle to inspire confidence and
    motivate action within our next generation. The program will give kids who
    have a sincere desire to pursue Martial Arts like Bruce, but simply cannot
    afford to do so, the opportunity to participate.
  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to play.: "From a young age Bruce Lee found himself in situations many of today’s youth can relate to. Bullying, street fighting, searching for ways to boost self-confidence and self-awareness to prepare for life in the real world. At 13, Bruce acted on his sincere desire to start training in martial arts. The rest...is history. \r\n\r\nOur youth deserves a philosophy to help them become more true, more whole, and more connected. Studying martial arts is proven to help kids increase self-confidence, self-discipline, self-esteem, focus, social skills and connect mind & body. As an organization based in Culver City, with staff and family living in Los Angeles County, it is imperative to us that the youth in our greater community are provided the tools and opportunities they need to be the best version of themselves possible, which can only stand to benefit the city of Los Angeles and foster it's future ambassadors. \r\n\r\nBy partnering with existing after school care providers such as Boys & Girls Club, and piloting programs within middle and high schools in the LA county area (targeting lower income areas), the Bruce Lee's Little Dragons program will use Bruce Lee as a vehicle to educate, motivate and inspire the youth in our community.  \r\n\r\nIn the first 12 months, 10 qualified martial arts and self-defense instructors, hand-picked by the Bruce Lee Foundation, will be sent to a group of 120 clubs and schools within the LA county area for a period of 4 weeks at a time - one 2-hour lesson per week, with an average of 20 kids per class. The curriculum will include entry level physical training in martial art and self defense, an introduction to personal health and wellbeing, bully defense group discussions and sharing Bruce Lee's insights into personal self-cultivation; to honestly express yourself. It is our goal to reach 2400 students within the first 12 months.  "

Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  A major challenge we anticipate is the cost of human capital needed to manage
  the program from a high level to ensure the quality of the work and level of
  education is kept to a high standard at all times. 
   
   To overcome this obstacle we will allocate a specific staff member from our operating budget, to ensure the program is set up for success from the beginning. Also to ensure that grant funding is not diluted through staffing needs, to maximize community impact.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: |-
  The three core KPI's we will monitor are: 
   
   1) Initial and Repeat Attendance 
   2) Personal Application 
   3) Expansion of Club and School Locations
   
   INITIAL AND REPEAT ATTENDANCE 
   We are confident the iconic energy and cultural relevance of Bruce Lee will encourage initial excitement and strong attendance. A "full" class will be considered 20 kids. A core measure of success will be the repeat attendance of students and the continuation of "full" classes.
   
   PERSONAL APPLICATION 
   We will work with relevant club and school staff to determine the social effects our curriculum is having on a student by way of their interaction with other students, performance in their studies and extra curricular activities, personal drive and goal setting.
   
   EXPANSION OF CLUB AND SCHOOL LOCATIONS
   In addition to a focus on the individual and the class environment, a key metric of success will be the number of requests to implement the program in new locations around the county.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There are certainly a handful of available Martial Arts after school programs,
  but these are predominantly located off-footprint, and operated by for-profit
  entities. 
   
   We are offering our curriculum at no cost, with a view to serve at-risk, underprivileged, and kids without the means or family income to begin their journey to self-actualization. 
   
   Our uniqueness is in our purpose to use Bruce Lee as a vehicle to inspire and motivate the individual mind, body and soul.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  The Bruce Lee Foundation is the sole stakeholder in this project. We have a
  network of supporters including Century Martial Arts
  (http://www.centurymartialarts.com/) that have generously agreed to help
  source expressions of interest from possible instructors within their network,
  as an in-kind gesture, and will not be compensated financially for this. 
   
   It is our goal that as a pilot program, specific to Los Angeles, that the two initial major partners are LA2050 and BLF.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  We will initially take a three vertical approach to scaling the program over a
  12-36 month period passed the initial 12 month funding term. Scaling is viewed
  as being able to continue programs within clubs and schools already
  participating, implementing programs in new areas of LA County and expanding
  the number of participants per class. The initial allocation of $12,000 for
  marketing materials is largely an investment in content creation to compliment
  these three verticals. 
   
   1) Peer-2-Peer Fundraising 
   2) Recurring Monthly Donations
   3) Influencers 
   
   PEER-2-PEER FUNDRAISING 
   We will utilize our peer-2-peer fundraising platform to amplify fundraising efforts, giving the power to make a difference directly to our audience, students, schools and clubs by way of personal fundraising campaigns. This type of fundraising is low cost to run, with a high revenue return for the program - increasing the amount of kids we can impact directly. 
   
   RECURRING MONTHLY DONATIONS
   The ability to attract long term recurring monthly donors is strengthened by the program cost per child of $57.50 - making the financial barrier of entry small and the impact on a child's life much greater. We will attract these donors through content creation and engaging marketing campaigns driven by sharing videos, photos and telling the stories of Bruce Lee's Little Dragons via our social media we assets.
   
   INFLUENCERS 
   More and more people are discovering Bruce Lee every day. His social media following alone is now over 20 million. Through the foundations network of corporate, celebrity and social influencers we will share the stories of the kids, clubs and schools taking part in the program to enable larger gifts and partnerships. 
   
   This pilot program and partnership with LA2050 will be key in proving the overall concept of the program itself, prior to expanding locally within LA county, then to the greater Californian area and eventually reaching other states within the continental US.
