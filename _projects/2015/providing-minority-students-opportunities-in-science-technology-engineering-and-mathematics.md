  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "African Americans, Hispanics, and women are overwhelmingly underrepresented in many STEM fields. Inadequate preparation in STEM subjects has major consequences in higher education, which limits their participation in many well-paid, high-growth professions. GMSS programs and services will encourage the enhancement in the academic development of our boys and girls by instilling a sense of competence, influence, and ownership. GMSS will not only be a place for learning and growth, but a place students can come in with their curious minds to have fun in discovering the strengths and limitations of each STEM field, absorbing these phenomena as a multifaceted and intricate whole. It will be a place where scientific futures are planted in the minds of our youth every single day. \r\nGMSS is more than compelled to give youth in the City of Inglewood something of their own: a scientific facility in their community, one that they will know belongs to them.  We want to give youth the sense of ownership and pride within their community uniting them with something positive. The goal of this program is to provide youth with the instructional activities to develop hands-on experience and skills in science, technology, engineering, and math. Participants in this program will improve their overall efficiency in the basic subjects of math and science while being prepared to take on other rigorous STEM coursework, required to succeed in such specialized fields. As a result of our program, these students also will benefit in the overall improvement of their grades and their level of achievement on the California Standardized Test. To facilitate student improvement, GMSS will secure a facility containing labs for science, technology, engineering and math activities. \r\nGreat Minds STEM Society will also create a professional STEM development program to improve teachers’ subject matter and content knowledge in STEM. GMSS will train teachers to develop specialized teaching techniques as well as instructional strategies, allowing him or her to establish effective methods for teaching their students STEM subjects. It is important to GMSS and the students of Inglewood to provide these teachers with the support needed to create effective curricula and tools for identifying students’ success.\r\nIn addition we will provide free workshops for people in the community needing skills in Microsoft Office which will be essential for them to be better suited for employment opportunities.

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    We recognize the challenges we will face, as students will come into our
    program with varying characteristics and different emotional states. Some
    will lack confidence and some will even come in a little timid. Our
    organization will be able to present these students with a positive role
    model, helping each one cope with his/her everyday challenges. We want to
    provide the direct resources these students need in order to overcome their
    situational barriers by implementing life development workshops that offer
    youth the benefits and services of behavioral management, healthy
    relationships, and community outreach. This comprehensive approach will
    afford them the opportunity to understand how their actions are an impactful
    influence to their personal being and how strong healthy relationships are
    vital to their personal growth. It is also an important benefit to teach
    these students the importance of giving back to the community in which they
    were raised. 
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    Each student will have an individual profile containing their school grades,
    state assessment results, and their initial math assessment from GMSS.
    Student profiles will be monitored and updated weekly examining areas of
    weaknesses, completed and uncompleted projects, attendance, number of hours
    used at the facility, number of hours on specific project, and skills
    acquired and mastered. Our evaluations committee composed of GMSS staff,
    school district administrators, and faculty will conduct initial student
    evaluations. Our committee will evaluate students quarterly, analyzing their
    progress and capability to meet academic expectations. These results will
    reveal the students’ rate of growth, strengths, weaknesses, and motivation.
    Students start by taking a customized assessment in math, which will assist
    us in identifying their needs, allowing GMSS to meet them where they are
    academically and develop them into scholastically inclined students. 
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "There are no known organizations doing similar work in the community of Inglewood. Great Minds is unique when compared to other organizations in outside cities. GMSS will provide students with hands-on skills developing their comprehension in Chemistry, Biology, Math, Computer Programming, and Engineering. We are going to provide a supporting and nurturing environment for these youth. We simply want them to feel safe, secure, and free of educational ridicule. We also will  have an ethnically diversified staff one that will be a strong representation of the community we serve. GMSS believe it is extremely important for these students to learn from people who have had similar cultural experiences growing up but have accomplish their dreams in becoming a minority STEM professional. This approach will allow for a better teacher-student relationship, thus, providing them with the motivation that they too can succeed in such fields. Here at GMSS we will provide even more attention to our minority women. \r\n\r\nMinority women face an even greater achievement gap because not only are they not being introduced to these fields, the education they receive is not sufficient enough to warrant such a career, let alone an interest. Great Minds STEM Society will not just encourage women to practice STEM fields; it will prepare these women to pursue these fields. We are going to create a cultivating environment for these women with role models represented by other women who are pursuing fields in STEM from nearby universities. We are going to establish science clubs for women and academic retreats so they will know how important they are to not only our program, but to the society in which we live. In attracting women into our program we have to develop an inside out approach. For women, it is not about the level of competence, it is about knowing there is a place for them to achieve their goals by providing them with a supportive environment that creates a personal identity in a field that is currently dominated by males. \r\nOur level of support in every aspect of a students' life is what separates us from similar organizations. GMSS simply wants to be the role model they will support them at all cost. "
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    There will be no other partners or collaborators on this project that will
    receive an outright share of this grant. Great Minds STEM Society will hire
    people on contractual terms and all financial obligations will be part of
    the general budget.  However, we will have collaborate with the school board
    and the City of Inglewood to ensure success of our project through a
    community effort. 
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    Great Minds STEM Society believe the estimated cost of leasing the property
    along with technological equipment will be approximately $60,000. Our
    organization will use an additional $20,000 to cover financial obligations
    to STEM professionals, guest speakers, and administrative cost. Great Minds
    STEM Society have constructed a budget that will not exceed the total cost
    of the grant during the first year. Our goal is to stay within budget and
    additional cost, if any, will be raised through fund raisers, private
    donors, and additional grants such as local and federal government funding.
    In addition we are working diligently to perform partnerships with BioRad,
    Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, and aerospace. These companies have community
    programs that can potentially sponsor any additional needs and cost.

  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "Our plan to scale the success is simple. We would like to obtain enough money through grants and other avenues to build our own facility that can hold an influx of students. GMSS would like to build something similar to that of a Boys and Girls Club but strictly dedicated to the profession of STEM. GMSS will be the after school STEM program you will find all the students in the neighborhood spending their time and honing their STEM skills. Our goal is to build four professional, fully equipped science labs comprising of a Biology lab, Analytical Chemistry lab, Organic Chemistry lab, and a Marine Biology lab that will provide students with a wide variety of hands-on opportunities in which students practice technique, gather data, and draw conclusions from those data. GMSS would also like to create an innovative technology and robotics Lab aimed at providing students with the breadth of knowledge that is required for specialization in STEM fields. \r\n"

    answer: "African Americans, Hispanics, and women are overwhelmingly underrepresented in many STEM fields. Inadequate preparation in STEM subjects has major consequences in higher education, which limits their participation in many well-paid, high-growth professions. GMSS programs and services will encourage the enhancement in the academic development of our boys and girls by instilling a sense of competence, influence, and ownership. GMSS will not only be a place for learning and growth, but a place students can come in with their curious minds to have fun in discovering the strengths and limitations of each STEM field, absorbing these phenomena as a multifaceted and intricate whole. It will be a place where scientific futures are planted in the minds of our youth every single day. \r\nGMSS is more than compelled to give youth in the City of Inglewood something of their own: a scientific facility in their community, one that they will know belongs to them.  We want to give youth the sense of ownership and pride within their community uniting them with something positive. The goal of this program is to provide youth with the instructional activities to develop hands-on experience and skills in science, technology, engineering, and math. Participants in this program will improve their overall efficiency in the basic subjects of math and science while being prepared to take on other rigorous STEM coursework, required to succeed in such specialized fields. As a result of our program, these students also will benefit in the overall improvement of their grades and their level of achievement on the California Standardized Test. To facilitate student improvement, GMSS will secure a facility containing labs for science, technology, engineering and math activities. \r\nGreat Minds STEM Society will also create a professional STEM development program to improve teachers’ subject matter and content knowledge in STEM. GMSS will train teachers to develop specialized teaching techniques as well as instructional strategies, allowing him or her to establish effective methods for teaching their students STEM subjects. It is important to GMSS and the students of Inglewood to provide these teachers with the support needed to create effective curricula and tools for identifying students’ success.\r\nIn addition we will provide free workshops for people in the community needing skills in Microsoft Office which will be essential for them to be better suited for employment opportunities.

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      We recognize the challenges we will face, as students will come into our
      program with varying characteristics and different emotional states. Some
      will lack confidence and some will even come in a little timid. Our
      organization will be able to present these students with a positive role
      model, helping each one cope with his/her everyday challenges. We want to
      provide the direct resources these students need in order to overcome
      their situational barriers by implementing life development workshops that
      offer youth the benefits and services of behavioral management, healthy
      relationships, and community outreach. This comprehensive approach will
      afford them the opportunity to understand how their actions are an
      impactful influence to their personal being and how strong healthy
      relationships are vital to their personal growth. It is also an important
      benefit to teach these students the importance of giving back to the
      community in which they were raised. 
  - name: Please explain how you will evaluate your work.
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      Each student will have an individual profile containing their school
      grades, state assessment results, and their initial math assessment from
      GMSS. Student profiles will be monitored and updated weekly examining
      areas of weaknesses, completed and uncompleted projects, attendance,
      number of hours used at the facility, number of hours on specific project,
      and skills acquired and mastered. Our evaluations committee composed of
      GMSS staff, school district administrators, and faculty will conduct
      initial student evaluations. Our committee will evaluate students
      quarterly, analyzing their progress and capability to meet academic
      expectations. These results will reveal the students’ rate of growth,
      strengths, weaknesses, and motivation. Students start by taking a
      customized assessment in math, which will assist us in identifying their
      needs, allowing GMSS to meet them where they are academically and develop
      them into scholastically inclined students.

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "There are no known organizations doing similar work in the community of Inglewood. Great Minds is unique when compared to other organizations in outside cities. GMSS will provide students with hands-on skills developing their comprehension in Chemistry, Biology, Math, Computer Programming, and Engineering. We are going to provide a supporting and nurturing environment for these youth. We simply want them to feel safe, secure, and free of educational ridicule. We also will  have an ethnically diversified staff one that will be a strong representation of the community we serve. GMSS believe it is extremely important for these students to learn from people who have had similar cultural experiences growing up but have accomplish their dreams in becoming a minority STEM professional. This approach will allow for a better teacher-student relationship, thus, providing them with the motivation that they too can succeed in such fields. Here at GMSS we will provide even more attention to our minority women. \r\n\r\nMinority women face an even greater achievement gap because not only are they not being introduced to these fields, the education they receive is not sufficient enough to warrant such a career, let alone an interest. Great Minds STEM Society will not just encourage women to practice STEM fields; it will prepare these women to pursue these fields. We are going to create a cultivating environment for these women with role models represented by other women who are pursuing fields in STEM from nearby universities. We are going to establish science clubs for women and academic retreats so they will know how important they are to not only our program, but to the society in which we live. In attracting women into our program we have to develop an inside out approach. For women, it is not about the level of competence, it is about knowing there is a place for them to achieve their goals by providing them with a supportive environment that creates a personal identity in a field that is currently dominated by males. \r\nOur level of support in every aspect of a students' life is what separates us from similar organizations. GMSS simply wants to be the role model they will support them at all cost. "

      Great Minds STEM Society believe the estimated cost of leasing the
      property along with technological equipment will be approximately $60,000.
      Our organization will use an additional $20,000 to cover financial
      obligations to STEM professionals, guest speakers, and administrative
      cost. Great Minds STEM Society have constructed a budget that will not
      exceed the total cost of the grant during the first year. Our goal is to
      stay within budget and additional cost, if any, will be raised through
      fund raisers, private donors, and additional grants such as local and
      federal government funding. In addition we are working diligently to
      perform partnerships with BioRad, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, and
      aerospace. These companies have community programs that can potentially
      sponsor any additional needs and cost.

    answer: "Our plan to scale the success is simple. We would like to obtain enough money through grants and other avenues to build our own facility that can hold an influx of students. GMSS would like to build something similar to that of a Boys and Girls Club but strictly dedicated to the profession of STEM. GMSS will be the after school STEM program you will find all the students in the neighborhood spending their time and honing their STEM skills. Our goal is to build four professional, fully equipped science labs comprising of a Biology lab, Analytical Chemistry lab, Organic Chemistry lab, and a Marine Biology lab that will provide students with a wide variety of hands-on opportunities in which students practice technique, gather data, and draw conclusions from those data. GMSS would also like to create an innovative technology and robotics Lab aimed at providing students with the breadth of knowledge that is required for specialization in STEM fields. \r\n"
