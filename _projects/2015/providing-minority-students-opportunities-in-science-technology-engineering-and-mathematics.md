  Great Minds will be a hands-on, research-based initiative set to improve the
  STEM skills of boys and girls in Grades K-12, which will include sustained
  professional development for teachers that focus on effective instructional
  strategies and methodologies. Our organization goal is to have an innovative
  STEM program that will be a leader in preparing youth, who are
  socioeconomically disadvantaged, to become scientific scholars.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  African Americans, Hispanics, and women are overwhelmingly underrepresented in
  many STEM fields. Inadequate preparation in STEM subjects has major
  consequences in higher education, which limits their participation in many
  well-paid, high-growth professions. GMSS programs and services will encourage
  the enhancement in the academic development of our boys and girls by
  instilling a sense of competence, influence, and ownership. GMSS will not only
  be a place for learning and growth, but a place students can come in with
  their curious minds to have fun in discovering the strengths and limitations
  of each STEM field, absorbing these phenomena as a multifaceted and intricate
  whole. It will be a place where scientific futures are planted in the minds of
  our youth every single day. 
   GMSS is more than compelled to give youth in the City of Inglewood something of their own: a scientific facility in their community, one that they will know belongs to them. We want to give youth the sense of ownership and pride within their community uniting them with something positive. The goal of this program is to provide youth with the instructional activities to develop hands-on experience and skills in science, technology, engineering, and math. Participants in this program will improve their overall efficiency in the basic subjects of math and science while being prepared to take on other rigorous STEM coursework, required to succeed in such specialized fields. As a result of our program, these students also will benefit in the overall improvement of their grades and their level of achievement on the California Standardized Test. To facilitate student improvement, GMSS will secure a facility containing labs for science, technology, engineering and math activities. 
   Great Minds STEM Society will also create a professional STEM development program to improve teachers’ subject matter and content knowledge in STEM. GMSS will train teachers to develop specialized teaching techniques as well as instructional strategies, allowing him or her to establish effective methods for teaching their students STEM subjects. It is important to GMSS and the students of Inglewood to provide these teachers with the support needed to create effective curricula and tools for identifying students’ success.
   In addition we will provide free workshops for people in the community needing skills in Microsoft Office which will be essential for them to be better suited for employment opportunities.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  We recognize the challenges we will face, as students will come into our
  program with varying characteristics and different emotional states. Some will
  lack confidence and some will even come in a little timid. Our organization
  will be able to present these students with a positive role model, helping
  each one cope with his/her everyday challenges. We want to provide the direct
  resources these students need in order to overcome their situational barriers
  by implementing life development workshops that offer youth the benefits and
  services of behavioral management, healthy relationships, and community
  outreach. This comprehensive approach will afford them the opportunity to
  understand how their actions are an impactful influence to their personal
  being and how strong healthy relationships are vital to their personal growth.
  It is also an important benefit to teach these students the importance of
  giving back to the community in which they were raised.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Each student will have an individual profile containing their school grades,
  state assessment results, and their initial math assessment from GMSS. Student
  profiles will be monitored and updated weekly examining areas of weaknesses,
  completed and uncompleted projects, attendance, number of hours used at the
  facility, number of hours on specific project, and skills acquired and
  mastered. Our evaluations committee composed of GMSS staff, school district
  administrators, and faculty will conduct initial student evaluations. Our
  committee will evaluate students quarterly, analyzing their progress and
  capability to meet academic expectations. These results will reveal the
  students’ rate of growth, strengths, weaknesses, and motivation. Students
  start by taking a customized assessment in math, which will assist us in
  identifying their needs, allowing GMSS to meet them where they are
  academically and develop them into scholastically inclined students.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There are no known organizations doing similar work in the community of
  Inglewood. Great Minds is unique when compared to other organizations in
  outside cities. GMSS will provide students with hands-on skills developing
  their comprehension in Chemistry, Biology, Math, Computer Programming, and
  Engineering. We are going to provide a supporting and nurturing environment
  for these youth. We simply want them to feel safe, secure, and free of
  educational ridicule. We also will have an ethnically diversified staff one
  that will be a strong representation of the community we serve. GMSS believe
  it is extremely important for these students to learn from people who have had
  similar cultural experiences growing up but have accomplish their dreams in
  becoming a minority STEM professional. This approach will allow for a better
  teacher-student relationship, thus, providing them with the motivation that
  they too can succeed in such fields. Here at GMSS we will provide even more
  attention to our minority women. 
   
   Minority women face an even greater achievement gap because not only are they not being introduced to these fields, the education they receive is not sufficient enough to warrant such a career, let alone an interest. Great Minds STEM Society will not just encourage women to practice STEM fields; it will prepare these women to pursue these fields. We are going to create a cultivating environment for these women with role models represented by other women who are pursuing fields in STEM from nearby universities. We are going to establish science clubs for women and academic retreats so they will know how important they are to not only our program, but to the society in which we live. In attracting women into our program we have to develop an inside out approach. For women, it is not about the level of competence, it is about knowing there is a place for them to achieve their goals by providing them with a supportive environment that creates a personal identity in a field that is currently dominated by males. 
   Our level of support in every aspect of a students' life is what separates us from similar organizations. GMSS simply wants to be the role model they will support them at all cost.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  There will be no other partners or collaborators on this project that will
  receive an outright share of this grant. Great Minds STEM Society will hire
  people on contractual terms and all financial obligations will be part of the
  general budget. However, we will have collaborate with the school board and
  the City of Inglewood to ensure success of our project through a community
  effort.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  Great Minds STEM Society believe the estimated cost of leasing the property
  along with technological equipment will be approximately $60,000. Our
  organization will use an additional $20,000 to cover financial obligations to
  STEM professionals, guest speakers, and administrative cost. Great Minds STEM
  Society have constructed a budget that will not exceed the total cost of the
  grant during the first year. Our goal is to stay within budget and additional
  cost, if any, will be raised through fund raisers, private donors, and
  additional grants such as local and federal government funding. In addition we
  are working diligently to perform partnerships with BioRad, Northrop Grumman,
  Raytheon, and aerospace. These companies have community programs that can
  potentially sponsor any additional needs and cost.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-

   $20,000 will cover financial obligations for contract hires and administrative fees. 
   
   The additional $20,000 will be saved for any unforeseen fees and/or financial obligations.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Our plan to scale the success is simple. We would like to obtain enough money
  through grants and other avenues to build our own facility that can hold an
  influx of students. GMSS would like to build something similar to that of a
  Boys and Girls Club but strictly dedicated to the profession of STEM. GMSS
  will be the after school STEM program you will find all the students in the
  neighborhood spending their time and honing their STEM skills. Our goal is to
  build four professional, fully equipped science labs comprising of a Biology
  lab, Analytical Chemistry lab, Organic Chemistry lab, and a Marine Biology lab
  that will provide students with a wide variety of hands-on opportunities in
  which students practice technique, gather data, and draw conclusions from
  those data. GMSS would also like to create an innovative technology and
  robotics Lab aimed at providing students with the breadth of knowledge that is
  required for specialization in STEM fields.
