  We are creating BUNCHFEST, a 3 day festival that aims to take the tools
  explored in the magazine offline and brought to the masses. BUNCH Magazine is
  dedicated to bringing resources to creatives with the goal of increasing
  employment in creative fields and empowering makers and entrepreneurs in these
  industries.
Please specify below: 'Arts District, Downtown Los Angeles'

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  In order to make Los Angeles the best place to create by 2050, we propose
  BUNCHFEST, a 3 day festival dedicated to bringing workshops, panels and
  cultural celebrations to the entire city. 
   
   Los Angeles is a hub for culture, creativity and the arts however it is often thought of as the epicenter of frivolity. People look to New York for creativity and even up North to Seattle and The Bay Area for culture and the arts. How can it be that we live in the entertainment capital of the world, yet we are not seen as a place that cultivates creativity, curiosity, culture, or innovation? 
   
   What this means is that we lose amazing creators to other metropolitan cities. These creators are the people who stimulate our economy, the ones who revitalize our neighborhoods and ultimately the ones who bring beauty and culture to our city. We know because many of us who will be managing this project have left LA seeking greener pastures at some point in our careers.
   
   What we have noticed is that this growing creative class is not comprised of outliers but instead are the people driving the culture and the economy. We come in the form of techies, artists, entrepreneurs and more. There is a deep desire to learn and collaborate. We have hosted a series of free panels and workshops on how to master creative business the latest of which had nearly 350 people signed up to attend. To us, that signals an eagerness to innovate and create. 
   
   The aim of BUNCHFEST is to replicate that momentum on a larger scale and make it accessible to the masses. Making Los Angeles a leader in the arts and also exposing our residents to the various types of careers that are available in creative industries is our goal. Empowering creatives to build careers is the end goal. 
   
   BUNCHFEST will be a 3 day festival hosted in the summer of 2016 dedicated to the intersection of music, film and innovation. Attendees will be able to see independent films, listen to up-and-coming/established musicians, all while having the opportunity to attend workshops and panels on innovation and creative business. We want attendees to leave feeling whole: inspired to create, knowledgeable on how to bring their plans to fruition and empowered to pursue their professional endeavors. 
   
   We believe that The Arts District in Downtown Los Angeles is the best place to host an event like this. The energy of this neighborhood is unmatched.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Challenge: The biggest challenge will be ensuring that the ticket prices are
  affordable for attendees. We want as many people to be able to attend, learn
  and grow. Our objective is to charge a nominal fee for tickets so that we can
  turn a small profit. Profits will be put towards hosting free, smaller
  workshops and panels throughout the rest of the year in addition to hosting
  this event annually. 
   
   Solution: We plan to offset these costs - that would otherwise be passed along to attendees - by minimizing staffing fees and supplementing through sponsorship. Staffing costs can be reduced by allowing people to volunteer for positions in exchange for festival passes. We will also work aggressively to bring in sponsors to reduce the cost of tickets.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: |-
  We will evaluate our work by measuring impact through:
   
   -Surveys administered throughout workshops and panels
   
   - Measure engagement through social media channels
   
   -Attendance rate
   
   - We will develop a focus group to attend the festival. We will track and monitor their progress throughout the year to understand how they have developed personally and professionally as it relates to their direct participation in the festival.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Northside Festival in Brooklyn is the closest example of an organization that
  is pushing out similar work. The festival celebrates film, technology, art and
  music over 8 days in Brooklyn and is put on by Northside Media, the publisher
  of Brooklyn Magazine and The L Magazine. We have a deep admiration for the
  impact that this festival has on the New York neighborhood. 
   
   Our distinguishing marker is that we will be more affordable and also execute on a smaller, more intimate scale. While our aim is to reach as many people as possible, Northside Festival can at times feel overwhelming, with hundreds of events taking place, many at the same time. Accessibility is our primary focus: by creating a curated experience with a schedule that offers opportunity instead of restriction. Seeing your favorite musician should not come at the expense of learning about digital marketing. Discussing personal branding as it relates to entering your film into festivals should not be sacrificed in order to experience a hands on craft workshop. Scheduling alone is not enough to guarantee a well rounded experience; it is truly about leaving people with inspiration and knowledge. BUNCHFEST embraces the idea of quality not quantity and will keep this at the forefront of our planning process.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Our partners will come directly from the community: the business owners,
  galleries, restaurants, co-working spaces, schools, council members & other
  public agents, volunteers, networking groups, non-profits and more. The
  support of these individuals and businesses is of paramount importance to our
  success. 
   
   There is no plan to directly share in the grant money with these partners, instead we will rely on them for their cooperation and collaboration in other ways such as helping to publicize the event.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 â€“ how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  We have estimated that this project will cost a minimum of $22,000 but will
  most likely top out at just under $50,000. We are prepared to cover additional
  costs through the help of sponsors.

How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: |-
  We plan to scale by utilizing the following strategy:
   
   -Make BUNCHFEST an annual event
   
   -Host smaller workshops, panels, and meetups around Los Angeles throughout the rest of the year. Each event will serve the purpose of fostering creativity, building a community, and providing the tools and resources people need to develop as creative professionals
   
   The data collected during the first event will be used to program all future events.
