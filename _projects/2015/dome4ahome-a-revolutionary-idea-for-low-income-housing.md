  'DESCRIBE IN GREATER DETAIL HOW YOU WILL MAKE LA THE HEALTHIEST PLACE TO LIVE: ': >-
    By creating housing and employment we will encourage the chronically
    homeless to leave the streets. This will improve their lives dramatically
    and free up all the associated resources.  We have a solution to finding
    space for these communities and we have a training scheme to encourage the
    acquisition of skills that provide ongoing employment.  Chronic homelessness
    impacts many lives and by providing solutions (housing, jobs, local clinics
    and community care) we can begin the task of eradicating this tragedy and
    making LA a model of how all cities should be.  Experience has shown us that
    we can provide individual, high quality homes whose construction can be paid
    for by a weekly rent of $100 - $140.

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    Planning and zoning issues are a major challenge. However we have already
    'passed' the plan check part of the building process.  The major obstacle is
    land acquisition. If no land is donated (either privately or publicly) we
    have a solution as to where we can build these show homes and start a
    community.  It is fairly radical, although entirely feasible - the
    technology hasn't been available until now to utilize this space.  We
    envisage that finding a donor for the show homes will not be difficult
    however.
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    We will evaluate occupancy rates, energy usage and generally evaluate
    demand. We know from similar construction in different parts of the world
    and different States that demand is very high.
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    There are other companies doing similar work but not with the intent of
    eliminating a specific inner city housing problem.  Our buildings are
    different to every other kind of construction and provide unparalleled
    safety, energy efficiency and longevity.
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    We will be encouraging major construction companies to contribute equipment
    and materials with the aim of providing the maximum number of homes.  The
    design will be done gratis and it is intended that a lot of the work be done
    on a volunteer basis. It is intended that every available dollar be put into
    constructing actual homes.
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    We believe we can build at least two homes for $100 K and perhaps more
    depending on the level of donations.
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Each Dome:  Dome Shell and slab $18,200, mechanical/electrical/plumbing $4,050, interior finish  $4,225,  windows $350, appliances  $1,250.\r\nLand improvement  sewer/power/water hookup, walkway etc etc.$10,000\r\nTotal for each dome $38,075  x 2  =  $76,150 \r\nIf materials/labor are donated we would like to build three Domes."
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    We would partner with the city of Los Angeles to roll out a larger
    Monolithic Dome building program. We would also look to corporate
    sponsorship to contribute a number of Dome homes.
