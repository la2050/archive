title: Dome4aHome A revolutionary idea for low-income housing
project_summary: "We will construct two Monolithic Dome homes to showcase the extraordinary qualities of reinforced, open-span concrete construction. \r\nWe will show how by providing skills training to the unemployed we can construct permanent, high quality, low-cost housing for the homeless."

project_areas:
  - County of Los Angeles
  - City of Los Angeles
maker_answers:
  'In one to three sentences, please describe your proposal.': "We will construct two Monolithic Dome homes to showcase the extraordinary qualities of reinforced, open-span concrete construction. \r\nWe will show how by providing skills training to the unemployed we can construct permanent, high quality, low-cost housing for the homeless."
  How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
    - Money (financial capital)
    - Volunteers/staff (human capital)
    - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
    - 'Infrastructure (building/space/vehicles, etc.)'
    - 'Technical infrastructure (computers, etc.)'
  How do you plan to use these resources to make change?:
    - Conduct research
    - Engage residents and stakeholders
    - Implement a pilot or new project
    - Expand a pilot or a program
    - Mobilize for systems change
    - Advocate with policymakers and leaders
    - Implement and track policy
    - Show how low cost housing can be high quality and desirable
  Where will you be working?:
    - County of Los Angeles
    - City of Los Angeles
  How will your proposal improve the following “Live” metrics?:
    - Healthcare access
    - Exposure to air toxins
    - Number of households below the self-sufficiency index
    - Housing affordability
    - Rates of homelessness
    - Walk/bike/transit score
    - Acres and miles of polluted waterways
    - Rates of mental illness
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    We will evaluate occupancy rates, energy usage and generally evaluate
    demand. We know from similar construction in different parts of the world
    and different States that demand is very high.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  By creating housing and employment we will encourage the chronically homeless
  to leave the streets. This will improve their lives dramatically and free up
  all the associated resources. We have a solution to finding space for these
  communities and we have a training scheme to encourage the acquisition of
  skills that provide ongoing employment. Chronic homelessness impacts many
  lives and by providing solutions (housing, jobs, local clinics and community
  care) we can begin the task of eradicating this tragedy and making LA a model
  of how all cities should be. Experience has shown us that we can provide
  individual, high quality homes whose construction can be paid for by a weekly
  rent of $100 - $140.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Planning and zoning issues are a major challenge. However we have already
  'passed' the plan check part of the building process. The major obstacle is
  land acquisition. If no land is donated (either privately or publicly) we have
  a solution as to where we can build these show homes and start a community. It
  is fairly radical, although entirely feasible - the technology hasn't been
  available until now to utilize this space. We envisage that finding a donor
  for the show homes will not be difficult however.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We will evaluate occupancy rates, energy usage and generally evaluate demand.
  We know from similar construction in different parts of the world and
  different States that demand is very high.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There are other companies doing similar work but not with the intent of
  eliminating a specific inner city housing problem. Our buildings are different
  to every other kind of construction and provide unparalleled safety, energy
  efficiency and longevity.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  We will be encouraging major construction companies to contribute equipment
  and materials with the aim of providing the maximum number of homes. The
  design will be done gratis and it is intended that a lot of the work be done
  on a volunteer basis. It is intended that every available dollar be put into
  constructing actual homes.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  We would partner with the city of Los Angeles to roll out a larger Monolithic
  Dome building program. We would also look to corporate sponsorship to
  contribute a number of Dome homes.
