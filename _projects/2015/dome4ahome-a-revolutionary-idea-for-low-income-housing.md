title: Dome4aHome A revolutionary idea for low-income housing

project_summary: >-
  We will construct two Monolithic Dome homes to showcase the extraordinary
  qualities of reinforced, open-span concrete construction. 
   We will show how by providing skills training to the unemployed we can construct permanent, high quality, low-cost housing for the homeless.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  By creating housing and employment we will encourage the chronically homeless
  to leave the streets. This will improve their lives dramatically and free up
  all the associated resources. We have a solution to finding space for these
  communities and we have a training scheme to encourage the acquisition of
  skills that provide ongoing employment. Chronic homelessness impacts many
  lives and by providing solutions (housing, jobs, local clinics and community
  care) we can begin the task of eradicating this tragedy and making LA a model
  of how all cities should be. Experience has shown us that we can provide
  individual, high quality homes whose construction can be paid for by a weekly
  rent of $100 - $140.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Planning and zoning issues are a major challenge. However we have already
  'passed' the plan check part of the building process. The major obstacle is
  land acquisition. If no land is donated (either privately or publicly) we have
  a solution as to where we can build these show homes and start a community. It
  is fairly radical, although entirely feasible - the technology hasn't been
  available until now to utilize this space. We envisage that finding a donor
  for the show homes will not be difficult however.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We will evaluate occupancy rates, energy usage and generally evaluate demand.
  We know from similar construction in different parts of the world and
  different States that demand is very high.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There are other companies doing similar work but not with the intent of
  eliminating a specific inner city housing problem. Our buildings are different
  to every other kind of construction and provide unparalleled safety, energy
  efficiency and longevity.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  We will be encouraging major construction companies to contribute equipment
  and materials with the aim of providing the maximum number of homes. The
  design will be done gratis and it is intended that a lot of the work be done
  on a volunteer basis. It is intended that every available dollar be put into
  constructing actual homes.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 â€“ how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  We believe we can build at least two homes for $100 K and perhaps more
  depending on the level of donations.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
  Each Dome: Dome Shell and slab $18,200, mechanical/electrical/plumbing $4,050,
  interior finish $4,225, windows $350, appliances $1,250.
   Land improvement sewer/power/water hookup, walkway etc etc.$10,000
   Total for each dome $38,075 x 2 = $76,150 
   If materials/labor are donated we would like to build three Domes.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  We would partner with the city of Los Angeles to roll out a larger Monolithic
  Dome building program. We would also look to corporate sponsorship to
  contribute a number of Dome homes.
