  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "Create a structured process matching all students to receive mentoring from industry professionals and peers to help transition them from each step of their education.\r\n\r\nMentorMint has existing partnerships with high schools, community colleges, and four year universities throughout California.  LA2050 can help grow those partnerships to reach all students in LA.\r\n\r\nEvery student will have someone who has been in their shoes show them how to become successful at every step and hand-hold them across critical points in their education.\r\n\r\nStudents will also have access to mentors from all over the US if they choose.\r\n\r\nYouth unemployment would decrease because they hear directly from employers what skills they need and how to secure an interview and prepare for it.  Underemployment would decrease because students will understand what skills they need to build outside the classroom that makes them employable (demonstrating teamwork, leadership, technologies too new to be incorporated into the classroom).\r\n\r\nEngaging parents in the mentoring and learning process through weekly updated reports, they can also participate in the same chat channel as the virtual mentoring sessions.  We can reach parents through our partners and connect them to early education programs and if logistics is an issue we can facilitate that virtually through our platform.\r\n\r\nAny languages that need to be taught can be done over the platform through tutoring from someone who has encountered the same challenges before them and overcome those challenges.\r\n\r\nSTEM education and tutoring is a priority among the written resources we provide. A forum where anyone can post any question and receive answers from others on the mentoring platform, a news feed that powered by analytics to show the most relevant questions for each student to the top of their news feed. For example, if overcoming language or tutoring issues is most important those questions and answers can rise to the top along with recommended mentors who have helped many people and received great reviews overcome those challenges. Students engaged in learning and understanding its value in building their future will reduce truancy rates, suspensions, etc.\r\n\r\nTest scores can improve through video tutoring completed on the platform where fellow students who are great test takers can help teach to other children who don't have test preparation resources. Industry professionals who have done well on those tests can also participate."

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate.

However, we do not necessarily have to work through the schools and can also continue working through non-profits.\r\n\r\nReach out to school administration and HR managers of corporations.

Mentoring can be integrated as part of student extracurriculars, volunteer programs, and career education where they can help students slightly their junior, and also mentoring can be integrated to parts of the curriculum or after school events.\r\n\r\nMentoring for underserved students provided by students, both volunteer requirements for graduation and tutoring programs can be extended virtually to students who do not have modes of transportation to reach tutors.  Students can be reached both formally through the school system and through other programs"
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "-Measure the number of high school students on the platform who enter postsecondary education compared to their peers who are not in the program.\r\n-Compare the number of community college students who receive certificates or transfer to 4-year universities relative to their peers who are not in the program\r\n-Measure the parental engagement in student learning and professional development from both the number signed up and the length of time they're engaged.\r\n-The number of video mentoring sessions that take place, the number of questions that are posted and answered on the forum.\r\n-Job placement rate of students after graduation compared to previous years\r\n-Self-reported income of students/adults on the platform relative to their peers\r\n-Number of students signed up \r\n-The amount of participants, how engaged they are, how many students give back\r\n-Student feedback on the program and platform"

What is unique about your proposed approach?: "Yes, MicroMentor.org (competitive), numerous job boards, tutoring services, independent mentors, recruitment agencies (complementary).\r\n\r\nStrengthen and centralize the entire academic and career ecosystem into one place to better utilize and resources. Other mentoring areas are highly fragmented and only serve small pockets and many don't allow for peer mentoring.
