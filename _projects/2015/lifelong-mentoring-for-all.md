project_summary: >-
  A customized LA 2050 branded mentoring portal facilitating mentoring for
  lifelong learning for everyone to learn from each other.  Professionals can
  mentor students, and students can teach others on the latest technology trends
  and innovations. All facilitated through video chat and monitored by parents
  so everyone can learn and teach from the convenience and safety of home.  The
  best mentors are those who understand your perspective and culture, we
  facilitate those matches and virtual coaching.
Please specify below: 'Community Colleges, High Schools, USC'
category: learn
'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Create a structured process matching all students to receive mentoring from
  industry professionals and peers to help transition them from each step of
  their education.
   
   MentorMint has existing partnerships with high schools, community colleges, and four year universities throughout California. LA2050 can help grow those partnerships to reach all students in LA.
   
   Every student will have someone who has been in their shoes show them how to become successful at every step and hand-hold them across critical points in their education.
   
   Students will also have access to mentors from all over the US if they choose.
   
   Youth unemployment would decrease because they hear directly from employers what skills they need and how to secure an interview and prepare for it. Underemployment would decrease because students will understand what skills they need to build outside the classroom that makes them employable (demonstrating teamwork, leadership, technologies too new to be incorporated into the classroom).
   
   Engaging parents in the mentoring and learning process through weekly updated reports, they can also participate in the same chat channel as the virtual mentoring sessions. We can reach parents through our partners and connect them to early education programs and if logistics is an issue we can facilitate that virtually through our platform.
   
   Any languages that need to be taught can be done over the platform through tutoring from someone who has encountered the same challenges before them and overcome those challenges.
   
   STEM education and tutoring is a priority among the written resources we provide. A forum where anyone can post any question and receive answers from others on the mentoring platform, a news feed that powered by analytics to show the most relevant questions for each student to the top of their news feed. For example, if overcoming language or tutoring issues is most important those questions and answers can rise to the top along with recommended mentors who have helped many people and received great reviews overcome those challenges. Students engaged in learning and understanding its value in building their future will reduce truancy rates, suspensions, etc.
   
   Test scores can improve through video tutoring completed on the platform where fellow students who are great test takers can help teach to other children who don't have test preparation resources. Industry professionals who have done well on those tests can also participate.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Potential slow adoption of technology process among organizations such as
  schools. However, we do not necessarily have to work through the schools and
  can also continue working through non-profits.
   
   Reach out to school administration and HR managers of corporations. Most Corporations have structured volunteering programs where employees can mentor students in the LA area as an option as part of their volunteering programs. Mentoring can be integrated as part of student extracurriculars, volunteer programs, and career education where they can help students slightly their junior, and also mentoring can be integrated to parts of the curriculum or after school events.
   
   Mentoring for underserved students provided by students, both volunteer requirements for graduation and tutoring programs can be extended virtually to students who do not have modes of transportation to reach tutors. Students can be reached both formally through the school system and through other programs
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  -Measure the number of high school students on the platform who enter
  postsecondary education compared to their peers who are not in the program.
   -Compare the number of community college students who receive certificates or transfer to 4-year universities relative to their peers who are not in the program
   -Measure the parental engagement in student learning and professional development from both the number signed up and the length of time they're engaged.
   -The number of video mentoring sessions that take place, the number of questions that are posted and answered on the forum.
   -Job placement rate of students after graduation compared to previous years
   -Self-reported income of students/adults on the platform relative to their peers
   -Number of students signed up 
   -The amount of participants, how engaged they are, how many students give back
   -Student feedback on the program and platform
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Yes, MicroMentor.org (competitive), numerous job boards, tutoring services,
  independent mentors, recruitment agencies (complementary).
   
   Strengthen and centralize the entire academic and career ecosystem into one place to better utilize and resources. Other mentoring areas are highly fragmented and only serve small pockets and many don't allow for peer mentoring. We are unique in that we already have existing partnerships within high schools, community colleges, universities, and large corporations.
   
   Since we are not in the placement industry we can actually work with recruitment firms and other employers in adding them to the platform so students can have a funnel to go from education directly into the workforce.
   
   Bringing mentoring, ask me anything, and job boards into one place can bring together the community knowledge and connections necessary to gain employment in areas people love to be in.
   
   Simplifying the mentoring process of matching and reducing the overhead by providing video functionality, instant messaging, message boards, simple matching, forums where students can ask any question, and library of career information in one place.
   
   Creating specific to pathways from what students study in school to the long term skills needed to build into the eventual job they would like to secure. Tools for lifelong learning and assessment. The platform is free for students and mentors.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  We have existing partnerships with Community Colleges, High Schools, and four
  year universities throughout LA focusing on creating pathways to each
  successive level to bring students from high school into professional career
  paths focusing on technology and digital media.
   
   We will continue building out those relationships to work with every school and every student.
   
   Other partnerships including small businesses and large corporations to serve as mentors.
   
   No other partners need to receive pieces of the grant award.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  No additional costs: Customization of mentoring portal and additional
  development included, 3 years of technology maintenance
   
   Maintenance costs for the next 3 years are paid up front with the $100,000 so no additional costs additional to incur.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
  $20,000 for 3 years of technology maintenance supporting servers, code
  maintenance, and upgrades
   
   $70,000 to create a custom mentoring portal for the City of LA
   
   $10,000 for part time coordinator to contact local businesses to onboard and create partnerships
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: |-
  Building awareness and partnerships with the following:
   
   -Continuing adding schools to our partnership list by meeting with education and business leadership throughout LA
   -LA2050 backing and branding will definitely speed up partnerships across all LA educational institutions, small businesses, and locally based corporations. Just the LA2050 brand alone accelerates the process.
   -Promoting mentoring program among students, parents, and associations throughout LA.
   -Reach out to key stakeholders through in person meetings, phone, online channels, maintaining a physical presence at LA citywide events, institutional partnerships
   -Adding value to education institutions and non-profits throughout LA to continue growth and serving the needs of stakeholders
   -Partner with after school programs
   -Draw from the own LA community of student leaders to act as ambassadors to drive growth throughout their own peers also generating organic growth
   -Articles and publications that can be spread through various social media channels

    answer: "Create a structured process matching all students to receive mentoring from industry professionals and peers to help transition them from each step of their education.\r\n\r\nMentorMint has existing partnerships with high schools, community colleges, and four year universities throughout California.  LA2050 can help grow those partnerships to reach all students in LA.\r\n\r\nEvery student will have someone who has been in their shoes show them how to become successful at every step and hand-hold them across critical points in their education.\r\n\r\nStudents will also have access to mentors from all over the US if they choose.\r\n\r\nYouth unemployment would decrease because they hear directly from employers what skills they need and how to secure an interview and prepare for it.  Underemployment would decrease because students will understand what skills they need to build outside the classroom that makes them employable (demonstrating teamwork, leadership, technologies too new to be incorporated into the classroom).\r\n\r\nEngaging parents in the mentoring and learning process through weekly updated reports, they can also participate in the same chat channel as the virtual mentoring sessions.  We can reach parents through our partners and connect them to early education programs and if logistics is an issue we can facilitate that virtually through our platform.\r\n\r\nAny languages that need to be taught can be done over the platform through tutoring from someone who has encountered the same challenges before them and overcome those challenges.\r\n\r\nSTEM education and tutoring is a priority among the written resources we provide. A forum where anyone can post any question and receive answers from others on the mentoring platform, a news feed that powered by analytics to show the most relevant questions for each student to the top of their news feed. For example, if overcoming language or tutoring issues is most important those questions and answers can rise to the top along with recommended mentors who have helped many people and received great reviews overcome those challenges. Students engaged in learning and understanding its value in building their future will reduce truancy rates, suspensions, etc.\r\n\r\nTest scores can improve through video tutoring completed on the platform where fellow students who are great test takers can help teach to other children who don't have test preparation resources. Industry professionals who have done well on those tests can also participate."

    answer: "Potential slow adoption of technology process among organizations such as schools.  However, we do not necessarily have to work through the schools and can also continue working through non-profits.\r\n\r\nReach out to school administration and HR managers of corporations.  Most Corporations have structured volunteering programs where employees can mentor students in the LA area as an option as part of their volunteering programs.  Mentoring can be integrated as part of student extracurriculars, volunteer programs, and career education where they can help students slightly their junior, and also mentoring can be integrated to parts of the curriculum or after school events.\r\n\r\nMentoring for underserved students provided by students, both volunteer requirements for graduation and tutoring programs can be extended virtually to students who do not have modes of transportation to reach tutors.  Students can be reached both formally through the school system and through other programs"

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Yes, MicroMentor.org (competitive), numerous job boards, tutoring services, independent mentors, recruitment agencies (complementary).\r\n\r\nStrengthen and centralize the entire academic and career ecosystem into one place to better utilize and resources. Other mentoring areas are highly fragmented and only serve small pockets and many don't allow for peer mentoring. We are unique in that we already have existing partnerships within high schools, community colleges, universities, and large corporations.\r\n\r\nSince we are not in the placement industry we can actually work with recruitment firms and other employers in adding them to the platform so students can have a funnel to go from education directly into the workforce.\r\n\r\nBringing mentoring, ask me anything, and job boards into one place can bring together the community knowledge and connections necessary to gain employment in areas people love to be in.\r\n\r\nSimplifying the mentoring process of matching and reducing the overhead by providing video functionality, instant messaging, message boards, simple matching, forums where students can ask any question, and library of career information in one place.\r\n\r\nCreating specific to pathways from what students study in school to the long term skills needed to build into the eventual job they would like to secure. Tools for lifelong learning and assessment.  The platform is free for students and mentors."
