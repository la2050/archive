  We are seeking $100,000 in support of our hands-on, in- and out-of-school
  healthy cooking and nutrition education for underserved kids, their families,
  and their teachers. Our programs bring healthy food to children in need, while
  also teaching them how to prepare nutritious, affordable meals and snacks on
  their own. During the 2015-2016 school year, we will partner with 15 Los
  Angeles schools to implement our proven programming, thereby reaching a total
  of 3,649 individuals.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Common Threads will make Los Angeles the healthiest place to live by providing
  underserved kids (grades 3-8), their families, and their teaches with
  hands-on, in- and out-of-school cooking and nutrition education that brings
  healthy food to children in need, while also improving nutrition knowledge,
  attitudes, and behaviors. As the Institute of Medicine recommends fighting
  childhood obesity in part by making schools "the heart of health," and the
  Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recommends up to 50 hours per year per
  child of nutrition education, we work with schools to incorporate as many of
  our programs as possible into the school's schedule and according to their
  needs, thereby increasing individual students' exposure to nutrition education
  while fostering a community-wide culture of health. 
   
   During the 2015-16 school year, we will partner with 15 LA schools to expand our programming, reaching 1,000 more kids, parents/guardians, and teachers than we did during the previous year. Specifically, we will engage up to 3,649 individuals in up to 140 distinct program sessions (for a total of over 33,200 program hours) and will provide these individuals with up to 27,442 healthy meals and snacks they have prepared themselves. Because food insecurity and other factors related to poverty can contribute to obesity, we specifically target schools where at least 80% of students are eligible for free or reduced price lunch. 
   
   In our programs, participants cook and prepare healthy, culturally-diverse meals and snacks from scratch with affordable ingredients and an emphasis on whole grains, fresh fruits and vegetables, and less fat and sodium – and thereby not only receive nutritious food during our programs, but also gain the skills and knowledge needed to cook and eat healthy on their own. Programs include: a Cooking Skills and World Cuisine afterschool program; an in-school, teacher-led Small Bites nutrition education program and Garden Classes; Parent Workshops; family Grocery Store Tours; Family and Teacher Cooking Classes; and Healthy Teacher Trainings. 
   
   Our programmatic approach has resulted in measurable outcomes that create a strong foundation for a future of improved personal health. Indeed, our school year 2013-14 evaluation results showed that, of students with room to improve, 81% improved their nutrition knowledge, 43% increased their preference for healthy food, and 51% of students increased their vegetable consumption.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  We are committed to ongoing, rigorous evaluation that utilizes the best
  methods for understanding our program’s impact. However, due to our programs’
  size and geographical range, one major challenge we anticipate to our
  evaluation is collecting representative data. During the 2015-16 school year,
  we are addressing this challenge by: 1) sampling a randomly chosen subset of
  participants; 2) converting our data collection to scannable forms; and 3)
  decentralizing our data entry function. As a small organization, we are also
  challenged by time needed to comply with varying regulations governing student
  privacy in 6 districts and have thus hired a full-time associate to ensure
  compliance. Lastly, because our data collection is done by our program
  instructors, we have developed more detailed material to support them in this
  collection and integrated the survey into the first and last lessons more
  seamlessly, so that they may be used as an element of the curriculum, rather
  than a distraction.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We evaluate our programs through annual internal pre- and post-surveys of
  student and parent participants. In addition to measuring the impact of our
  programs on participants’ nutrition and cooking knowledge, attitudes, and
  behaviors, these surveys also capture data on dose delivered and received,
  fidelity, and context. Due to the large numbers of students participating in
  our programming across the country, we randomly chose schools to participate
  in our school year 2015-16 survey to achieve a national sample of 750 Small
  Bite student participants and 750 chef-led program participants. Previous
  experience shows that this number is adequately powered to detect the effect
  of our programming. At the end of each school year, we analyze the survey
  data, matching pre- and post-surveys to determine net change.
   
   Teachers also complete surveys after completing our Healthy Teacher Training and are able to provide feedback on and suggestions for the training.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  While there are other organizations in LA that offer health and/or nutrition
  programs for kids and/or families, many of them complement Common Threads’
  programs; target different areas in LA; or have a different programmatic
  approach and/or scope. We maintain partnerships with some of these health and
  wellness-focused organizations, including, for instance Revolution Foods, as
  well as with other youth-serving organizations, including LA’s BEST, Beyond
  the Bell, Boys and Girls Club, and Youth Policy Institute.
   
   Common Threads’ approach is unique in that we combine scalable, hands-on intensive cooking programs and nutrition education curricula with parent engagement and teacher trainings to maximize impact and create a culture of wellness in our partner schools. Additionally, by working with schools to implement as many of our complementary programs as possible and aligning our programs to local wellness policies, we further help foster a school-wide culture of health. Moreover, our programmatic approach goes beyond simply promoting nutrition and good health by utilizing research-based curriculum – created and refined in-house by our curriculum staff with input from educators, chefs, and nutritionists – to educate participants on how to adopt, practice, and maintain healthy behaviors. Indeed, our curriculum is rooted in both internal and external evaluations and aligned to the nutrition theory of Dr. Isobel Contento, Professor of Nutrition and Education at Columbia University, and we incorporate experiential learning strategies that research has shown lead to the greatest improvements in health behaviors, including improved diet quality. Additionally, our program instructors are trained chefs and teachers who implement the entire program, thereby also serving as mentors to the kids in our programs.
   
   Lastly, our programs are unique in that they are also designed to promote success in the classroom by utilizing curriculum aligned to Common Core Standards for math and English and Next Generation Science Standards and by helping kids establish healthy habits that research – such as a 2014 report from the Centers for Disease Control - has linked to academic achievement. For example, in our Small Bites nutrition education program, trained teachers engage students in connecting math, language arts, and science concepts to hands-on nutrition lessons.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  During the 2015-2016 school year, Common Threads will work closely with the
  Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) and its umbrella of schools, as
  well as area charter school networks, to deliver our full program menu of
  healthy cooking and nutrition education to children, parents/guardians, and
  teachers. We will provide our programming to our partner schools at no cost to
  them or to participants. The direct program cost per school is $8,000, which
  is all underwritten by Common Thread’s own fundraising. Thus, while the
  $100,000 award will directly go to Common Threads, we will utilize these funds
  to provide our programming to our partner schools for free.
   
   Our Los Angeles Program Manager will work directly with school administration to incorporate as many components of our programming as possible in both in- and out-of-school settings, and schools will provide kitchen space for our afterschool programs at no cost. Additionally, thanks to approval from LAUSD this past April, we are able to award salary point (Professional Development) credit to teachers who participate in Common Threads’ Healthy Teacher Training program; this school year, we except up to 320 teachers to complete the Training and thus receive salary point credit.
   
   Our confirmed 2015-2016 school year partners are as follows: Aspire Titan Academy, Glenfeliz Boulevard Elementary School, Hollenbeck Middle School, John Adams Middle School, KIPP Comienza Community Prep, KIPP Sol Academy, Pacoima Charter School, Para Los Niños, and Sunrise Elementary.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  Our total projected 2015-2016 school year budget for our programming in Los
  Angeles is $781,752.
   We will cover the additional costs through support from other foundations and corporations, including committed funding from Ralph’s/Food 4 Less Foundation, Herbalife, the Fresh Produce and Floral Council, the Julia Child Foundation, and Whole Kids Foundation; special event revenue; and individual contributions. 
   
   Moreover, Common Threads ensures the viability and longevity of its mission and programs by recruiting and seating board members that provide leadership and participate in efforts that financially support the organization. Boards include a National Board of Directors and local Advisory Boards and
   Associate Boards in our markets, including an Associate Board in Los Angeles. All board members assist in the cultivation of productive partner relationships; however, it is our Associate Board whose primary role is to fundraise, particularly through events. Additionally, we cultivate productive partner relationships with individuals, foundations, corporations, culinary communities and, especially, schools, parents and children; and hire staff (and volunteers) with skills and expertise in nutrition, cooking, education, fundraising and nonprofit management.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
  Salaries and Wages: $25,000; this includes the salaries of our National
  Program Manager as well as our LA Program Manager, who oversee all programming
  in LA, including supporting program implementation at each school; managing
  both Chefs and volunteers; and overseeing school, district, and local
  organization partnerships.
   
   Chefs/Program Supplies: $70,000; includes chef instructor training and pay*; the training of classroom teachers*; and healthy groceries, curriculum, cookbooks, and cooking equipment for our in- and after-school nutrition education and cooking programs. 
   
   *Our after-school programs are led by trained Chef Instructors and volunteers, while our in-school programs are led by trained teachers from our partner schools. 
   
   Evaluation: $5,000; this includes the costs of data collection and analysis for our 2015-2016 school year evaluation, as described above.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  In Los Angeles, we will continue to scale our programming and grow our reach
  by: 1) increasing uptake of our Small Bites nutrition education program among
  our partner schools; 2) continuing to prove out our new model of implementing
  Small Bites in partnership with out-of-school time program providers and
  district-led, in- and after-school initiatives; and 3) deepening our
  engagement within each partner school. Small Bites is an effective but
  lower-cost program, with the added benefits of being aligned to Common Core
  and Next Generation Science Standards and being flexible enough to leverage as
  part of partnerships with other organizations; thus, by expanding Small Bites,
  we will reach more kids and families in an efficient, sustainable, and
  impactful way.
   
   Additionally, this past year, we developed a game-based nutrition education app, CommonBytes, which we believe has the potential to supplement our current programs, increasing their impact in the short term, and to bring relevant nutrition learning to additional kids in the long term. The CommonBytes app includes interactive games designed for students grades 3-8 to use with classroom teachers in school – including as a supplement to our Small Bites program - or at home. Participants follow recipes from the garden to the grocery store to the kitchen, and, finally, to a table. The CommonBytes platform will consist of 10-15 games – with easy, medium, and hard levels - that incorporate gardening, healthy shopping, healthy cooking techniques, and table etiquette as well as over 25 recipes, organized by Snacks, Meals, Beverages, and Treats. Incentive points and badges that further the nutritional experience (e.g., personal secrets and recipes from celebrity chefs) will be awarded as various milestones and goals are reached. Parents and teachers will also be able to access the app to track the progress of their child or student in completing the games; look up new recipes; or find cooking and nutrition resources.
   
   This fall, we are piloting CommonBytes in the Miami-Dade County Public Schools, with a national pilot –including in Los Angeles – planned for 2016. Overall, during the 2015-16 school year, we expect up to 5,000 kids to receive cooking and nutrition education through CommonBytes.

      DESCRIBE IN GREATER DETAIL HOW YOU WILL MAKE LA THE HEALTHIEST PLACE TO
      LIVE: 
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Common Threads will make Los Angeles the healthiest place to live by providing underserved kids (grades 3-8), their families, and their teaches with hands-on, in- and out-of-school cooking and nutrition education that brings healthy food to children in need, while also improving nutrition knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors.  As the Institute of Medicine recommends fighting childhood obesity in part by making schools \"the heart of health,\" and the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recommends up to 50 hours per year per child of nutrition education, we work with schools to incorporate as many of our programs as possible into the school's schedule and according to their needs, thereby increasing individual students' exposure to nutrition education while fostering a community-wide culture of health. \r\n\r\nDuring the 2015-16 school year, we will partner with 15 LA schools to expand our programming, reaching 1,000 more kids, parents/guardians, and teachers than we did during the previous year. Specifically, we will engage up to 3,649 individuals in up to 140 distinct program sessions (for a total of over 33,200 program hours) and will provide these individuals with up to 27,442 healthy meals and snacks they have prepared themselves. Because food insecurity and other factors related to poverty can contribute to obesity, we specifically target schools where at least 80% of students are eligible for free or reduced price lunch.   \r\n\r\nIn our programs, participants cook and prepare healthy, culturally-diverse meals and snacks from scratch with affordable ingredients and an emphasis on whole grains, fresh fruits and vegetables, and less fat and sodium – and thereby not only receive nutritious food during our programs, but also gain the skills and knowledge needed to cook and eat healthy on their own. Programs include: a Cooking Skills and World Cuisine afterschool program; an in-school, teacher-led Small Bites nutrition education program and Garden Classes; Parent Workshops; family Grocery Store Tours; Family and Teacher Cooking Classes; and Healthy Teacher Trainings. \r\n\r\nOur programmatic approach has resulted in measurable outcomes that create a strong foundation for a future of improved personal health. Indeed, our school year 2013-14 evaluation results showed that, of students with room to improve, 81% improved their nutrition knowledge, 43% increased their preference for healthy food, and 51% of students increased their vegetable consumption. \r\n"

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      We are committed to ongoing, rigorous evaluation that utilizes the best
      methods for understanding our program’s impact. However, due to our
      programs’ size and geographical range, one major challenge we anticipate
      to our evaluation is collecting representative data. During the 2015-16
      school year, we are addressing this challenge by: 1) sampling a randomly
      chosen subset of participants; 2) converting our data collection to
      scannable forms; and 3) decentralizing our data entry function. As a small
      organization, we are also challenged by time needed to comply with varying
      regulations governing student privacy in 6 districts and have thus hired a
      full-time associate to ensure compliance. Lastly, because our data
      collection is done by our program instructors, we have developed more
      detailed material to support them in this collection and integrated the
      survey into the first and last lessons more seamlessly, so that they may
      be used as an element of the curriculum, rather than a distraction.
  - name: Please explain how you will evaluate your work.
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "We evaluate our programs through annual internal pre- and post-surveys of student and parent participants. In addition to measuring the impact of our programs on participants’ nutrition and cooking knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors, these surveys also capture data on dose delivered and received, fidelity, and context. Due to the large numbers of students participating in our programming across the country, we randomly chose schools to participate in our school year 2015-16 survey to achieve a national sample of 750 Small Bite student participants and 750 chef-led program participants. Previous experience shows that this number is adequately powered to detect the effect of our programming. At the end of each school year, we analyze the survey data, matching pre- and post-surveys to determine net change.\r\n\r\nTeachers also complete surveys after completing our Healthy Teacher Training and are able to provide feedback on and suggestions for the training."

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "While there are other organizations in LA that offer health and/or nutrition programs for kids and/or families, many of them complement Common Threads’ programs; target different areas in LA; or have a different programmatic approach and/or scope. We maintain partnerships with some of these health and wellness-focused organizations, including, for instance Revolution Foods, as well as with other youth-serving organizations, including LA’s BEST, Beyond the Bell, Boys and Girls Club, and Youth Policy Institute.\r\n\r\nCommon Threads’ approach is unique in that we combine scalable, hands-on intensive cooking programs and nutrition education curricula with parent engagement and teacher trainings to maximize impact and create a culture of wellness in our partner schools. Additionally, by working with schools to implement as many of our complementary programs as possible and aligning our programs to local wellness policies, we further help foster a school-wide culture of health. Moreover, our programmatic approach goes beyond simply promoting nutrition and good health by utilizing research-based curriculum – created and refined in-house by our curriculum staff with input from educators, chefs, and nutritionists – to educate participants on how to adopt, practice, and maintain healthy behaviors. Indeed, our curriculum is rooted in both internal and external evaluations and aligned to the nutrition theory of Dr. Isobel Contento, Professor of Nutrition and Education at Columbia University, and we incorporate experiential learning strategies that research has shown lead to the greatest improvements in health behaviors, including improved diet quality. Additionally, our program instructors are trained chefs and teachers who implement the entire program, thereby also serving as mentors to the kids in our programs.\r\n\r\nLastly, our programs are unique in that they are also designed to promote success in the classroom by utilizing curriculum aligned to Common Core Standards for math and English and Next Generation Science Standards and by helping kids establish healthy habits that research – such as a 2014 report from the Centers for Disease Control - has linked to academic achievement. For example, in our Small Bites nutrition education program, trained teachers engage students in connecting math, language arts, and science concepts to hands-on nutrition lessons."

      Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on
      this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner
      receive?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "During the 2015-2016 school year, Common Threads will work closely with the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) and its umbrella of schools, as well as area charter school networks, to deliver our full program menu of healthy cooking and nutrition education to children, parents/guardians, and teachers. We will provide our programming to our partner schools at no cost to them or to participants. The direct program cost per school is $8,000, which is all underwritten by Common Thread’s own fundraising. Thus, while the $100,000 award will directly go to Common Threads, we will utilize these funds to provide our programming to our partner schools for free.\r\n\r\nOur Los Angeles Program Manager will work directly with school administration to incorporate as many components of our programming as possible in both in- and out-of-school settings, and schools will provide kitchen space for our afterschool programs at no cost. Additionally, thanks to approval from LAUSD this past April, we are able to award salary point (Professional Development) credit to teachers who participate in Common Threads’ Healthy Teacher Training program; this school year, we except up to 320 teachers to complete the Training and thus receive salary point credit.\r\n\r\nOur confirmed 2015-2016 school year partners are as follows: Aspire Titan Academy, Glenfeliz Boulevard Elementary School, Hollenbeck Middle School, John Adams Middle School, KIPP Comienza Community Prep, KIPP Sol Academy, Pacoima Charter School, Para Los Niños, and Sunrise Elementary."

Boards include a National Board of Directors and local Advisory Boards and\r\nAssociate Boards in our markets, including an Associate Board in Los Angeles. All board members assist in the cultivation of productive partner relationships; however, it is our Associate Board whose primary role is to fundraise, particularly through events. Additionally, we cultivate productive partner relationships with individuals, foundations, corporations, culinary communities and, especially, schools, parents and children; and hire staff (and volunteers) with skills and expertise in nutrition, cooking, education, fundraising and nonprofit management."

  - name: How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "In Los Angeles, we will continue to scale our programming and grow our reach by: 1) increasing uptake of our Small Bites nutrition education program among our partner schools; 2) continuing to prove out our new model of implementing Small Bites in partnership with out-of-school time program providers and district-led, in- and after-school initiatives; and 3) deepening our engagement within each partner school. Small Bites is an effective but lower-cost program, with the added benefits of being aligned to Common Core and Next Generation Science Standards and being flexible enough to leverage as part of partnerships with other organizations; thus, by expanding Small Bites, we will reach more kids and families in an efficient, sustainable, and impactful way.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this past year, we developed a game-based nutrition education app, CommonBytes, which we believe has the potential to supplement our current programs, increasing their impact in the short term, and to bring relevant nutrition learning to additional kids in the long term. The CommonBytes app includes interactive games designed for students grades 3-8 to use with classroom teachers in school – including as a supplement to our Small Bites program - or at home. Participants follow recipes from the garden to the grocery store to the kitchen, and, finally, to a table. The CommonBytes platform will consist of 10-15 games – with easy, medium, and hard levels - that incorporate gardening, healthy shopping, healthy cooking techniques, and table etiquette as well as over 25 recipes, organized by Snacks, Meals, Beverages, and Treats. Incentive points and badges that further the nutritional experience (e.g., personal secrets and recipes from celebrity chefs) will be awarded as various milestones and goals are reached. Parents and teachers will also be able to access the app to track the progress of their child or student in completing the games; look up new recipes; or find cooking and nutrition resources.\r\n\r\nThis fall, we are piloting CommonBytes in the Miami-Dade County Public Schools, with a national pilot –including in Los Angeles – planned for 2016. Overall, during the 2015-16 school year, we expect up to 5,000 kids to receive cooking and nutrition education through CommonBytes. "
