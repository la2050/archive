title: Common Threads’ Healthy Cooking and Nutrition Education for Kids and Families
project_summary: >-
  We are seeking $100,000 in support of our hands-on, in- and out-of-school
  healthy cooking and nutrition education for underserved kids, their families,
  and their teachers. Our programs bring healthy food to children in need, while
  also teaching them how to prepare nutritious, affordable meals and snacks on
  their own. During the 2015-2016 school year, we will partner with 15 Los
  Angeles schools to implement our proven programming, thereby reaching a total
  of 3,649 individuals.

Where will you be working?:
  - County of Los Angeles
  - LAUSD
How do you plan to use these resources to make change?:
  - Engage residents and stakeholders
  - Expand a pilot or a program
How will your proposal improve the following “Live” metrics?:
  - Access to healthy food
  - Obesity rates
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "We evaluate our programs through annual internal pre- and post-surveys of student and parent participants. In addition to measuring the impact of our programs on participants’ nutrition and cooking knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors, these surveys also capture data on dose delivered and received, fidelity, and context. Due to the large numbers of students participating in our programming across the country, we randomly chose schools to participate in our school year 2015-16 survey to achieve a national sample of 750 Small Bite student participants and 750 chef-led program participants. Previous experience shows that this number is adequately powered to detect the effect of our programming. At the end of each school year, we analyze the survey data, matching pre- and post-surveys to determine net change.\r\n\r\nTeachers also complete surveys after completing our Healthy Teacher Training and are able to provide feedback on and suggestions for the training."
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
  - Money (financial capital)
  - Volunteers/staff (human capital)
  - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
