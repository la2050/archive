title: Social Justice Resilience and Community Building
project_summary: >-
  We work with local social justice organizations to implement Council Practice.
  To serve the needs of the populations they serve, these organizations must
  develop their capacity to listen deeply and compassionately so as to
  understand both the context and history of the underlying issues. The practice
  of deep listening without judgment fosters an atmosphere of respect for one’s
  self and others, promotes empathy, understanding and cooperation.

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "A critical challenge for social justice organizations as they advocate for positive social change is to listen deeply to the communities in which they work. These organizations are mission-driven to voice the needs of the populations they serve and, therefore, staff must develop a capacity to listen deeply to understand both the context and history of the underlying issues embedded within these populations and the history that lives in the stories of individual community members and their families. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the opportunity to hear the voice of the population they serve, when a staff participates in Council, an opportunity emerges for employees and peers to develop greater rapport, trust and a deeper sense of community. Integrating Council practice creates a healthier and more nurturing workplace, which fosters greater cooperation, motivation and creativity that then supports innovation, increased productivity and better decision-making. Inviting deep listening and giving permission to speak authentically, allows employees to trust that they will not be judged or shut down for speaking heartfully in Council. Thus, the workplace becomes a rich environment for greater individual self-expression, group affirmation and collegial bonding, becoming an effective antidote to burnout.\r\nCouncil may be understood to be the embodiment of compassion in community.  Groups and organizations that incorporate this practice of collective mindfulness, awareness of self and surroundings, regulation and cultivation of healthy communication and behavior create environments of care, compassion, and community wellness.  The indigenous wisdom traditions from which this work has emerged have known about the great benefits of ceremony and ritual and have gathered around the fire for countless generations to share stories, norm shared values and celebrate commonalities. Agencies and organizations, schools, prisons, communities and families can use the skills taught by Center for Council to create greater community wellness, which will be evidenced in significant positive shifts in personal health (lower stress, less stress-related disease, greater attention), group health (better communication, more empathy, deeper cooperation) and community health (more pro-social, compassion-centered engagement).  These health outcomes are consistently observed and increasingly measured in program evaluation of our work."

    - Adults getting sufficient social & emotional support
  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    We view our work as paradigm-shifting, as we foster programs that increase
    compassion and support healthier individuals, communities and work places. 
    As our work is about a shift in culture toward a more heart-centered,
    compassion-based focus and we continue to find vestiges of dysfunctional
    systems in attitudes and behaviors that do not embrace self-care or an
    empathic orientation.  Law enforcement, heath-care and corrections are slow
    to embrace the importance of these practices that deepen and bolster
    community wellness.  And the more careful we are with language and messaging
    that invite these segments to experience the power of the work, making it
    accessible to everyone, the more openings we find.  Organizationally, as we
    look to scale our programs, our biggest obstacle is our ability to respond
    to the great need for programming with adequate resources.  Our core
    operational support must continue to deepen and we need adequate resources
    to expand our training team.
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    We will employ an internal evaluation methodology for this program, which we
    developed in partnership with RAND Corp and which will include
    administration of pre and post surveys, anonymous feedback forms, and
    anecdotal and narrative self-¬report accounts of the project’s impacts.  We
    will evaluate: perceptions of authentic interpersonal connection,
    self-reported feelings of support and recognition versus isolation within
    staff groups, organizational resilience in instances of change or hardship,
    participants’ understanding of the council form and process, impact of the
    council process on organizational function and client interactions,
    organizational readiness for the project, degree to which the organization’s
    specific stated objectives were met, overall effectiveness of council
    trainers, including cultural sensitivity and self-awareness, whether
    appropriate referrals were available and known to participants, and
    retention and engagement of council trained staff. 
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    We are not aware of other organizations doing similar work.  Center for
    Council has integrated the practice of council into its very fabric, the
    organization grew out of over 15 years as a program initiative of The Ojai
    Foundation, where council was developed and codified.  Center for Council is
    the only organization authorized to train and certify practitioners of
    council and has become the leading provider of council training for
    community-based organizations, council-based rehabilitative services in
    prisons and council-based wellness/resiliency training for correctional
    officers in the state of California.
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    While we are not directly partnering with collaborators in this grant
    request, our programs and services are designed to provide council-based
    training and support to dozens of local non-profit and community-based
    organizations.  In a prior iteration of this project, we provided services
    to: HOMEBOY INDUSTRIES, LA GAY & LESBIAN CENTER, MIXTECO/INDIGENA COMMUNITY
    ORGANIZING PROJECT, WINTER (WOMEN IN NON-TRADITIONAL EMPLOYMENT ROLES), SAJE
    (STRATEGIC ACTION FOR A JUST ECONOMY), PEACE OVER VIOLENCE, YOUTH MENTORING
    CONNECTION, CONTRA-TIEMPO, Santa Monica, SAN GABRIEL VALLEY CONSERVATION
    CORPS., FLINTRIDGE CENTER/ “SUSTAINABLE PASADENA PROJECT”, PUBLIC
    WORKS/LEARNING WORKS, JUST COMMUNITIES and other organizations.  We are
    currently receiving requests for program support and training from an
    equally robust group of over two dozen local organizations hoping to learn
    and implement council practice into their organizational cultures and we
    hope to extend this network even further
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    Initial costs to work with 13 organizations is $166,750 which has been
    funded by a private foundation.  However, 26 worthy organizations applied,
    and based on the amount of funding received we can work with additional
    organizations.  
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Program Development\t$11,875\r\nOrganizational Outreach, Application and Review Process $8,550\r\nProgram Implementation at Social Justice Orgs $64,350\r\nOnsite support following training  $50,775\r\nNetworking event for social justice organizations  $7,200\r\nEvaluation $2,250\r\nAdmin Support/Overhead $21,750\r\nFor 13 Organizations  $166,750\r\nPer Organization\t\t$12,827\r\n"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    We have more opportunities and organizations requesting that we work with
    them than we can manage due to our training base.  Additional funding will
    allow us to train additional trainers to meet the demand for our work.
