project_summary: >-
  We work with local social justice organizations to implement Council Practice.
  To serve the needs of the populations they serve, these organizations must
  develop their capacity to listen deeply and compassionately so as to
  understand both the context and history of the underlying issues. The practice
  of deep listening without judgment fosters an atmosphere of respect for one’s
  self and others, promotes empathy, understanding and cooperation.
