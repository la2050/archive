  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: "We value artistic vision and the way artists engage with the world. At this critical time when support for the arts is decreasing and the interest in art is increasing, EWLA builds alliances across disciplines and industries to create a strong support system for LA based artists and arts organizations. \r\n\r\nLA is home to one of the largest concentrations of artists in the nation, many who urgently need specific resources to help them create and build sustainable careers. LA is also home to a growing community of art lovers and businesses with resources, such as professional services, equipment and materials, which are useful to artists. \r\n\r\nEWLA catalyzes art through the following plan:\r\n\r\nRESEARCH: We will identify a minimum of 50 professional artists and 50 resource providers to be featured at our temporary space, with a larger group presented online. Participants include contemporary artists working in all media, who exhibit or perform in galleries and museums. Resource providers include individuals and businesses with a wide range of resources. EWLA recognizes the diversity of LA County and will include minorities, as well as ethnically and economically diverse participants. \r\n\r\nOUTREACH: We will reach out to artists, resource providers and the art interested public through information sessions at local art and community centers, as well as through newsletters and social media.  \r\n\r\nEVENTS: EWLA will host a series of in-person exchange events at our temporary space in LA’s Downtown Arts District. EWLA features a curated exhibition of art and resources, focused on the process of art making. An emcee led exchange event will initiate live exchanges and focused discussions. Demonstrations by artists and resource providers add an educational component, with topics such as recycling in art and interdisciplinary collaborations. \r\n\r\nWEBSITE: EW’s collaborative platform allows artists to post their artwork and resource providers to post resources available for exchange. We will streamline online and offline efforts to make exchanges more common and convenient. Participants can register, sign up for alerts, create posts, contact others and book EW Art + Public offers. A feedback system will help foster trust among participants.  \r\n\r\nREVENUE: Posting and contacting others on the website is free. Revenue will be generated through additional premium services, commissions on EW Art + Public bookings and sponsorship opportunities for LA businesses."

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "Major challenges include building trust among participants and match making between artists and resource providers. \r\n\r\nEWLA brings people together who most likely don’t know each other. We will initiate introductions between participants to help build relationships and facilitate fair exchanges. Participants will be encouraged to include social media links on their online profile pages to make connections and find friends or colleagues in common. We will also implement a participant-driven feedback feature that will foster trust and accountability among participants.\r\n\r\nEach exchange has a unique set of variables and finding the ideal match between artists and resource providers can be a challenge. We are developing an exchange survey and agreement to help establish more specific criteria for exchanges and a suggested protocol to streamline the exchange process. As the EWLA community grows and more art and resources become available, exchanging will become easier and more common.\r\n"
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "EWLA will be evaluated by how it meets the following goals and associated metrics:\r\n\r\n- Secure 5,000 registered participants and additional 15,000 website visitors across LA County in 2016, with exponential growth monthly. Site traffic, open / click through rates and number of social shares per post will be tracked through our website. \r\n\r\n- Attract 2,000 visitors to our events. EWLA events are free and coincide with gallery openings in the area. Registration for events will be tracked at the door and online.\r\n\r\n- Facilitate at least 100 exchanges in LA County in 2016. Participants change the status of their posts as they are completed and are encouraged to share stories about exchanges.  \r\n\r\n- Based on past EW feedback, exposure from EWLA may result in paid jobs and new clients for both artists and resource providers. We will request specific feedback regarding opportunities that result from EWLA.\r\n\r\n- Revenue from premium services, EW Art + Public and sponsorships are tracked on EW."
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "There are non-profit organizations in LA, such as reDiscover Center, Trade School Los Angeles, and community time banks, which are doing similar work, with a different focus. In addition, other arts organizations support contemporary artists in complementary ways. \r\n\r\nEWLA is unique because it provides a non-monetary option for individuals and businesses to support artists specifically through exchanges, which currently does not exist online. EWLA focuses on connecting professional visual artists to individuals and businesses to make creative and practical exchanges. An exchange through EW is a framework for mutually beneficial interactions and collaborations, revolving around art.  \r\n\r\nLA artists, like all artists, have a continuous need for resources. The people and businesses that have these resources enjoy supporting artists, while gaining access to valuable artwork. EWLA closes the gap between artists and the public and addresses the continuous need for artists to find resources to create their work in a more affordable, convenient and sustainable way.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, as a business in the growing creative economy, we can fund our business through revenue generated by our platform and additional capital. EWLA allows us to research and further develop our program here in LA, where we are based. It is a key part of the overall expansion of the ExchangeWorks platform both nationally and internationally. \r\n"
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "In the past, ExchangeWorks has worked with LA based non-profits, such as Clockshop, to secure some of the supplies for artists’ projects they produced. EW secured over 150 gallons of paint, from Home Depot, Do it Best Hardware, and PAR Paint Company, among other local stores that supported the creation of public artwork. \r\n\r\nAs part of EWLA, we will build strategic partnerships with LA arts organizations and venues to identify artists who need assistance, help solve production challenges through exchanges and cross promote our efforts. Partnerships with businesses will also be developed, to provide a way for excess inventory and equipment to be offered through an ongoing exchange program. Available resources can be put to good use and save artists and organizations thousands of dollars. In exchanges for the resources, artwork or recognition at exhibitions and online may be offered. \r\n\r\nWe will discuss collaborations with government agencies to explore a recycling program that includes materials that are useful to artists. We will also build alliances with universities, such as UCLA, Otis College of Art and Design, The California Institute of the Arts, and Santa Monica College, to share information about EWLA with their staff and students and discuss potential resources from their facilities. \r\n\r\nWe are exploring partnerships with professional associations of architects, designers, technologists and others. EWLA partners and collaborators will receive acknowledgement on our website. We do not have plans to allocate funds to partners at this time. \r\n"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "As exchanges and collaborations are completed, we will encourage participants to share their success stories. As seen on our Successful Exchanges page of the website at http://www.exchangeworks.co/successfulexchanges and on social media outlets, the excitement around each exchange and the sharing of stories is the best impetus to growing our community and business.  \r\n\r\nArtists who want to engage with others offline can participate in EW Art + Public. EW Art + Public is a section of the ExchangeWorks website that fosters art appreciation, unique art experiences and supplemental income for artists. EW Art + Public connects artists offering classes, tours, workshops and other art related experiences to the public. \r\n\r\nWe provide the infrastructure for EW Art + Public and the artist can decide whether to charge a fee for their program or offer it for free. Attendees pay the fee through PayPal on ExchangeWorks. The artists receive the majority of the fee, with EW receiving a 13% commission per booking.\r\n\r\nExchangeWorks currently has a network of 7,000 artists, resource providers and others from all over the world. In 2016 our goal is to grow our community in LA to include an additional 5,000 registered participants and 15,000 website visitors.\r\n\r\nWe will explore the feasibility of hiring a permanent staff and securing a permanent space in Downtown LA to act as a warehouse to store resources, office and event space.\r\n\r\nBased on what we learn in Los Angeles, we will expand with similar focused programs in other major art capitals, such as NY, Chicago and Miami. This will also enable our participants in LA to have more opportunities to make exchanges with people from other cities. \r\n"
