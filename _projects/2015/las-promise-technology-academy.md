  - Implement a pilot or new project
How will your proposal improve the following “Learn” metrics?:
  - District-wide graduation rates
  - HS student proficiency in English & Language Arts and Math
  - Academic Performance Index* scores
  - >-
    Student education pipeline (an integrated network of pre-schools, K-12
    institutions, and higher education systems that prepares students for
    seamless transitions between high school, higher ed
Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: >-
  For more than a decade, the United States has trailed the international
  community in Math, Reading, and Science, producing a growing surplus of
  workers with limited skills and further hampering our nation’s ability to
  compete on a global stage. According to the National Math + Science Initiative
  more than 46.8 million new jobs will be created by 2018, of which one million
  STEM graduates will be needed to meet demand. Additionally, STEM-based careers
  are expected to outpace traditional job growth and increase by 17 percent over
  the next decade. However, a 2010 report released by the United States Census
  Bureau illustrates the widening achievement gap for minorities, with only 19
  percent of African Americans and 14 percent of Hispanics aged 25-29 having
  earned a Bachelor’s degree. Our organization will address this disparity and
  introduce young men and women to STEM though the creation of the LA’s Promise
  Technology Academy at John Muir Middle School, Manual Arts Senior High School,
  and West Adams Preparatory High School. We will expose a combined 90 students
  (40 per school) to STEM-related after school activities. All LA’s Promise
  Technology Academy participants will attend coding and app development
  classes, lectures from guest speakers, and/or field trips organized in
  partnership with Televisa, Univision, Fox Studios, Direct TV, Google, and
  others. Participants will chronicle their experience through a dedicated blog,
  video journals, and on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and
  Instagram. In addition, participating students will be provided with Math and
  Science tutoring to ensure they excel in the classroom. Use of a digital badge
  platform such as Mozilla’s Open Badges will track the progress of students and
  unlock achievements as skills are mastered within each respective curriculum.
  Activities will be scheduled after school throughout the upcoming 2016-2017
  academic school year.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Students from John Muir Middle School, Manual Arts Senior High School, and West Adams Preparatory High School will participate in the LA’s Promise Technology Academy as tracked through attendance logs. LA’s Promise will conduct a qualitative survey to gauge participating students interest in STEM at the start of the program and upon culmination. Baseline data will also be collected during the pilot year to demonstrate potential linkages between after school STEM programming and student academic performance in Math and Science subject areas as well as increases to daily attendance, high school graduation rate, and college enrollment. Intended measurable outcomes include:\r\n\r\n1. Expose more than 90 students to STEM-related careers.\r\n2. More than 75% of participating students will increase their interest in STEM and the pursuit of a related career as measured through surveys.\r\n3. Track participating students attendance rate and grade point average in Math and Science subject areas."
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
  - Money (financial capital)
  - Volunteers/staff (human capital)
  - Education/training
  - 'Technical infrastructure (computers, etc.)'
  - Network/relationship support
  - Quality improvement research
