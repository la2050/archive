'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  For more than a decade, the United States has trailed the international
  community in Math, Reading, and Science, producing a growing surplus of
  workers with limited skills and further hampering our nation’s ability to
  compete on a global stage. According to the National Math + Science Initiative
  more than 46.8 million new jobs will be created by 2018, of which one million
  STEM graduates will be needed to meet demand. Additionally, STEM-based careers
  are expected to outpace traditional job growth and increase by 17 percent over
  the next decade. However, a 2010 report released by the United States Census
  Bureau illustrates the widening achievement gap for minorities, with only 19
  percent of African Americans and 14 percent of Hispanics aged 25-29 having
  earned a Bachelor’s degree. Our organization will address this disparity and
  introduce young men and women to STEM though the creation of the LA’s Promise
  Technology Academy at John Muir Middle School, Manual Arts Senior High School,
  and West Adams Preparatory High School. We will expose a combined 90 students
  (40 per school) to STEM-related after school activities. All LA’s Promise
  Technology Academy participants will attend coding and app development
  classes, lectures from guest speakers, and/or field trips organized in
  partnership with Televisa, Univision, Fox Studios, Direct TV, Google, and
  others. Participants will chronicle their experience through a dedicated blog,
  video journals, and on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and
  Instagram. In addition, participating students will be provided with Math and
  Science tutoring to ensure they excel in the classroom. Use of a digital badge
  platform such as Mozilla’s Open Badges will track the progress of students and
  unlock achievements as skills are mastered within each respective curriculum.
  Activities will be scheduled after school throughout the upcoming 2016-2017
  academic school year.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  The primary obstacle facing our proposed LA’s Promise Technology Academy is
  the need to develop a comprehensive curriculum that caters to both incoming
  and returning students. This will be addressed by establishing an introductory
  curriculum that exposes students to basic coding and app development.
  Subsequent years will advance the curriculum by incorporating a greater
  variety of STEM related activities in subject areas such as Video Game Design,
  Computer Animation, and Robotics. In addition, a committee comprised of
  parents, teachers, and students will be established to review program elements
  and propose necessary changes.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Students from John Muir Middle School, Manual Arts Senior High School, and
  West Adams Preparatory High School will participate in the LA’s Promise
  Technology Academy as tracked through attendance logs. LA’s Promise will
  conduct a qualitative survey to gauge participating students interest in STEM
  at the start of the program and upon culmination. Baseline data will also be
  collected during the pilot year to demonstrate potential linkages between
  after school STEM programming and student academic performance in Math and
  Science subject areas as well as increases to daily attendance, high school
  graduation rate, and college enrollment. Intended measurable outcomes include:
   
   1. Expose more than 90 students to STEM-related careers.
   2. More than 75% of participating students will increase their interest in STEM and the pursuit of a related career as measured through surveys.
   3. Track participating students attendance rate and grade point average in Math and Science subject areas.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Other organizations such as Girls Who Code and Teens Exploring Technology
  expose low-income students to STEM activities. However, our MOU through the
  Los Angeles Unified School District provides us with direct access to teachers
  and faculty from each school site, which helps promote collaboration and
  greater learning in and outside of the classroom. The LA’s Promise Technology
  Academy also goes to greater lengths to inspire students to pursue STEM
  related careers through immersive onsite exposure and mentorship
  opportunities. In addition, parent engagement remains a focus of our strategic
  approach and will allow us to open a dialogue with families about the overall
  impact of our proposed LA’s Promise Technology Academy.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': N/A
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  The Proposed LA’s Promise Technology Academy will cost approximately $150,000
  to implement during its pilot year. LA's Promise is always actively seeking
  funding and in-kind donations from foundations and corporate entities as well
  as cultivating partnerships with other local non-profit organizations to
  provide resources and support for specific unmet needs.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
  A full-time coordinator will be hired to manage all aspects of our proposed
  LA’s Promise Technology Academy. In addition, funding will be used towards the
  purchase of Google Chromebooks for coding and app development, Copernicus Tech
  Tubs for storage and transport, development of the program curriculum,
  background checks for guest speakers/volunteers, and buses rentals for field
  trips.
   
   LA’s Promise Technology Academy Coordinator (1 FTE) - $65,450 (Taxes & Benefits)
   
   LA’s Promise Technology Academy Curriculum - $14,204
   
   Google Chromebooks – $13,200 ($440 x 30 Laptops)
   
   Bus Rentals - $6,750 ($450 Per Bus x 3 School Sites x 5 Field Trips)
   
   Copernicus Tech Tub – $395.94 ($65.99 x 6 Storage Units)
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  The LA’s Promise Technology Academy has the potential to expand in the
  following areas:
   
   School-Wide – Grow programing elements to include all students at each school site.
   
   Diversification of Content – Offer a greater variety of STEM activities in subject areas such as Video Game Design, Computer Animation, and Robotics.
   
   Multiyear/Multilevel Programing – Create an advanced curriculum for returning participants and to serve more students.
   
   Off-Site Expansion – Expand program to other schools within the Los Angeles Unified School District.
