    For more than a decade, the United States has trailed the international
    community in Math, Reading, and Science, producing a growing surplus of
    workers with limited skills and further hampering our nation’s ability to
    compete on a global stage. According to the National Math + Science
    Initiative more than 46.8 million new jobs will be created by 2018, of which
    one million STEM graduates will be needed to meet demand. Additionally,
    STEM-based careers are expected to outpace traditional job growth and
    increase by 17 percent over the next decade. However, a 2010 report released
    by the United States Census Bureau illustrates the widening achievement gap
    for minorities, with only 19 percent of African Americans and 14 percent of
    Hispanics aged 25-29 having earned a Bachelor’s degree. Our organization
    will address this disparity and introduce young men and women to STEM though
    the creation of the LA’s Promise Technology Academy at John Muir Middle
    School, Manual Arts Senior High School, and West Adams Preparatory High
    School. We will expose a combined 90 students (40 per school) to
    STEM-related after school activities. All LA’s Promise Technology Academy
    participants will attend coding and app development classes, lectures from
    guest speakers, and/or field trips organized in partnership with Televisa,
    Univision, Fox Studios, Direct TV, Google, and others. Participants will
    chronicle their experience through a dedicated blog, video journals, and on
    social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. In
    addition, participating students will be provided with Math and Science
    tutoring to ensure they excel in the classroom. Use of a digital badge
    platform such as Mozilla’s Open Badges will track the progress of students
    and unlock achievements as skills are mastered within each respective
    curriculum. Activities will be scheduled after school throughout the
    upcoming 2016-2017 academic school year.

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    The primary obstacle facing our proposed LA’s Promise Technology Academy is
    the need to develop a comprehensive curriculum that caters to both incoming
    and returning students. This will be addressed by establishing an
    introductory curriculum that exposes students to basic coding and app
    development. Subsequent years will advance the curriculum by incorporating a
    greater variety of STEM related activities in subject areas such as Video
    Game Design, Computer Animation, and Robotics. In addition, a committee
    comprised of parents, teachers, and students will be established to review
    program elements and propose necessary changes.
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Students from John Muir Middle School, Manual Arts Senior High School, and West Adams Preparatory High School will participate in the LA’s Promise Technology Academy as tracked through attendance logs. LA’s Promise will conduct a qualitative survey to gauge participating students interest in STEM at the start of the program and upon culmination. Baseline data will also be collected during the pilot year to demonstrate potential linkages between after school STEM programming and student academic performance in Math and Science subject areas as well as increases to daily attendance, high school graduation rate, and college enrollment. Intended measurable outcomes include:\r\n\r\n1. Expose more than 90 students to STEM-related careers.\r\n2. More than 75% of participating students will increase their interest in STEM and the pursuit of a related career as measured through surveys.\r\n3. Track participating students attendance rate and grade point average in Math and Science subject areas."
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    Other organizations such as Girls Who Code and Teens Exploring Technology
    expose low-income students to STEM activities. However, our MOU through the
    Los Angeles Unified School District provides us with direct access to
    teachers and faculty from each school site, which helps promote
    collaboration and greater learning in and outside of the classroom. The LA’s
    Promise Technology Academy also goes to greater lengths to inspire students
    to pursue STEM related careers through immersive onsite exposure and
    mentorship opportunities. In addition, parent engagement remains a focus of
    our strategic approach and will allow us to open a dialogue with families
    about the overall impact of our proposed LA’s Promise Technology Academy.

  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    The Proposed LA’s Promise Technology Academy will cost approximately
    $150,000 to implement during its pilot year. LA's Promise is always actively
    seeking funding and in-kind donations from foundations and corporate
    entities as well as cultivating partnerships with other local non-profit
    organizations to provide resources and support for specific unmet needs.
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "A full-time coordinator will be hired to manage all aspects of our proposed LA’s Promise Technology Academy. In addition, funding will be used towards the purchase of Google Chromebooks for coding and app development, Copernicus Tech Tubs for storage and transport, development of the program curriculum, background checks for guest speakers/volunteers, and buses rentals for field trips.\r\n\r\nLA’s Promise Technology Academy Coordinator (1 FTE) - $65,450 (Taxes & Benefits)\r\n\r\nLA’s Promise Technology Academy Curriculum - $14,204\r\n\r\nGoogle Chromebooks – $13,200 ($440 x 30 Laptops)\r\n\r\nBus Rentals - $6,750 ($450 Per Bus x 3 School Sites x 5 Field Trips)\r\n\r\nCopernicus Tech Tub –  $395.94 ($65.99 x 6 Storage Units)"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "The LA’s Promise Technology Academy has the potential to expand in the following areas:\r\n\r\nSchool-Wide – Grow programing elements to include all students at each school site.\r\n\r\nDiversification of Content – Offer a greater variety of STEM activities in subject areas such as Video Game Design, Computer Animation, and Robotics.\r\n\r\nMultiyear/Multilevel Programing – Create an advanced curriculum for returning participants and to serve more students.\r\n\r\nOff-Site Expansion – Expand program to other schools within the Los Angeles Unified School District."

      For more than a decade, the United States has trailed the international
      community in Math, Reading, and Science, producing a growing surplus of
      workers with limited skills and further hampering our nation’s ability to
      compete on a global stage. According to the National Math + Science
      Initiative more than 46.8 million new jobs will be created by 2018, of
      which one million STEM graduates will be needed to meet demand.
      Additionally, STEM-based careers are expected to outpace traditional job
      growth and increase by 17 percent over the next decade. However, a 2010
      report released by the United States Census Bureau illustrates the
      widening achievement gap for minorities, with only 19 percent of African
      Americans and 14 percent of Hispanics aged 25-29 having earned a
      Bachelor’s degree. Our organization will address this disparity and
      introduce young men and women to STEM though the creation of the LA’s
      Promise Technology Academy at John Muir Middle School, Manual Arts Senior
      High School, and West Adams Preparatory High School. We will expose a
      combined 90 students (40 per school) to STEM-related after school
      activities. All LA’s Promise Technology Academy participants will attend
      coding and app development classes, lectures from guest speakers, and/or
      field trips organized in partnership with Televisa, Univision, Fox
      Studios, Direct TV, Google, and others. Participants will chronicle their
      experience through a dedicated blog, video journals, and on social media
      platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. In addition,
      participating students will be provided with Math and Science tutoring to
      ensure they excel in the classroom. Use of a digital badge platform such
      as Mozilla’s Open Badges will track the progress of students and unlock
      achievements as skills are mastered within each respective curriculum.
      Activities will be scheduled after school throughout the upcoming
      2016-2017 academic school year.

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      The primary obstacle facing our proposed LA’s Promise Technology Academy
      is the need to develop a comprehensive curriculum that caters to both
      incoming and returning students. This will be addressed by establishing an
      introductory curriculum that exposes students to basic coding and app
      development. Subsequent years will advance the curriculum by incorporating
      a greater variety of STEM related activities in subject areas such as
      Video Game Design, Computer Animation, and Robotics. In addition, a
      committee comprised of parents, teachers, and students will be established
      to review program elements and propose necessary changes.

    answer: "Students from John Muir Middle School, Manual Arts Senior High School, and West Adams Preparatory High School will participate in the LA’s Promise Technology Academy as tracked through attendance logs. LA’s Promise will conduct a qualitative survey to gauge participating students interest in STEM at the start of the program and upon culmination. Baseline data will also be collected during the pilot year to demonstrate potential linkages between after school STEM programming and student academic performance in Math and Science subject areas as well as increases to daily attendance, high school graduation rate, and college enrollment. Intended measurable outcomes include:\r\n\r\n1. Expose more than 90 students to STEM-related careers.\r\n2. More than 75% of participating students will increase their interest in STEM and the pursuit of a related career as measured through surveys.\r\n3. Track participating students attendance rate and grade point average in Math and Science subject areas."

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      Other organizations such as Girls Who Code and Teens Exploring Technology
      expose low-income students to STEM activities. However, our MOU through
      the Los Angeles Unified School District provides us with direct access to
      teachers and faculty from each school site, which helps promote
      collaboration and greater learning in and outside of the classroom. The
      LA’s Promise Technology Academy also goes to greater lengths to inspire
      students to pursue STEM related careers through immersive onsite exposure
      and mentorship opportunities. In addition, parent engagement remains a
      focus of our strategic approach and will allow us to open a dialogue with
      families about the overall impact of our proposed LA’s Promise Technology
      Academy.
