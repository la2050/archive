  Through LA2050, APCH will help beautify our South Los Angeles neighborhood,
  improve fitness and wellbeing, expand opportunities for education, and
  encourage broader horizons and a sense of community by engaging all residents,
  young and old. APCH believes that your zip code should not define your future;
  through our innovative, wrap-around services we will provide thousands of
  children and families in the 90011 area with safe spaces to play and thrive.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  From its humble beginnings over 22 years ago, APCH has evolved from an
  afterschool drop-in program in the basement of a church to a community center
  representing 25,000 square feet, including an athletic field, commercial
  kitchen, garden and dance studio. We serve an annual average of 900 boys and
  girls from more than 100 elementary, middle and high schools in South Los
  Angeles.
   
   At APCH we believe that zip code should not determine a child’s future, so we offer a comprehensive array of free programs spanning academics, athletics, the arts, and more with the goal of enriching our members’ lives and helping them become excited to learn and grow. We propose to:
   
   Create Opportunities to Play - Our South Central neighborhood currently lacks safe places for children to play. Through our totally free programming and open membership process we create healthy avenues for activity and joy. We plan to expand the South Central Sports League, which we founded and currently facilitate. This League provides an opportunity for hundreds of youth from APCH and partner organizations to play competitive sports in a supportive environment completely free of charge. We also offer 125 enriching field trips throughout the year, including sailing camp, horseback riding, sporting events, and more.
   
   Expand Safe Places to Play- An important part of encouraging play and community is providing safe spaces for local residents to gather. APCH has already built two community gardens, in addition to our on-site garden, and will continue to expand by building a new, even larger garden over the coming year. Our vision is for a “Green Corridor” linking APCH, the Newton Division Police Station, and Jefferson High School. We will also increase the number of community clean ups we coordinate throughout the year (currently averaging six per year), helping to create a physically pleasing neighborhood that will inspire pride and active ownership. 
   
   Engage the Community in Change- For our plans to be successful, all community members must be aware of, equipped for, and able to participate in the opportunities available. By building on our existing relationships, APCH will generate awareness and participation in community change. This will be accomplished through parental education workshops held at APCH, regular stakeholder meetings, our annual community events including the Health & Garden Expo, and the distribution of nearly $1 million in groceries, toys, books, and more.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  A constant problem is the high demand for our services. APCH serves over 900
  unduplicated members per year and member retention has recently reached 90%. A
  high retention rate means that, by engaging youth semester after semester,
  year after year, we are able to have a deeper and more lasting impact. The
  downside to this is our ballooning wait-list; we currently have a waiting list
  of over 550 youth which translates to a 14 month wait period for most. 
   
   To address this challenge we have begun construction on a new Teen Center/Performing Arts Space, which will also be available upon request to other organizations in the community. We are also expanding our impact by taking leadership roles in multiple initiatives. From partnering with LAPD’s Newton division to plant gardens, to serving on the local Community-Police Advisory Board proving cultural awareness training, to driving Council District 9’s Great Streets initiative; APCH continues growing in our community.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We will monitor this proposal’s progress by tracking the number of community
  members taking advantage of our services and community spaces and through pre
  and post surveys given during the beginning and end of key projects and
  events. These surveys will gauge residents’ knowledge of local services and
  resources, satisfaction with our programs, as well as their perspectives on
  and involvement in the neighborhood. 
   
   All APCH youth members are also tracked through KidTrax, a performance measurement and participant management software designed specifically for youth-serving nonprofit organizations.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  While there are agencies throughout Los Angeles that offer services focused on
  helping high- and at-risk youth to avoid challenges and realize their
  potentials, few of those agencies are community-integrated and none we know of
  offers the wide variety of programs that are delivered at APCH. Once a young
  person becomes a member of APCH, and benefits from a few of our programs, that
  individual is much more likely to respond positively to the additional
  exceptional opportunities APCH offers to create a brighter future. Because the
  age range we serve starts as young as eight, our programs have time to nourish
  and cultivate an individual through elementary, middle and high school and on
  to college. Through our partnership with the parents at APCH, we can work with
  a family to ensure they take full advantage of all of our programs and
  services, including free and comprehensive mental health counseling services.
  Through our holistic approach, we can address challenges and identify
  strengths early on and follow through with each and every one of our members
  as they progress. Our work has been recognized by organizations such as
  Charity Navigator; we have just received our 4th consecutive 4 star rating,
  which only 8% of organizations accomplish, and are the only 4 star rated
  afterschool program in South LA. 
   
   Our proposed approach is to make the high quality, free services available to APCH members available to more community residents. By engaging residents, creating public venues and increasing opportunities for play, APCH will transform South Central into a thriving community for all residents to enjoy.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  A Place Called Home will be the sole executing agent, in charge of
  facilitating all programs and events, but will provide benefits to other
  community organizations by collaboration. For example, all partner
  organizations in the South Central Sports League will benefit as APCH staff
  currently administer the league.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  We project an expected cost of $458,171.04. Additional costs will be covered
  by program specific and general operating funds. 
   
   APCH is in good fiscal health, including a 2-month Board-mandated operating reserve and an endowment, and maintains a strong cash flow, allowing us to accommodate any additional costs or unforeseen expenses. Each year we design and implement a strategic fundraising plan to ensure that all programmatic and organizational operations are sustained. Strategies for sustainability include growing the Board of Directors; executing a Capital Campaign to improve and expand our space; developing multi-year organizational budget projections; developing and executing a comprehensive Annual Giving plan; and developing and launching a communications strategy that supports our goals.
   
   When and if program-specific funds present a shortfall, APCH is able to draw from general operating funds raised through three annual fundraisers: our Gala for the Children; the GirlPower Awards Luncheon; and Stars & Strikes. We can also acquire additional unrestricted funds through our Annual Appeals and Newsletter, as well as from foundation, corporations, and major individual donors. 
   
   APCH’s strength in raising unrestricted funds in no way indicate a lack of need, rather it speaks to the growth of the agency as a whole, and the commitment to providing continually evolving services in areas that are traditionally harder to fund with restricted donations. Our budget and operation have grown over the past five years in direct response to the increasing demand for APCH’s programs and services.

How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  To expand our services and meet increasing community demand, we are currently
  undertaking a capital expansion plan to build a Teen Center and Gallery and
  Performing Arts Space, addressing APCH's highest priority needs and allow us
  to provide additional services for the South Los Angeles community. Our Teen
  Program has grown significantly over the past several years; three years ago
  the average daily attendance was 35 members and today this has doubled to 80
  members on average each day. During that time we have added four new staff who
  work with the teens, but the program is being run out of the same 800 square
  foot temporary bungalow the Teen Program has occupied for more than a decade.
  This space restriction has severely limited the program’s growth and
  membership. Enrollment in our general and teen membership is so high during
  the summer months that we are compelled to offer 3-4 field trips (ranging from
  12-100 in attendance) per day so that our facilities do not become dangerously
  overcrowded. The new space will also serve as a performing arts center made
  available by request to other organizations in the community. This will allow
  us to host plays, concerts, and other performances and promote greater access
  to the arts. 
   
   We also plan to scale our impact through community partnerships, most notably the creation of new community gardens throughout our neighborhood. Additionally, we are in the process of codifying the APCH approach. APCH would like to further codify and standardize the gathering and tracking of data to identify and apply appropriate metrics in assessing and documenting acquisition and development of academic skills and rigor, attitudinal change, social competency, career aptitude, self-efficacy, and preparedness for transition to next levels of education, vocation and independence.
