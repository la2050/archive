  Localism is developing a “trifecta” business accelerator, culinary
  accelerator, and tech makerspace called MADE. We create opportunity for
  innovative local entrepreneurs, and lower their risk threshold to help them
  grow. Our vision is to make these projects scalable, sustainable and
  repeatable for diverse communities.

  MADE is a project that promotes “local self-reliance,” as defined by the
  Institute for Local Self-Reliance. Our project aims to a) attract and keep
  talented people; b) use place to connect opportunity for all; and c) use place
  to accelerate civic engagement. MADE’s model advances independent
  entrepreneurs by 1) mitigating the early stage risks to starting a retail
  brand or opening a storefront; 2) mitigating common pitfalls and barriers by
  directing entrepreneurs through “pipelines” such as permitting and
  distribution channels; 3) attracting cross-marketing value to these businesses
  by utilizing technology and Metcalfe’s Law (the network effect); and 4)
  providing “hosted retail” so local business owners can focus their time and
  money on making their goods rather than renting space to sell their goods.
  Localism has also developed a technology and media platform to strategically
  provide these businesses with advantages typically reserved for major brands.
  The extent of this project is to develop a scalable, sustainable and
  repeatable model for diverse communities.
   
   Primary prototype participants are independent entrepreneurs who have a product, a business growth plan, and reflect the socioeconomic diversity of the locality of Long Beach. Secondary prototype participants are product makers who can scale through manufacture, merchants who plan to open storefronts, and artisans who can increase their value by elevating their craft and training apprentices.
   
   Currently MADE showcases products from over 100 local makers and merchants, distributes products to key destinations such as 
   Renaissance Hotel, Working Class Kitchen, and is working with the Long Beach Airport, and the CVB for further exposure of the MADE in Long Beach brand. In the first 10 months since opening at least 25 living wage jobs have been created, half of which are tech jobs. Several of these businesses are ready to expand beyond MADE and are actively looking for space to lease. Over 200 makers are on the waiting list to get their products in MADE, many of which are cottage foodmakers. MADE is seeking funding not just to expand facilities, but also to increase to capacity to foster the types of great businesses that reflect the unique character of Long Beach. In addition to our incubator services, we have hosted over 50 events, ranging from fashion and art shows to hackathons and maker expos. We also offer innovation-based STEM classes for children and adults.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: |-
  There are two obstacles we have identified. 
   
   1) Complex permitting processes for small businesses
   We have started the permitting process for MARKET so that we can have a Certified Farmer’s Market at least three times a week in our store, in addition to sales of cottage food products. This will allow us to provide affordable, freshly prepared foods to the community. We have also started research and a "permit pipeline" for this project, in partnership with the LB Health Department and LB Fresh.org.
   
   2) Engaging diverse communities
   We have partnered with the Arts Council for Long Beach and like organizations in order to activate community spaces and engage the community. MADE’s physical venue and organizational structure provide a nurturing hub for artists and other creatives, providing the support and structure with which to build sustainability and success.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Primary participant impact of our accelerator by evaluating the following
  basic factors: increased financial well-being of participants based on living
  wage income, and increased business revenue growth. The secondary, wider
  participant impact is measured in numbers: increased number of products
  produced and sold, increased participants able to lease retail space,
  increased participants able to distribute to additional locations, increased
  creation of jobs and hiring of local residents. In addition, we understand our
  broader responsibility to the local community. We utilize media campaigns to
  move people from Apathy to Awareness, but when we track behavior we don’t
  always see Awareness resulting in Action. Through our platform we offer
  incentives and tools that motivate people to move from Awareness to Action,
  with a change in their behavior to support their local community. Then some
  are inspired to Advocacy which completes the circle. The incentives allow us
  to track actionable data.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Our model is unique because it is comprehensive. Our approach is based on
  organizations who provide similar services such as The Hood and FabLab.
  However, because we target retail, food, tech and supply the tools necessary
  to develop products, we are able to offer a one-stop hub for making, dining
  and shopping. This will also allow us to increase locally made goods and
  therefore increase money that is reinvested into the community. We will be
  closing the gaps that chain establishments miss -- guaranteeing a living wage
  for their employees and sourcing labors and goods locally. Studies show that
  by purchasing locally, 3 times more money stays in the community than with
  chain purchases.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  We have already started engaging the community and are seeing results by
  developing projects in partnership with local BIDS, merchants, artisans,
  community organizations and residents. In particular, we are collaborating
  with the Arts Council for Long Beach, Long Beach Fresh, the Growing
  Experience, Slow Money SoCal, California Endowment/Building Healthy
  Communities, the Long Beach Health Department and the State of California
  Department of Public Health.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  To date we have raised $36,770 through a crowdfunding campaign. Overall, we
  are raising $500,000 through diverse revenue sources (please see our response
  to scaling), but the project can be completed within a $400,000 budget. Grants
  and loans are anticipated to offset funds required, with potential grant and
  loans totaling $150 - 250k, which leaves $250 - 350k as the investment
  opportunity for community stakeholders and investors.

How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: |-
  Culinary accelerator
   We are planning to build out a large industrial kitchen in the back 1/3 of the 12,500 sq ft space at MADE. It will be rented out to up and coming foodmakers for blocks of 4-8 hours at a time. A culinary accelerator is for food businesses that have plans to grow by packaging and distributing their unique products. Long Beach does not have a culinary accelerator, and currently many of our foodmakers have to leave Long Beach to develop their businesses. To be conservative in our projects we estimated 4 foodmakers renting our kitchen space at $30 an hour, but only for 18 hours a day. 
   
   Culinary goods
   The foodmakers who rent the kitchen will have the option to sell items at wholesale to MADE for retail sales. Only selected food prepared in the incubator kitchen will be packaged and sold at MADE, and some foodmakers will be using the kitchen for catering. Additionally several local and regional farms have partnered with MADE to offer fresh produce, eggs, honey from local fields, and regular grocery items such as artisan bread, pasta, spices, coffees, and 40+ local food brands. This math is based on 100 food sales a day at an average food sale price of $10. 
   
   Retail goods
   Retail goods encompass all the non-food items that are sold at MADE. There are currently products from over 100 local makers. This estimation is based on one main aspect: By increasing foot traffic with food there will be increased exposure of non-food re
   tail departments at MADE: furniture, home & garden, bath & body, artisan jewelry, books & music, hand-assembled bikes and biking accessories, lamps & candles, apparel, baby and children, greeting cards and more. As MADE matures it will resemble a local department store with a market space. These are based on 60 vendor/40 MADE consignment sales.
   
   Distribution
   Distribution is a volume play and a positioning play, with a focus on key destinations such as The Renaissance Long Beach, and fine local establishments such as Working Class Kitchen. 
   
   Because these models are based on amount of product and fees, they are scalable for the growth of clients that we receive. Moreover, we do make revenue by renting out facility space for events, for which we charge 50%.
