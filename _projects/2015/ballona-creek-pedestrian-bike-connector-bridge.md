title: Ballona Creek Pedestrian/Bike Connector Bridge
project_summary: >-
  THarchitecture in has identified a dire need to safely connect the communities
  of  Westchester, Inglewood, Playa Vista, Culver City, Mar Vista Marina Del Rey
  and Venice via pedestrian/bike friendly oriented paths, our proposal is to
  provide a Connector Pedestrian/Bike Bridge as a first step. The challenge:
  there is currently not a safe route that provides the residents of our
  community the ability to move north and south with existing Ballona Creek
  Bridges at Lincoln and Centinela.

  'In one sentence, please describe what your organization does': >-
    THarchitecture is a community minded Architecture firm seeking projects to
    provide a positive meaningful impact within our built environment in Los
    Angeles.  As Architects we can bring together Community Stakeholders,
    Governmental Agencies and NPOs.
  'In one to three sentences, please describe your proposal.': >-
    THarchitecture in has identified a dire need to safely connect the
    communities of  Westchester, Inglewood, Playa Vista, Culver City, Mar Vista
    Marina Del Rey and Venice via pedestrian/bike friendly oriented paths, our
    proposal is to provide a Connector Pedestrian/Bike Bridge as a first step.
    The challenge: there is currently not a safe route that provides the
    residents of our community the ability to move north and south with existing
    Ballona Creek Bridges at Lincoln and Centinela.  
  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "As indicated in the recent adoption of the Westside Mobility plan, there is a great need for alternative methods of transportation, a proposed Connector Ped/Bike Bridge is shown on the Westside Mobility Plan Map but not currently available.  We believe the best method for mobility within the Westside is by cycling, skateboarding, walking and running, this provides a long term solution to the traffic problem in Los Angeles.  LA has the ability to be just as bike friendly as our Euro neighbors or other West Coast City neighbors, however we need infrastructure to allow this to happen safely.  Awareness is growing through cycLAvia and there is a growing community of people who commute via bike, but a long term solution is needed for the Westside and this proposal facilitates the development of a vast network of bike/ped paths that connect north and south as well as east and west.  Currently a north south route does not exist on the west side across Ballona creek except for at the Beach path.  \r\n\r\nOur proposal will allow people, students, to move freely and commute safely.  Currently there is not a safe method for Venice High students who live in Westchester to cycle to school since there is not easy access or bike path across Ballona Creek.  Lincoln Blvd bridge is very dangerous and Centinela is equally as dangerous.  Our proposal will allow pedestrian connection for daily commuting and daily recreation through the Parks at Playa Vista across Ballona creek and along Beethoven to access Alla Park and Moore Park. The Connector bridge will also allow a connection through the bike path along Marina 90 into Marina Del rey and Venice.  Our proposal connects communities, allow for increase mobility with recreation, and facilitates future pedestrian oriented growth within the Westside and the surrounding LA area.\r\n  "
  How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
    - Money (financial capital)
    - Volunteers/staff (human capital)
    - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
    - Network/relationship support
  How do you plan to use these resources to make change?:
    - Engage residents and stakeholders
    - Implement a pilot or new project
    - 'We need the resources to set up community meetings and '
  Where will you be working?:
    - Westside
    - >-
      Ballona Creek between Play Vista, Mar Vista, Marina Del Rey and Culver
      City.
  How will your proposal improve the following “Connect” metrics?:
    - Median travel time to work
    - Attendance at cultural events
    - Attendance at public/open streets gatherings (Dream Metric)
    - Residential segregation (Dream Metric)
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    Work will be evaluated by completion of the bridge and the resultant of
    additional bike/pedestrian friendly and safe paths on the Westside.  We hope
    this project will catalyze future development of Bike/Pedestrian friendly
    paths.  This will provide increased access to Healthy life styles,
    recreation and mobility between communities.  We will provide increased
    access to the beach from communities that currently do not have safe
    access.  We also will provide access to new grocery stores being built in
    Playa Vista.  We suspect there is an Food Desert in the area we are working
    since there are so few grocery stores.  Providing access over Ballona Creek
    will only further alleviate these conditions and provide access for the
    community to healthy lifestyles.

Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  A major challenge is going to be acquisition of land for the ideal location,
  there are proposed locations that do not require acquisition of land. The
  First propose site is adjacent to Lincoln Blvd Bridge, Second Proposed Site is
  at Alla Road and Third is adjacent to the Marina 90 Fwy bridge on an abandoned
  CSX railway line. The best location includes a peninsula which could be used
  as an interpretive park and is on axis with Marina 90 Fwy, since it is an
  abandoned CSX railway line, it has existing bridge abutments which can be
  rehabilitated and used to support a new bike/pedestrian bridge. There is an
  opportunity to connect into Marvin Braude Bike path in Marina Del Rey if the
  bridge is oriented along the 90 Fwy on CSX railway. This also allows for a
  connection to Westchester and Inglewood through a future bike path along the
  Centinela Creek waterway. A new connection is proposed into Playa Vista Park
  and Westchester neighborhood through Loyola Marymount University.

Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  We propose teaming up with North East Trees a non-profit who has a critical
  role in the development of the Glendale River Narrows path development. They
  have done similar projects across the region and will provide invaluable
  experience to deliver the project.
   
   We propose teaming up with anyone who is interested in the project and who can allocate resources or people to further developing the project. The more support we can obtain from local organizations and community the higher chance of success the project will have.
   
   THarchitecture and North East Trees will work with the community to perform, community workshops, a feasibility study and initial design concepts for the Connector Bridge. We have previous experience with public works projects and also have consulting engineers who will help engineer the project and work with county engineers and local regulatory agencies to deliver a successful project.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  We have visited the site with North East Trees northeasttrees.org a non-profit
  organization who has a critical role in the development of the Glendale River
  Narrows path development and other bike/pedestrian friendly paths around LA
  and LA County. As an organization they see immense potential in the project
  and are interested in working with THarchitecture to make this project a
  reality. We propose a 50K for North East trees to dedicate one full time
  employee and 50K for THarchitecture to dedicate one full time employee to the
  project for the next two years, until the project has catalyzed enough for
  other methods of Grant funding/Private funding.
   
   We will work with other Ballona Creek organizations and Bicycle advocacy Groups:
   
   ballonafriends.org, ballonarenaissance.org, ballonawetlands.org, ballonarestoration.org, labike.org, CCbike.org (culver city cyclists). Bike LMU, SMspoke.org (santa monica cyclists)
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Success will be determined by the number of people who will use the Connector
  Ped/Bike bridge in the future once it is completed. We feel it is not a matter
  of "If" a bridge will be provided it is "When" and we hope this proposal will
  accelerate that time period. Providing a safe way to cross Ballona Creek will
  increase the amount of Pedestrian and Bike Traffic moving between communities.
  Safe routes which prevent accidents between pedestrians, bikes and cars and
  save lives will have success which cannot be scaled. The ability to safely
  bicycle our kids from Culver City, Mar Vista to Ballona Creek Wetlands
  Ecological Reserve and other Playa Vista parks will also be a measure of
  success.
