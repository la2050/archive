project_summary: >-
  THarchitecture in has identified a dire need to safely connect the communities
  of Westchester, Inglewood, Playa Vista, Culver City, Mar Vista Marina Del Rey
  and Venice via pedestrian/bike friendly oriented paths, our proposal is to
  provide a Connector Pedestrian/Bike Bridge as a first step. The challenge:
  there is currently not a safe route that provides the residents of our
  community the ability to move north and south with existing Ballona Creek
  Bridges at Lincoln and Centinela.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  As indicated in the recent adoption of the Westside Mobility plan, there is a
  great need for alternative methods of transportation, a proposed Connector
  Ped/Bike Bridge is shown on the Westside Mobility Plan Map but not currently
  available. We believe the best method for mobility within the Westside is by
  cycling, skateboarding, walking and running, this provides a long term
  solution to the traffic problem in Los Angeles. LA has the ability to be just
  as bike friendly as our Euro neighbors or other West Coast City neighbors,
  however we need infrastructure to allow this to happen safely. Awareness is
  growing through cycLAvia and there is a growing community of people who
  commute via bike, but a long term solution is needed for the Westside and this
  proposal facilitates the development of a vast network of bike/ped paths that
  connect north and south as well as east and west. Currently a north south
  route does not exist on the west side across Ballona creek except for at the
  Beach path. 
   
   Our proposal will allow people, students, to move freely and commute safely. Currently there is not a safe method for Venice High students who live in Westchester to cycle to school since there is not easy access or bike path across Ballona Creek. Lincoln Blvd bridge is very dangerous and Centinela is equally as dangerous. Our proposal will allow pedestrian connection for daily commuting and daily recreation through the Parks at Playa Vista across Ballona creek and along Beethoven to access Alla Park and Moore Park. The Connector bridge will also allow a connection through the bike path along Marina 90 into Marina Del rey and Venice. Our proposal connects communities, allow for increase mobility with recreation, and facilitates future pedestrian oriented growth within the Westside and the surrounding LA area.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  A major challenge is going to be acquisition of land for the ideal location,
  there are proposed locations that do not require acquisition of land. The
  First propose site is adjacent to Lincoln Blvd Bridge, Second Proposed Site is
  at Alla Road and Third is adjacent to the Marina 90 Fwy bridge on an abandoned
  CSX railway line. The best location includes a peninsula which could be used
  as an interpretive park and is on axis with Marina 90 Fwy, since it is an
  abandoned CSX railway line, it has existing bridge abutments which can be
  rehabilitated and used to support a new bike/pedestrian bridge. There is an
  opportunity to connect into Marvin Braude Bike path in Marina Del Rey if the
  bridge is oriented along the 90 Fwy on CSX railway. This also allows for a
  connection to Westchester and Inglewood through a future bike path along the
  Centinela Creek waterway. A new connection is proposed into Playa Vista Park
  and Westchester neighborhood through Loyola Marymount University.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Work will be evaluated by completion of the bridge and the resultant of
  additional bike/pedestrian friendly and safe paths on the Westside. We hope
  this project will catalyze future development of Bike/Pedestrian friendly
  paths. This will provide increased access to Healthy life styles, recreation
  and mobility between communities. We will provide increased access to the
  beach from communities that currently do not have safe access. We also will
  provide access to new grocery stores being built in Playa Vista. We suspect
  there is an Food Desert in the area we are working since there are so few
  grocery stores. Providing access over Ballona Creek will only further
  alleviate these conditions and provide access for the community to healthy
  lifestyles.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  We propose teaming up with North East Trees a non-profit who has a critical
  role in the development of the Glendale River Narrows path development. They
  have done similar projects across the region and will provide invaluable
  experience to deliver the project.
   
   We propose teaming up with anyone who is interested in the project and who can allocate resources or people to further developing the project. The more support we can obtain from local organizations and community the higher chance of success the project will have.
   
   THarchitecture and North East Trees will work with the community to perform, community workshops, a feasibility study and initial design concepts for the Connector Bridge. We have previous experience with public works projects and also have consulting engineers who will help engineer the project and work with county engineers and local regulatory agencies to deliver a successful project.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  We have visited the site with North East Trees northeasttrees.org a non-profit
  organization who has a critical role in the development of the Glendale River
  Narrows path development and other bike/pedestrian friendly paths around LA
  and LA County. As an organization they see immense potential in the project
  and are interested in working with THarchitecture to make this project a
  reality. We propose a 50K for North East trees to dedicate one full time
  employee and 50K for THarchitecture to dedicate one full time employee to the
  project for the next two years, until the project has catalyzed enough for
  other methods of Grant funding/Private funding.
   
   We will work with other Ballona Creek organizations and Bicycle advocacy Groups:
   
   ballonafriends.org, ballonarenaissance.org, ballonawetlands.org, ballonarestoration.org, labike.org, CCbike.org (culver city cyclists). Bike LMU, SMspoke.org (santa monica cyclists)
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 â€“ how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  Additional cost will be covered by applying for Grants for which the Connector
  Ped/Bike Brige is a prime candidate, such as Proposition 50- River Parkways
  Grant program, we will submit for this grant in 2016. We will need additional
  resources and funding to make this a successful grant application. 
   
   Other sources of Funding: 
    Los Angeles County - Proposition A Grant
   Caltrans - Dept. of Transportation - Environmental Enhancement and Mitigation program
   LACity Funding
   LACounty Funding
    
   We recognize there is a wealth of financial capital within the tech community in Playa Vista, Venice and Santa Monica (aka Silicon Beach) we believe there can be enormous financial support for this project from one or many of these major tech companies. We will need additional resources and funding to seek the support of these companies.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
  As the project is in the infant stage, we need organizers behind the project
  to garner community support, local governmental support and corporate support
  for the project. Funding and Resources will be required to run community
  workshops as well as research and identify funding sources. We feel this
  project could reach fruition and become a reality faster if there are people
  who are dedicated full time to the project. THarchitecture proposes to donate
  all partner and principal time to the project as much is financially possible,
  however we need capital to allocate resources to the project for a full time
  employee for the next two years. 
   
   We propose North East Trees will use a similar approach to the project and will need capital to dedicate a full time person to the project for the next two years. As they are busy with many other projects, we will need the additional funding to allow this project to be a priority, within their scope of projects.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Success will be determined by the number of people who will use the Connector
  Ped/Bike bridge in the future once it is completed. We feel it is not a matter
  of "If" a bridge will be provided it is "When" and we hope this proposal will
  accelerate that time period. Providing a safe way to cross Ballona Creek will
  increase the amount of Pedestrian and Bike Traffic moving between communities.
  Safe routes which prevent accidents between pedestrians, bikes and cars and
  save lives will have success which cannot be scaled. The ability to safely
  bicycle our kids from Culver City, Mar Vista to Ballona Creek Wetlands
  Ecological Reserve and other Playa Vista parks will also be a measure of
  success.
