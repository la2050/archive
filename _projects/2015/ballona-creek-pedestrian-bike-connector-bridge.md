  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "As indicated in the recent adoption of the Westside Mobility plan, there is a great need for alternative methods of transportation, a proposed Connector Ped/Bike Bridge is shown on the Westside Mobility Plan Map but not currently available.  We believe the best method for mobility within the Westside is by cycling, skateboarding, walking and running, this provides a long term solution to the traffic problem in Los Angeles.  LA has the ability to be just as bike friendly as our Euro neighbors or other West Coast City neighbors, however we need infrastructure to allow this to happen safely.  Awareness is growing through cycLAvia and there is a growing community of people who commute via bike, but a long term solution is needed for the Westside and this proposal facilitates the development of a vast network of bike/ped paths that connect north and south as well as east and west.  Currently a north south route does not exist on the west side across Ballona creek except for at the Beach path.  \r\n\r\nOur proposal will allow people, students, to move freely and commute safely.  Currently there is not a safe method for Venice High students who live in Westchester to cycle to school since there is not easy access or bike path across Ballona Creek.  Lincoln Blvd bridge is very dangerous and Centinela is equally as dangerous.  Our proposal will allow pedestrian connection for daily commuting and daily recreation through the Parks at Playa Vista across Ballona creek and along Beethoven to access Alla Park and Moore Park. The Connector bridge will also allow a connection through the bike path along Marina 90 into Marina Del rey and Venice.  Our proposal connects communities, allow for increase mobility with recreation, and facilitates future pedestrian oriented growth within the Westside and the surrounding LA area.\r\n  "

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    A major challenge is going to be acquisition of land for the ideal location,
    there are proposed locations that do not require acquisition of land.  The
    First propose site is adjacent to Lincoln Blvd Bridge, Second Proposed Site
    is at  Alla Road and Third is adjacent to the Marina 90 Fwy bridge on an
    abandoned CSX railway  line.  The best location includes a peninsula which
    could be used as an interpretive park and is on axis with Marina 90 Fwy,
    since it is an abandoned CSX railway line, it has existing bridge abutments
    which can be rehabilitated and used to support a new bike/pedestrian
    bridge.  There is an opportunity to connect into Marvin Braude Bike path in
    Marina Del Rey if the bridge is oriented along the 90 Fwy on CSX railway. 
    This also allows for a connection to Westchester and Inglewood through a
    future bike path along the Centinela Creek waterway. A new connection is
    proposed into Playa Vista Park and Westchester neighborhood through Loyola
    Marymount University.   
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    Work will be evaluated by completion of the bridge and the resultant of
    additional bike/pedestrian friendly and safe paths on the Westside.  We hope
    this project will catalyze future development of Bike/Pedestrian friendly
    paths.  This will provide increased access to Healthy life styles,
    recreation and mobility between communities.  We will provide increased
    access to the beach from communities that currently do not have safe
    access.  We also will provide access to new grocery stores being built in
    Playa Vista.  We suspect there is an Food Desert in the area we are working
    since there are so few grocery stores.  Providing access over Ballona Creek
    will only further alleviate these conditions and provide access for the
    community to healthy lifestyles.
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "We propose teaming up with North East Trees a non-profit who has a critical role in the development of the Glendale River Narrows path development.  They have done similar projects across the region and will provide invaluable experience to deliver the project.\r\n\r\nWe propose teaming up with anyone who is interested in the project and who can allocate resources or people to further developing the project.  The more support we can obtain from local organizations and community the higher chance of success the project will have.\r\n\r\nTHarchitecture and North East Trees will work with the community to perform, community workshops, a feasibility study and initial design concepts for the Connector Bridge.  We have previous experience with public works projects and also have consulting engineers who will help engineer the project and work with county engineers and local regulatory agencies to deliver a successful project."
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "We have visited the site with North East Trees northeasttrees.org a non-profit organization who has a critical role in the development of the Glendale River Narrows path development and other bike/pedestrian friendly paths around LA and LA County. As an organization they see immense potential in the project and are interested in working with THarchitecture to make this project a reality.  We propose a 50K for North East trees to dedicate one full time employee and 50K for THarchitecture to dedicate one full time employee to the project for the next two years, until the project has catalyzed enough for other methods of Grant funding/Private funding.\r\n\r\nWe will work with other Ballona Creek organizations and Bicycle advocacy Groups:\r\n\r\nballonafriends.org, ballonarenaissance.org, ballonawetlands.org, ballonarestoration.org, labike.org, CCbike.org (culver city cyclists).  Bike LMU, SMspoke.org (santa monica cyclists) "
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': "Additional cost will be covered by applying for Grants for which the Connector Ped/Bike Brige is a prime candidate, such as Proposition 50- River Parkways Grant program, we will submit for this grant in 2016. We will need additional resources and funding to make this a successful grant application. \r\n\r\nOther sources of Funding: \r\n Los Angeles County - Proposition A Grant\r\nCaltrans - Dept. of Transportation - Environmental Enhancement and Mitigation program\r\nLACity Funding\r\nLACounty Funding\r\n \r\nWe recognize there is a wealth of financial capital within the tech community in Playa Vista, Venice and Santa Monica (aka Silicon Beach) we believe there can be enormous financial support for this project from one or many of these major tech companies.  We will need additional resources and funding to seek the support of these companies."
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "As the project is in the infant stage, we need organizers behind the project to garner community support, local governmental support and corporate support for the project. Funding and Resources will be required to run community workshops as well as research and identify funding sources. We feel this project could reach fruition and become a reality faster if there are people who are dedicated full time to the project. THarchitecture proposes to donate all partner and principal time to the project as much is financially possible, however we need capital to allocate resources to the project for a full time employee for the next two years.  \r\n\r\nWe propose North East Trees will use a similar approach to the project and will need capital to dedicate a full time person to the project for the next two years. As they are busy with many other projects, we will need the additional funding to allow this project to be a priority, within their scope of projects.  "
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    Success will be determined by the number of people who will use the
    Connector Ped/Bike bridge in the future once it is completed.  We feel it is
    not a matter of "If" a bridge will be provided it is "When" and we hope this
    proposal will accelerate that time period.  Providing a safe way to cross
    Ballona Creek will increase the amount of Pedestrian and Bike Traffic moving
    between communities.  Safe routes which prevent accidents between
    pedestrians, bikes and cars and save lives will have success which cannot be
    scaled. The ability to safely bicycle our kids from Culver City, Mar Vista
    to Ballona Creek Wetlands Ecological Reserve and other Playa Vista parks
    will also be a measure of success.

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "As indicated in the recent adoption of the Westside Mobility plan, there is a great need for alternative methods of transportation, a proposed Connector Ped/Bike Bridge is shown on the Westside Mobility Plan Map but not currently available.  We believe the best method for mobility within the Westside is by cycling, skateboarding, walking and running, this provides a long term solution to the traffic problem in Los Angeles.  LA has the ability to be just as bike friendly as our Euro neighbors or other West Coast City neighbors, however we need infrastructure to allow this to happen safely.  Awareness is growing through cycLAvia and there is a growing community of people who commute via bike, but a long term solution is needed for the Westside and this proposal facilitates the development of a vast network of bike/ped paths that connect north and south as well as east and west.  Currently a north south route does not exist on the west side across Ballona creek except for at the Beach path.  \r\n\r\nOur proposal will allow people, students, to move freely and commute safely.  Currently there is not a safe method for Venice High students who live in Westchester to cycle to school since there is not easy access or bike path across Ballona Creek.  Lincoln Blvd bridge is very dangerous and Centinela is equally as dangerous.  Our proposal will allow pedestrian connection for daily commuting and daily recreation through the Parks at Playa Vista across Ballona creek and along Beethoven to access Alla Park and Moore Park. The Connector bridge will also allow a connection through the bike path along Marina 90 into Marina Del rey and Venice.  Our proposal connects communities, allow for increase mobility with recreation, and facilitates future pedestrian oriented growth within the Westside and the surrounding LA area.\r\n  "

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      A major challenge is going to be acquisition of land for the ideal
      location, there are proposed locations that do not require acquisition of
      land.  The First propose site is adjacent to Lincoln Blvd Bridge, Second
      Proposed Site is at  Alla Road and Third is adjacent to the Marina 90 Fwy
      bridge on an abandoned CSX railway  line.  The best location includes a
      peninsula which could be used as an interpretive park and is on axis with
      Marina 90 Fwy, since it is an abandoned CSX railway line, it has existing
      bridge abutments which can be rehabilitated and used to support a new
      bike/pedestrian bridge.  There is an opportunity to connect into Marvin
      Braude Bike path in Marina Del Rey if the bridge is oriented along the 90
      Fwy on CSX railway.  This also allows for a connection to Westchester and
      Inglewood through a future bike path along the Centinela Creek waterway. A
      new connection is proposed into Playa Vista Park and Westchester
      neighborhood through Loyola Marymount University.   
  - name: Please explain how you will evaluate your work.
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      Work will be evaluated by completion of the bridge and the resultant of
      additional bike/pedestrian friendly and safe paths on the Westside.  We
      hope this project will catalyze future development of Bike/Pedestrian
      friendly paths.  This will provide increased access to Healthy life
      styles, recreation and mobility between communities.  We will provide
      increased access to the beach from communities that currently do not have
      safe access.  We also will provide access to new grocery stores being
      built in Playa Vista.  We suspect there is an Food Desert in the area we
      are working since there are so few grocery stores.  Providing access over
      Ballona Creek will only further alleviate these conditions and provide
      access for the community to healthy lifestyles.

We propose a 50K for North East trees to dedicate one full time employee and 50K for THarchitecture to dedicate one full time employee to the project for the next two years, until the project has catalyzed enough for other methods of Grant funding/Private funding.\r\n\r\nWe will work with other Ballona Creek organizations and Bicycle advocacy Groups:\r\n\r\nballonafriends.org, ballonarenaissance.org, ballonawetlands.org, ballonarestoration.org, labike.org, CCbike.org (culver city cyclists).

We will need additional resources and funding to make this a successful grant application. \r\n\r\nOther sources of Funding: \r\n Los Angeles County - Proposition A Grant\r\nCaltrans - Dept. of Transportation - Environmental Enhancement and Mitigation program\r\nLACity Funding\r\nLACounty Funding\r\n \r\nWe recognize there is a wealth of financial capital within the tech community in Playa Vista, Venice and Santa Monica (aka Silicon Beach) we believe there can be enormous financial support for this project from one or many of these major tech companies.

      Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement
      this project.
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "As the project is in the infant stage, we need organizers behind the project to garner community support, local governmental support and corporate support for the project. Funding and Resources will be required to run community workshops as well as research and identify funding sources. We feel this project could reach fruition and become a reality faster if there are people who are dedicated full time to the project. THarchitecture proposes to donate all partner and principal time to the project as much is financially possible, however we need capital to allocate resources to the project for a full time employee for the next two years.  \r\n\r\nWe propose North East Trees will use a similar approach to the project and will need capital to dedicate a full time person to the project for the next two years. As they are busy with many other projects, we will need the additional funding to allow this project to be a priority, within their scope of projects.  "

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      Success will be determined by the number of people who will use the
      Connector Ped/Bike bridge in the future once it is completed.  We feel it
      is not a matter of "If" a bridge will be provided it is "When" and we hope
      this proposal will accelerate that time period.  Providing a safe way to
      cross Ballona Creek will increase the amount of Pedestrian and Bike
      Traffic moving between communities.  Safe routes which prevent accidents
      between pedestrians, bikes and cars and save lives will have success which
      cannot be scaled. The ability to safely bicycle our kids from Culver City,
      Mar Vista to Ballona Creek Wetlands Ecological Reserve and other Playa
      Vista parks will also be a measure of success.
