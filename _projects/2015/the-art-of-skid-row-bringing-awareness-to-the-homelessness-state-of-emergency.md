  The Art of Skid Row’s goal is to bring awareness to the homelessness state of
  emergency through digital and print photojournalism. The AoSR is an print and
  digital collaboration of local photographers that will be launched through a
  loud social media campaign and sold at Los Angeles businesses including: book
  stores, art galleries, restaurants, and coffee shops. Proceeds from book sales
  will achieve both an immediate and long-term solution for the homeless crisis.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Using the launch of The Art of Skid Row as a catalyst, Sustaynabl aims to be
  an equitable and responsible economic participant, contributing to the
  stabilization of Los Angeles’ unbalanced housing market. By orchestrating the
  impact of state and local government officials, city planning professionals,
  key real estate investors, and social non-government authorities, Sustaynabl
  poses the innovation to develop an immediate and long-term permanent solution
  to urban poverty. 
   
   In Los Angeles, for example, if one person makes $20,000/year and spends 50% of their gross income, $10,000 ($833/month) on rent, that person would have $10,000/year to participate in the rest of the economy. In a balanced housing market, that person should be paying 20-30% of their annual income in housing costs. Let’s say 25%, which is $5000 ($416 / month). That person then has $15000/year to participate more equitably in other sectors of the economy. By reversing the damaging impact of a renter’s burden in our current state of imbalanced housing costs, LA becomes an community in which one can pursue educational aspirations, have financial flexibility to support a family, and gain access to bare necessities they couldn’t once afford. 
   
   At Sustaynabl we believe a truly healthy economy is one where interdependence is established between all constituents. It is one where an unsettling juxtaposition between extreme poverty and extreme wealth no longer exist; where raising a family in Downtown Los Angeles is just as healthy as raising a family in Beverly Hills. Where quality education is no longer dictated by zip code.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Lack of political will and cross sector collaboration has been the greatest
  deterrent to ending homelessness. This will be our greatest roadblock as well.
  Sustaynabl will use The Art of Skid Row to overcome these challenges by
  generating revenue through for profit business models to accomplish what
  governments and an army of nonprofits have tried to for decades. 
   
   Gary Blasi, a UCLA professor and homelessness expert, said previous grand schemes to combat the homelessness issue have "never made it off paper.” The $100m plan announced by Mayor Eric Garcetti may not be enough. The Art of Skid Row aims to tackle the challenge by bringing awareness to the severity of the issue in the public eye, and in doing so, generate revenue for short term solutions such as homeless services; and long term solutions like Urban Habitats.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We will evaluate our work through book sales, social media impressions, global
  awareness created, feedback and impact in the homeless community.
   Tracking social media impressions through digital photojournalism; which includes videos, photos, and articles.
   Tracking media stories related to #TheArtofSkidRow.
   Achieve goal of selling 45,000 copies of The Art of Skid Row book, via print or ebook. 
   Utilizing Google Analytics to monitor site traffic for The Art of Skid Row, Sustaynabl, and connect social media accounts such as youtube, facebook, instagram, and twitter. 
   Connecting Angelenos with bi-annual tours of Skid Row for those that desire to reach out to our homeless community members.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  The U.S. Housing and Urban Development Department, Los Angeles Homeless
  Services Authority, Poverty Matters, United Way for a Greater Los Angeles, and
  countless other non profit organizations all attempt to address homelessness
  and provide services to those on the streets.
   
   In 2003, the City of Los Angeles launched a ten year plan to end homelessness, titled “Bring L.A. Home.” It was part of a larger national effort starting in 2000 to end homelessness, lead by National Alliance to End Homelessness and HUD. In 2002, hundreds of cities signed onto the pact.
   
   2015 marks the twelfth anniversary of Bring L.A. Home’s launching. No one needs to walk far to see that chronic homelessness still permeates practically every corner of Los Angeles. By LAHSA’s 2015 homeless count, homelessness in LA County has increased to 44,359, up from 39,463 in 2013. Evidently, an army of nonprofits funded by government grants has not been effective enough.
   
   Creating and signing onto a plan to end homelessness establishes a roadmap to end the sad state of affairs for tens of thousands of people. It shows ending homelessness is within society’s grasp. Actually implementing such a plan as scheduled is a different issue. Homelessness is a systemic result of an unbalanced housing market. Solving homelessness requires a balanced housing market. 
   
   Sustaynabl’s differentiation from competitors is its development of innovative projects that generate revenue to support the core mission - eliminating extreme urban poverty. Our efforts are aligned with the number one global goal of ending poverty by 2030. Incorporating a market-based solution, Sustaynabl will have a long-term impact on Urban Centers that has not yet been achieved by similar non-profit organizations solely reliant upon private donors and government grants.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  The Weingart Center Association will receive an investment of 10% of the
  proceeds from each book. Local Los Angeles photographers, who will receive
  $500 each for their time. 
   
   Other partners include local los angeles business such as retailers, book stores, art galleries, restaurants, and coffee shops that will showcase and sell the book. These partners will not be receiving a portion of the $100,000 grant.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  The Art of Skid Row will cost $100,000 to fully develop and distribute; no
  additional funding will be needed for the project.

   ISBN Purchase: $300
   Operating/Miscellaneous Expenses: $2700
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  The Art of Skid Row is the pioneer GIP which will generate critical funds to
  support individuals experiencing homelessness and develop a long-term approach
  to redefine affordable housing development. Sustaynabl plans to publish and
  sell 45,000 print and electronic copies; this represents the amount of people
  currently living on Skid Row.
   By implementing an aggressive sales plan through targeted marketing and community engagement - Sustaynabl expects to generate over $1MM in proceeds during the first 12 months. 
   Immediate impact: Sustaynabl will invest 10% of revenue generated through book sales to Weingart’s comprehensive 9-month program that provides safe housing, meals, case management, job training, and job placement services to those experiencing homelessness. 
   Long term scalable plan, 90% of the revenue generated through book sales will be used to fund Sustaynabl’s major GIP, Urban Habitats (UH’s); mixed-use, mixed-income and environmentally friendly urban developments.
   Urban Habitats are designed to balance the housing market. UH’s will also reverse the cycle of “renter’s burden” in a city plagued with income disparity. This cycle of burden refers to the everyday renter that spends upwards of 50%+ of their income on housing, thereby reducing their capacity to purchase bare necessities (food, clothing, education). Sustaynabl seeks to develop its first UH in Los Angeles which will scale to other regions in the United States and eventually, around the globe. Urban Habitats will operate at optimal economic efficiency by dividing the residential units into three rental structures as follows:
   65%: Sustaynabl Units: Individuals and families pay an Occupancy Fee which is based on a Qualification Percentage (QP). The QP does not rise above 40%. The algorithm takes into consideration IRS income data, family / unit size, educational aspirations, and an individual's ability to earn income.
   25%: Market Linked Units: These units are linked to market pricing, but are priced lower than the subject property’s submarket to provide a competitive advantage and keep our units fully occupied at all times.
   10%: Transitional Units: These units have the ability to transition 120 - 240 at risk / homeless individuals into stable housing through our 6 month or 1 year comprehensive programs.
   By using various for-profit business models, Sustaynabl will provide a source of funding for responsible housing development and create the foundation of a balanced housing market.
