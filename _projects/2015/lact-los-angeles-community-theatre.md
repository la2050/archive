  We are a group of professional Los Angeles artists, writers, actors and
  directors who earn our living in live theater. We want to utilize existing
  theatrical venues like Ramona Hall in Sycamore Grove Park, turning it into a
  professional training ground for Angelenos. 
   
   LACT will have programs for all age ranges. We will welcome anyone wanting to experience the excitement of performing plays that have been written for them, about them and by them. 
   
   LACT will help break down the barriers between cultural communities. Highland Park is a perfect example of the diversity within the Los Angeles. It is that very diversity that will inspire our new theatrical works. Because our works will be created within the community, they will inspire the next generation of theater lovers.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  We do not want to be in competition with school drama programs. Our strategy
  is to present LACT as a place for families and community members who want to
  supplement the school programs. We will also focus our student programs during
  the Summer, to provide children with a safe artistic outlet when they are out
  of school.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  LACT will have a Board of Directors that meets monthly to evaluate the
  progress of the company.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There are many 99 and 45 seat theatres in Los Angeles, but there is no
  comprehensive Community Theatre program. 
   
   The foundation of the LACT concept is that professional theater artists will be working on each show. These guest artists will share their knowledge and talents. Their expertise will give the community a professional theater experience.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': N/A
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  We do not anticipate that our budget will go over $100,000. However, if it
  does, we will have auctions and fundraisers to raise the additional funds.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  We will allocate $25k per year for 4 years to get the program up and running. 
   
   Annual breakdown:
   $10k - venue rental & equipment
   $10k - instructors & guest artists
   $5k - marketing & development
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Over the 4 years that we make use of the $100k, we will grow our audience and
  donors to a place where LACT will be self sustainable.
