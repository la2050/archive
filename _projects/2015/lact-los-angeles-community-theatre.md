We want to utilize existing theatrical venues like Ramona Hall in Sycamore Grove Park, turning it into a professional training ground for Angelenos. \r\n\r\nLACT will have programs for all age ranges. We will welcome anyone wanting to experience the excitement of performing plays that have been written for them, about them and by them. \r\n\r\nLACT will help break down the barriers between cultural communities.
