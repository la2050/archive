  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: "Our organization will make LA a better place utilizing STARS to foster artistic entrepreneurship along with cultural and economic diversity. Currently, Los Angeles is the mecca for creativity within the entertainment industry.  However, it is difficult for aspiring and mid-level professionals to effectively pursue their entertainment careers when they lack key resources.  According to UCLA’s 2014 Hollywood Diversity report, women, minorities and low-income creative professionals are underrepresented in the entertainment field. Our STARS’ facility will help our LA entertainment capital diversify its working population to be more reflective of the mirage of artists pursuing their careers. \r\n\r\nSTARS will provide the creative community with access to state-of-the art shared equipment, education and training, and accountability partnerships.  As a result of STARS, more diverse artists will be better equipped for industry jobs and to produce their own projects, which will ultimately stabilize their finances as an artisticpreneur.\r\n\r\nSTARS will not only be a destination for creatives, but the heart of where careers are developed and artistic dreams come true for all. Currently, our organization hosts over 25 educational networking events at various locations throughout the year with a total attendance of 2,000 entertainment professionals. This grant will allow our organization to use one venue for our events and programming. Los Angeles will become a better place to create because artists will not only have an avenue to learn about the creative arts, but also an artistic location to create their projects and showcase their talent within our center’s facility.\r\n\r\nEvery professional coming through the door of the resource center will have an opportunity to become involved with our various Sections. STARS’ Sections are divided into each profession, such as the Acting Section, Writing Section, Directing Section, Producing Section, Music Composing Section, etc. Section Members can work individually within their Section, or collaborate with other Sections. Each Section has a Chair that is responsible to make sure that each Section showcases at least one project, or a joint project with another Section.\r\n\r\n"

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    One barrier/challenge will be making the public aware of the resource
    center, particularly for recent college graduates and diverse groups. Our
    strategy is to utilize our 5,000 email list of industry professionals and
    local media to announce the opening of the center. Additional strategy for
    publicizing the center will include partnering with established industry
    organizations that focus on specific minority groups and women. We will also
    research diverse social media groups to get the word out that STARS exists. 
    While there is often a key focus of finding talent from prestigious LA
    universities such as UCLA and USC. We will also notify community colleges in
    the county of Los Angeles, which will help us to get the word out to diverse
    aspiring professionals from an ethnic and economic standpoint.
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "We will evaluate our work through surveys and keep track of the number of people as well as the demographics of the people utilizing STARS. Each person taking advantage of the studio will be required to complete an initial survey and an ‘exit’ survey upon completion of a personal career project or Section team project. \r\n\r\nWe will monitor the number of projects being created within our center on a regular basis. Through our quarterly evaluation methods, we will be able to make any necessary adjustments to maximize the center’s operational goals.\r\n\r\n"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "The major industry organizations such as SAG, DGA, WGA, PGA, and other associations host events and offer resources to their members. But majority of their members are not aspiring and mid-level, they are primarily working professionals. Those unions also have pricey membership fees which is typically not affordable to aspiring and mid-level talent, which is the key focus of our center. \r\n\r\nWe will shepherd extremely talented professionals who may not have the credits to be a part of the unions. We will also provide them with training and industry contacts to better equip them with the tools needed to thrive in the entertainment business. \r\n\r\nMajority of networking and educational events hosted by industry unions and other centers often occur in the evenings to accommodate those professionals who already have jobs. However, evening events often prevent many talented artists from attending because they do not have their own cars or because they work night shifts to obtain higher pay.  Many industry events are held at elite locations which is not feasible for direct and safe bus routes. It can take artists 2-4 hours to arrive on time at an event that is only 20-45 mins way in a car. Lengthy public transportation commutes is a frequent hindrance for low-income industry professionals who have a sincere desire to attend evening workshops. STARS is unique in that it will hold a variety of events in the day to accommodate those who take public transportation.\r\n\r\nThe STARS mission will be to equip and empower entertainment professionals with the tools needed to create their projects in a collaborative artistic environment. Collaboration is a key aspect of being successful in Hollywood. STARS will embrace collaboration and diversity among the various industry crafts.\r\n\r\nLastly, STARS is unique because it is similar to a resource center but it operates like a small studio. It is a place where creative projects are actually being produced similar to a lab environment in the tech space. All artists will retain ownership of any projects they create unless otherwise decided by the artists. In other words, the studio will not own intellectual properties just because they are being created with the use of our STARS facility. To empower artists’ entrepreneurial spirits, STARS’ users will be encouraged to start their own entertainment companies utilizing guidance from our studio. This also includes helping professionals to register/copyright their creative properties. \r\n"
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    We will have several partners to promote awareness about the center. We will
    receive many in-kind donations for our partnerships. Allocated in the budget
    are freelance contractors that will provide part-time administrative
    support. In addition, our various speakers and educational training partners
    will receive a small gift for donating their time (under $50 per person).
    Each of our budgeted items are specifically allocated for the direct use of
    launching the center. 
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': "Launching the center in the first year will cost $100,000. If more is needed, our organization is prepared to use up to an additional $25,000 of our regular revenue toward this new venture. It should be noted that during the first year of the center, one of our administrators will also research other grants that we can apply for to sustain STARS in future years. \r\n\r\n"
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "$24,000 – Rent and associated expenses (utility/internet/etc.); for the center to be located in the city of Los Angeles, in a central location for artists.\r\n$22,000 – Three part-time administrative contractors to work at the center. Note that we have several volunteers and board members that will also be involved with the center. \r\n$15,000 – Project creation equipment, including three video cameras with accessories, two desktop computers, laptop, two printers/copiers combo, and software for filmmaking, editing, creative design and business office.\r\n$7,500 – Marketing and promotional items to promote the center, such as banner, brochures, etc.\r\n$6,000 – Presentation equipment for educational networking workshops, such as flat screen TV, projector and white board/screen\r\n$5,000 – Artistic furnishings to be utilized for events and conference room that can be made available for rental for studio member meetings or small casting sessions for Section projects\r\n$4,000 – Operating expenses for Sections’ collaborative creative projects\r\n$3,500 – Honorariums or small gifts for speakers/power players donating their time as a speaker/instructor/mentor\r\n$3,000 – Insurances and any business/government permits\r\n$10,000 – Standard 10 percent emergency fund\r\nTOTAL $100,000\r\n"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "1.\tBuild a strong network through the resource studio. Through sign-in sheets, surveys and the Sections, we will be able to keep track of every person coming to the center and every person utilizing any aspect of the center. Whether a STARS’ user is attending an event, renting a conference room space, using video editing equipment, or having a career consultation with an industry mentor counselor, we will know that the center has succeeded in its mission.  \r\n2.\tMaking our vision resilient. We will make sure that our volunteers and paid staff are all clear on the vision of the resource studio. We will also be flexible as we execute the vision so that we maximize the benefits it has on the creative community-at-large.\r\n3.\tSustainability of the studio. Twice a month we will have meetings to discuss our current budget so that we can assess its accuracy based on actual center use and operation. This process will allow us to effectively apply for the appropriate local and federal grants based on our center’s usage. \r\n4.\tAccountability to grant donors. We will provide monthly recaps to our Goldhirsh Foundation point of contact. Through our report findings, we will gauge our success and continuously consider implementation of advice provided by the Foundation.\r\n"
