    Our 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, Breaking into Hollywood, will launch
    an innovative resource center:  STARS (Super Talented Artists' Resource
    Studio) in the city of Los Angeles for creative and business professionals
    in the entertainment industry. STARS will be a brick and mortar hub for
    aspiring and mid-level artists to collaborate and showcase their diverse
    talents.
  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: "Our organization will make LA a better place utilizing STARS to foster artistic entrepreneurship along with cultural and economic diversity. Currently, Los Angeles is the mecca for creativity within the entertainment industry.  However, it is difficult for aspiring and mid-level professionals to effectively pursue their entertainment careers when they lack key resources.  According to UCLA’s 2014 Hollywood Diversity report, women, minorities and low-income creative professionals are underrepresented in the entertainment field. Our STARS’ facility will help our LA entertainment capital diversify its working population to be more reflective of the mirage of artists pursuing their careers. \r\n\r\nSTARS will provide the creative community with access to state-of-the art shared equipment, education and training, and accountability partnerships.  As a result of STARS, more diverse artists will be better equipped for industry jobs and to produce their own projects, which will ultimately stabilize their finances as an artisticpreneur.\r\n\r\nSTARS will not only be a destination for creatives, but the heart of where careers are developed and artistic dreams come true for all. Currently, our organization hosts over 25 educational networking events at various locations throughout the year with a total attendance of 2,000 entertainment professionals. This grant will allow our organization to use one venue for our events and programming. Los Angeles will become a better place to create because artists will not only have an avenue to learn about the creative arts, but also an artistic location to create their projects and showcase their talent within our center’s facility.\r\n\r\nEvery professional coming through the door of the resource center will have an opportunity to become involved with our various Sections. STARS’ Sections are divided into each profession, such as the Acting Section, Writing Section, Directing Section, Producing Section, Music Composing Section, etc. Section Members can work individually within their Section, or collaborate with other Sections. Each Section has a Chair that is responsible to make sure that each Section showcases at least one project, or a joint project with another Section.\r\n\r\n"
