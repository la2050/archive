  'DESCRIBE IN GREATER DETAIL HOW YOU WILL MAKE LA THE HEALTHIEST PLACE TO LIVE: ': "In 2015, the Los Angeles City Council declared a state of emergency on homelessness. In addition to housing needs, persons who are homeless also often battle with mental illness, substance abuse, physical disability, and/or domestic violence. Furthermore, many homeless people have nutrition-related health problems and need improved access to food and nutrition.  It is our opinion that LA can only be as healthy as those least fortunate, and to make LA healthy, we must focus first on this growing population.\r\n\r\nGrowGood’s 1.5-acre farm adjacent to the Salvation Army’s Bell Shelter fills this critical gap.  Founded in 2011, GrowGood’s mission is to provide a variety of fresh produce to the Shelter’s kitchen; to create a green space for emotional healing; and to provide meaningful job training opportunities for Shelter’s residents. \r\n\r\nCurrently, GrowGood’s farm consists of a 50 fruit tree orchard, 14 raised vegetable garden beds, a California native garden, as well as traditional in-ground row crops. GrowGood’s farm continues to provide organic produce to the Shelter’s kitchen - 2,000 lbs of produce this year alone.  Moreover, GrowGood also provides garden classes for Shelter residents. In furtherance of its mission, GrowGood will use $100,000 to continue developing its farm as well as to launch its UCLA award-winning social enterprise business to employ Shelter residents and provide meaningful job training. \r\n\r\nTo launch the business, GrowGood will install on-site a commercial, climate-controlled 30 x 58 ft greenhouse.  The greenhouse will require a foundation, electricity, and plumbing to increase the production scale and to enable year-round cultivation.  GrowGood will also need to hire an additional full-time employee as well as lease a truck to deliver product to customers. Residents will be involved in every stage of business. \r\n\r\nIn 2014, GrowGood presented this concept to a panel of business leaders at the Social Enterprise Academy at UCLA. GrowGood was awarded 1st place and received a $12,000 prize.  Since then, GrowGood has conducted further market research, gained agreement from a talented individual to run the business, and has received approval from the Army to place the greenhouse on-site. By producing a high-quality local product and providing meaningful job training opportunities to the Shelter’s residents, many of whom are veterans, GrowGood is building a replicable model that will make LA the healthiest place to live. \r\n"

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "Based on our experience over the past four years, we anticipate a major challenge will be getting consistent resident participation in the social enterprise.  Our business plan for putting the $100,000 grant monies to work relies on sourcing Shelter residents as employees. For GrowGood’s social enterprise, the basic premise is that the best way to teach how to be employed is to employ. Residents learn to come to work on time, complete tasks and work with others among other things. This also goes hand in hand with the therapeutic aspect of the program.  With that said, we recognize each resident brings a unique set of obligations and issues that may sometimes interfere with their commitment to GrowGood. \r\n\r\nIn order to overcome this challenge we will develop and institutionalize the following into our operating model: 1) case worker training and accountability; 2) training and ongoing education; 3) employee reward system; and 4) access to jobs upon completion.\r\n"
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "GrowGood will evaluate the program through resident surveys, feedback from key stakeholders (i.e. Shelter staff, especially case managers), and documenting whether resident employees are successfully leveraging their experience with GrowGood to gain full-time employment after their time in the Shelter. Moreover, documenting volunteer hours - additional hours a resident spends at the farm beyond what is required - can also be helpful in determining “success.”  \r\n"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "GrowGood is unique because we operate a 1.5-acre farm only 8 miles from downtown LA that produces nutritious, healthy food for Los Angeles’s neediest, and has a enthusiast population of underserved residents only 100 yards away.  GrowGood’s social enterprise will empower the homeless by giving residents a chance to grow something of their own and learn valuable skills that they can leverage for future careers. \r\n\r\nFarmscape is an organization whose mission it is “to connect city dwellers with fresh, organic product through a network of urban farms, while creating living wage jobs for the new generation of farmers.” Farmscape is complementary to our work and provides a career pathway for residents who participate in GrowGood’s social enterprise.  Other career pathways for Shelter residents might include greenhouse management, customer service and retail, food production, and water efficiency auditing.\r\n"
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "GrowGood is closely aligned with the The Salvation Army’s Bell Shelter. Currently, GrowGood occupies the site rent-free and the Salvation Army pays for GrowGood’s utilities.  GrowGood and the Army are presently negotiating a long-term lease agreement to formalize the relationship.  With that said, the Army has approved GrowGood's plan to construct a greenhouse on-site in order to launch the social enterprise. \r\n\r\nThe Salvation Army will not receive any amount from this grant award, although participating Shelter residents will be paid for their work.  "
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': "A detailed budget for putting the $100,000 to work is outlined below.  Coincidentally, this is the same amount as our capital campaign that was recently kicked-off.  In addition to the LA 2020 grant monies, GrowGood retains a professional grant writer who is managing targeted outreach efforts to supplement our existing operational budget and to aid in our expansion in 2016. \r\n"

  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "The GrowGood model can be replicated at other sites, especially other Salvation Army sites across LA County, a plan which has already been discussed with Army senior officials.  On the commercial front, GrowGood’s long term goal is to create a brand with a range of products like Homeboys or Newman’s Own, which creates great products and contributes to the greater good.  Once our brand name has been established, we see many potential areas for expansion from growing California native plants for drought-stricken California gardens to value-add food products such as craft coleslaw and sauces. \r\n"

      DESCRIBE IN GREATER DETAIL HOW YOU WILL MAKE LA THE HEALTHIEST PLACE TO
      LIVE: 
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "In 2015, the Los Angeles City Council declared a state of emergency on homelessness. In addition to housing needs, persons who are homeless also often battle with mental illness, substance abuse, physical disability, and/or domestic violence. Furthermore, many homeless people have nutrition-related health problems and need improved access to food and nutrition.  It is our opinion that LA can only be as healthy as those least fortunate, and to make LA healthy, we must focus first on this growing population.\r\n\r\nGrowGood’s 1.5-acre farm adjacent to the Salvation Army’s Bell Shelter fills this critical gap.  Founded in 2011, GrowGood’s mission is to provide a variety of fresh produce to the Shelter’s kitchen; to create a green space for emotional healing; and to provide meaningful job training opportunities for Shelter’s residents. \r\n\r\nCurrently, GrowGood’s farm consists of a 50 fruit tree orchard, 14 raised vegetable garden beds, a California native garden, as well as traditional in-ground row crops. GrowGood’s farm continues to provide organic produce to the Shelter’s kitchen - 2,000 lbs of produce this year alone.  Moreover, GrowGood also provides garden classes for Shelter residents. In furtherance of its mission, GrowGood will use $100,000 to continue developing its farm as well as to launch its UCLA award-winning social enterprise business to employ Shelter residents and provide meaningful job training. \r\n\r\nTo launch the business, GrowGood will install on-site a commercial, climate-controlled 30 x 58 ft greenhouse.  The greenhouse will require a foundation, electricity, and plumbing to increase the production scale and to enable year-round cultivation.  GrowGood will also need to hire an additional full-time employee as well as lease a truck to deliver product to customers. Residents will be involved in every stage of business. \r\n\r\nIn 2014, GrowGood presented this concept to a panel of business leaders at the Social Enterprise Academy at UCLA. GrowGood was awarded 1st place and received a $12,000 prize.  Since then, GrowGood has conducted further market research, gained agreement from a talented individual to run the business, and has received approval from the Army to place the greenhouse on-site. By producing a high-quality local product and providing meaningful job training opportunities to the Shelter’s residents, many of whom are veterans, GrowGood is building a replicable model that will make LA the healthiest place to live. \r\n"

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Based on our experience over the past four years, we anticipate a major challenge will be getting consistent resident participation in the social enterprise.  Our business plan for putting the $100,000 grant monies to work relies on sourcing Shelter residents as employees. For GrowGood’s social enterprise, the basic premise is that the best way to teach how to be employed is to employ. Residents learn to come to work on time, complete tasks and work with others among other things. This also goes hand in hand with the therapeutic aspect of the program.  With that said, we recognize each resident brings a unique set of obligations and issues that may sometimes interfere with their commitment to GrowGood. \r\n\r\nIn order to overcome this challenge we will develop and institutionalize the following into our operating model: 1) case worker training and accountability; 2) training and ongoing education; 3) employee reward system; and 4) access to jobs upon completion.\r\n"
  - name: Please explain how you will evaluate your work.
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "GrowGood will evaluate the program through resident surveys, feedback from key stakeholders (i.e. Shelter staff, especially case managers), and documenting whether resident employees are successfully leveraging their experience with GrowGood to gain full-time employment after their time in the Shelter. Moreover, documenting volunteer hours - additional hours a resident spends at the farm beyond what is required - can also be helpful in determining “success.”  \r\n"

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "GrowGood is unique because we operate a 1.5-acre farm only 8 miles from downtown LA that produces nutritious, healthy food for Los Angeles’s neediest, and has a enthusiast population of underserved residents only 100 yards away.  GrowGood’s social enterprise will empower the homeless by giving residents a chance to grow something of their own and learn valuable skills that they can leverage for future careers. \r\n\r\nFarmscape is an organization whose mission it is “to connect city dwellers with fresh, organic product through a network of urban farms, while creating living wage jobs for the new generation of farmers.” Farmscape is complementary to our work and provides a career pathway for residents who participate in GrowGood’s social enterprise.  Other career pathways for Shelter residents might include greenhouse management, customer service and retail, food production, and water efficiency auditing.\r\n"

      this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner
      receive?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "GrowGood is closely aligned with the The Salvation Army’s Bell Shelter. Currently, GrowGood occupies the site rent-free and the Salvation Army pays for GrowGood’s utilities.  GrowGood and the Army are presently negotiating a long-term lease agreement to formalize the relationship.  With that said, the Army has approved GrowGood's plan to construct a greenhouse on-site in order to launch the social enterprise. \r\n\r\nThe Salvation Army will not receive any amount from this grant award, although participating Shelter residents will be paid for their work.

    answer: "The GrowGood model can be replicated at other sites, especially other Salvation Army sites across LA County, a plan which has already been discussed with Army senior officials.  On the commercial front, GrowGood’s long term goal is to create a brand with a range of products like Homeboys or Newman’s Own, which creates great products and contributes to the greater good.  Once our brand name has been established, we see many potential areas for expansion from growing California native plants for drought-stricken California gardens to value-add food products such as craft coleslaw and sauces. \r\n"
