  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "GrowGood will evaluate the program through resident surveys, feedback from key stakeholders (i.e. Shelter staff, especially case managers), and documenting whether resident employees are successfully leveraging their experience with GrowGood to gain full-time employment after their time in the Shelter. Moreover, documenting volunteer hours - additional hours a resident spends at the farm beyond what is required - can also be helpful in determining “success.”  \r\n"
