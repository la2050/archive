  spcaLAs ASN - Helping Domestic Violence Survivors and their Pets Live Safer
  Healthier Lives.

project_summary: >-
  Abusers use everything at their disposal to terrorize and control those they
  batter – including the family pet, often threatening to harm or kill an animal
  if the domestic violence survivor dares leave. spcaLA’s Animal Safety Network
  (ASN)™ provides a safe refuge for the domestic violence survivors’ pets,
  free-of-charge, so that they may leave a dangerous situation without fear for
  their animals’ lives. spcaLA wants to expand ASN and break the cycle of
  violence for more people and their pets.
