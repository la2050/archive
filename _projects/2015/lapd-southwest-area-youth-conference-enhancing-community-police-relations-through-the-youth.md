  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    In March of 2014 we coordinated our first conference with approximately 300
    high school students from 30 different schools. We would like to increase
    our participation and frequency for this conference to continue to make an
    impact. The major challenge is soliciting the funds and resources for
    coordinating the event and providing free transportation on a school day.
    Our strategy for overcoming this obstacle is to plan early with the schools
    (LAUSD) and share the conference impact on the community to increase
    volunteer and financial resources. 
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    We will evaluate our work on the total number of students that attend the
    conference, increased participation in LAPD Southwest area youth programs
    and positive media reports on community-police relations.
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    There are other community youth programs that help positive interactions
    between police and the youth; i.e. police little league coaching. This
    approach is unique because it is planned by a youth board of high school and
    college students with the help of LAPD officers. The goal to connect more
    youth with the police officers that serve their community and increase
    involvement in public safety.
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': 'LAUSD: $20,000 for school bus transfortation'
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    We would like to plan two conferences for the next school year at a total of
    about $47,000 for each conference. The total should not be more than
    $100,000.
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Guest Speaker:              $5,000.00\r\nLunch:\t                        $3,000.00\r\nBreakfast:\t\t\t$2,000.00\r\nNotebooks:\t\t\t$1,000.00\r\nTags/Stickers:\t\t$200.00\r\nPens:  \t\t\t        $200.00\r\nTable Cloths:\t\t\t$520 \r\nVenue:\t\t\t        $5,000.00\r\nEvent Rentals:\t\t$1,000.00\r\nWalkie Talkies:\t\t$200.00\r\nPhotographer:\t\t$500.00\r\nPrinted Programs:\t\t$500.00\r\nOther:\t\t\t        $500 \r\nPlanning Expenses:\t$100 \r\nt-shirts:\t\t\t        $6,000 \r\nTransportation:\t\t$20,000.00\r\nAV Equipment:\t\t$1,000 \r\n\r\nTotal Per Conference\t$46,720.00\r\n"
