The future result is to ensure more positive interactions between all community members and police and increase youth involvement in public safety.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  In March of 2014 we coordinated our first conference with approximately 300
  high school students from 30 different schools. We would like to increase our
  participation and frequency for this conference to continue to make an impact.
  The major challenge is soliciting the funds and resources for coordinating the
  event and providing free transportation on a school day. Our strategy for
  overcoming this obstacle is to plan early with the schools (LAUSD) and share
  the conference impact on the community to increase volunteer and financial
  resources.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We will evaluate our work on the total number of students that attend the
  conference, increased participation in LAPD Southwest area youth programs and
  positive media reports on community-police relations.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There are other community youth programs that help positive interactions
  between police and the youth; i.e. police little league coaching. This
  approach is unique because it is planned by a youth board of high school and
  college students with the help of LAPD officers. The goal to connect more
  youth with the police officers that serve their community and increase
  involvement in public safety.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': 'LAUSD: $20,000 for school bus transfortation'
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Increased community engagement and support and participation in youth
  programs.
