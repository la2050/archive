  through the Youth
organization_id: '2015111'
areas_impacted: ''
partners: ''
project_summary: >-
  The Public Safety Youth Conference will gather advice, concerns and
  recommendations on deterring crime and fostering public safety and community
  policing from the perspective of the youth in our communities.
Please specify below: Los Angeles Police Department
category: connect
'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Today the youth are constantly dealing with the issues of police violence,
  narcotics, bullying and neighborhood gangs in real life and through social
  media; Leaving a generation wanting to make a difference and have a voice in
  their communities.
   
   The Public Safety Youth Conference will make LA the best place to connect by creating a platform where students in Los Angeles can have a dialogue with Los Angeles police and facilitators to address concerns and create solutions on deterring crime and improving community-police relations. The future result is to ensure more positive interactions between all community members and police and increase youth involvement in public safety.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  In March of 2014 we coordinated our first conference with approximately 300
  high school students from 30 different schools. We would like to increase our
  participation and frequency for this conference to continue to make an impact.
  The major challenge is soliciting the funds and resources for coordinating the
  event and providing free transportation on a school day. Our strategy for
  overcoming this obstacle is to plan early with the schools (LAUSD) and share
  the conference impact on the community to increase volunteer and financial
  resources.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We will evaluate our work on the total number of students that attend the
  conference, increased participation in LAPD Southwest area youth programs and
  positive media reports on community-police relations.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There are other community youth programs that help positive interactions
  between police and the youth; i.e. police little league coaching. This
  approach is unique because it is planned by a youth board of high school and
  college students with the help of LAPD officers. The goal to connect more
  youth with the police officers that serve their community and increase
  involvement in public safety.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': 'LAUSD: $20,000 for school bus transfortation'
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  We would like to plan two conferences for the next school year at a total of
  about $47,000 for each conference. The total should not be more than $100,000.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?

      In March of 2014 we coordinated our first conference with approximately
      300 high school students from 30 different schools. We would like to
      increase our participation and frequency for this conference to continue
      to make an impact. The major challenge is soliciting the funds and
      resources for coordinating the event and providing free transportation on
      a school day. Our strategy for overcoming this obstacle is to plan early
      with the schools (LAUSD) and share the conference impact on the community
      to increase volunteer and financial resources.

      There are other community youth programs that help positive interactions
      between police and the youth; i.e. police little league coaching. This
      approach is unique because it is planned by a youth board of high school
      and college students with the help of LAPD officers. The goal to connect
      more youth with the police officers that serve their community and
      increase involvement in public safety.
