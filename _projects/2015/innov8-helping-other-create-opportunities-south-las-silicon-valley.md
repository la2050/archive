  LASC Foundation partnered with Innovate Globally to create a synergistic
  program that accomplishes the following three goals: 1) educate students and
  South Los Angeles residents on the highly marketable skill of coding; 2)
  support business entrepreneurship by providing students and community members
  with “soup to nuts” business instruction and industry exposure for
  tech-related start-ups; and 3) ultimately create a sustainable “Innovation
  Ecosystem” that will encourage indigenous creativity.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  LASC Foundation, in partnership with Innovate Globally and LASC’s Career and
  Technical Education School seek to create a “tech hub” in South Los Angeles. 
   1. Students are offered the Introduction to Innovation 72 (I2 I), a 6-week, non-credit class at LASC CTE. The course is an introduction to the core components of the Innov8 program—CodeTechIQ, DigiTechIQ and BizTechIQ. 
   a. CodeTechIQ—students are taught the “back-end of innovation”. They are provided with an introduction to computer coding, as well as a look at how coding is used in industry (web-based, mobile, gaming and other industries). 
   b. DigiTechIQ—students are taught “what drives innovation”. They are instructed on content creation (digital media, web and graphic design, infographics, etc.).
   c.  BizTechIQ—students are taught the “front end” of innovation”. They are given the skills to manage a tech start up. The students get lessons in project management, securing funding, making the pitch and overall business development. 
   2. I2I enables the student to determine their area of interest—Code, Digi or BizTech. Students are then put on an education track with more in-depth introductory course work in their area of interest. Upon completion of one semester of classes, the student receives a Certificate of Knowledge.
   3. The students will then be placed in an 8-12 week internship with an Innov8 industry partner. The student gives the students the opportunity to get hands-on experience and continued education in a real-world work environment.
   4. The students’ for-credit coursework at LASC CTE. The student earns a Certificate of Skill. 
   5. Students are eligible to participate in a Preceptorship—the opportunity to work with a Fast 5 team (coder, digi-technician, BizTech manager, a Masters Level Student from local University and an Industry Expert) to work with local entrepreneurs on a tech start- up. This is exciting for two reasons: a) it provides local entrepreneurs access to significantly discounted development expertise, helping to launch a successful tech-based business and b) it provides the Innov8 students the opportunity to get hands-on experience on launching a start-up, as well as projects to add to their professional portfolios.
   6. Students are recommended to complete three Preceptorships. The students now have three options: a) four-year degree; b) employment in the tech industry with work experience and impressive portfolios; or c) launch their own start-up.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  One anticipated challenge is institutionalizing the Innov8 Program into the
  Los Angeles Southwest College official, for-credit education track. LASC
  Foundation is working closely with the Dean of CTE to identify and address all
  of the requirements. Moreover, another challenge is getting industry
  representatives to participate. LASC Foundation and Innovate Globally have
  made tremendous inroads by hosting the nationally recognized Start-Up weekend
  at LASC in September 2015. The event, sponsored by Google had representatives
  from dozens of tech companies. Individuals came from many states Successful
  individuals were assigned a Fast 5 team that helped them to develop their
  product over the weekend. LASC Foundation build upon the relationships
  developed while hosting this extraordinary event. Finally, communities of
  color are the biggest consumers of entertaining technology; but very few
  creators. Innov8 seeks to move South LA from consumers to creators.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Innov8 will use a variety of evaluative tools. These include, but are not
  limited to the following: 
   • Number of students enrolled and % that complete classes.
   • Student surveys/questionnaires
   • LASC Institutional Effectiveness department gathers data on all classes taught on campus
   • Number of corporate partners secured for instruction and internships
   • Number of students successfully placed in internships and preceptorships; % complete
   • Number of students enrolled in four year university
   • Number of students placed in viable job
   • Number of students that launch a tech start-up
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There are organizations that are doing portions of our program, but not any
  combine the education and business development like Innov8. 
   
   One of the more famous coding programs is Yes We Code, founded by Van Jones that provides coding instruction for underserved youth. The #YesWeCode initiative targets low-opportunity youth and provides them with the necessary resources and tools to become world-class computer programmers. By learning this highly valuable and relevant 21st century skill, these young people are shifting the trajectory of their futures and transforming their relationships with their communities and their country. 
   
   There are programs that provide entrepreneurial training for teachers. In partnership with the LAUSD and with school districts in Culver City, Downey, and Hawthorne, NFTE Los Angeles Metro trains teachers to engage students from low-income communities as entrepreneurial thinkers using our innovative, hands-on curriculum. Since its opening in 2007, NFTE Los Angeles Metro has provided over 12,000 students with the tools and mindset necessary to prepare for successful futures in school, college and the workforce. There are a myriad of schools that provide training on digital technology. 
   
   However, Innov8 is unique in that we strive to create an entrepreneurial ecosystem that fosters continual education, connected to business opportunity, connected to South Los Angeles. Innov8 seeks to bring the educational and economic dynamism that is found in the Silicon Valley into South Los Angeles. The benefits to the community will include: career awareness, valuable and marketable skills development; entrepreneurial opportunity; work experience and job placement; and the hope of becoming the Southern California tech destination!
