title: Innov8-Helping Other Create Opportunities. South LAs Silicon Valley!
project_summary: >-
  LASC Foundation partnered with Innovate Globally to create a synergistic
  program that accomplishes the following three goals:  1) educate students and
  South Los Angeles residents on the highly marketable skill of coding;  2)
  support business entrepreneurship by providing students and community members
  with “soup to nuts” business instruction and industry exposure for
  tech-related start-ups; and 3) ultimately create a sustainable “Innovation
  Ecosystem” that will encourage indigenous creativity.

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    One anticipated challenge is institutionalizing the Innov8 Program into the
    Los Angeles Southwest College official, for-credit education track.  LASC
    Foundation is working closely with the Dean of CTE to identify and address
    all of the requirements.  Moreover, another challenge is getting industry
    representatives to participate.  LASC Foundation and Innovate Globally have
    made tremendous inroads by hosting the nationally recognized Start-Up
    weekend at LASC in September 2015.  The event, sponsored by Google had
    representatives from dozens of tech companies.  Individuals came from many
    states Successful individuals were assigned a Fast 5 team that helped them
    to develop their product over the weekend.  LASC Foundation build upon the
    relationships developed while hosting this extraordinary event.  Finally,
    communities of color are the biggest consumers of entertaining technology;
    but very few creators.  Innov8 seeks to move South LA from consumers to
    creators.
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Innov8 will use a variety of evaluative tools.  These include, but are not limited to the following: \r\n•\tNumber of students enrolled and % that complete classes.\r\n•\tStudent surveys/questionnaires\r\n•\tLASC Institutional Effectiveness department gathers data on all classes taught on campus\r\n•\tNumber of corporate partners secured for instruction and internships\r\n•\tNumber of students successfully placed in internships and preceptorships; % complete\r\n•\tNumber of students enrolled in four year university\r\n•\tNumber of students placed in viable job\r\n•\tNumber of students that launch a tech start-up\r\n"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "There are organizations that are doing portions of our program, but not any combine the education and business development like Innov8.  \r\n\r\nOne of the more famous coding programs is Yes We Code, founded by Van Jones that provides coding instruction for underserved youth. The #YesWeCode initiative targets low-opportunity youth and provides them with the necessary resources and tools to become world-class computer programmers. By learning this highly valuable and relevant 21st century skill, these young people are shifting the trajectory of their futures and transforming their relationships with their communities and their country.  \r\n\r\nThere are programs that provide entrepreneurial training for teachers.  In partnership with the LAUSD and  with school districts in Culver City, Downey, and Hawthorne, NFTE Los Angeles Metro trains teachers to engage students from low-income communities as entrepreneurial thinkers using our innovative, hands-on curriculum.  Since its opening in 2007, NFTE Los Angeles Metro has provided over 12,000 students with the tools and mindset necessary to prepare for successful futures in school, college and the workforce.  There are a myriad of schools that provide training on digital technology. \r\n\r\nHowever, Innov8 is unique in that we strive to create an entrepreneurial ecosystem that fosters continual education, connected to business opportunity, connected to South Los Angeles.  Innov8 seeks to bring the educational and economic dynamism that is found in the Silicon Valley into South Los Angeles.  The benefits to the community will include: career awareness, valuable and marketable skills development; entrepreneurial opportunity; work experience and job placement; and the hope of becoming the Southern California tech destination!\r\n\r\n"
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "There are three primary partners on the project—LASC Foundation, Innovate Globally and LASC CTE.  Below is a brief description of roles, responsibilities and compensation:\r\n\r\nLASC Foundation is the Project Director and will be fiscally responsible for the project.  The LASC Foundation will be responsible project compliance, fiscal management, identifying and recruiting business partners and facilitating interaction between interactions with the LASC campus.  LASC will receive $50,000 of the funds.\r\n\r\nInnovate Globally is the Education and Program Coordinator.  They are responsible for curriculum development, instruction, educational coordination with LASC, and overseeing internship and preceptorship placements.  Innovate Globally will receive $50,000\r\n\r\nLASC CTE will work with the program to shepherd the project through the Los Angeles Community College District (LACCD) curriculum approval process to ensure the class is approved to issue certificates.  LASC CTE will also make classroom and presentation space available to the program.  LASC CTE is an uncompensated partner.\r\n"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    Innov8 will document our development process with hopes of initial
    increasing the number of students at LASC.  Once the program is successfully
    implemented and integrated into the LASC approved certificated list of
    programs, Innov8 seeks to expand the program to the other eight colleges in
    LACCD.  Ultimately, we hope to package and license the curriculum, making it
    available to community colleges throughout the state and nation as a social
    enterprise.

   1. Students are offered the Introduction to Innovation 72 (I2 I), a 6-week, non-credit class at LASC CTE. The course is an introduction to the core components of the Innov8 program—CodeTechIQ, DigiTechIQ and BizTechIQ. 
   a. CodeTechIQ—students are taught the “back-end of innovation”. They are provided with an introduction to computer coding, as well as a look at how coding is used in industry (web-based, mobile, gaming and other industries). 
   b. DigiTechIQ—students are taught “what drives innovation”. They are instructed on content creation (digital media, web and graphic design, infographics, etc.).
   c.  BizTechIQ—students are taught the “front end” of innovation”. They are given the skills to manage a tech start up. The students get lessons in project management, securing funding, making the pitch and overall business development. 
   2. I2I enables the student to determine their area of interest—Code, Digi or BizTech. Students are then put on an education track with more in-depth introductory course work in their area of interest. Upon completion of one semester of classes, the student receives a Certificate of Knowledge.
   3. The students will then be placed in an 8-12 week internship with an Innov8 industry partner. The student gives the students the opportunity to get hands-on experience and continued education in a real-world work environment.
   4. The students’ for-credit coursework at LASC CTE. The student earns a Certificate of Skill. 
   5.
