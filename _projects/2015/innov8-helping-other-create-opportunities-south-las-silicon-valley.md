  LASC Foundation partnered with Innovate Globally to create a synergistic
  program that accomplishes the following three goals:  1) educate students and
  South Los Angeles residents on the highly marketable skill of coding;  2)
  support business entrepreneurship by providing students and community members
  with “soup to nuts” business instruction and industry exposure for
  tech-related start-ups; and 3) ultimately create a sustainable “Innovation
  Ecosystem” that will encourage indigenous creativity.

  LASC Foundation, in partnership with Innovate Globally and LASC’s Career and
  Technical Education School seek to create a “tech hub” in South Los Angeles. 
   1. Students are offered the Introduction to Innovation 72 (I2 I), a 6-week, non-credit class at LASC CTE. The course is an introduction to the core components of the Innov8 program—CodeTechIQ, DigiTechIQ and BizTechIQ. 
   a. CodeTechIQ—students are taught the “back-end of innovation”. They are provided with an introduction to computer coding, as well as a look at how coding is used in industry (web-based, mobile, gaming and other industries). 
   b. DigiTechIQ—students are taught “what drives innovation”. They are instructed on content creation (digital media, web and graphic design, infographics, etc.).
   c.  BizTechIQ—students are taught the “front end” of innovation”. They are given the skills to manage a tech start up. The students get lessons in project management, securing funding, making the pitch and overall business development. 
   2. I2I enables the student to determine their area of interest—Code, Digi or BizTech. Students are then put on an education track with more in-depth introductory course work in their area of interest. Upon completion of one semester of classes, the student receives a Certificate of Knowledge.
   3. The students will then be placed in an 8-12 week internship with an Innov8 industry partner. The student gives the students the opportunity to get hands-on experience and continued education in a real-world work environment.
   4. The students’ for-credit coursework at LASC CTE. The student earns a Certificate of Skill. 
   5. Students are eligible to participate in a Preceptorship—the opportunity to work with a Fast 5 team (coder, digi-technician, BizTech manager, a Masters Level Student from local University and an Industry Expert) to work with local entrepreneurs on a tech start- up. This is exciting for two reasons: a) it provides local entrepreneurs access to significantly discounted development expertise, helping to launch a successful tech-based business and b) it provides the Innov8 students the opportunity to get hands-on experience on launching a start-up, as well as projects to add to their professional portfolios.
   6. Students are recommended to complete three Preceptorships. The students now have three options: a) four-year degree; b) employment in the tech industry with work experience and impressive portfolios; or c) launch their own start-up.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  One anticipated challenge is institutionalizing the Innov8 Program into the
  Los Angeles Southwest College official, for-credit education track. LASC
  Foundation is working closely with the Dean of CTE to identify and address all
  of the requirements. Moreover, another challenge is getting industry
  representatives to participate. LASC Foundation and Innovate Globally have
  made tremendous inroads by hosting the nationally recognized Start-Up weekend
  at LASC in September 2015. The event, sponsored by Google had representatives
  from dozens of tech companies. Individuals came from many states Successful
  individuals were assigned a Fast 5 team that helped them to develop their
  product over the weekend. LASC Foundation build upon the relationships
  developed while hosting this extraordinary event. Finally, communities of
  color are the biggest consumers of entertaining technology; but very few
  creators. Innov8 seeks to move South LA from consumers to creators.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Innov8 will use a variety of evaluative tools. These include, but are not
  limited to the following: 
   • Number of students enrolled and % that complete classes.
   • Student surveys/questionnaires
   • LASC Institutional Effectiveness department gathers data on all classes taught on campus
   • Number of corporate partners secured for instruction and internships
   • Number of students successfully placed in internships and preceptorships; % complete
   • Number of students enrolled in four year university
   • Number of students placed in viable job
   • Number of students that launch a tech start-up
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There are organizations that are doing portions of our program, but not any
  combine the education and business development like Innov8. 
   
   One of the more famous coding programs is Yes We Code, founded by Van Jones that provides coding instruction for underserved youth. The #YesWeCode initiative targets low-opportunity youth and provides them with the necessary resources and tools to become world-class computer programmers. By learning this highly valuable and relevant 21st century skill, these young people are shifting the trajectory of their futures and transforming their relationships with their communities and their country. 
   
   There are programs that provide entrepreneurial training for teachers. In partnership with the LAUSD and with school districts in Culver City, Downey, and Hawthorne, NFTE Los Angeles Metro trains teachers to engage students from low-income communities as entrepreneurial thinkers using our innovative, hands-on curriculum. Since its opening in 2007, NFTE Los Angeles Metro has provided over 12,000 students with the tools and mindset necessary to prepare for successful futures in school, college and the workforce. There are a myriad of schools that provide training on digital technology. 
   
   However, Innov8 is unique in that we strive to create an entrepreneurial ecosystem that fosters continual education, connected to business opportunity, connected to South Los Angeles. Innov8 seeks to bring the educational and economic dynamism that is found in the Silicon Valley into South Los Angeles. The benefits to the community will include: career awareness, valuable and marketable skills development; entrepreneurial opportunity; work experience and job placement; and the hope of becoming the Southern California tech destination!
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  There are three primary partners on the project—LASC Foundation, Innovate
  Globally and LASC CTE. Below is a brief description of roles, responsibilities
  and compensation:
   
   LASC Foundation is the Project Director and will be fiscally responsible for the project. The LASC Foundation will be responsible project compliance, fiscal management, identifying and recruiting business partners and facilitating interaction between interactions with the LASC campus. LASC will receive $50,000 of the funds.
   
   Innovate Globally is the Education and Program Coordinator. They are responsible for curriculum development, instruction, educational coordination with LASC, and overseeing internship and preceptorship placements. Innovate Globally will receive $50,000
   
   LASC CTE will work with the program to shepherd the project through the Los Angeles Community College District (LACCD) curriculum approval process to ensure the class is approved to issue certificates. LASC CTE will also make classroom and presentation space available to the program. LASC CTE is an uncompensated partner.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  The Innov8 full program budget is $280,000 for the first full year. Additional
  cost will be covered through various fundraising activities such as: grant
  writing, individual donors, corporate sponsorship, events and online donor
  campaigns.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  Anticipated budget:
   Staff and Contractors--$60,000
   Equipment--$20,000
   Marketing--$10,000
   Event--$10,000
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Innov8 will document our development process with hopes of initial increasing
  the number of students at LASC. Once the program is successfully implemented
  and integrated into the LASC approved certificated list of programs, Innov8
  seeks to expand the program to the other eight colleges in LACCD. Ultimately,
  we hope to package and license the curriculum, making it available to
  community colleges throughout the state and nation as a social enterprise.

    answer: "LASC Foundation, in partnership with Innovate Globally and LASC’s Career and Technical Education School seek to create a “tech hub” in South Los Angeles.  \r\n1.\tStudents are offered the Introduction to Innovation 72 (I2 I), a 6-week, non-credit class at LASC CTE.  The course is an introduction to the core components of the Innov8 program—CodeTechIQ, DigiTechIQ and BizTechIQ.  \r\na.\tCodeTechIQ—students are taught the “back-end of innovation”.  They are provided with an introduction to computer coding, as well as a look at how coding is used in industry (web-based, mobile, gaming and other industries).  \r\nb.\tDigiTechIQ—students are taught “what drives innovation”.  They are instructed on content creation (digital media, web and graphic design, infographics, etc.).\r\nc.\t  BizTechIQ—students are taught the “front end” of innovation”.  They are given the skills to manage a tech start up. The students get lessons in project management, securing funding, making the pitch and overall business development.  \r\n2.\t I2I enables the student to determine their area of interest—Code, Digi or BizTech.  Students are then put on an education track with more in-depth introductory course work in their area of interest.  Upon completion of one semester of classes, the student receives a Certificate of Knowledge.\r\n3.\tThe students will then be placed in an 8-12 week internship with an Innov8 industry partner.  The student gives the students the opportunity to get hands-on experience and continued education in a real-world work environment.\r\n4.\tThe students’ for-credit coursework at LASC CTE.  The student earns a Certificate of Skill. \r\n5.\tStudents are eligible to participate in a Preceptorship—the opportunity to work with a Fast 5 team (coder, digi-technician, BizTech manager, a Masters Level Student from local University and an Industry Expert) to work with local entrepreneurs on a tech start- up.  This is exciting for two reasons: a) it provides local entrepreneurs access to significantly discounted development expertise, helping to launch a successful tech-based business and b) it provides the Innov8 students the opportunity to get hands-on experience on launching a start-up, as well as projects to add to their professional portfolios.\r\n6.\tStudents are recommended to complete three Preceptorships.  The students now have three options: a) four-year degree; b) employment in the tech industry with work experience and impressive portfolios; or c) launch their own start-up.  \r\n"

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      One anticipated challenge is institutionalizing the Innov8 Program into
      the Los Angeles Southwest College official, for-credit education track. 
      LASC Foundation is working closely with the Dean of CTE to identify and
      address all of the requirements.  Moreover, another challenge is getting
      industry representatives to participate.  LASC Foundation and Innovate
      Globally have made tremendous inroads by hosting the nationally recognized
      Start-Up weekend at LASC in September 2015.  The event, sponsored by
      Google had representatives from dozens of tech companies.  Individuals
      came from many states Successful individuals were assigned a Fast 5 team
      that helped them to develop their product over the weekend.  LASC
      Foundation build upon the relationships developed while hosting this
      extraordinary event.  Finally, communities of color are the biggest
      consumers of entertaining technology; but very few creators.  Innov8 seeks
      to move South LA from consumers to creators.
  - name: Please explain how you will evaluate your work.
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Innov8 will use a variety of evaluative tools.  These include, but are not limited to the following: \r\n•\tNumber of students enrolled and % that complete classes.\r\n•\tStudent surveys/questionnaires\r\n•\tLASC Institutional Effectiveness department gathers data on all classes taught on campus\r\n•\tNumber of corporate partners secured for instruction and internships\r\n•\tNumber of students successfully placed in internships and preceptorships; % complete\r\n•\tNumber of students enrolled in four year university\r\n•\tNumber of students placed in viable job\r\n•\tNumber of students that launch a tech start-up\r\n"

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "There are organizations that are doing portions of our program, but not any combine the education and business development like Innov8.  \r\n\r\nOne of the more famous coding programs is Yes We Code, founded by Van Jones that provides coding instruction for underserved youth. The #YesWeCode initiative targets low-opportunity youth and provides them with the necessary resources and tools to become world-class computer programmers. By learning this highly valuable and relevant 21st century skill, these young people are shifting the trajectory of their futures and transforming their relationships with their communities and their country.  \r\n\r\nThere are programs that provide entrepreneurial training for teachers.  In partnership with the LAUSD and  with school districts in Culver City, Downey, and Hawthorne, NFTE Los Angeles Metro trains teachers to engage students from low-income communities as entrepreneurial thinkers using our innovative, hands-on curriculum.  Since its opening in 2007, NFTE Los Angeles Metro has provided over 12,000 students with the tools and mindset necessary to prepare for successful futures in school, college and the workforce.  There are a myriad of schools that provide training on digital technology. \r\n\r\nHowever, Innov8 is unique in that we strive to create an entrepreneurial ecosystem that fosters continual education, connected to business opportunity, connected to South Los Angeles.  Innov8 seeks to bring the educational and economic dynamism that is found in the Silicon Valley into South Los Angeles.  The benefits to the community will include: career awareness, valuable and marketable skills development; entrepreneurial opportunity; work experience and job placement; and the hope of becoming the Southern California tech destination!\r\n\r\n"

      Innov8 will document our development process with hopes of initial
      increasing the number of students at LASC.  Once the program is
      successfully implemented and integrated into the LASC approved
      certificated list of programs, Innov8 seeks to expand the program to the
      other eight colleges in LACCD.  Ultimately, we hope to package and license
      the curriculum, making it available to community colleges throughout the
      state and nation as a social enterprise.
