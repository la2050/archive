Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: "LASC Foundation, in partnership with Innovate Globally and LASC’s Career and Technical Education School seek to create a “tech hub” in South Los Angeles.  \r\n1.\tStudents are offered the Introduction to Innovation 72 (I2 I), a 6-week, non-credit class at LASC CTE.  The course is an introduction to the core components of the Innov8 program—CodeTechIQ, DigiTechIQ and BizTechIQ.  \r\na.\tCodeTechIQ—students are taught the “back-end of innovation”.  They are provided with an introduction to computer coding, as well as a look at how coding is used in industry (web-based, mobile, gaming and other industries).  \r\nb.\tDigiTechIQ—students are taught “what drives innovation”.  They are instructed on content creation (digital media, web and graphic design, infographics, etc.).\r\nc.\t  BizTechIQ—students are taught the “front end” of innovation”.  They are given the skills to manage a tech start up. The students get lessons in project management, securing funding, making the pitch and overall business development.  \r\n2.\t I2I enables the student to determine their area of interest—Code, Digi or BizTech.  Students are then put on an education track with more in-depth introductory course work in their area of interest.  Upon completion of one semester of classes, the student receives a Certificate of Knowledge.\r\n3.\tThe students will then be placed in an 8-12 week internship with an Innov8 industry partner.  The student gives the students the opportunity to get hands-on experience and continued education in a real-world work environment.\r\n4.\tThe students’ for-credit coursework at LASC CTE.  The student earns a Certificate of Skill. \r\n5.\tStudents are eligible to participate in a Preceptorship—the opportunity to work with a Fast 5 team (coder, digi-technician, BizTech manager, a Masters Level Student from local University and an Industry Expert) to work with local entrepreneurs on a tech start- up.  This is exciting for two reasons: a) it provides local entrepreneurs access to significantly discounted development expertise, helping to launch a successful tech-based business and b) it provides the Innov8 students the opportunity to get hands-on experience on launching a start-up, as well as projects to add to their professional portfolios.\r\n6.\tStudents are recommended to complete three Preceptorships.  The students now have three options: a) four-year degree; b) employment in the tech industry with work experience and impressive portfolios; or c) launch their own start-up.  \r\n"
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Innov8 will use a variety of evaluative tools.  These include, but are not limited to the following: \r\n•\tNumber of students enrolled and % that complete classes.\r\n•\tStudent surveys/questionnaires\r\n•\tLASC Institutional Effectiveness department gathers data on all classes taught on campus\r\n•\tNumber of corporate partners secured for instruction and internships\r\n•\tNumber of students successfully placed in internships and preceptorships; % complete\r\n•\tNumber of students enrolled in four year university\r\n•\tNumber of students placed in viable job\r\n•\tNumber of students that launch a tech start-up\r\n"
