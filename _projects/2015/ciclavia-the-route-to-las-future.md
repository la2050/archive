  CicLAvia 2016 will expand its open streets program by integrating iconic
  routes with new ones:  Southeast Cities; Northeast San Fernando Valley; the
  Heart of LA, and Wilshire Blvd.  By blending the old with the new, car-free
  Angelenos can bear witness to social, cultural and economic renaissances
  happening from one neighborhood to the next.  The opportunity to see Los
  Angeles, up close and personal vs. in a car and through the rear view mirror,
  redefines the meaning of connection.
Please specify below: >-
  Southeast Cities – Huntington Park, South Gate, Lynwood, Florence/Firestone &
  Walnut Park; Northeast San Fernando Valley - Pacoima, Panorama City, Arleta, &
  North Hills; Downtown Los Angeles, Wilshire Center, Little Tokyo, Chinatown,
  Boyle Heights
category: connect
'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  On the thousands of miles of road we travel by car everyday, we connect to Los
  Angeles via destination points, from point A to point B. CicLAvia shows us
  what we miss in between those points. CicLAvia presents an almost still
  photograph of our city and allows us to focus and engage with our built
  environment and with each other. In essence, we self-propel through our
  streets using our body’s inertia as pedestrians, bicyclists, skateboarders,
  roller skaters and other non-motorized forms of movement. There are no
  windshields to block out the ambient noise of the car’s engine. Instead, it is
  replaced by the ambient noise of footsteps pounding, skateboards running,
  bicycle wheels spinning, gears shifting, chains rubbing, horns and whistles
  sounding, and conversations continuing. We become open to exploring old and
  new neighborhoods in the safety of a car-free environment, thus rediscovering
  our city and region as newly-engaged participants.
   
   Initiated in 2010, CicLAvia is now a major force in transforming attitudes and lifestyle behaviors regarding health, civic engagement, active transportation and the environment. These free open-street events have changed the conversation and are now having a direct impact on related local policy issues. As we complete our fifth year and fifteenth event, we remain enthralled by the stories that CicLAvia tells about our city and region. We are a region of more than 10 million people, and a city that spans more than 465 square miles. But four times a year, CicLAvia makes us feel that our city is small enough to explore in one fell swoop. LA is still relatively young, but we have wise souls willing to share experiences and secret treasures.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Our major challenge lies in the financial support necessary to deliver future
  CicLAvias to a level surpassing past events to encourage the participation of
  more Angelenos and to create new memories and experiences for attendees. Our
  strategy to overcome this obstacle is to diversify our funding base through
  extensive campaigns dedicated to corporate giving as well as foundation and
  government grants. The primary emphasis will be on individual engagement.
  CicLAvia will expand its individual donor base by encouraging more engagement
  from event participants who become more empowered at each event as
  stakeholders in the sustainability of CicLAvia. It is our goal to double
  individual donations every year for the next five years to reach 25% of our
  annual budget.
   
   CicLAvia will continue its commitment to working with Metro & SCAG to expand financial and policy support of open streets events in Los Angeles County to create more active transportation projects.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: |-
  CicLAvia will evaluate impact on:
   
    - Public space CicLAvia creates for people to connect
    - Physical activity increase compared with a normal Sunday (surveys on site)
    - Reduction in crime levels (LAPD stats comparing non-CicLAvia days)
    - Behavior change towards the use of active transportation (surveys on site and after event)
    - Increase in pedestrian and bike use (data from public agency counts)
    - Direct impact on local policy changes on active transportation (implementation of local and regional mobility plans)
    - Number of participants at CicLAvia and track increase in social media penetration using key platforms (Facebook, Twitter, etc.)
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Across the country, open streets events are growing in number since CicLAvia
  began in 2010. Large cities like NYC, San Francisco and Atlanta have events.
  But since 2010, CicLAvia has grown into a recognized national model because of
  its collaborative approach, scale and impact on both the city and the region.
  CicLAvia begins with safety, collaboration and outreach with public officials,
  the local community, community institutions/organizations, and business
  owners. Extensive community outreach occurs prior to each event, and the
  outcomes inform the experiences on each route. Each CicLAvia is about
  celebrating culture, people and each route weaves a new place from whole cloth
  into the city’s fabric. As Adam Leipzig states in Cultural Weekly in April
  2014, “CicLAvia creates the feeling of discovery because it’s organizers
  constantly change its route, and because participants approach it alone on
  bicycles, then suddenly, in turning one corner, discover they are a part of a
  vast collective enterprise. This is one way that creative culture moves and
  spreads – through the emotions of anticipation and discovery. It’s the Law of
  Discovery, and CicLAvia illustrates it on city streets for all to see.”
   
   CicLAvia is also about changing the public conversation of our built environment, and how we interact with it. The experiences at CicLAvia inform public policy shifts at all levels of local and regional governance. Key city and regional agencies have launched efforts to support active transportation – with METRO open streets initiative and LA’s Mobility Plan 2035. 
   
   CicLAvia has changed attitudes about the car culture of Los Angeles by shifting the perceptions and attitudes of local stakeholders who affect local transportation and environmental policies and the design of our streets. A shift towards a commitment to safety with a focus on serving the most vulnerable users including children, seniors, persons with disabilities and transit-dependent populations, will make streets safe for all users.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  The $100,000 LA2050 grant is designated to CicLAvia’s support planning and
  implementing of four events in 2016. The LA2050 grant will help support the
  infrastructure costs, such as tent and booth expenses at the hubs and along
  the route associated with first aid, bike repair, and community information
  for community organizational partners and local agencies. Additionally, the
  grant will help support the organizing of over 2200 volunteers involved in
  every aspect of CicLAvia production, including work prior to, during and after
  the event. They assist in community and business outreach; providing safe
  crossing during the event; staffing of information booths; and serve as
  general ambassadors of goodwill. 
   
   CicLAvia partners with all relevant city and county agencies, including Transportation, Cultural Affairs, LAPD, LADWP, Fire, and others who provide the public services for the route. Outreach and programming of CicLAvia involves partnerships with community organizations, local religious institutions, and business owners to enhance the experiences on the routes.

'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  As shown in the detailed Budget below, the total direct Project Cost (not
  including staffing) to produce and implement four CicLAvia events in 2016 is
  $611,507 with $100,000 from LA2050 and the additional $511,507 costs supported
  by foundation grants and gifts, government agency sources, individual and
  organizational donations. The majority of expenses are related to traffic
  management; expenses to set up, coordinate and construct the hubs at each
  event and for communications and security. LA2050 funding will be contributing
  to all cost categories in the Budget provided below at a rate of 16% of the
  total budget. 84% of the total budget will come from other sources.

How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  The goal of CicLAvia is to gradually increase the frequency of the events from
  four times per year to one per month. In order to deliver more CicLAvias to
  different parts of the region, it will require active engagement of new
  communities and new cities, and key local and regional stakeholders. As in
  past CicLAvias, we will continue to document and share the environmental,
  social and economic benefits of open streets events. We are confident that the
  measurement of impact through metrics and evaluation could encourage more
  CicLAvia events more often and in more places. We do this by:
   
   - Measuring the improvement in air quality when alternative modes of transportation are used;
   - Documenting the creation of temporary open space and recreation opportunities created by opening up streets to pedestrians and bicyclists;
   - Showing the positive local economic benefits as a results of CicLAvia during the day of, and weeks after the event with new customers;
   - Continuing to focus resources on public safety on the route for participants;
   - Streamlining the production costs to capitalize on economies of scale.
   
   Since 2010, the success of CicLAvia has resonated not only across the region, but also throughout the country. Open streets events have taken place in many of the country’s urban and rural cities, and CicLAvia has been the national model. While CicLAvia events are often measured by the number of participants, the success of the events will be strengthened by the overall positive impacts on our quality of life. CicLAvia improves air quality and increases the benefits to the local economy. It reinforces positive change in local and regional alternative transportation policies, and encourages conversation in creating new open space. And CicLAvia brings communities closer and makes people more connected to each other.

  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "The goal of CicLAvia is to gradually increase the frequency of the events from four times per year to one per month.

While CicLAvia events are often measured by the number of participants, the success of the events will be strengthened by the overall positive impacts on our quality of life.  CicLAvia improves air quality and increases the benefits to the local economy.  It reinforces positive change in local and regional alternative transportation policies, and encourages conversation in creating new open space.  And CicLAvia brings communities closer and makes people more connected to each other.  \r\n"

      CicLAvia 2016 will expand its open streets program by integrating iconic
      routes with new ones:  Southeast Cities; Northeast San Fernando Valley;
      the Heart of LA, and Wilshire Blvd.  By blending the old with the new,
      car-free Angelenos can bear witness to social, cultural and economic
      renaissances happening from one neighborhood to the next.  The opportunity
      to see Los Angeles, up close and personal vs. in a car and through the

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "On the thousands of miles of road we travel by car everyday, we connect to Los Angeles via destination points, from point A to point B.   CicLAvia shows us what we miss in between those points.  CicLAvia presents an almost still photograph of our city and allows us to focus and engage with our built environment and with each other.  In essence, we self-propel through our streets using our body’s inertia as pedestrians, bicyclists, skateboarders, roller skaters and other non-motorized forms of movement.  There are no windshields to block out the ambient noise of the car’s engine.  Instead, it is replaced by the ambient noise of footsteps pounding, skateboards running, bicycle wheels spinning, gears shifting, chains rubbing, horns and whistles sounding, and conversations continuing. We become open to exploring old and new neighborhoods in the safety of a car-free environment, thus rediscovering our city and region as newly-engaged participants.\r\n\r\nInitiated in 2010, CicLAvia is now a major force in transforming attitudes and lifestyle behaviors regarding health, civic engagement, active transportation and the environment. These free open-street events have changed the conversation and are now having a direct impact on related local policy issues.  As we complete our fifth year and fifteenth event, we remain enthralled by the stories that CicLAvia tells about our city and region.  We are a region of more than 10 million people, and a city that spans more than 465 square miles.  But four times a year, CicLAvia makes us feel that our city is small enough to explore in one fell swoop.  LA is still relatively young, but we have wise souls willing to share experiences and secret treasures.\r\n"

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Our major challenge lies in the financial support necessary to deliver future CicLAvias to a level surpassing past events to encourage the participation of more Angelenos and to create new memories and experiences for attendees. Our strategy to overcome this obstacle is to diversify our funding base through extensive campaigns dedicated to corporate giving as well as foundation and government grants. The primary emphasis will be on individual engagement. CicLAvia will expand its individual donor base by encouraging more engagement from event participants who become more empowered at each event as stakeholders in the sustainability of CicLAvia. It is our goal to double individual donations every year for the next five years to reach 25% of our annual budget.\r\n\r\nCicLAvia will continue its commitment to working with Metro & SCAG to expand financial and policy support of open streets events in Los Angeles County to create more active transportation projects.\r\n"
  - name: Please explain how you will evaluate your work.

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Across the country, open streets events are growing in number since CicLAvia began in 2010.  Large cities like NYC, San Francisco and Atlanta have events.  But since 2010, CicLAvia has grown into a recognized national model because of its collaborative approach, scale and impact on both the city and the region.  CicLAvia begins with safety, collaboration and outreach with public officials, the local community, community institutions/organizations, and business owners. Extensive community outreach occurs prior to each event, and the outcomes inform the experiences on each route.  Each CicLAvia is about celebrating culture, people and each route weaves a new place from whole cloth into the city’s fabric.  As Adam Leipzig states in Cultural Weekly in April 2014, “CicLAvia creates the feeling of discovery because it’s organizers constantly change its route, and because participants approach it alone on bicycles, then suddenly, in turning one corner, discover they are a part of a vast collective enterprise. This is one way that creative culture moves and spreads – through the emotions of anticipation and discovery. It’s the Law of Discovery, and CicLAvia illustrates it on city streets for all to see.”\r\n\r\nCicLAvia is also about changing the public conversation of our built environment, and how we interact with it.  The experiences at CicLAvia inform public policy shifts at all levels of local and regional governance.  Key city and regional agencies have launched efforts to support active transportation – with METRO open streets initiative and LA’s Mobility Plan 2035. \r\n\r\nCicLAvia has changed attitudes about the car culture of Los Angeles by shifting the perceptions and attitudes of local stakeholders who affect local transportation and environmental policies and the design of our streets. A shift towards a commitment to safety with a focus on serving the most vulnerable users including children, seniors, persons with disabilities and transit-dependent populations, will make streets safe for all users.\r\n"

      this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner
      receive?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "The $100,000 LA2050 grant is designated to CicLAvia’s support planning and implementing of four events in 2016. The LA2050 grant will help support the infrastructure costs, such as tent and booth expenses at the hubs and along the route associated with first aid, bike repair, and community information for community organizational partners and local agencies.  Additionally, the grant will help support the organizing of over 2200 volunteers involved in every aspect of CicLAvia production, including work prior to, during and after the event. They assist in community and business outreach; providing safe crossing during the event; staffing of information booths; and serve as general ambassadors of goodwill. \r\n\r\nCicLAvia partners with all relevant city and county agencies, including Transportation, Cultural Affairs, LAPD, LADWP, Fire, and others who provide the public services for the route.  Outreach and programming of CicLAvia involves partnerships with community organizations, local religious institutions, and business owners to enhance the experiences on the routes.   Partnerships for CicLAvia 2016 include:\r\n\r\nOrganizational Partners:\r\n- Bureau of Sanitation, City of LA\r\n- Bureau of Street Services\r\n- California State Senate 33rd District, Senator Ricardo Lara\r\n- Chinatown Business Improvement District\r\n- Chinatown Service Center\r\n- City of Huntington Park\r\n- City of Los Angeles Council District 14 - Jose Huizar\r\n- City of Los Angeles Mayor’s Office\r\n- City of Lynwood\r\n- City of South Gate\r\n- Community Health Councils\r\n- Department of Recreation and Parks, City of Los Angeles\r\n- Department of Transportation, City of Los Angeles\r\n- East LA College (ELAC)\r\n- East Los Angeles Community Corporation\r\n- East Yard Communities for Environmental Justice\r\n- Gateway Cities Council of Governments\r\n- Joe Buscaino, Councilmember, 15th District\r\n- Korean Cultural Center\r\n- LAPD\r\n- Los Angeles County Department of Parks and Recreation\r\n- Los Angeles County Sheriff’  (LASD)\r\n- Metro\r\n- Miracle Mile Chamber of Commerce\r\n- New Hope Baptist Church\r\n- Office of Council Member Gilbert Cedillo - CD 1\r\n- Office of Hilda Solis, Los Angeles County Supervisor, First District\r\n- PLACE Program LA County Dept of Public Health\r\n- Policies for Livable, Active Communities and Environments\r\n- Safe Moves\r\n- St James Episcopal Church\r\n- Weingart East Los Angeles YMCA Southeast Rio Vista YMCA\r\n- Westlake South Neighborhood Council\r\n- Wilshire United Methodist Church\r\n\r\n"

    answer: "The goal of CicLAvia is to gradually increase the frequency of the events from four times per year to one per month.  In order to deliver more CicLAvias to different parts of the region, it will require active engagement of new communities and new cities, and key local and regional stakeholders.  As in past CicLAvias, we will continue to document and share the environmental, social and economic benefits of open streets events.  We are confident that the measurement of impact through metrics and evaluation could encourage more CicLAvia events more often and in more places.  We do this by:\r\n\r\n- Measuring the improvement in air quality when alternative modes of transportation are used;\r\n- Documenting the creation of temporary open space and recreation opportunities created by opening up streets to pedestrians and bicyclists;\r\n- Showing the positive local economic benefits as a results of CicLAvia during the day of, and weeks after the event with new customers;\r\n- Continuing to focus resources on public safety on the route for participants;\r\n- Streamlining the production costs to capitalize on economies of scale.\r\n\r\nSince 2010, the success of CicLAvia has resonated not only across the region, but also throughout the country.  Open streets events have taken place in many of the country’s urban and rural cities, and CicLAvia has been the national model.  While CicLAvia events are often measured by the number of participants, the success of the events will be strengthened by the overall positive impacts on our quality of life.  CicLAvia improves air quality and increases the benefits to the local economy.  It reinforces positive change in local and regional alternative transportation policies, and encourages conversation in creating new open space.  And CicLAvia brings communities closer and makes people more connected to each other.  \r\n"
