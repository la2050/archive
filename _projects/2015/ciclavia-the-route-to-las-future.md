title: 'CicLAvia: The Route to LA’s Future'
project_summary: >-
  CicLAvia 2016 will expand its open streets program by integrating iconic
  routes with new ones:  Southeast Cities; Northeast San Fernando Valley; the
  Heart of LA, and Wilshire Blvd.  By blending the old with the new, car-free
  Angelenos can bear witness to social, cultural and economic renaissances
  happening from one neighborhood to the next.  The opportunity to see Los
  Angeles, up close and personal vs. in a car and through the rear view mirror,
  redefines the meaning of connection.

Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "On the thousands of miles of road we travel by car everyday, we connect to Los Angeles via destination points, from point A to point B.   CicLAvia shows us what we miss in between those points.  CicLAvia presents an almost still photograph of our city and allows us to focus and engage with our built environment and with each other.  In essence, we self-propel through our streets using our body’s inertia as pedestrians, bicyclists, skateboarders, roller skaters and other non-motorized forms of movement.  There are no windshields to block out the ambient noise of the car’s engine.  Instead, it is replaced by the ambient noise of footsteps pounding, skateboards running, bicycle wheels spinning, gears shifting, chains rubbing, horns and whistles sounding, and conversations continuing. We become open to exploring old and new neighborhoods in the safety of a car-free environment, thus rediscovering our city and region as newly-engaged participants.\r\n\r\nInitiated in 2010, CicLAvia is now a major force in transforming attitudes and lifestyle behaviors regarding health, civic engagement, active transportation and the environment. These free open-street events have changed the conversation and are now having a direct impact on related local policy issues.  As we complete our fifth year and fifteenth event, we remain enthralled by the stories that CicLAvia tells about our city and region.  We are a region of more than 10 million people, and a city that spans more than 465 square miles.  But four times a year, CicLAvia makes us feel that our city is small enough to explore in one fell swoop.  LA is still relatively young, but we have wise souls willing to share experiences and secret treasures.\r\n"
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "CicLAvia will evaluate impact on:\r\n\r\n - Public space CicLAvia creates for people to connect\r\n - Physical activity increase compared with a normal Sunday (surveys on site)\r\n - Reduction in crime levels (LAPD stats comparing non-CicLAvia days)\r\n - Behavior change towards the use of active transportation (surveys on site and after event)\r\n - Increase in pedestrian and bike use (data from public agency counts)\r\n - Direct impact on local policy changes on active transportation (implementation of local and regional mobility plans)\r\n - Number of participants at CicLAvia and track increase in social media penetration using key platforms (Facebook, Twitter, etc.)\r\n"
