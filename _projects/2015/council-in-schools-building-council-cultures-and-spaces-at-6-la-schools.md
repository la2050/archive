title: 'Council in Schools: Building Council Cultures and Spaces at 6 LA Schools'
project_summary: >-
  We are Council in Schools. "Council" is a circle form of dialogue that builds
  trust, understanding, and awareness, and that fosters engaged, compassionate
  school communities. We propose to work with teachers, staff, students, and
  families at six Los Angeles public schools (see below) to implement council
  and "restorative practices" programs and to collaborate on the design and
  construction of a dedicated council space at one of those schools.

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "Learning is a relational process. Research shows relationship affects every aspect of students’ mental and physical health and academic achievement. Studies document the impact on absenteeism, self-esteem, bullying, aggression, violence, sexual harassment, substance abuse, psychological well-being, rates of suspension and expulsion, motivation to learn, academic achievement, graduation rates…and more. “A Review of School Climate Research,” Thapa, et al. (2013) Review of Educational Research.\r\nMany students feel alienated, disengaged, fear, and mistrust at school. Underachievement, drop-out, bullying, violence, and burnout are the byproducts. Perhaps ironically, the explosion of electronic communication, social networking, and virtual connectedness often exacerbates the lack of real connection so many feel.\r\nIt doesn't have to be this way. The processes that shape relationships in schools are essential. Council is a structured process of communication that helps participants connect with themselves and others and that provides space for emotional, social, and moral development alongside the mental and physical. It is an instructional strategy to explore themes and topics from the academic curriculum and make the academic relevant to students’ lives. It is an inclusive process that promotes an environment of trust and respect. It is a mindfulness practice that helps students become more aware of themselves and others and more adept at managing emotions and behavior. It is a leadership tool to harvest the collective wisdom of a group and take informed action. It is a community-building tool and the foundation for a “restorative justice” approach to school discipline.\r\nHolding a council involves a few basic elements, the main ones being  sitting in a circle – where all are equal and everyone can see and be seen; using a talking piece – to focus attention and shift habitual ways of listening and speaking; and practicing the intention to listen and speak “from the heart.” Simple as the process is, it's power to connect  transforms schools and lives.\r\nLast year we started council and restorative practices programs with the 6 schools that are part of this proposal. The impact was profound and the schools all committed to making these practices core parts of their school cultures. We want to provide two more years of training and mentoring, at which point the schools will be able to sustain their council and restorative practices programs with minimal support. "

   Last year we started council and restorative practices programs with the 6 schools that are part of this proposal.

We want to provide two more years of training and mentoring, at which point the schools will be able to sustain their council and restorative practices programs with minimal support.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Council and RP are good for students, educators, schools, families, and
  communities, as confirmed by evidence that use of these practices has reduced
  suspensions and expulsions, decreased incidence of bullying, increased
  feelings of safety and belonging, raised GPAs, and increased teacher job
  satisfaction. While the benefits are clear and compelling, establishing and
  sustaining circle practices shifts school culture and shakes up the status
  quo, and can be met with fear, resistance, and uncertainty. Success requires
  visionary school leaders willing to invest time and resources to make
  relational practices a school-wide priority. Having worked with the Bright
  Star and Gardner leaders last year, we chose them for this project confident
  they will help make it a success.
   Building the council space at Gardner will require obtaining district permission. We don't anticipate a problem and will rely on Gardner's principal and our architect partner, both experienced with similar projects.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We will use a combination of quantitive metrics and qualitative surveys to
  evaluate our work, including: attendance/truancy rates; suspension and
  expulsion rates; disciplinary referral rates; bullying complaint rates; rates
  of disciplinary incidents resolved through "restorative practices";
  standardized test scores; grade point average; students' perceived senses of
  safety, belonging, and fairness at school; students' reported level of
  engagement in school; and staffs' perceived senses of effectiveness, purpose,
  and solidarity at school.
   In addition, we want to collaborate on devising better metrics that more meaningful reflect the short and long-term impact of our work.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Council in Schools and The Ojai Foundation have been bringing council into Los
  Angeles schools for over 30 years have been the only organization doing this
  work. Over the last few years, restorative practices have emerged as an
  alternative to traditional school discipline processes, which are often
  punitive, exclusionary, and ineffective. 
   Like council, restorative justice has its roots in the ways of indigenous peoples and involves a facilitated circle form of dialogue. 
   As providers have emerged to meet the burgeoning demand for restorative practices in schools, they recognized that circles are not effective if they are used only to address problems and to restore community when harm has been caused. Rather, circles must also be used to build community. If community has not been built, then there is nothing to restore when things go wrong. Restorative practices organizations have begun developing their own versions of council, which go by a variety of names, such as "morning meeting" and "community circle." Other organizations providing restorative practices training and implementation to Los Angeles schools include: the California Conference for Equality and Justice, Community Matters, and Restorative Justice for Oakland Youth.
   While other organizations have begun doing work similar to council, our approach remains unique. With a history of success bringing council into schools, CIS has a team of experienced council trainers and a library of council curriculum. Unlike other community-building circle processes, which frequently ask participants to share their feelings or opinions on issues, council prompts typically elicit stories from participants' lived experience, as it is the sharing of story that best evokes our compassion for one another, not our opinions nor even our feelings if they don't include our story. We have also developed plans and templates to help educators integrate council into both the academic and social-emotional lives of students. Whereas other organizations often send their people to run community-building circles for teachers, we emphasize training and mentoring so that teachers and administrators take ownership of their councils themselves and the school becomes self-sufficient. We also offer council-based retreats at The Ojai Foundation and other locations where participants can deepen their practice by withdrawing from the city for a day or a weekend and reconnecting with the natural world.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': |-
  Our partners/collaborators on this project will be:
   Bright Star Charter Academy (charter management organization) and the five Bright Star schools
   Gardner Street Elementary School
   Beth Ann Morrison, graduate student in Otis College of Art and Design's Public Practice program
   K. Ben Loescher, AIA, ICC, LEED AP, Registered Architect; Founding Principal of Loescher Meachem Architects; Program Manager at the Center for Land Use Interpretation
   
   Our partners/collaborators will not receive any part of the $100,000 grant award directly, other than a stipend of $2,000 to be paid to Mr. Loescher for his design and permitting work on the council space project. $67,000 is budgeted for expanding council and restorative practices at the five Bright Star Schools and $23,000 is budgeted for expanding the council program at Gardner and designing and building the dedicated council space.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Our work is, by its nature, self-propagating. As we train and mentor educators
  who become practitioners and facilitators of council, and as more young people
  participate in councils in their schools, the numbers of council carriers
  grows and the practice spreads.
   We are also at a time in our cultural development when the power and value of circle practices are being remembered. With the growth of the restorative justice movement, there is growing demand for the work we do. We expect the success of this project will create more demand for our services. The Bright Star organization is doing amazing work with severely underserved populations in some of LA's most difficult communities, and council is playing a big part in their success. Opportunities to work with other charter schools are and will continue emerging from our work with Bright Star. 
   The council space we are building at Gardner will bring additional attention to our work and additional opportunities to work with other schools, and to collaborate with other artists and architects interested in creating spaces for circle conversations.
