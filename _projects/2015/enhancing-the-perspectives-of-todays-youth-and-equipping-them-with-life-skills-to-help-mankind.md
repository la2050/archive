  KASIF will provide educational training, counseling services and resources to
  help young people thrive and survive through positive, productive outreach;
  assisting them on their journey towards living healthier lifestyles and
  becoming productive citizens.
   
   KASIF will accomplish our goals through some of the following strategies:
   
   Partner with local state agencies and community groups to facilitate and administer on-site educational workshops
   Host on-site and off-site conferences to provide the aforementioned educational workshops combined with counseling. This counseling will allow participants to speak in confidence with licensed collaborating counselors.
   
   KASIF’s focus is to implement methods for prevention, while also applying intervention strategies. We will help participants become clearer about their own identity and abilities – what they want in life - their life vision - and how to consciously transform their life for the better. No matter what they may be dealing with, they will learn how their beliefs and actions can shape the rest of their life. 
   
   Our supportive services will be designed to help individuals and families find the strength within themselves to improve their lives. From anger management to parenting education, to substance abuse and prevention, KASIF will help produce positive long-term outcomes. 
   
   KASIF’s self-development programs will help those challenged with self-destructive habits, while helping participants develop positive strategies to address the causes and effects of their lives. 
   
   To advance our efforts, we will form collaborations with local hospitals, community leaders, grass roots organizations, and community members, in order to help our participants become more self-reliant and empowered. 
   
   The essence of our work is a learning process that will continue throughout the lives of the individuals themselves. Education, training, practice, accompaniment, and evaluation will be the basis of our work.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Prejudice. By educating others to respect cultural, racial, ethnic and
  religion differences.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We are currently seeking collaboration with licensed and skilled pediatric and
  adolescent mental health clinicians who possess the expertise to properly
  evaluate the effectiveness of our programs and their application.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There are other organizations with similar mission statements, but what makes
  KASIF's approach unique, are the life experiences, testimonies, and unique
  skill sets of the staff KASIF team members, as well as the manner in which
  KASIF delivers its programs. KASIF performs face to face presentations, using
  extremely hard-hitting testimonials, and videos, that literally shocks the
  conscious of the audience members, i.e. likened to the infamous, "Scared
  Straight" approach. KASIF is also positioning itself to implement a "social
  movement" with it's Somer's Drive Alive Project, to ultimately bring about a
  complete cessation to impaired and distracted driving of automobiles,
  especially by today's youth, and that is the number one cause of death amongst
  teenagers in America!
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  (None at the present time. However we are open to collaborating in order to
  enhance our effectiveness and our reach across all strata of our society)
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Through collaborations with outside professionals I'll be able to scale the
  success of my proposal, and make the necessary adjustments when those same
  experts deem it necessary to accomplish the greatest degree of impact and
  effectiveness.
