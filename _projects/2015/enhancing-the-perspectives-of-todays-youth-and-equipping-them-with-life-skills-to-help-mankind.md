    There are other organizations with similar mission statements, but what
    makes KASIF's approach unique, are the life experiences, testimonies, and
    unique skill sets of the staff KASIF team members, as well as the manner in
    which KASIF delivers its programs. KASIF performs face to face
    presentations, using extremely hard-hitting testimonials, and videos, that
    literally shocks the conscious of the audience members, i.e.  likened to the
    infamous, "Scared Straight" approach. KASIF is also positioning itself to
    implement a "social movement" with it's Somer's Drive Alive Project, to
    ultimately bring about a complete cessation to impaired and distracted
    driving of automobiles, especially by today's youth, and that is the number
    one cause of death amongst teenagers in America!

    answer: "KASIF will provide educational training, counseling services and resources to help young people\_thrive and survive through positive, productive outreach; assisting them on their journey towards living healthier lifestyles and becoming productive citizens.\r\n\r\nKASIF will accomplish our goals through some of the following strategies:\r\n\r\nPartner with local state agencies and community groups to facilitate and administer on-site educational workshops\r\nHost on-site and off-site conferences to provide the aforementioned educational workshops combined with counseling.  This counseling will allow participants to speak in confidence with licensed collaborating counselors.\r\n\r\nKASIF’s focus is to implement methods for prevention, while also applying intervention strategies.  We will help participants become clearer about their own identity and abilities – what they want in life - their life vision - and how to consciously transform their life for the better.   No matter what they may be dealing with, they will learn how their beliefs and actions can shape the rest of their life.  \r\n\r\nOur supportive services will be designed to help individuals and families find the strength within themselves to improve their lives. From anger management to parenting education, to substance abuse and prevention, KASIF will help produce positive long-term outcomes. \r\n\r\nKASIF’s self-development programs will help those challenged with self-destructive habits, while helping participants develop positive strategies to address the causes and effects of their lives.  \r\n\r\nTo advance our efforts, we will form collaborations with local hospitals, community leaders, grass roots organizations, and community members, in order to help our participants become more self-reliant and empowered.  \r\n\r\nThe essence of our work is a learning process that will continue throughout the lives of the individuals themselves.  Education, training, practice, accompaniment, and evaluation will be the basis of our work. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      Prejudice. By educating others to respect cultural, racial, ethnic and
      religion differences.
  - name: Please explain how you will evaluate your work.
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      We are currently seeking collaboration with licensed and skilled pediatric

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      There are other organizations with similar mission statements, but what
      makes KASIF's approach unique, are the life experiences, testimonies, and
      unique skill sets of the staff KASIF team members, as well as the manner
      in which KASIF delivers its programs. KASIF performs face to face
      presentations, using extremely hard-hitting testimonials, and videos, that
      literally shocks the conscious of the audience members, i.e.  likened to
      the infamous, "Scared Straight" approach. KASIF is also positioning itself
      to implement a "social movement" with it's Somer's Drive Alive Project, to
      ultimately bring about a complete cessation to impaired and distracted
      driving of automobiles, especially by today's youth, and that is the
      number one cause of death amongst teenagers in America!
