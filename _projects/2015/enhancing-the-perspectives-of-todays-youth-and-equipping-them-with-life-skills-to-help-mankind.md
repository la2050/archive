    There are other organizations with similar mission statements, but what
    makes KASIF's approach unique, are the life experiences, testimonies, and
    unique skill sets of the staff KASIF team members, as well as the manner in
    which KASIF delivers its programs. KASIF performs face to face
    presentations, using extremely hard-hitting testimonials, and videos, that
    literally shocks the conscious of the audience members, i.e.  likened to the
    infamous, "Scared Straight" approach. KASIF is also positioning itself to
    implement a "social movement" with it's Somer's Drive Alive Project, to
    ultimately bring about a complete cessation to impaired and distracted
    driving of automobiles, especially by today's youth, and that is the number
    one cause of death amongst teenagers in America!
