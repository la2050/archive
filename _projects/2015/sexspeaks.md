  Through ongoing projects that use storytelling, multimedia and liberation arts
  practices derived from Theatre of the Oppressed pedagogy and participatory
  action research, #sexspeaks aims to promote healing, education and
  self-empowerment of Black Women. By sharing the truth of our own lived
  experiences, we plan to continue engaging Black Women to feel confident in
  making informed and intuitive decisions about their bodies, sexualities,
  reproductive and mental health.
