Where will you be working?:
  - San Gabriel Valley
How do you plan to use these resources to make change?:
  - Implement a pilot or new project
How will your proposal improve the following “Connect” metrics?:
  - Rates of volunteerism
  - Adults getting sufficient social & emotional support
  - Percentage of Angelenos that volunteer informally (Dream Metric)
Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "Unemployment is an endemic disease that affects lives and the economy; young people are affected the most. Over the lifetime of 6.7 million unemployed Americans who are currently ages 16-34, it is estimated to cost the U.S. $1.5 trillion in government subsidized assistance and loss in tax revenue.\r\n \r\nThe highest percentage of unemployed adults are 18-24 year olds college students who lack essential skills in the workplace.  Our organization will provide hands-on essential/soft skills training for college students.  Students will volunteer their time as interns to help high school students achieve success.\r\n \r\nMAPS will provide two opportunities: 1.  host intentional events and workshops and 2. establish a volunteer/internship program designed for college students.\r\n\r\n1. These events are tailored to bridge students with agencies. We will invite students, businesses, job recruiting agencies, colleges, and leaders to create a seamless interagency network to create opportunities for students to be employed and companies to recruit qualified candidates who may have been missed in the pile of job applicants.\r\n \r\n2. Student interns/volunteers will be able to gain experience through training and completing hands on tasks that will prepare them to reach their full potential in the industry of their choice. Students will also be able to volunteer and help with the preparation of events."
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "MAPS will be evaluated by the number of events and workshops hosted, number of people who attended, and number of volunteers and interns and hours completed. \r\n\r\nThe workshops and events hosted would also be evaluated through surveys by those who attended the events."
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
  - Money (financial capital)
  - Volunteers/staff (human capital)
  - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
  - Education/training

  - Community outreach
  - Network/relationship support
