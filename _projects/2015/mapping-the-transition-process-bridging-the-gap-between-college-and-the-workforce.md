  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "Unemployment is an endemic disease that affects lives and the economy; young people are affected the most. Over the lifetime of 6.7 million unemployed Americans who are currently ages 16-34, it is estimated to cost the U.S. $1.5 trillion in government subsidized assistance and loss in tax revenue.\r\n \r\nThe highest percentage of unemployed adults are 18-24 year olds college students who lack essential skills in the workplace.  Our organization will provide hands-on essential/soft skills training for college students.  Students will volunteer their time as interns to help high school students achieve success.\r\n \r\nMAPS will provide two opportunities: 1.  host intentional events and workshops and 2. establish a volunteer/internship program designed for college students.\r\n\r\n1. These events are tailored to bridge students with agencies. We will invite students, businesses, job recruiting agencies, colleges, and leaders to create a seamless interagency network to create opportunities for students to be employed and companies to recruit qualified candidates who may have been missed in the pile of job applicants.\r\n \r\n2. Student interns/volunteers will be able to gain experience through training and completing hands on tasks that will prepare them to reach their full potential in the industry of their choice. Students will also be able to volunteer and help with the preparation of events."

  Unemployment is an endemic disease that affects lives and the economy; young
  people are affected the most. Over the lifetime of 6.7 million unemployed
  Americans who are currently ages 16-34, it is estimated to cost the U.S. $1.5
  trillion in government subsidized assistance and loss in tax revenue.
    
   The highest percentage of unemployed adults are 18-24 year olds college students who lack essential skills in the workplace. Our organization will provide hands-on essential/soft skills training for college students. Students will volunteer their time as interns to help high school students achieve success.
    
   MAPS will provide two opportunities: 1. host intentional events and workshops and 2. establish a volunteer/internship program designed for college students.
   
   1. These events are tailored to bridge students with agencies. We will invite students, businesses, job recruiting agencies, colleges, and leaders to create a seamless interagency network to create opportunities for students to be employed and companies to recruit qualified candidates who may have been missed in the pile of job applicants.
    
   2. Student interns/volunteers will be able to gain experience through training and completing hands on tasks that will prepare them to reach their full potential in the industry of their choice. Students will also be able to volunteer and help with the preparation of events.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  The former CEO has been preparing former MAPS student to become the next
  Executive Director since 2011. This grant will provide the new Executive
  Director an opportunity to rebrand and relaunch MAPS. The strategy is to have
  the former CEO continue to mentor the ED to ensure the grant and organization
  will be a success.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  MAPS will be evaluated by the number of events and workshops hosted, number of
  people who attended, and number of volunteers and interns and hours
  completed. 
   
   The workshops and events hosted would also be evaluated through surveys by those who attended the events.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Many organizations provide employment services, but they focus on helping
  people secure jobs. Some agencies provide emotional and social support and
  training, but the services only graze the surface. Former CEO, Dr. Koo, will
  use her proprietary approach to address the root issues people experience to
  not only reduce and eliminate unwanted social and emotional barriers, but also
  provide a path to help them secure employment. Previously, Dr. Koo has
  provided her proprietary approach to long-term, unemployed adults; results of
  the program are being reviewed by leaders who focus on workforce development.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  SELACO-WIB, City of Baldwin Park, Mount Saint Mary’s University (student
  clubs), Project SPICES, and businesses. Some partners may receive grant award,
  but as of now, funding will remain in-house.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  MAPS anticipates expanding its services by continually collaborating with job
  recruitment agencies, chambers of commerce, businesses, corporations, and
  colleges. We plan to expand our training services at prospective agency sites
  and ensure students have the essential skills to successfully navigate the
  workforce.
