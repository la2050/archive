  'DESCRIBE IN GREATER DETAIL HOW YOU WILL MAKE LA THE HEALTHIEST PLACE TO LIVE: ': "Dharma Health Institute offers health and wellness services, and education for the health culture community. Health, longevity and quality of life are a passion for us; we believe good health is a shared personal and community responsibility. We treat clients who have or are at risk for diabetes, hypertension, high blood pressure, arthritis, heart disease, obesity, chronic diseases, anxiety, depression, pain issues, and others who are pursuing a healthier lifestyle. We are a resource for partner clinicians of various disciplines that find it beneficial to add Dharma services to their clients’ health and wellness regimen. All healthcare practitioners are licensed by the State of California to provide primary healthcare for children and adults. \r\n\r\nDharma Health Institute offers classes in Tai Chi, Qi Gong, Yoga, Dharma Youth, Family Fitness as well as a number of Preventative and Integrative Health services. We also offer acupuncture, acupressure, nutrition, herbs, and nutraceuticals, as well as number of integrative modalities such as Hyperbaric Oxygen, Enhanced External Counterpulsation (EECP), Infrared Sauna, Neuroplasticity and Mental Health services. \r\n\r\nWe want to introduce our health services to those who do not have the means to create a holistic approach to their health and wellness. For example, one of our community partners shared the story of a 30 year-old Latina, mother of three with a weight problem. She has not yet been approved through her Medi-Cal HMO to see a dietician and is experiencing anxiety, depression and symptoms associated with pre-diabetes. She has two special needs children, and a host of her own adverse childhood experiences. She and her children could access services at our Dharma Institute. In another case, a 67-year-old Viet Nam Vet suffers from PTSD and depression, has high blood pressure, an enlarged heart, diabetes, poor circulation and struggles with his weight.  He receives medical interventions at his local VA and has received acupuncture, and claims “This has helped me more than all the medicines I have received.”  However, due to the restrictions of his health benefits, his access is not consistent. He would benefit from Dharma services. Or, in a different kind of situation, there is a new mom that needs to reduce her stress: Stroller-yoga or tai chi might be perfect for her. \r\n\r\nWith support, Dharma will be able to serve people in these kinds of situations and that need a sliding scale for fees.\r\n"

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "“Many diseases are preventable with minor lifestyle changes.” Master Zi\r\n\r\nIn today’s society, people seek quick fixes to health. Our challenge is constructively working with this mentality. One client shares that she wants to lose weight but in the same breath also says that she wants to eat and enjoy her life. She doesn’t want to stop having fun. Her concept of healthy living is life void of joy. Yet, her 76 year old brother-in-law who has been involved in several of our programs dines at wonderful restaurants, looks years younger than his age and has a zest for life.  As practitioners, we want to have her experience that doing things to support wellbeing does not mean taking enjoyment out of life. We invite the whole family to engage in life practices and family members to support one another in sustaining health practices. Also, our members offer support (by phone, after class, individual lessons, going for tea/coffee or lunch) as people begin this journey. \r\n"
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Participants will complete a pre and post examination to help in monitoring their progress.  One monitoring system we use is the InBody scan: Assesses Percentage of Body Fat, Body Mass Index, Body Strength, Intra/Extracellular water, and Visceral Fat to assess whether at risk for chronic conditions. It can be used with all ages.  EKG: Assesses cardiovascular health and heart strength. And, one of our team members is a specialist in evaluation. \r\n\r\nAt intake, we will assess an individual’s eligibility for subsidized fees. At various points throughout we will ask clients how they are doing, to help catch early issues, as well as give guidance and encouragement; building relationships is important. At the completion of services we will collect Client satisfaction data related to the specific services they received. We will use data regularly collected by the various machines and progress notes from our files. Collectively, this will provide an evaluation picture of clients’ changes. \r\n"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "We offer knowledge and skills for individuals to take care better care of themselves and become stewards of their own wellbeing.\r\n\r\nDharma benefits from decades of intense integrative health and martial arts training, study, practical applications and commitment by its co-owners. Our quality of life programs set us apart from many competitors in that we also draw from the Vedic Sciences and neuroplasticity. We help individuals with integrating nutrition, physical movement, and techniques to shift their consciousness towards healthier living and psychological, social and mental good health. \r\n\r\nOur multidisciplinary staff considers the best modalities for each client. We can take victims of crime insurance and traditional medical insurances. We offer health trainings via SKYPE. Our practitioners are culturally/linguistically diverse (Spanish, Hindi, Urdu). Our clients, too, are diverse: students, mothers and babies, families, professionals, retirees, etc. \r\n\r\n"
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "Our partners are individuals that have benefited from the work and have their own life practice. \r\n\r\nWe work with medical doctors, a professor from Loyola Marymount University, which is the head of the Asian Studies program, Chinese medical practitioners including acupuncturists and herbalists, physical therapists, social workers, counselors, marriage and family therapists, as well other institutions. We also teach at various venues including Malibu Fitness and Loyola Marymount University. For events, we partner with local businesses including Rawvolution and Simply Wholesome, a natural food grocery store and restaurant, locally owned and operated. We donate to a number of organizations including One World Health Project, a non-profit organization training health workers in Africa and South America, Firefighters association, Race for the Cure and local companies holding raffles or community fundraising events. Based on the number of clients we receive and the health issues they are experiencing, the partners will receive monetary compensation for their time. The fees calculated will be sliding scale and thus it is hard to assess how much each partner will receive. Within our organization, there is an understanding of Dakshana, giving a portion of the knowledge received, so we consistently have volunteers working alongside us administratively as well a teaching. This is foundational to our work; it, too, sets us apart from some other organizations. If we receive this grant, these volunteers will receive a small payment for their assistance. \r\n"
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': "We have already created a very warm and welcoming institution for our existing community and are a fully equipped integrative health clinic. This is the first grant we are applying for to support our goal of expanding services to other populations. Most of the funds associated with the grant will be spent on subsidizing the client services and funding practitioners to assist with the increased demand for our services. We have a number of volunteers already in place that give of their time. While the grant money will not cover all of the costs, our current community of staff understands this is a learning and educational institution and does not rely on our Institute for a full income. \r\n\r\nWe are already an established business. Some of our other machines not yet mentioned include: \r\n\r\nEnhanced External Counterpulsation (EECP): Increases the blood and oxygen supply to the heart muscle and decreases the amount of work the heart has to do to pump blood to the rest of the body. This is an excellent machine for anyone experiencing cardiovascular issues, diabetes and many chronic diseases that result from being obese. This machine is under used by cardiovascular clients because many people do not know about it and/or insurance has stopped paying for these treatments so it is no longer affordable. \r\n\r\nHyperbaric Oxygen Chamber: Clients are placed in a one-person chamber where 100% oxygen is circulated. The oxygen is pressurized so the air pressure is  2-3 times greater than normal. As a result, the lungs and skin absorb more concentrated oxygen in a shorter period of time. This allows for growth of new blood vessels with reduced circulation including artherosclerosis, aids in treatment of infection, diabetic ulcers, MS, macular degeneration, and helps restore brain function. \r\n\r\nInfrared Sauna: The infrared lamp sauna penetrates deepest due to the fact that the heat source is all concentrated in a small area, and not due to the frequencies of the energy used. It is also an antioxidant nutrient, activates the cells, supports metabolic processes and decouples toxins from water molecules. Infrared sauna therapy is one of the least costly, safest and most powerful ways to eliminate toxic metals, toxic chemicals and chronic infections.  \r\n\r\nIf we see that we may run over, we will try to make up the difference through various insurances or an additional grant.\r\n"
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Clinicians (10% of time) (5 total): $25,000\r\nAdministrative Personnel: $1575\r\nVolunteers (100 individuals): $2500\r\nEvaluation: $500\r\nMarketing: $2000\r\nOutreach/Travel: $1000\r\nMaterials/Supplies: $1250\r\nSpace: $9,000\r\nMonthly Membership for Tai Chi, Qi Gong, Yoga Therapy Classes (320 individuals): $8000\r\nEnhanced External Counterpulsation (EECP) (420 treatments): $21,000\r\nHyperbaric Oxygen (125 treatments): $3125\r\nAcupuncture/Acupressure (400 treatments): $12,000\r\nInfrared Sauna (305 treatments): $3050\r\nInBody Scan (500 individuals/scans*): $2500\r\nNutrition and Lifestyle Counseling (500 individuals*): $7500\r\n\r\n* We will see a total of 500 new clients in the year. Each person will receive an InBody Scan for Diagnostic purposes and Nutrition/Lifestyle counseling. Each client may receive one or more treatments in the category depending on personal situation\r\nso the above is an estimate of the total number of treatments. \r\n"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "The success of our proposal will be determined by the number of individuals that incorporate the health behaviors into their life. We have a number of quantitative metrics that will assess whether people make improvements on health related measurements such as Body Mass Index, Percentage Body fat, the amount of strength increasing in their muscles, and the decrease in visceral fat. Based on the Prochaska model of Stages of Change, an individual cycles through various stages before they incorporate the lessons into their life and maintain it. We will use the Stages of Change model to develop a pre-post test survey to assess the ability of an individual to maintain the newly adopted behaviors into their life. \r\n\r\nIn addition, we will collect qualitative data in the form of personal follow up with clients to assess their mental and emotional well being as a result of their ability to cope with their illness in a healthier way. \r\n\r\nFor us as an organization, we will assess success by having the opportunity to provide integrative health services to a wider population and offer the community at large an opportunity to learn strategies and techniques to live a healthier, a more productive life and be empowered to make health decisions based on the knowledge they receive. \r\n"
