It can be used with all ages.  EKG: Assesses cardiovascular health and heart strength. And, one of our team members is a specialist in evaluation. \r\n\r\nAt intake, we will assess an individual’s eligibility for subsidized fees. At various points throughout we will ask clients how they are doing, to help catch early issues, as well as give guidance and encouragement; building relationships is important. At the completion of services we will collect Client satisfaction data related to the specific services they received.
