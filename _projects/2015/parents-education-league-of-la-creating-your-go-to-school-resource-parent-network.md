'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Imagine an LA where discussions of schools and education are met with
  excitement and possibility rather than anxiety and discord. 
   
   Imagine a “one-stop” Website and Mobile App where parents can easily access and learn about the importance of early childhood education, the differences between public and private schools, and enrichment resources. PEL will create a robust Website and Mobile App, hosting videos of our programming & speakers. With the advanced technology, we can replicate our existing programming to reach thousands more parents. PEL frequently hosts speakers on hot topics such as: separation anxiety for new preschoolers, promote vocabulary growth, tech for tots, kindergarten readiness, reading strategies, learning styles & differences, dyslexia, gifted education, progressive education, homeschooling, and arts as enrichment.
   
   Imagine a “go-to” mapped presentation of LA’s schools and educational choices without advertising or bias. PEL will host and feature a more visually engaging and interactive geographical map that outlines all options from a managed database.
   
   Imagine informed parents connected through a City-Wide Parents Network, representing schools from all sectors of the educational landscape so they can virtually connect. PEL will develop and activate a parent portal for access to relevant information.
   
   PEL is positioned to reach the above goals as we currently offer live programming to over 500 families a year in collaboration with over 200 preschools, over 50 independent schools, over 50 educational resource providers, the Office of School Choice of LAUSD, and the California Charter Schools Association. 
   
   With new website capabilities of online programming combined with a robust Parent Network, we can geographically reach an almost unlimited number of families throughout LA County. Specifically, we can expand to include the Downtown LA/Los Feliz/South Los Angeles areas. 
   
   Our success would be measured by reaching as many families of the approximately 55,000 children entering Preschool or Kindergarten every year in LA. With Google Analytics we can specifically analyze who we are reaching & where. Data collected can also indicate which type of programming parents are most interested in accessing. Email addresses will be collected on the site to request subjective feedback.
   
   Specifically, PEL’s goal is to reach 1,500 new parents during the initial 90 days, 4,000 by the 6th month, & 12,000 by year end & maintain consistently high ratings.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  We can anticipate some challenge with outreach and with populating the
  database. While our membership and visibility are strong in many parts of the
  city, we will create a targeted outreach strategy to areas of the city in
  which we have not yet worked. Our strategy includes site visits to local
  parent groups and school PTA’s; use of targeted and wide-scale social media;
  continued use of written press releases to printed publications & radio
  stations; and creatively utilizing PEL’s $10,000/month Google AdWords Grant. 
   
   We can anticipate some challenge with populating the school & resource database; specifically inclusion and proper identification. This requires an understanding of all sectors of the school world & parent leader involvement. Our strategy includes utilizing our Board’s resources, connections within the educational community, creating a timeline of goals, and tapping additional educational leaders and organizations (within LAUSD, CCSAD, ESAD, CCSA, CAIS) as advisors.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  PEL’s proposal is unique in that we can determine how many people we have
  helped as well as the quality of the programming. 
   
   For subjective feedback, PEL will e-survey all recipients of live and streamed programming with a 3-point grading system. Each program will be evaluated by parents for quality and “take-away” merits. Follow-up e-surveys will be scheduled at six month and year intervals to determine parents’ continued satisfaction and/or value-added results. Demographic information will be incorporated into the survey to determine populations most served. A “comment and feedback” button on Website will provide for additional testimonials.
   
   For a more objective evaluation, the PEL Website/Application traffic is tracked with Google Analytics, including number of users, basic demographic info, and most demanded landing pages. With this data, PEL will strategize and respond to the community’s needs. The City-Wide Parent Network can be evaluated by its growth in schools represented.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Finding the right school and educational resources takes more than a
  hit-or-miss online search. There are for-profit ventures and online blogs that
  have a select degree of school information available:
   
   Greatschools is a national website with substantial advertising (www.greatschools.org/california/los-angeles/) 
   Los Angeles TImes has a page for all California schools K-12 (schools.latimes.com/)
   Zillow has an interactive map with K-12 schools using Greatschools ratings. www.zillow.com/los-angeles-ca/schools
   
   Specific to Early Childhood Education, LAUP offers information to families about public preschool choices. The Independent School Alliance works with multiracial families interested in the independent schools. 
   
   PEL is unique in its mission and purpose: our purpose is to provide access to information about all school options (preschool-grade 12) and educational opportunities so families can make the most appropriate choices for their children. PEL is a timely, unbiased, objective and ultimately comprehensive resource for families. We are the only non-profit organization in Los Angeles that reaches out to parents, schools and educational resources and offers a platform of collaboration. Lastly, PEL relies on the generosity of its supporters and donors and not on advertisement. 
   
   PEL believes families in LA have a great deal of choice when exploring schools and educational opportunities for their children. It’s access to these choices in a clear, concise and understandable manner that is often lacking. Parents deserve this access. Armed with access and information, families can make the best choices for their children--and finding the right fit for schooling has proven long-term results. Student success, self-confidence, as well as parent’s confidence in their child’s school and teachers are all critical results of finding and attending the best fitting school for each family.
   
   Our collaborations with the various educational sectors of this county, including LAUSD, CCSA, ESAD and CCSAD, have greatly increased parent awareness. In addition, our past programming reflects this commitment to access: 
   
   LA Preschool Fair, Multilingual Education Fair, Education and Enrichment Fair, Preschool Workshop, Preschool Admissions Panel, Private School Admissions Panel, Charter & Magnet Presentation, and Summer Camp Fair.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  We have a website proposal from Fireman Creative, a family-centric website
  developer in Pittsburgh, PA. Fireman creative has developed similar websites
  and applications in other cities such as San Francisco
  http://firemancreative.com/work/parents-place/. They will receive
  approximately $36,000 of the grant.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  PEL will keep our Proposal within the $100,000 budget. The Website and Mobile
  Application will cost approximately $30,000 to develop as noted above. The
  annual site maintenance is $6,000. In addition, staff is budgeted at $25,000.
  $20,000 is allocated for programming & production. The outreach will cost
  approximately $14,000 and overhead will be limited to $5,000. Additional
  staffing may be needed to keep the database current and comprehensive. This is
  addressed in our budget, but we will also utilize undergraduate interns for
  research and data entry.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-

How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Pathways to scale PEL’s success depend on a) providing a continued valuable
  resource and b) growing the number of parents served. The more parents we
  reach and serve well, the more valuable PEL becomes as a network of
  information. 
   
   PEL’s budget is extremely lean, and yet we have made great strides in 5 years. Parents are extremely receptive and have seen the value in our programming. Via the proposed technology and parent networks, PEL can reach exponentially more parents. With this foothold of recognition and awareness, PEL will achieve an economy of scale to insure stability and viability as an organization. The benefits of the initial investment in the Website and Application will continue long after the initial 12 months, thus compounding the return on investment for multiple years. 
   
   With this infrastructure in place, PEL ultimately aims to replicate this model for the larger counties in California and expand statewide with the support of Regional and State organizations and local PTA Chapters. In addition, we will continue to partner and collaborate with other non-profit organizations & for-profit affiliates who can help fulfill our mission.
   
   Note: PEL’s current Affiliate Membership is available to for-profit resource providers and consists of a $95 tax-deductible donation/year. While PEL does not & will not advertise on its website, we do recognize these generous donors. Also, with a larger subscriber database, we are able to secure more corporate sponsorships for our events. These proceeds will allow us to hire additional staff to manage more programming and outreach. 
   
   Parent Testimonials:
   Education & Enrichment Resource Fair:
   “I loved the speakers, mostly the keynote speakers. At something like this, it is nice to know you are not alone. Sometimes you feel you are the only one that has kid with issues and it's nice to see other moms doing what they can to help their children. It was nice to have various services all at one place. It was my first year going and I thought it was great.”
   
   Kindergarten Panel:
   “The program was well organized & worthwhile. The moderator did a really good job. That isn't always easy, nor is handling a roomful of anxious parents, so just wanted to say "thanks!"
   
   Preschool Fair:
   “I'm a new mom and this was very helpful because some of the preschools I didn't find in my search on yelp, google search, & in the book. It was wonderful to be able to ask questions to multiple schools. Please keep having the fairs.”

  - name: Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Imagine an LA where discussions of schools and education are met with excitement and possibility rather than anxiety and discord. \r\n\r\nImagine a “one-stop” Website and Mobile App where parents can easily access and learn about the importance of early childhood education, the differences between public and private schools, and enrichment resources. PEL will create a robust Website and Mobile App, hosting videos of our programming & speakers. With the advanced technology, we can replicate our existing programming to reach thousands more parents. PEL frequently hosts speakers on hot topics such as: separation anxiety for new preschoolers, promote vocabulary growth, tech for tots, kindergarten readiness, reading strategies, learning styles & differences, dyslexia, gifted education, progressive education, homeschooling, and arts as enrichment.\r\n\r\nImagine a “go-to” mapped presentation of LA’s schools and educational choices without advertising or bias. PEL will host and feature a more visually engaging and interactive geographical map that outlines all options from a managed database.\r\n\r\nImagine informed parents connected through a City-Wide Parents Network, representing schools from all sectors of the educational landscape so they can virtually connect. PEL will develop and activate a parent portal for access to relevant information.\r\n\r\nPEL is positioned to reach the above goals as we currently offer live programming to over 500 families a year in collaboration with over 200 preschools, over 50 independent schools, over 50 educational resource providers, the Office of School Choice of LAUSD, and the California Charter Schools Association. \r\n\r\nWith new website capabilities of online programming combined with a robust Parent Network, we can geographically reach an almost unlimited number of families throughout LA County. Specifically, we can expand to include the Downtown LA/Los Feliz/South Los Angeles areas. \r\n\r\nOur success would be measured by reaching as many families of the approximately 55,000 children entering Preschool or Kindergarten every year in LA. With Google Analytics we can specifically analyze who we are reaching & where. Data collected can also indicate which type of programming parents are most interested in accessing. Email addresses will be collected on the site to request subjective feedback.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, PEL’s goal is to reach 1,500 new parents during the initial 90 days, 4,000 by the 6th month, & 12,000 by year end & maintain consistently high ratings."

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "We can anticipate some challenge with outreach and with populating the database. While our membership and visibility are strong in many parts of the city, we will create a targeted outreach strategy to areas of the city in which we have not yet worked. Our strategy includes site visits to local parent groups and school PTA’s; use of targeted and wide-scale social media; continued use of written press releases to printed publications & radio stations; and creatively utilizing PEL’s $10,000/month Google AdWords Grant.  \r\n\r\nWe can anticipate some challenge with populating the school & resource database; specifically inclusion and proper identification. This requires an understanding of all sectors of the school world & parent leader involvement. Our strategy includes utilizing our Board’s resources, connections within the educational community, creating a timeline of goals, and tapping additional educational leaders and organizations (within LAUSD, CCSAD, ESAD, CCSA, CAIS) as advisors."
  - name: Please explain how you will evaluate your work.
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "PEL’s proposal is unique in that we can determine how many people we have helped as well as the quality of the programming. \r\n\r\nFor subjective feedback, PEL will e-survey all recipients of live and streamed programming with a 3-point grading system. Each program will be evaluated by parents for quality and “take-away” merits. Follow-up e-surveys will be scheduled at six month and year intervals to determine parents’ continued satisfaction and/or value-added results. Demographic information will be incorporated into the survey to determine populations most served. A “comment and feedback” button on Website will  provide for additional testimonials.\r\n\r\nFor a more objective evaluation, the PEL Website/Application traffic is tracked with Google Analytics, including number of users, basic demographic info, and most demanded landing pages.  With this data, PEL will strategize and respond to the community’s needs. The City-Wide Parent Network can be evaluated by its growth in schools represented."

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Finding the right school and educational resources takes more than a hit-or-miss online search. There are for-profit ventures and online blogs that have a select degree of school information available:\r\n\r\nGreatschools is a national website with substantial advertising (www.greatschools.org/california/los-angeles/) \r\nLos Angeles TImes has a page for all California schools K-12 (schools.latimes.com/)\r\nZillow has an interactive map with K-12 schools using Greatschools ratings. www.zillow.com/los-angeles-ca/schools\r\n\r\nSpecific to Early Childhood Education, LAUP offers information to families about public preschool choices. The Independent School Alliance works with multiracial families interested in the independent schools.   \r\n\r\nPEL is unique in its mission and purpose: our purpose is to provide access to information about all school options (preschool-grade 12) and educational opportunities so families can make the most appropriate choices for their children. PEL is a timely, unbiased, objective and ultimately comprehensive resource for families. We are the only non-profit organization in Los Angeles that reaches out to parents, schools and educational resources and offers a platform of collaboration. Lastly, PEL relies on the generosity of its supporters and donors and not on advertisement. \r\n\r\nPEL believes families in LA have a great deal of choice when exploring schools and educational opportunities for their children. It’s access to these choices in a clear, concise and understandable manner that is often lacking. Parents deserve this access. Armed with access and information, families can make the best choices for their children--and finding the right fit for schooling has proven long-term results. Student success, self-confidence, as well as parent’s confidence in their child’s school and teachers are all critical results of finding and attending the best fitting school for each family.\r\n\r\nOur collaborations with the various educational sectors of this county, including LAUSD, CCSA, ESAD and CCSAD, have greatly increased parent awareness. In addition, our past programming reflects this commitment to access: \r\n\r\nLA Preschool Fair, Multilingual Education Fair, Education and Enrichment Fair, Preschool Workshop, Preschool Admissions Panel, Private School Admissions Panel, Charter & Magnet Presentation, and Summer Camp Fair.

      budgeted at $25,000.  $20,000 is allocated for programming & production.
      The outreach will cost approximately $14,000 and overhead will be limited
      to $5,000. Additional staffing may be needed to keep the database current
      and comprehensive. This is addressed in our budget, but we will also

  - name: How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Pathways to scale PEL’s success depend on a) providing a continued valuable resource and b) growing the number of parents served. The more parents we reach and serve well, the more valuable PEL becomes as a network of information. \r\n\r\nPEL’s budget is extremely lean, and yet we have made great strides in 5 years. Parents are extremely receptive and have seen the value in our programming. Via the proposed technology and parent networks, PEL can reach exponentially more parents. With this foothold of recognition and awareness, PEL will achieve an economy of scale to insure stability and viability as an organization. The benefits of the initial investment in the Website and Application will continue long after the initial 12 months, thus compounding the return on investment for multiple years. \r\n\r\nWith this infrastructure in place, PEL ultimately aims to replicate this model for the larger counties in California and expand statewide with the support of Regional and State organizations and local PTA Chapters. In addition, we will continue to partner and collaborate with other non-profit organizations & for-profit affiliates who can help fulfill our mission.\r\n\r\nNote: PEL’s current Affiliate Membership is available to for-profit resource providers and consists of a $95 tax-deductible donation/year. While PEL does not & will not advertise on its website, we do recognize these generous donors. Also, with a larger subscriber database, we are able to secure more corporate sponsorships for our events. These proceeds will allow us to hire additional staff to manage more programming and outreach. \r\n\r\nParent Testimonials:\r\nEducation & Enrichment Resource Fair:\r\n“I loved the speakers, mostly the keynote speakers. At something like this, it is nice to know you are not alone. Sometimes you feel you are the only one that has kid with issues and it's nice to see other moms doing what they can to help their children.  It was nice to have various services all at one place.  It was my first year going and I thought it was great.”\r\n\r\nKindergarten Panel:\r\n“The program was well organized & worthwhile. The moderator did a really good job. That isn't always easy, nor is handling a roomful of anxious parents, so just wanted to say \"thanks!\"\r\n\r\nPreschool Fair:\r\n“I'm a new mom and this was very helpful because some of the preschools I didn't find in my search on yelp, google search, & in the book.  It was wonderful to be able to ask questions to multiple schools.  Please keep having the fairs.”"
