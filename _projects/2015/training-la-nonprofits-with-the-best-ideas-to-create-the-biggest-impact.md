Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: "Our program trains promising nonprofit startups to create sustainable business models, to use data to measure their impact and innovate faster, and to create a network of partners that will enable their organizations to scale. At Change Better, we promote best practices for the nonprofit space, bringing in new techniques and knowledge from other sectors to help organizations maximize their limited resources and achieve greater impact.\r\n\r\nOver the 4 months of the program, we will train participating organizations on business strategies, data systems and metrics, and partnerships and collaboration through the Change Better Startup Curriculum. The curriculum brings together best practices from the for-profit business and tech startup worlds into the context of running a nonprofit. It’s been tested, refined, and proven to work over the course of the last year and a half. \r\n\r\nThe training culminates with Pitch Day where we will bring all of our program participants together with other leaders in the LA nonprofit community for a high-energy, big-stakes competition where five attendees will walk away with $1,000 grants. \r\n\r\nWhile LA has been a hub for artists, creatives, and entrepreneurs for years, the geography makes it a difficult city in which to connect. This pitch day brings together the best and brightest nonprofit startups from all corners of the county to meet, and form partnerships. We believe that all attendees will be able to bring back skills that will allow them to achieve the LA2050 create goals. "
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Our goal is to provide best-in-class resources for nonprofits, so we use data to improve the quality of our resources.  \r\n\r\nTo measure our program, we look at the type and frequency of member needs, the kinds of solutions we offer, and the rate of adoption on the insights we provide. In addition, we conduct extensive ethnographic interviews at the end of each program to gather qualitative data on participants’ experiences. \r\n\r\nThrough this framework, we have consistently witnessed the impact of our program. Our members have told us that we’ve created a safe space  to explore new ideas and build the skills needed to be successful.  As one of them explained:\r\n\r\n“There are two opposing pulls in running an organization – the passion and the business. I do this because I’m passionate about it and it’s always been hard for us to balance that side with the business side. You brought those two pieces closer together and showed us how the business can support the mission.”"
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
  - Money (financial capital)
  - Volunteers/staff (human capital)
  - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
  - 'Infrastructure (building/space/vehicles, etc.)'
  - Community outreach
  - Network/relationship support
