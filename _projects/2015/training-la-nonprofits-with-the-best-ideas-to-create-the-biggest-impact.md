project_summary: >-
  We will host a 4-month training program for startup nonprofits that are based
  in and serving greater Los Angeles. The program will teach the most promising
  new nonprofits to create sustainable business models, to use data to innovate
  faster, and to build partnerships that enable their organizations to scale.
  Our LA2050 program will culminate with a pitch competition, where industry
  leaders and our participants will gather to showcase their bold ideas and make
  LA the best place to create change.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Our program trains promising nonprofit startups to create sustainable business
  models, to use data to measure their impact and innovate faster, and to create
  a network of partners that will enable their organizations to scale. At Change
  Better, we promote best practices for the nonprofit space, bringing in new
  techniques and knowledge from other sectors to help organizations maximize
  their limited resources and achieve greater impact.
   
   Over the 4 months of the program, we will train participating organizations on business strategies, data systems and metrics, and partnerships and collaboration through the Change Better Startup Curriculum. The curriculum brings together best practices from the for-profit business and tech startup worlds into the context of running a nonprofit. It’s been tested, refined, and proven to work over the course of the last year and a half. 
   
   The training culminates with Pitch Day where we will bring all of our program participants together with other leaders in the LA nonprofit community for a high-energy, big-stakes competition where five attendees will walk away with $1,000 grants. 
   
   While LA has been a hub for artists, creatives, and entrepreneurs for years, the geography makes it a difficult city in which to connect. This pitch day brings together the best and brightest nonprofit startups from all corners of the county to meet, and form partnerships. We believe that all attendees will be able to bring back skills that will allow them to achieve the LA2050 create goals.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  One challenge is selecting the best startup nonprofits for the program. We
  believe that a part of finding the most innovative solutions means looking in
  new places and bringing resources to unexpected places. While we have roots in
  Los Angeles, we’re excited to explore the potential that’s simmering in
  greater LA.
   
   In selecting organizations to join the program, we will look for 5 key characteristics: 
   
   1. They value their community. Participants have cultivated long-term, respectful relationships in their community. They listen to community members and understand the problems they face.
   
   2. They have identified an impactful solution. This solution has a proven potential for high impact based on early indicators.
   
   3. They are devoted to testing & learning. They are ready to build, measure, and learn. 
   
   4. They know the value of collaboration. Participants are open, transparent, and self-aware. 
   
   5. They have long-term vision that solves the root of the problem.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Our goal is to provide best-in-class resources for nonprofits, so we use data
  to improve the quality of our resources. 
   
   To measure our program, we look at the type and frequency of member needs, the kinds of solutions we offer, and the rate of adoption on the insights we provide. In addition, we conduct extensive ethnographic interviews at the end of each program to gather qualitative data on participants’ experiences. 
   
   Through this framework, we have consistently witnessed the impact of our program. Our members have told us that we’ve created a safe space to explore new ideas and build the skills needed to be successful. As one of them explained:
   
   “There are two opposing pulls in running an organization – the passion and the business. I do this because I’m passionate about it and it’s always been hard for us to balance that side with the business side. You brought those two pieces closer together and showed us how the business can support the mission.”
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There are other organizations that support nonprofit startups and social
  entrepreneurs (Echoing Green, Ashoka, Be Social Change, PresenTense) and even
  other nonprofit training programs (Fast Forward, Beespace, Points of Light).
    
   Change Better is unique because: 
   
   - We look different than your average training program. We meet our nonprofits where they are. Instead of requiring the organization to pick up what they’re doing and meet in our space, we plug into participants' location and schedules.
   
   - We work differently. We train new nonprofits with the latest trends in the tech innovation space with an emphasis on lean startup and agile development. The focus is on skill training by collaborating. We’re not just consultants and we’re not just advisors. We’re partners.
   
   - We hold our participants accountable to impact. We give open and honest feedback. Each organization that works with Change Better builds metrics by which they’re judging their work. We aren’t afraid to speak up when they’re not getting the results on those metrics, then we help them take that information and pivot.
    
   Our founders started in the nonprofit sector and launched their careers at one of the leading nonprofits in the U.S. – DoSomething.org. In true lean startup fashion, they learned by doing. Ellie and Amanda received their formative education at Do Something, where they helped the organization transform into a powerhouse nonprofit on the cutting edge of technology, data, and social good. As the leaders of the social entrepreneurship programs, Ellie and Amanda trained many of the best young change makers in the country to build strong, strategic businesses.
    
   Our Board of Directors is made up of a Chief of Marketing, a Head of Product, an Economist, and a Data Scientist – a team that’s distinctly different than an average nonprofit board. Our board is more reminiscent of a tech startup than a nonprofit. And that’s intentional. We are building a team of experts in lean startup and agile development to bring these movements to the nonprofit space.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  We know there is power in numbers and in order to make an impact, it takes a
  village. So we plan to engage many partners in this project - people to refer
  and identify the best nonprofit startups for the training program, partners to
  organize the Pitch Day, and leaders in the LA community to give guidance and
  support to our participants along the way.
   
   The first way we will be mobilizing partners is through our selection process. In order to find the best startups for the program, we will need to look in all corners of the nonprofit community. We plan to reach out to key players in the LA area to help - including the Brittingham Social Enterprise Lab at USC Marshall School of Business, the Impact Hub, Community Partners, Taproot Foundation, and we would love to engage the team at the Goldhirsh Foundation as well.
   
   We also plan to collaborate with partners and volunteers to put together an exciting, productive, engaging Pitch Day. We will work with partners to host the event, and we are in the process of securing the space and a food sponsor. We will also be inviting leaders in the social innovation community - both funders and nonprofit executives to network with and provide feedback to our pitchers. 
   
   While all of the funds of this grant will go directly towards Change Better, we will use a small portion of the funds (as outlined in the budget section) to pay for speaking fees for the Pitch Day.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  The total cost of the program is $111,270.00. This includes the full cost of
  the training program, the full cost of the Pitch Day, and the corresponding
  staff required to make the program successful.
   
   The $100,000 contribution from LA2050 will be critical to get this initiative off the ground. The remaining $11,270.00 will be covered by additional fundraising efforts. Change Better’s fundraising comes from three primary areas: foundations and grantmakers, individual contributions, and earned income from our consulting arm. We expect to cover the additional costs through a combination of dollars raised from individuals and from our consulting income.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
  We will use the $100,000 grant from Goldhirsh Foundation to cover the costs of
  running the 4-month training program for four LA-based nonprofits, and to
  cover the costs of the capstone Pitch Day, including the four nonprofits, as
  well as leaders from around 20 other LA-based nonprofit organizations.
  Approximately 53% of the funds will go towards the training program, and 47%
  of the funds will go towards hosting Pitch Day. 
   
   To cover the costs of the LA-based training program: 
   - $46,900 in staff costs including coverage of the Executive Director (30% of time during the training program); Program Director (60% of time during the training program); Program Associate (80% of time spent during the training program); and Creative Director
   - $4,000 will go towards a stipend for an intern who will help with the program execution and administration, part-time for Spring semester, and 30-hours a week for summer semester
   - $1,500 will go towards marketing and program materials 
   - $800 will go towards office supplies in support of the program 
   
   To cover the costs of the capstone Pitch Day: 
   - $22,000 will go towards the staff costs of planning and executing the Pitch Day
   - $5,000 will go towards the 5 grant winners of the pitch competition. The winners will be determined based on scoring of their pitch. 
   - $19,800 will go towards the costs of executing the event itself including cost of space, food, supplies, promotion, speaking fees, and travel.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Our plan to scale is focused on 1) improving the success rate of the
  organizations who participate in our training and 2) fostering collaboration
  in the LA nonprofit community to create a space where the best solutions
  thrive and have the support networks they need to grow.
   
   The organizations that participate in the program will build the skills needed to improve their impact and scale their work in the LA area. In this way, investing in Change Better has a multiplier effect. LA2050 funding will allow Change Better to reach more nonprofits in Southern California, who in turn will help more people in their respective local communities. 
   
   From this multiplier effect, we expect to see an increase in jobs per capita; an increase in women and minority owned businesses; an increase in the number of high growth startups; and an increase in venture capital investment -- all driving progress though our participants increased capacity and success. 
   
   Next, we will scale the success of our program by fostering collaboration between the organizations in our program and the other groups participating in the capstone Pitch Day. We expect attendees at the event to make the connections needed to take their work to the next level.
   
   Each organization that participates in the training program goes through an extensive exploration of their partnership strategy, focusing on their areas of need and of leading strengths. Through the 4 months, we create a map of potential partnership opportunities and rehearse putting those options into practice. The startups that go through the Change Better training program come to Pitch Day ready and eager to grow their network. 
   
   By facilitating this network building, we can maximize the potential of the nonprofit community in LA. We can create a city where startup organizations have the connections for their work to thrive and nonprofit veterans have access to the freshest new ideas on the block.

      based in and serving greater Los Angeles. The program will teach the most
      promising new nonprofits to create sustainable business models, to use
      data to innovate faster, and to build partnerships that enable their

    answer: "Our program trains promising nonprofit startups to create sustainable business models, to use data to measure their impact and innovate faster, and to create a network of partners that will enable their organizations to scale. At Change Better, we promote best practices for the nonprofit space, bringing in new techniques and knowledge from other sectors to help organizations maximize their limited resources and achieve greater impact.\r\n\r\nOver the 4 months of the program, we will train participating organizations on business strategies, data systems and metrics, and partnerships and collaboration through the Change Better Startup Curriculum. The curriculum brings together best practices from the for-profit business and tech startup worlds into the context of running a nonprofit. It’s been tested, refined, and proven to work over the course of the last year and a half. \r\n\r\nThe training culminates with Pitch Day where we will bring all of our program participants together with other leaders in the LA nonprofit community for a high-energy, big-stakes competition where five attendees will walk away with $1,000 grants. \r\n\r\nWhile LA has been a hub for artists, creatives, and entrepreneurs for years, the geography makes it a difficult city in which to connect. This pitch day brings together the best and brightest nonprofit startups from all corners of the county to meet, and form partnerships. We believe that all attendees will be able to bring back skills that will allow them to achieve the LA2050 create goals. "

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "One challenge is selecting the best startup nonprofits for the program. We believe that a part of finding the most innovative solutions means looking in new places and bringing resources to unexpected places. While we have roots in Los Angeles, we’re excited to explore the potential that’s simmering in greater LA.\r\n\r\nIn selecting organizations to join the program, we will look for 5 key characteristics: \r\n\r\n1. They value their community. Participants have cultivated long-term, respectful relationships in their community. They listen to community members and understand the problems they face.\r\n\r\n2. They have identified an impactful solution. This solution has a proven potential for high impact based on early indicators.\r\n\r\n3. They are devoted to testing & learning. They are ready to build, measure, and learn. \r\n\r\n4. They know the value of collaboration. Participants are open, transparent, and self-aware. \r\n\r\n5. They have long-term vision that solves the root of the problem."

    answer: "Our goal is to provide best-in-class resources for nonprofits, so we use data to improve the quality of our resources.  \r\n\r\nTo measure our program, we look at the type and frequency of member needs, the kinds of solutions we offer, and the rate of adoption on the insights we provide. In addition, we conduct extensive ethnographic interviews at the end of each program to gather qualitative data on participants’ experiences. \r\n\r\nThrough this framework, we have consistently witnessed the impact of our program. Our members have told us that we’ve created a safe space  to explore new ideas and build the skills needed to be successful.  As one of them explained:\r\n\r\n“There are two opposing pulls in running an organization – the passion and the business. I do this because I’m passionate about it and it’s always been hard for us to balance that side with the business side. You brought those two pieces closer together and showed us how the business can support the mission.”"

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "There are other organizations that support nonprofit startups and social entrepreneurs (Echoing Green, Ashoka, Be Social Change, PresenTense) and even other nonprofit training programs (Fast Forward, Beespace, Points of Light).\r\n \r\nChange Better is unique because: \r\n\r\n- We look different than your average training program. We meet our nonprofits where they are. Instead of requiring the organization to pick up what they’re doing and meet in our space, we plug into participants' location and schedules.\r\n\r\n- We work differently. We train new nonprofits with the latest trends in the tech innovation space with an emphasis on lean startup and agile development. The focus is on skill training by collaborating. We’re not just consultants and we’re not just advisors. We’re partners.\r\n\r\n- We hold our participants accountable to impact. We give open and honest feedback. Each organization that works with Change Better builds metrics by which they’re judging their work. We aren’t afraid to speak up when they’re not getting the results on those metrics, then we help them take that information and pivot.\r\n \r\nOur founders started in the nonprofit sector and launched their careers at one of the leading nonprofits in the U.S. – DoSomething.org. In true lean startup fashion, they learned by doing.  Ellie and Amanda received their formative education at Do Something, where they helped the organization transform into a powerhouse nonprofit on the cutting edge of technology, data, and social good. As the leaders of the social entrepreneurship programs, Ellie and Amanda trained many of the best young change makers in the country to build strong, strategic businesses.\r\n \r\nOur Board of Directors is made up of a Chief of Marketing, a Head of Product, an Economist, and a Data Scientist – a team that’s distinctly different than an average nonprofit board. Our board is more reminiscent of a tech startup than a nonprofit. And that’s intentional. We are building a team of experts in lean startup and agile development to bring these movements to the nonprofit space.\r\n"

      Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on
      this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner
      receive?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "We know there is power in numbers and in order to make an impact, it takes a village. So we plan to engage many partners in this project - people to refer and identify the best nonprofit startups for the training program, partners to organize the Pitch Day, and leaders in the LA community to give guidance and support to our participants along the way.\r\n\r\nThe first way we will be mobilizing partners is through our selection process. In order to find the best startups for the program, we will need to look in all corners of the nonprofit community. We plan to reach out to key players in the LA area to help - including the Brittingham Social Enterprise Lab at USC Marshall School of Business, the Impact Hub, Community Partners, Taproot Foundation, and we would love to engage the team at the Goldhirsh Foundation as well.\r\n\r\nWe also plan to collaborate with partners and volunteers to put together an exciting, productive, engaging Pitch Day.  We will work with partners to host the event, and we are in the process of securing the space and a food sponsor. We will also be inviting leaders in the social innovation community - both funders and nonprofit executives to network with and provide feedback to our pitchers. \r\n\r\nWhile all of the funds of this grant will go directly towards Change Better, we will use a small portion of the funds (as outlined in the budget section) to pay for speaking fees for the Pitch Day.

      How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you
      cover the additional costs?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "The total cost of the program is $111,270.00. This includes the full cost of the training program, the full cost of the Pitch Day, and the corresponding staff required to make the program successful.\r\n\r\nThe $100,000 contribution from LA2050 will be critical to get this initiative off the ground. The remaining $11,270.00 will be covered by additional fundraising efforts. Change Better’s fundraising comes from three primary areas: foundations and grantmakers, individual contributions, and earned income from our consulting arm. We expect to cover the additional costs through a combination of dollars raised from individuals and from our consulting income. \r\n"

      Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement
      this project.
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "We will use the $100,000 grant from Goldhirsh Foundation to cover the costs of running the 4-month training program for four LA-based nonprofits, and to cover the costs of the capstone Pitch Day, including the four nonprofits, as well as leaders from around 20 other LA-based nonprofit organizations. Approximately 53% of the funds will go towards the training program, and 47% of the funds will go towards hosting Pitch Day. \r\n\r\nTo cover the costs of the LA-based training program: \r\n- $46,900 in staff costs including coverage of the Executive Director (30% of time during the training program); Program Director (60% of time during the training program); Program Associate (80% of time spent during the training program); and Creative Director\r\n- $4,000 will go towards a stipend for an intern who will help with the program execution and administration, part-time for Spring semester, and 30-hours a week for summer semester\r\n- $1,500 will go towards marketing and program materials \r\n- $800 will go towards office supplies in support of the program \r\n\r\nTo cover the costs of the capstone Pitch Day: \r\n- $22,000 will go towards the staff costs of planning and executing the Pitch Day\r\n- $5,000 will go towards the 5 grant winners of the pitch competition. The winners will be determined based on scoring of their pitch.  \r\n- $19,800 will go towards the costs of executing the event itself including cost of space, food, supplies, promotion, speaking fees, and travel. \r\n"

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Our plan to scale is focused on 1) improving the success rate of the organizations who participate in our training and 2) fostering collaboration in the LA nonprofit community to create a space where the best solutions thrive and have the support networks they need to grow.\r\n\r\nThe organizations that participate in the program will build the skills needed to improve their impact and scale their work in the LA area. In this way, investing in Change Better has a multiplier effect. LA2050 funding will allow Change Better to reach more nonprofits in Southern California, who in turn will help more people in their respective local communities. \r\n\r\nFrom this multiplier effect, we expect to see an increase in jobs per capita; an increase in women and minority owned businesses; an increase in the number of high growth startups; and an increase in venture capital investment -- all driving progress though our participants increased capacity and success. \r\n\r\nNext, we will scale the success of our program by fostering collaboration between the organizations in our program and the other groups participating in the capstone Pitch Day. We expect attendees at the event to make the connections needed to take their work to the next level.\r\n\r\nEach organization that participates in the training program goes through an extensive exploration of their partnership strategy, focusing on their areas of need and of leading strengths. Through the 4 months, we create a map of potential partnership opportunities and rehearse putting those options into practice. The startups that go through the Change Better training program come to Pitch Day ready and eager to grow their network. \r\n\r\nBy facilitating this network building, we can maximize the potential of the nonprofit community in LA. We can create a city where startup organizations have the connections for their work to thrive and nonprofit veterans have access to the freshest new ideas on the block."
