  The high school dropout crisis is enormous in scope, yet highly concentrated
  in just a few neighborhoods, like South L.A. City Year LA and the Partnership
  are expanding our collaboration into Carver Middle School to ensure the most
  at-risk students reach their full potential. City Year AmeriCorps members will
  target 7th and 8th grade students who demonstrate risk factors for dropping
  out, providing more capacity to Partnership staff and school leadership to
  implement their vision at the school.

  As the graduation rate in the United States continues to rise—up to 81.4% for
  the class of 2013—progress in California schools and Los Angeles specifically,
  is crucial to reaching the national goal of a 90% graduation rate by 2020. The
  good news is that more students in Los Angeles are graduating every year. The
  Los Angeles Unified School District class of 2014 saw 70% of students graduate
  in four years, a tremendous increase from the 61% graduation rate for the
  class of 2011. However, there is still much work to be done, as 50% of
  dropouts in Los Angeles come from just 22% of high schools. Progress in these
  schools—where City Year and the Partnership strategically serve—will be a
  lynchpin for our city, state, and country’s success. We are turning around
  some of our city’s historically most-challenging campuses, where students
  struggle with academic achievement and the ongoing ramifications of
  generational poverty and violence. Both organizations are dedicated to making
  schools safe havens where students can learn and thrive. Combining our
  enhanced services – parent centers, community health facilities, etc., with
  additional adults serving as tutors, mentors, and role models – students will
  have a safety net to help them succeed. 
   Our collective efforts promote school-wide cultural norms and standards related to student responsibility, efficacy and interactions between peers, students and adults. When we can change school climates—encouraging trust, respect and support—the impact is profound. Students are interacting positively with adults, and feel a sense of pride and ownership in their school. School pride makes students more likely to work hard in the classroom, reach out to adults for extra support, and become more engaged in activities before, during, and after school, treating their school like the valuable community resource it should be. 
   
   This transformation will not just positively impact today’s students, but can ripple out to future generations. If students feel more connected to school and have greater success, they are more likely to graduate. If they graduate from high school, they will likely earn at least $1M more in their lifetime than if they drop out. If they drop out, they are three times more likely to be unemployed and eight times more likely to go to jail. This will not only impact their lives, but their children and grandchildren. By breaking the cycle now, we can set up future generations for continued and further success.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  In order for City Year LA to be successful at Carver, it requires certain
  conditions for success, which include: sufficient time in the school schedule
  for tutoring; a willingness to share student-level data; time dedicated for
  administrators to meet regularly with City Year AmeriCorps members and
  leadership; and more. When starting at a new partner school, it often takes
  time for the school teachers and administration to buy into the work our
  AmeriCorps members are doing. However, City Year LA has a strong history of
  building partnerships effectively at Partnership schools and Carver expressed
  great interest in bringing City Year’s services to their campuses and are
  excited to have the team in service. During the first year City Year LA served
  at the Partnership’s Mendez High School, they had the highest one-year gain on
  the Academic Performance Index in California among traditional large schools.
  Our history of collaboration should make this year at Carver a success.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  City Year LA focuses its measurement on the subset of students it serves,
  while the Partnership tracks data for all students in its network, looking at
  individual, grade-level and overall gains. Our outcomes are linked – if the
  lowest-performing population shows increases, it will elevate the entire
  school’s performance and improve the Partnership network results.
   
   The following are some of City Year LA’s and the Partnership’s proposed outcomes:
   
   • Provide individualized interventions to 150 students and extended learning time through City Year after-school programs to 100 students
   • Move 50% of students from an English language arts/math course grade of “D” or lower to a “C” or higher, or maintain/improve an existing “C”
   • Increase by 3 percentage points the number of students in 7th and 8th grade who meet or exceed the standards in English language arts and math
   • Elicit strong teacher feedback in which at least 85% of teachers report positive experiences with City Year.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  While there are many excellent organizations working in education, we believe
  each of our programs has unique strengths. We also contend that the depth of
  our partnership and collaboration is extremely unique in the education space,
  which has a history of competition and contention. 
   
   Partnership for LA Schools is the only organization in Los Angeles with a track record of turning around the lowest-performing schools at scale and driving policy and programmatic changes that impact all students in LAUSD. While charter schools have shown progress toward increasing student achievement, few of their methods have proven scalable to-date, and not within the constraints of the current education system. The Partnership’s model offers another option for transforming schools that takes the benefits of charter schools and applies them in a way that is scalable to LAUSD. Partnership schools work with existing staff under labor contracts and serve all students within existing attendance boundaries. Because the Partnership team works side-by-side with LAUSD, quality practices developed in our schools can be shared with and eventually adopted by other District schools, and because Partnership schools are LAUSD schools and operate under the same District constraints, we can identify and remove barriers to success for our schools and others across LAUSD and the State.
   
   City Year also fills a unique void due to the comprehensive package of supports we provide for the most at-risk students. Teams of AmeriCorps members work from 7:30am-6:00pm to provide individualized tutoring, after-school and extracurricular programs, and positive school climate initiatives to turn around the early warning indicators for the students that need it most. We are also unique in the strong partnerships we build with teachers who report feeling more supported and able to differentiate instruction because of the AmeriCorps members’ consistent presence in their classroom. There are strong after-school programs and other student support organizations, but none that are fully integrated into the school day and classroom like City Year. AmeriCorps members are uniquely positioned to help students with their homework since they witnessed the lessons taught that day and can provide different perspective and support to students. 
   
   Again, the depth of this particular partnership is unique, leveraging our individual strengths, assets, and resources to better support students across Los Angeles.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Over the last six years, City Year LA and the Partnership have worked together
  to bring additional supports to our city’s most at-risk students. By expanding
  City Year LA services to Carver Middle School, AmeriCorps members will be
  serving at 10 of the 17 Partnership schools. When City Year partners with a
  new school, we look for a strong, positive school culture that is open to
  collaboration, committed to putting students first, and a fundamental belief
  in students’ potential to succeed. The Partnership embodies this philosophy by
  providing students better instruction, safer campuses, enrichment programs and
  activities, and a rigorous curriculum that offers a platform to realize their
  full potential. The Partnership greatly values City Year AmeriCorps members’
  added-value by bringing additional individual attention to students that
  teachers often cannot extend in the course of a school day. 
   
   In 2013, Partnership for LA Schools recognized City Year as their Community Partner of the Year at its annual Family and Community Engagement Awards ceremony. We both deeply believe that our students are more likely to succeed if they attend a Partnership school with City Year corps members in the classroom. Our collaboration runs so deep that we have once again opted to apply for this grant together, rather than compete against one another. 
   
   In our past collaboration, we have found these three factors to be critical: 1) strong leadership from both organizations – on the ground level at the schools as well as at the senior level of our organizations; 2) shared values and a deep belief in our students and their potential; and 3) a willingness to leverage partnerships and outside resources to support our students and our work.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  The total cost of the project is $833,000 per year. This cost covers full
  program implementation of City Year on a school campus with a team of 15
  AmeriCorps members in collaboration with two FTE Partnership staff, a Director
  of School Transformation and a Manager of Family & Community Engagement, to
  align initiatives between all stakeholders. As an AmeriCorps program, City
  Year receives approximately one quarter of its annual budget from the
  government, both federal and state. Additionally, as a close partner of the
  Los Angeles Unified School District, City Year receive support from school
  partners. City Year has seen its funding from the school district increase
  annually since 2009, despite the difficult budget climate—a tribute to its
  work in schools, a close collaboration with the Partnership and the value the
  community and school staff see in the work. The remainder of City Year's funds
  is raised through the private sector. The Partnership is supported by a
  private $50M sustainable grant over 10 years that ends in 2017, and covers
  most of the organization's operating costs. Another $5M is raised annually
  with the support of former LA City Mayor, Antonio Villaraigosa and other civic
  leaders through a combination of public and private dollars, including
  corporate and foundation partners who make our annual growth and expansion in
  LA possible.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
  The Partnership for Los Angeles Schools will use $50,000 to support the salary
  of their Partnership Support Team, who supports the school's implementation of
  their model.
   
   City Year LA will use $50,000 to support the salaries and benefits of the 16 AmeriCorps members at Carver ($27,569), the staff that supports our AmeriCorps members ($8,196), and for the other costs of materials and non-personnel items that support our program ($14,235). We can provide detailed budgets for both organizations upon request.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  As the demand for City Year’s services continues to grow and more schools are
  identifying resources so that they can have a team serving on their campus,
  City Year is committed to our Long-Term Impact plan that will see City Year
  Los Angeles grow substantially—increasing the size of our corps and number of
  school partners until we have 770 AmeriCorps members serving in 63 schools
  across Los Angeles. At scale, City Year LA will serve 50% of the students who
  are off-track in our key low-income neighborhoods with a goal of 80% of
  students reaching the 10th grade on track to graduate. One of the
  Partnership’s key strategies for turning around low-performing schools is
  connecting them to effective community partners like City Year to increase a
  school’s capacity for transformation. The Partnership pilots programs at its
  schools, raising philanthropic dollars in the initial years and then over
  time, program costs are absorbed into schools' budgets while the need for
  Partnership staff oversight is diminished and can be deployed to other
  campuses. This enables the Partnership to meet the needs of its schools in a
  cost-effective way, providing a sustainable and scalable model.
