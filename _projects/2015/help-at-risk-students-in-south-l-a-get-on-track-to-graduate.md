title: Help At-Risk Students in South L.A. Get on Track to Graduate
project_summary: >-
  The high school dropout crisis is enormous in scope, yet highly concentrated
  in just a few neighborhoods, like South L.A.  City Year LA and the Partnership
  are expanding our collaboration into Carver Middle School to ensure the most
  at-risk students reach their full potential. City Year AmeriCorps members will
  target 7th and 8th grade students who demonstrate risk factors for dropping
  out, providing more capacity to Partnership staff and school leadership to
  implement their vision at the school.

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "As the graduation rate in the United States continues to rise—up to 81.4% for the class of 2013—progress in California schools and Los Angeles specifically, is crucial to reaching the national goal of a 90% graduation rate by 2020.  The good news is that more students in Los Angeles are graduating every year. The Los Angeles Unified School District class of 2014 saw 70% of students graduate in four years, a tremendous increase from the 61% graduation rate for the class of 2011. However, there is still much work to be done, as 50% of dropouts in Los Angeles come from just 22% of high schools. Progress in these schools—where City Year and the Partnership strategically serve—will be a lynchpin for our city, state, and country’s success. We are turning around some of our city’s historically most-challenging campuses, where students struggle with academic achievement and the ongoing ramifications of generational poverty and violence. Both organizations are dedicated to making schools safe havens where students can learn and thrive. Combining our enhanced services – parent centers, community health facilities, etc., with additional adults serving as tutors, mentors, and role models – students will have a safety net to help them succeed. \r\nOur collective efforts promote school-wide cultural norms and standards related to student responsibility, efficacy and interactions between peers, students and adults. When we can change school climates—encouraging trust, respect and support—the impact is profound. Students are interacting positively with adults, and feel a sense of pride and ownership in their school. School pride makes students more likely to work hard in the classroom, reach out to adults for extra support, and become more engaged in activities before, during, and after school, treating their school like the valuable community resource it should be.  \r\n\r\nThis transformation will not just positively impact today’s students, but can ripple out to future generations. If students feel more connected to school and have greater success, they are more likely to graduate. If they graduate from high school, they will likely earn at least $1M more in their lifetime than if they drop out. If they drop out, they are three times more likely to be unemployed and eight times more likely to go to jail. This will not only impact their lives, but their children and grandchildren. By breaking the cycle now, we can set up future generations for continued and further success. \r\n"

    In order for City Year LA to be successful at Carver, it requires certain
    conditions for success, which include: sufficient time in the school
    schedule for tutoring; a willingness to share student-level data; time
    dedicated for administrators to meet regularly with City Year AmeriCorps
    members and leadership; and more. When starting at a new partner school, it
    often takes time for the school teachers and administration to buy into the
    work our AmeriCorps members are doing. However, City Year LA has a strong
    history of building partnerships effectively at Partnership schools and
    Carver expressed great interest in bringing City Year’s services to their
    campuses and are excited to have the team in service. During the first year
    City Year LA served at the Partnership’s Mendez High School, they had the
    highest one-year gain on the Academic Performance Index in  California among
    traditional large schools. Our history of collaboration should make this
    year at Carver a success.
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "City Year LA focuses its measurement on the subset of students it serves, while the Partnership tracks data for all students in its network, looking at individual, grade-level and overall gains. Our outcomes are linked – if the lowest-performing population shows increases, it will elevate the entire school’s performance and improve the Partnership network results.\r\n\r\nThe following are some of City Year LA’s and the Partnership’s proposed outcomes:\r\n\r\n•\tProvide individualized interventions to 150 students and extended learning time through City Year after-school programs to 100 students\r\n•\tMove 50% of students from an English language arts/math course grade of “D” or lower to a “C” or higher, or maintain/improve an existing “C”\r\n•\tIncrease by 3 percentage points the number of students in 7th and 8th grade who meet or exceed the standards in English language arts and math\r\n•\tElicit strong teacher feedback in which at least 85% of teachers report positive experiences with City Year."
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "While there are many excellent organizations working in education, we believe each of our programs has unique strengths. We also contend that the depth of our partnership and collaboration is extremely unique in the education space, which has a history of competition and contention. \r\n\r\nPartnership for LA Schools is the only organization in Los Angeles with a track record of turning around the lowest-performing schools at scale and driving policy and programmatic changes that impact all students in LAUSD. While charter schools have shown progress toward increasing student achievement, few of their methods have proven scalable to-date, and not within the constraints of the current education system. The Partnership’s model offers another option for transforming schools that takes the benefits of charter schools and applies them in a way that is scalable to LAUSD. Partnership schools work with existing staff under labor contracts and serve all students within existing attendance boundaries. Because the Partnership team works side-by-side with LAUSD, quality practices developed in our schools can be shared with and eventually adopted by other District schools, and because Partnership schools are LAUSD schools and operate under the same District constraints, we can identify and remove barriers to success for our schools and others across LAUSD and the State.\r\n\r\nCity Year also fills a unique void due to the comprehensive package of supports we provide for the most at-risk students. Teams of AmeriCorps members work from 7:30am-6:00pm to provide individualized tutoring, after-school and extracurricular programs, and positive school climate initiatives to turn around the early warning indicators for the students that need it most. We are also unique in the strong partnerships we build with teachers who report feeling more supported and able to differentiate instruction because of the AmeriCorps members’ consistent presence in their classroom. There are strong after-school programs and other student support organizations, but none that are fully integrated into the school day and classroom like City Year. AmeriCorps members are uniquely positioned to help students with their homework since they witnessed the lessons taught that day and can provide different perspective and support to students. \r\n\r\nAgain, the depth of this particular partnership is unique, leveraging our individual strengths, assets, and resources to better support students across Los Angeles."
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "Over the last six years, City Year LA and the Partnership have worked together to bring additional supports to our city’s most at-risk students. By expanding City Year LA services to Carver Middle School, AmeriCorps members will be serving at 10 of the 17 Partnership schools. When City Year partners with a new school, we look for a strong, positive school culture that is open to collaboration, committed to putting students first, and a fundamental belief in students’ potential to succeed. The Partnership embodies this philosophy by providing students better instruction, safer campuses, enrichment programs and activities, and a rigorous curriculum that offers a platform to realize their full potential. The Partnership greatly values City Year AmeriCorps members’ added-value by bringing additional individual attention to students that teachers often cannot extend in the course of a school day. \r\n\r\nIn 2013, Partnership for LA Schools recognized City Year as their Community Partner of the Year at its annual Family and Community Engagement Awards ceremony. We both deeply believe that our students are more likely to succeed if they attend a Partnership school with City Year corps members in the classroom. Our collaboration runs so deep that we have once again opted to apply for this grant together, rather than compete against one another. \r\n\r\nIn our past collaboration, we have found these three factors to be critical: 1) strong leadership from both organizations – on the ground level at the schools as well as at the senior level of our organizations; 2) shared values and a deep belief in our students and their potential; and 3) a willingness to leverage partnerships and outside resources to support our students and our work. \r\n"
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    The total cost of the project is $833,000 per year. This cost covers full
    program implementation of City Year on a school campus with a team of 15
    AmeriCorps members in collaboration with two FTE Partnership staff, a
    Director of School Transformation and a Manager of Family & Community
    Engagement, to align initiatives between all stakeholders. As an AmeriCorps
    program, City Year receives approximately one quarter of its annual budget
    from the government, both federal and state. Additionally, as a close
    partner of the Los Angeles Unified School District, City Year receive
    support from school partners. City Year has seen its funding from the school
    district increase annually since 2009, despite the difficult budget
    climate—a tribute to its work in schools, a close collaboration with the
    Partnership and the value the community and school staff see in the work.
    The remainder of City Year's funds is raised through the private sector. The
    Partnership is supported by a private $50M sustainable grant over 10 years
    that ends in 2017, and covers most of the organization's operating costs.
    Another $5M is raised annually with the support of former LA City Mayor,
    Antonio Villaraigosa and other civic leaders through a combination of public
    and private dollars, including corporate and foundation partners who make
    our annual growth and expansion in LA possible.
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "The Partnership for Los Angeles Schools will use $50,000 to support the salary of their Partnership Support Team, who supports the school's implementation of their model.\r\n\r\nCity Year LA will use $50,000 to support the salaries and benefits of the 16 AmeriCorps members at Carver ($27,569), the staff that supports our AmeriCorps members ($8,196), and  for the other costs of materials and non-personnel items that support our program ($14,235).  We can provide detailed budgets for both organizations upon request."
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    As the demand for City Year’s services continues to grow and more schools
    are identifying resources so that they can have a team serving on their
    campus, City Year is committed to our Long-Term Impact plan that will see
    City Year Los Angeles grow substantially—increasing the size of our corps
    and number of school partners until we have 770 AmeriCorps members serving
    in 63 schools across Los Angeles.  At scale, City Year LA will serve 50% of
    the students who are off-track in our key low-income neighborhoods with a
    goal of 80% of students reaching the 10th grade on track to graduate. One of
    the Partnership’s key strategies for turning around low-performing schools
    is connecting them to effective community partners like City Year to
    increase a school’s capacity for transformation. The Partnership pilots
    programs at its schools, raising philanthropic dollars in the initial years
    and then over time, program costs are absorbed into schools' budgets while
    the need for Partnership staff oversight is diminished and can be deployed
    to other campuses. This enables the Partnership to meet the needs of its
    schools in a cost-effective way, providing a sustainable and scalable model.
