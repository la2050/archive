  Sequoyah school is establishing a new high school that will challenge the
  prevalent model for high school education in both public and private schools
  across the country and accelerate reform in secondary education.  This new
  high school will be focused not only on cultivating and expressing academic
  achievement, but will be a place where students learn how their individual
  success can make a difference for their communities.
Please specify below: 'Sequoyah School, Pasadena-enrolling students from above areas.'

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Sequoyah is establishing a new kind of high school situated in one of the most
  demographically diverse regions of the world, with a program focused on
  developing a student’s leadership skills to address social issues across
  cultural and economic contexts. The curriculum is informed by the principles
  of social entrepreneurship and attention to the skills needed to become
  successful in a 21st century global economy.
   
   The school’s purpose is to ignite and develop a student’s passion for service and social change. As part of their course of study, students attending Sequoyah will be challenged to identify and explore issues important to themselves and their communities, and will fulfill a requirement for the design of a viable proposal for solving a societal problem of their choosing. In doing so, students will have the opportunity to work alongside professionals experienced in the management of public, private and nonprofit organizations and they will acquire the skills, knowledge and determination to assume the responsibility of active citizenship and culturally competent leadership.
   
   The school intends to structure a learning environment that will guide adolescents in balancing ambitious academic achievement with patience, persistence and equanimity. The past few decades of theory and research in educational psychology underscore the importance of non-cognitive skills, dispositions or habits for learning. Students who are coached in how to identify their own strengths and challenges, set realistic goals, use support systems and persevere, find greater long-term success as learners.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Sequoyah must attract sufficient numbers of students to a new independent high
  school that has not yet demonstrated success in college admissions. In order
  to allay perceptions of risk of enrolling in a new program the school has
  already engaged a respected and widely known high school college admissions
  counselor who can assure student applicants that the school's
  college-preparatory program will meet the demands of selective colleges and
  universities.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  In the years ahead Sequoyah will assess the experience of our alumni to
  determine if the school has fulfilled its purpose. To do so it will develop an
  alumni program that will keep our graduates involved and the school informed.
   It will also be important to understand the experience of our social innovation program partners to determine if our students are constructively engaged.Sequoyah will establish an administrative staff position to facilitate social innovation program partnerships and assess the effectiveness of community outreach. 
   In addition, Sequoyah’s board of trustees will annually evaluate the success of high school program. Their assessment will include among other concerns the following objectives: student enrollment goals – including metrics for socioeconomic diversity, recruitment goals for faculty and staff who fit mission and vision; summer institute enrollment and conference outreach ; college matriculation and financial sustainability.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Many colleges and universities are establishing interdisciplinary
  undergraduate entrepreneurship centers. Some are establishing summer programs
  directed towards recruiting high school students. A handful of high schools
  have started extracurricular programs that introduce social entrepreneurship.
  In contrast, Sequoyah will incorporate principles of social entrepreneurship,
  and 21st century skills: critical thinking, collaboration, communication and
  creativity, into every dimension of its program, and do so in a
  developmentally appropriate way for high school-age students. Such a
  beyond-the-self, purpose driven educational approach has been demonstrated to
  raise engagement and achievement levels across subject areas for adolescents
  from a wide range of socioeconomic backgrounds.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Sequoyah is benefiting from the partnership of the following individuals who
  are contributing their expertise to the design of the high school program:
  Mariana Amatullo, Art Center College of Design; Marie-Aimee Brajeux,social
  enterprise consultant;Lorena Garcia-Duran, Ashoka; Laura Gowen, Zest
  Finance;Nicholas Haan, Singularity University;Scott Sherman,Transformative
  Action Institute;Neela Rajendra, Claremont McKenna Kravis Leadership
  Institute;Cynthia Willard, Echoing Green. These partners will not receive any
  portion of the grant.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  The establishment of the high school will require seed funding of $850,000 by
  fall 2016. Total commitments of $720,000 have been raised to date.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-

How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Although Sequoyah is a relatively small independent school, the school's
  leadership intends to amplify the school's influence through partnerships with
  national organizations focused on educational reform and changemaking such as
  Edleader21 and Ashoka. In order to foster a sustained dialogue among educators
  interested in developing innovative curriculum and high school cultures that
  will nurture creativity and critical thinking, Sequoyah will also develop an
  annual summer teacher training institute gathering together public and private
  school educators from across the country and convene an annual Conference for
  Youth Changemakers, in partnership with Ashoka.

    answer: "Sequoyah is establishing a new kind of high school situated in one of the most demographically diverse regions of the world, with a program focused on developing a student’s leadership skills to address social issues across cultural and economic contexts. The curriculum is informed by the principles of social entrepreneurship and attention to the skills needed to become successful in a 21st century global economy.\r\n\r\nThe school’s purpose is to ignite and develop a student’s passion for service and social change. As part of their course of study, students attending Sequoyah will be challenged to identify and explore issues important to themselves and their communities, and will fulfill a requirement for the design of a viable proposal for solving a societal problem of their choosing. In doing so, students will have the opportunity to work alongside professionals experienced in the management of public, private and nonprofit organizations and they will acquire the skills, knowledge and determination to assume the responsibility of active citizenship and culturally competent leadership.\r\n\r\nThe school intends to structure a learning environment that will guide adolescents in balancing ambitious academic achievement with patience, persistence and equanimity. The past few decades of theory and research in educational psychology underscore the importance of non-cognitive skills, dispositions or habits for learning. Students who are coached in how to identify their own strengths and challenges, set realistic goals, use support systems and persevere, find greater long-term success as learners.\r\n\r\n"

      Sequoyah must attract sufficient numbers of students to a new independent
      high school that has not yet demonstrated success in college admissions.
      In order to allay perceptions of risk of enrolling in a new program the
      school has already engaged a respected and widely known high school
      college admissions counselor who can assure student applicants that the
      school's college-preparatory program will meet the demands of selective
      colleges and universities. 
  - name: Please explain how you will evaluate your work.
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "In the years ahead Sequoyah will assess the experience of our alumni to determine if the school has fulfilled its purpose. To do so it will develop an alumni program that will keep our graduates involved and the school informed.\r\nIt will also be important to understand the experience of our social innovation program partners to determine if our students are constructively engaged.Sequoyah will establish an administrative staff position to facilitate social innovation program partnerships and assess the effectiveness of community outreach.  \r\nIn addition, Sequoyah’s board of trustees will annually evaluate the success of high school program. Their assessment will include among other concerns the following objectives: student enrollment goals – including metrics for socioeconomic diversity, recruitment goals for faculty and staff who fit mission and vision; summer institute enrollment and conference outreach ;  college matriculation and financial sustainability. \r\n"

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or

      Many colleges and universities are establishing interdisciplinary
      undergraduate entrepreneurship centers. Some are establishing summer
      programs directed towards recruiting high school students. A handful of
      high schools have started extracurricular programs that introduce social
      entrepreneurship. In contrast, Sequoyah will incorporate principles of
      social entrepreneurship, and 21st century skills: critical thinking,
      collaboration, communication and creativity, into every dimension of its
      program, and do so in a developmentally appropriate way for high
      school-age students. Such a beyond-the-self, purpose driven educational
      approach has been demonstrated to raise engagement and achievement levels
      across subject areas for adolescents from a wide range of socioeconomic
      backgrounds.

      Although Sequoyah is a relatively small independent school, the school's
      leadership intends to amplify the school's influence through partnerships
      with national organizations focused on educational reform and changemaking
      such as Edleader21 and  Ashoka.  In order to foster a sustained dialogue
      among educators interested in developing innovative curriculum and high
      school cultures that will nurture creativity and critical thinking,
      Sequoyah will also develop an annual summer teacher training institute
      gathering together public and private school educators from across the
      country and convene an annual Conference for Youth Changemakers, in
      partnership with Ashoka.
