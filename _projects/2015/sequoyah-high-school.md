  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "Sequoyah is establishing a new kind of high school situated in one of the most demographically diverse regions of the world, with a program focused on developing a student’s leadership skills to address social issues across cultural and economic contexts. The curriculum is informed by the principles of social entrepreneurship and attention to the skills needed to become successful in a 21st century global economy.\r\n\r\nThe school’s purpose is to ignite and develop a student’s passion for service and social change. As part of their course of study, students attending Sequoyah will be challenged to identify and explore issues important to themselves and their communities, and will fulfill a requirement for the design of a viable proposal for solving a societal problem of their choosing. In doing so, students will have the opportunity to work alongside professionals experienced in the management of public, private and nonprofit organizations and they will acquire the skills, knowledge and determination to assume the responsibility of active citizenship and culturally competent leadership.\r\n\r\nThe school intends to structure a learning environment that will guide adolescents in balancing ambitious academic achievement with patience, persistence and equanimity. The past few decades of theory and research in educational psychology underscore the importance of non-cognitive skills, dispositions or habits for learning. Students who are coached in how to identify their own strengths and challenges, set realistic goals, use support systems and persevere, find greater long-term success as learners.\r\n\r\n"

    Sequoyah must attract sufficient numbers of students to a new independent
    high school that has not yet demonstrated success in college admissions. In
    order to allay perceptions of risk of enrolling in a new program the school
    has already engaged a respected and widely known high school college
    admissions counselor who can assure student applicants that the school's
    college-preparatory program will meet the demands of selective colleges and
    universities. 
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "In the years ahead Sequoyah will assess the experience of our alumni to determine if the school has fulfilled its purpose. To do so it will develop an alumni program that will keep our graduates involved and the school informed.\r\nIt will also be important to understand the experience of our social innovation program partners to determine if our students are constructively engaged.Sequoyah will establish an administrative staff position to facilitate social innovation program partnerships and assess the effectiveness of community outreach.  \r\nIn addition, Sequoyah’s board of trustees will annually evaluate the success of high school program. Their assessment will include among other concerns the following objectives: student enrollment goals – including metrics for socioeconomic diversity, recruitment goals for faculty and staff who fit mission and vision; summer institute enrollment and conference outreach ;  college matriculation and financial sustainability. \r\n"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    Many colleges and universities are establishing interdisciplinary
    undergraduate entrepreneurship centers. Some are establishing summer
    programs directed towards recruiting high school students. A handful of high
    schools have started extracurricular programs that introduce social
    entrepreneurship. In contrast, Sequoyah will incorporate principles of
    social entrepreneurship, and 21st century skills: critical thinking,
    collaboration, communication and creativity, into every dimension of its
    program, and do so in a developmentally appropriate way for high school-age
    students. Such a beyond-the-self, purpose driven educational approach has
    been demonstrated to raise engagement and achievement levels across subject
    areas for adolescents from a wide range of socioeconomic backgrounds.

    Sequoyah is benefiting from the partnership of the following individuals who

    The establishment of the high school will require seed funding of $850,000

  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    Although Sequoyah is a relatively small independent school, the school's
    leadership intends to amplify the school's influence through partnerships
    with national organizations focused on educational reform and changemaking
    such as Edleader21 and  Ashoka.  In order to foster a sustained dialogue
    among educators interested in developing innovative curriculum and high
    school cultures that will nurture creativity and critical thinking, Sequoyah
    will also develop an annual summer teacher training institute gathering
    together public and private school educators from across the country and
    convene an annual Conference for Youth Changemakers, in partnership with
    Ashoka.
