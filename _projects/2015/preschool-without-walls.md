title: Preschool Without Walls
project_summary: >-
  Preschool Without Walls (PWW) addresses the fact that 80% of the most
  vulnerable children in Los Angeles are not attending, and will never attend,
  preschool. PWW has a solution: bring early learning out of the classroom and
  into the community with pop-up preschools, place based learning, and community
  run co-ops.

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "We all know that creating access to high quality, early learning experiences for low-income children is one of the most pressing social justice issues of the 21st century. Children who have positive early learning experiences get better grades, have higher graduation rates, and earn more money.  Most of us—do-gooders, funders, policy makers, early childhood advocates—believe that the path to improving early childhood care is to encourage and fiscally support low-income children in attending preschool and then improve the preschool workforce through professional development.  The problem is that the vast majority of the most vulnerable children do not, and will not, go to preschool.  In Los Angeles, 80% of the most vulnerable children attend license exempt friends, family, and neighbor care (FFN). They hang with grandma, play with aunty, or are watched by the neighbor down the hall.   In LA County there are over 200,000 children in this type of care. \r\nPreschool Without Walls  (PWW) has a solution to this problem. Rather than pushing families into traditional school, PWW brings early learning experiences into the community through a three-part model. First, we operate informal preschools on city blocks, in public housing rec rooms, in church basements—pretty much anywhere FFN providers naturally spend time. These informal preschools offer research based, culturally relevant, free early learning activities including story time, dramatic play, and arts and crafts. Second, PWW operates place based preschools in libraries, parks, school sites, and churches for ongoing structured learning experiences using easily replicated activities in readily available community environments.   These “place based” programs meet weekly and have been designed by the UCLA School of Education to leverage the use of public spaces as natural learning environments.   Lastly, FFN providers are supported in organizing community based co-ops—groups of local FFN providers who meet regularly and are supported with take-home activity guides, links to community resources, low-cost learning materials for home use, and daily text messaged activities. Each co-op is visited by PWW staff, providing feedback and support around skills and activities developed in PWW sessions. \r\nDoes PWW work? According to evaluations by UCLA’s School of Social Welfare of PWW’s pilot program 90% of PWW children improved in every category of school readiness."

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    FFN providers are a difficult demographic to engage, organize, and support.
    These folks are often disconnected from, and distrustful of, traditional
    institutions. This social isolation is the primary barrier facing PWW.  To
    address this challenge, PWW is based on, and builds off of, SBCC’s
    Relationship-Based Community Organizing model (RBCO). This model, developed
    at Northwestern University, is considered a promising best practice for
    community engagement. SBCC has the largest RBCO initiative in Los Angeles
    operating over 100 resident-led neighborhood groups, with over 1,500
    individuals. These groups are composed primarily of individuals from the
    low-income communities of color that make most extensive use of FFN care. A
    significant number of participants are themselves FFN providers.  PWW
    leverages the RBCO infrastructure to outreach directly to FFN providers
    through people they know and trust.
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    PWW has an evaluation model designed and implemented by UCLA’s School of
    Social Welfare.  Outcome areas measured for children include: developmental
    gains (motor skills, letter and number recognition, positive play and
    socialization); improved school readiness and physical health as measured by
    teacher interviews, standardized kindergarten assessments; outcome areas
    measured for parents/providers include: increase in positive developmental
    behaviors, including parent-child reading, parent-child play, and overall
    parent engagement; number of parents/providers demonstrating increased
    knowledge on formal early learning resources and programs; number of parents
    enrolling their children in formal early learning programs, number of
    parents/providers demonstrating increased knowledge and increased use with
    their children of community learning and development resources in parks,
    home and neighborhood, libraries, and schools.
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "Experts in early childhood have called FFN the third rail of early learning systems building and have mostly ignored this critical population. Few initiatives in Los Angeles are working with the FNN population.   First Five LA conducted a research study in 2007 to understand the needs of FFN providers and implemented a limited pilot project.  In 2015, The David and Lucile Packard Foundation contracted with Harding and Company to map the FFN landscape. This assessment found no comparable community based programs to PWW. According to the report, attempts to reach the FFN population are primarily focused on parent engagement/training and family strengthening including projects by Families In Schools, Abriendo Puertas, Magnolia Place Community Initiative, Youth Policy Institute, and CSUN Neighborhood Partners in Action Institute for Community Health and Wellbeing. \r\nThere are a number of national initiatives to bring information on early learning to communities. Too Small to Fail, an initiative of the Clinton Global Foundation, aims to help parents and businesses take meaningful actions to improve the health and well-being of children ages zero to five by promoting new research on the science of children’s brain development, early learning and early health. VROOM is an app, developed by the Bezos Foundation, which supports parents with daily “brain building” activities to do with children 0-5.  While important, neither of these offers direct programing for FFN providers in the Los Angeles area and have limited cultural relevance for diverse populations. They are both, however, potential partners to support PWW with additional best practices. VROOM specifically could provide complementary services to PWW text messaging approach to support FFN providers within PWW network with daily enrichment activities."
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "PWW has built strategic partnerships that align and leverage the resources and expertise of a number of partners. Some of the partners were funded at the pilot stage to develop curriculum and instructional models; others are leveraging existing resources to support PWW.  While all of these partners are essential to PWW, two will receive direct funding from the LA 2050 challenge.  Partners include:\r\n\r\n•\tUCLA School of Education and Information Studies has partnered with PWW to develop a place based learning curriculum that is culturally relevant for the FFN population.   The curriculum is designed to turn local assets such as the libraries, parks, and small businesses, into learning opportunities. Each model is progressive and builds the capacity of FFN providers to utilize these local learning sites on an ongoing basis. UCLA School of Education and Information Studies will receive $10,000.  \r\n•\tUCLA School of Social Welfare develops and implements the program evaluation model for PWW\r\n•\tCounty and local library systems provide space, free of cost, for “learning in the library” programs as well as access to ongoing literacy services.  Currently PWW works with the LA County and city library system and will expand to work with municipal libraries where necessary\r\n•\tCounty and city parks and programs host “preschool in the park” providing space for PWW in 9 parks in SPA 8 and will provide an additional 6 locations for future PWW expansion.\r\n•\tLos Angeles County Department of Children’s and Family Services is an ongoing funding partner providing fiscal resources to place families engaged with protective services in PWW programs\r\n•\tCal State Dominguez Hills provides early childhood interns to PWW locations free of cost.\r\n•\tBring Me a Book Foundation provides free early literacy materials to PWW locations. "
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': "SBCC is seeking $100,000 to expand its successful PWW pilot throughout Los Angeles County.  There are two primary costs associated with PWW: one time start-up and one year operational costs to build the community based investment and ongoing operational costs to sustain the program. The start-up costs of expanding the number of PWW place based locations for one year is $100,000, the amount of the grant requested from LA 2050 and outlined in the budget.  Beyond LA 2050 resources, further PWW expansion sites can be funded from foundations strategically aligned with PWW’s mission. While FFN has historically been ignored, an interest in them is emerging. In 2012, The David and Lucile Packard Foundation announced a 10-year, $100 million early learning initiative, which included investments in FFN. The Bezos Foundation created the app VROOM and has began to explore partners and funding local initiatives working with non-traditional preschool communities; and First Five LA conducted a horizon scan of the FFN landscape and has invested in pilot programing. These, and other private sector funders, can provide catalytic start-up resources for new PWW programs\r\nPWW has also received a grant from LAUP to support expansion and ongoing operating costs.  The Department of Children and Family Services has also expressed interest in this model and we are currently conducting a pilot in a partnership with the DCFS Torrance office.  We are currently working with the Bring Me a Book Foundation as well as CSU Dominguez Hills to explore additional funding and a partnership with them. And we will be submitting a proposal to The David and Lucile Packard Foundation."

  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "PWW has a bold vision to bring quality early learning experiences to every child in FFN care throughout Los Angeles County closing a critical service gap in the Los Angeles early learning system. Beyond the LA 2050 expansion site, we will achieve this bold vision by leveraging existing public systems and advocating for systems to bring learning out of the classroom and into the community. \r\nSBCC’s role as a strategic community engagement partner to First Five LA’s Best Start programs creates an opportunity for PWW to offer our place based learning model in the Best Start Communities. Created in 1998 to invest LA County’s allocation of funds from California’s Proposition 10 tobacco tax, First 5 LA is a leading early childhood advocate working collaboratively across LA County.  In 2011, First Five LA created a place based strategy called Best Start working in 14 vulnerable communities across LA County.  SBCC is a funded strategic community engagement partner in 13 Best Start communities operating 100 community action groups with over 1,500 residents.   This strategic partnership with First 5 LA Best Start will be an asset in expanding PWW programs throughout LA County.  \r\nSecond, SBCC will partner with other community-based organizations to work in locations outside of the 14 Best Start locations. There are hundreds of community based non-profits throughout Los Angeles County that have deep relationships with the population of families that utilizes FFN care. Moreover, many of these non-profits have a mission to support families. PWW provides these CBO's with a cost effective model to strengthen early outcomes within these communities. PWW will partner with these CBOs to provide technical assistance and support implementation. Finally, in addition to expanding on the ground programming, PWW will work with the LA County and city library system to remove barriers to “early childhood library learning” and leverage opportunities to enhance libraries as early learning centers for all children and partner with the LA County and city parks system to support “preschools in the park” bringing the best practices of place based learning to every city in LA County."

  in the Los Angeles early learning system. Beyond the LA 2050 expansion site,
  we will achieve this bold vision by leveraging existing public systems and
  advocating for systems to bring learning out of the classroom and into the
  community. 
   SBCC’s role as a strategic community engagement partner to First Five LA’s Best Start programs creates an opportunity for PWW to offer our place based learning model in the Best Start Communities. Created in 1998 to invest LA County’s allocation of funds from California’s Proposition 10 tobacco tax, First 5 LA is a leading early childhood advocate working collaboratively across LA County. In 2011, First Five LA created a place based strategy called Best Start working in 14 vulnerable communities across LA County. SBCC is a funded strategic community engagement partner in 13 Best Start communities operating 100 community action groups with over 1,500 residents. This strategic partnership with First 5 LA Best Start will be an asset in expanding PWW programs throughout LA County. 
   Second, SBCC will partner with other community-based organizations to work in locations outside of the 14 Best Start locations. There are hundreds of community based non-profits throughout Los Angeles County that have deep relationships with the population of families that utilizes FFN care. Moreover, many of these non-profits have a mission to support families. PWW provides these CBO's with a cost effective model to strengthen early outcomes within these communities. PWW will partner with these CBOs to provide technical assistance and support implementation. Finally, in addition to expanding on the ground programming, PWW will work with the LA County and city library system to remove barriers to “early childhood library learning” and leverage opportunities to enhance libraries as early learning centers for all children and partner with the LA County and city parks system to support “preschools in the park” bringing the best practices of place based learning to every city in LA County.
