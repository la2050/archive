  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "There is an education alarm bell ringing! Across Los Angeles, there is a major high school drop out crisis and After-School All-Stars, Los Angeles is here to respond. \r\nAccording to estimates released by the Ad Council, 7,000 high school students drop out of school every day. Without a high school diploma, these children face huge socioeconomic challenges, including above-average unemployment rates, below-average wages, and an increased likelihood of serving time in prison. \r\nOur nation’s staggering dropout crisis most significantly affects minority students, with nearly 50% of Black, Latino, and Native Americans in public schools failing to graduate. ASAS-LA population of students are 91% Latino and 8% African American. Our students are most at risk of abandoning their education before receiving a high school diploma. \r\nAfter-School All-Stars, Los Angeles will combat this crisis by mentoring students in three ways:\r\n1.\tWe Are Ready (W.A.R.) - We Are Ready is a middle school to high school transition program. ASAS-LA identifies and engages eighth graders who show signs they are at risk of dropping out, such as poor attendance, behavior issues, and low grades. The primary goal is to maximize the number of students who are promoted to the ninth grade, graduate high school and attend college. \r\n2.\tCampUs - Students who have completed the W.A.R. curriculum will have the opportunity to apply for and attend CampUs. CampUs is a summer program on college campuses that focuses on preparing rising ninth graders for high school and beyond. Students sleep in college dorms and take daily classes on how to be successful in high school, college, and the workforce. They are mentored by ASAS-LA staff and by successful high school and college students. Students attend nightly career panels, comprised of community leaders. Students examine critical issues affecting their communities, engage in debate, and develop their leadership and advocacy skills. \r\n3.\tLeaders Influence Family and Education- Students will attend Alumni Reunion Summits once a month. These summits will include topics such as high school plans, scholarships, life skills, entrepreneurship, college visits and assistance with college applications. Students will also receive on-the-job training where they will be paired with a Program Leader for 6-8 weeks. Upon graduation from high school and successful completion of L.I.F.E., students will be invited to become Program Leaders within the organization."

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    One major barrier that we foresee is that students become really busy once
    they enter high school. It may be difficult for the students to attend the
    proposed summits. We will overcome this by offering the summit on the
    weekends and multiple times throughout the month. This will make it more
    accessible to the students. 
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    Our work will be evaluated on numerous levels. After-School All-Stars, Los
    Angeles works with a third party evaluator, Claremont Graduate School, to
    assess W.A.R. and CampUs program impact, and together with school district
    data, measures impact in areas such as academic performance and
    social-emotional development. Program impact is assessed through a series of
    pre and post surveys completed by students and mentors. We will also track
    attendance and consistency through Youth Services database. Claremont
    Graduate School will also collect Fall and Spring grades from each student,
    complete ongoing observations of the program as well as receive counselor
    tracking documents to ensure students will graduate.
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    The middle school to high school transition piece is a hot topic in
    education right now. There are definitely other organizations that are
    trying to accomplish the same goal. There are several differences in our
    approach. First, we serve a large population of students throughout the city
    of Los Angeles. The program will reach all of these students. Second, our
    program component, CampUs, allows students to take part in a week-long
    experience on a college campus and it's completely free of charge. Third, we
    will continue to follow these students and provide support as they continue
    through high school.
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "Wells Fargo- $0\r\nJunior Achievement- $!,500 \r\nNational Office- $0\r\n"
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    This project overall will cost roughly around $150,000. The additional cost
    will be covered by using another grant we received.
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Staffing- $60,000\r\nProfessional Development- $5,000\r\nMaterials and Supplies- $10,000\r\nEquipment- $5,000\r\nTransportation- $20,000\r\n\r\n"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    I'll be honest I don't understand this question but would be more than
    willing to discuss with someone once I understand the question.
