title: South Los Angeles Healthy Corner Store Conversion Program
project_summary: >-
  South Los Angeles Healthy Corner Store Conversion Program is a proposal to
  help prevent childhood obesity through an innovative approach of converting
  corner stores into venues that stock fresh, healthy products. In food deserts,
  with limited access to fresh fruits and vegetables, corner stores are
  ubiquitous. Adding fresh, healthy food to these regularly frequented
  businesses can increase consumption of nutritious food and stimulate the
  economy by increasing the profits of local businesses.

  'DESCRIBE IN GREATER DETAIL HOW YOU WILL MAKE LA THE HEALTHIEST PLACE TO LIVE: ': "In South LA, 1 in 3 children is obese. Tackling obesity at a young age can decrease population prevalence of obesity-related diseases, such as diabetes and heart disease. The lack of healthy food in low-income communities contributes to the obesity epidemic. Eating healthy food is not simply a matter of choice, as many families can’t choose healthy food because the options aren’t accessible in their community. \r\nCorner stores, commonly the primary location where residents shop in low-income communities, don’t often stock fresh, healthy food. Children’s Bureau’s South LA Healthy Corner Store Conversion Program will work with corner stores to provide access to fresh, healthy food and increase the availability of nutritious options in low-income communities. Generally, a corner store has less than 2,000 square feet, 4 aisles or less, and 1 cash register. Children’s Bureau (CB) will recruit 14 corner stores, 1 in each of the following neighborhoods in District 1 in Los Angeles City: Glassell Park, Cypress Park, Highland Park, Mount Washington, Solano Canyon, Elysian Park, Echo Park, Westlake, Angelino Heights, Lafayette Park, Chinatown, Lincoln Heights, Montecito Heights, and Pico Union. \r\nOnce a corner store formally agrees to participate, they select 3 items from a healthy menu to introduce in their store. This menu includes bananas, avocadoes, mangoes, oranges, and apples. CB connects the stores with COMPRA Foods to purchase these items. COMPRA (Community Market Purchasing Real and Affordable) Foods is a food distribution company that delivers produce to small businesses. \r\nCB then works with each corner store owner to provide one-on-one trainings about the skills necessary to make healthy changes profitable. CB also provides essential marketing tools, including nutrition labels and food demonstrations to guide customers to make healthy purchasing decisions. \r\nAll corner stores that implement 3 healthy foods and marketing strategies within 3 months of joining the program receive an incentive to purchase more healthy food. Corner stores that maintain their healthy food and marketing for 6 months are eligible for either a shelving unit or refrigerator to increase their capacity to provide healthy food.\r\nSouth LA Healthy Corner Store Conversions aims to help reverse the obesity epidemic by providing corner stores the resources to stock fresh, healthy food in low-income communities.\r\n"

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    Children’s Bureau (CB) has previous experience working with local businesses
    to join a voluntary health improvement program. This program worked with
    local restaurants to increase their availability of healthy options.
    Although CB successfully on-boarded several restaurants, the most
    challenging aspect was enticing local restaurant owners to make healthy
    changes. From this experience, we anticipate that a challenge may be
    identifying corner store owners who are willing to make healthy conversions.
    Two important tactics we plan to incorporate to overcome this obstacle are
    to build one-on-one, supportive relationships with the owners and to
    highlight the potential business benefits of including healthy items. CB is
    confident that through the lessons learned recruiting restaurant owners to
    make healthy changes, we will be able to successfully recruit 14 corner
    store owners who are interested in serving as health champions in their
    community.
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    Children’s Bureau (CB) will evaluate our project by initially outreaching to
    30 corner stores and then determining if we successfully recruited 14 out of
    the 30 corner stores. Second, CB will assess if these 14 corner stores
    underwent a corner store conversion. CB will also collect process data,
    which will allow corner store owners to determine if their new, healthy
    products are selling. These evaluations will help determine any potential
    barriers to stocking healthy food at the corner store. Additionally, CB will
    collect food demonstration pre- and post-tests. These evaluation tools will
    determine if the food demonstrations are effective in teaching customers how
    to use a corner store’s new, healthy ingredients to prepare a meal their
    whole family will enjoy. In CB's previous experience with conducting food
    demonstrations, surveys comparing data before and after each food
    demonstration show an overall increase in knowledge.
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    The Healthy Neighborhood Market Network is a healthy food retail project of
    the LA Food Policy Council that increases the capacity of corner stores to
    stock healthy items. Children’s Bureau’s South Los Angeles Healthy Corner
    Store Conversion Program is unique in that we provide corner store owners
    with one-on-one, in-store trainings on how to price and display their
    healthy products. Additionally, Children’s Bureau conducts culturally
    appropriate food demonstrations in each of the participating corner stores.
    This will supply the corner stores with an additional resource to highlight
    the healthy food to their customers and will provide the customers with an
    opportunity to see how they can utilize the store’s new items to prepare a
    healthy meal that their family will enjoy. Both the individualized trainings
    about marketing and branding and the food demonstrations are intended to
    increase customers’ awareness and consumption of the new, healthy products
    and thereby aid in the efforts to reduce and prevent childhood overweight
    and obesity.
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    Children’s Bureau (CB) plans to work with COMPRA (Community Market
    Purchasing Real and Affordable) Foods. COMPRA Foods is a food distribution
    company that delivers healthy foods to small businesses on a weekly basis
    that want to start offering fresh, healthy foods. CB will connect the corner
    stores with COMPRA Foods, as an avenue for the corner stores to purchase
    healthy foods. COMPRA Foods charges a one-time membership fee to join and
    $1,400 of the $100,000 grant will be used to cover this cost.
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    The outlined South LA Healthy Corner Store Conversion Program is estimated
    to cost $100,000. Children’s Bureau does not anticipate needing additional
    money to fund the program.
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "A. Full time Program Coordinator working 30% of their time on the program: $15,530.\r\n\r\nB. Benefits for full time Program Coordinator, including health, dental, vision, life and disability, state unemployment, workers compensation, and 401k: $4,193.\r\nThe total benefits rate is calculated at 27% for full time employees. \r\n\r\nC. Contract Worker with a Masters in Public Policy working 100% of their time on the program: $62,400.\r\n\r\nD. Promotional materials, such as signs and nutrition labels, for each corner store: $5,000.\r\n\r\nE. Program and office supplies to complete food demonstrations and daily work assignments: $4,500.\r\n\r\nF. Client related incentives for corner stores to purchase and display healthy foods, including membership fee to join COMPRA Foods and conversion equipment, such as a shelving unit or refrigerator: $6,500."
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    Children’s Bureau (CB) plans to expand our reach after successfully
    implementing the program in the 14neighborhoods within Los Angeles City of
    District 1. We hope to target additional corner stores in low-income
    communities throughout Los Angeles that have limited access to fresh,
    healthy foods and that have the highest rates of obesity and obesity-related
    diseases. CB aims to implement lessons learned, through evaluation and
    knowledge sharing among corner store and partners, and secure additional
    funding for successful scaling.

      South Los Angeles Healthy Corner Store Conversion Program is a proposal to
      help prevent childhood obesity through an innovative approach of
      converting corner stores into venues that stock fresh, healthy products.
      In food deserts, with limited access to fresh fruits and vegetables,
      corner stores are ubiquitous. Adding fresh, healthy food to these
      regularly frequented businesses can increase consumption of nutritious
      food and stimulate the economy by increasing the profits of local
      businesses.

      DESCRIBE IN GREATER DETAIL HOW YOU WILL MAKE LA THE HEALTHIEST PLACE TO
      LIVE: 
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "In South LA, 1 in 3 children is obese. Tackling obesity at a young age can decrease population prevalence of obesity-related diseases, such as diabetes and heart disease. The lack of healthy food in low-income communities contributes to the obesity epidemic. Eating healthy food is not simply a matter of choice, as many families can’t choose healthy food because the options aren’t accessible in their community. \r\nCorner stores, commonly the primary location where residents shop in low-income communities, don’t often stock fresh, healthy food. Children’s Bureau’s South LA Healthy Corner Store Conversion Program will work with corner stores to provide access to fresh, healthy food and increase the availability of nutritious options in low-income communities. Generally, a corner store has less than 2,000 square feet, 4 aisles or less, and 1 cash register. Children’s Bureau (CB) will recruit 14 corner stores, 1 in each of the following neighborhoods in District 1 in Los Angeles City: Glassell Park, Cypress Park, Highland Park, Mount Washington, Solano Canyon, Elysian Park, Echo Park, Westlake, Angelino Heights, Lafayette Park, Chinatown, Lincoln Heights, Montecito Heights, and Pico Union. \r\nOnce a corner store formally agrees to participate, they select 3 items from a healthy menu to introduce in their store. This menu includes bananas, avocadoes, mangoes, oranges, and apples. CB connects the stores with COMPRA Foods to purchase these items. COMPRA (Community Market Purchasing Real and Affordable) Foods is a food distribution company that delivers produce to small businesses. \r\nCB then works with each corner store owner to provide one-on-one trainings about the skills necessary to make healthy changes profitable. CB also provides essential marketing tools, including nutrition labels and food demonstrations to guide customers to make healthy purchasing decisions. \r\nAll corner stores that implement 3 healthy foods and marketing strategies within 3 months of joining the program receive an incentive to purchase more healthy food. Corner stores that maintain their healthy food and marketing for 6 months are eligible for either a shelving unit or refrigerator to increase their capacity to provide healthy food.\r\nSouth LA Healthy Corner Store Conversions aims to help reverse the obesity epidemic by providing corner stores the resources to stock fresh, healthy food in low-income communities.\r\n"

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      Children’s Bureau (CB) has previous experience working with local
      businesses to join a voluntary health improvement program. This program
      worked with local restaurants to increase their availability of healthy
      options. Although CB successfully on-boarded several restaurants, the most
      challenging aspect was enticing local restaurant owners to make healthy
      changes. From this experience, we anticipate that a challenge may be
      identifying corner store owners who are willing to make healthy
      conversions. Two important tactics we plan to incorporate to overcome this
      obstacle are to build one-on-one, supportive relationships with the owners
      and to highlight the potential business benefits of including healthy
      items. CB is confident that through the lessons learned recruiting
      restaurant owners to make healthy changes, we will be able to successfully
      recruit 14 corner store owners who are interested in serving as health
      champions in their community.
  - name: Please explain how you will evaluate your work.
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      Children’s Bureau (CB) will evaluate our project by initially outreaching
      to 30 corner stores and then determining if we successfully recruited 14
      out of the 30 corner stores. Second, CB will assess if these 14 corner
      stores underwent a corner store conversion. CB will also collect process
      data, which will allow corner store owners to determine if their new,
      healthy products are selling. These evaluations will help determine any
      potential barriers to stocking healthy food at the corner store.
      Additionally, CB will collect food demonstration pre- and post-tests.
      These evaluation tools will determine if the food demonstrations are
      effective in teaching customers how to use a corner store’s new, healthy
      ingredients to prepare a meal their whole family will enjoy. In CB's
      previous experience with conducting food demonstrations, surveys comparing
      data before and after each food demonstration show an overall increase in
      knowledge.

    answer: >-
      The Healthy Neighborhood Market Network is a healthy food retail project
      of the LA Food Policy Council that increases the capacity of corner stores
      to stock healthy items. Children’s Bureau’s South Los Angeles Healthy
      Corner Store Conversion Program is unique in that we provide corner store
      owners with one-on-one, in-store trainings on how to price and display
      their healthy products. Additionally, Children’s Bureau conducts
      culturally appropriate food demonstrations in each of the participating
      corner stores. This will supply the corner stores with an additional
      resource to highlight the healthy food to their customers and will provide
      the customers with an opportunity to see how they can utilize the store’s
      new items to prepare a healthy meal that their family will enjoy. Both the
      individualized trainings about marketing and branding and the food
      demonstrations are intended to increase customers’ awareness and
      consumption of the new, healthy products and thereby aid in the efforts to
      reduce and prevent childhood overweight and obesity.

      that want to start offering fresh, healthy foods. CB will connect the
      corner stores with COMPRA Foods, as an avenue for the corner stores to
      purchase healthy foods. COMPRA Foods charges a one-time membership fee to
      join and $1,400 of the $100,000 grant will be used to cover this cost.

      District 1. We hope to target additional corner stores in low-income
      communities throughout Los Angeles that have limited access to fresh,
      healthy foods and that have the highest rates of obesity and
      obesity-related diseases. CB aims to implement lessons learned, through
      evaluation and knowledge sharing among corner store and partners, and
      secure additional funding for successful scaling.
