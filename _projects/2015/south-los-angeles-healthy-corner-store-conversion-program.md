title: South Los Angeles Healthy Corner Store Conversion Program
project_summary: >-
  South Los Angeles Healthy Corner Store Conversion Program is a proposal to
  help prevent childhood obesity through an innovative approach of converting
  corner stores into venues that stock fresh, healthy products. In food deserts,
  with limited access to fresh fruits and vegetables, corner stores are
  ubiquitous. Adding fresh, healthy food to these regularly frequented
  businesses can increase consumption of nutritious food and stimulate the
  economy by increasing the profits of local businesses.

Where will you be working?:
  - South LA
  - >-
    District One of Los Angeles City (Glassell Park, Cypress Park, Highland
    Park, Mount Washington, Solano Canyon, Elysian Park, Echo Park, Westlake,
    Angelino Heights, Lafayette Park, Chinatown, Lincoln Heights, Montecito
    Heights, and Pico Union)
How do you plan to use these resources to make change?:
  - Conduct research
  - Engage residents and stakeholders
  - Implement a pilot or new project
  - Mobilize for systems change
How will your proposal improve the following “Live” metrics?:
  - Access to healthy food
  - Obesity rates
  - Percentage of LA communities that are resilient (Dream Metric)
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Children’s Bureau (CB) will evaluate our project by initially outreaching to
  30 corner stores and then determining if we successfully recruited 14 out of
  the 30 corner stores. Second, CB will assess if these 14 corner stores
  underwent a corner store conversion. CB will also collect process data, which
  will allow corner store owners to determine if their new, healthy products are
  selling. These evaluations will help determine any potential barriers to
  stocking healthy food at the corner store. Additionally, CB will collect food
  demonstration pre- and post-tests. These evaluation tools will determine if
  the food demonstrations are effective in teaching customers how to use a
  corner store’s new, healthy ingredients to prepare a meal their whole family
  will enjoy. In CB's previous experience with conducting food demonstrations,
  surveys comparing data before and after each food demonstration show an
  overall increase in knowledge.
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
  - Money (financial capital)
  - Volunteers/staff (human capital)
  - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
  - Community outreach
  - Network/relationship support
  - Quality improvement research
