  The Garden is a socially-engaged, immersive art installation, designed to
  fulfill a site’s highest potential through creating a functional and beautiful
  greenspace: an edible garden intermingled with drought-tolerant native plants.
  This abundant environment will sustain, inspire and nourish students (and
  teachers) at New Village Girls Academy, a public charter school. This kicks
  off Alma Community Outreach’s pilot program to create sustainable
  installations in food desert areas of Los Angeles.
