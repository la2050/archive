  URBAN NATURE EXPLORED: LAAS will engage the public, students, teachers, and
  community volunteers in nature activities, field trips, and after-school
  programs at parks, beaches and open spaces at these locations:
   
   Ballona Wetlands
   Open House On The Wetlands welcomes people of all ages to explore one of the last remaining coastal wetlands. Our school field trip program brings thousands of students and teachers to view the wetlands up-close through microscope samples, and binoculars, witnessing birds and wildlife that utilize the wetlands.
   
   Kenneth Hahn State Rec.Area
   Elementary and middle school students participate in experiential science-based activities, including exploration of geology, soil, plant life, local wildlife habitat and a good dose of exercise. 
   
   Beaches
   Hundreds of volunteers and students help to conserve shorebird habitat on beaches in LA County. Serving 400+ students, the program explores ecology and stewardship along a coastline visited by millions of people each year. 
   
   Baldwin Hills Scenic Overlook
   LAAS’ after-school internship program teams high school students with biologists and restoration ecologists to actively engage in and improve their communities. Students are introduced to the science of habitat restoration ecology through site-specific work and field trips, learning first-hand about managing natural habitat within urban areas. Students will then lead hundreds of community volunteers in restoration work, planting native coastal sage scrub at Baldwin Hills, and restoring beach habitat at Venice Beach. The restoration work is aimed at creating a healthy, clean and safe environment where people and wildlife can thrive.
   
   Schoolyard Habitat
   Building on their knowledge from the Environmental Leadership program, students will assist LAAS College Fellows, LAAS restoration ecologists and community volunteers to implement a new schoolyard habitat at Esperanza Elementary. The goal of this project is to create a healthier schoolyard environment where students can play; and turn a once degraded area into a thriving nature-filled space that attracts insects, pollinators, birds, and lizards, that children and teachers can observe, utilizing the habitat as an outdoor learning center. Habitat plans have been approved by LAUSD officials. The Esperanza Schoolyard Habitat will be the second project of its kind for LAAS and students.
   
   URBAN NATURE EXPRESSED: Collaboration with Venice Arts (described in partnership section below)
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  In park-poor LA, many urban youth have little connection to nature, and may
  therefore place little value in environmental stewardship. A recent student in
  LAAS' Baldwin Hills program, J. Sosa, describes what many in her community
  experience every day. “Concrete dominates my life. Every day I walk down
  concrete stairs, through concrete hallways, down concrete sidewalks, toward a
  mostly concrete school. Seeing a “neighborhood” is difficult.” We view
  engaging urban minority youth, through service learning, as a key component to
  achieving long-term conservation success. We further our mission by empowering
  the next generation of environmental stewards to pursue higher education and
  career goals that they may not have otherwise thought possible. We host
  college application workshops. Within our Baldwin Hills Greenhouse Internship
  program, 100% of graduating seniors have received acceptance letters from
  four-year institutions.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We track student attendance/hours engaged in all of our programs. We also ask
  students and teachers to fill out 1-2 surveys about their experience in the
  programs. The majority of high school students respond that they learned new
  things about their local green spaces, and that being in the program helped
  shape a new interest in environmental careers or ways to integrate
  environmental awareness into a non-science career interest. Students often
  describe the program as helpful academically, socially, and emotionally.
  Because our outdoor programs reach youth of all ages, elementary through high
  school, many of our students will have been exposed to the wide range of
  biodiversity found in LA, and as alumni, they continue to participate in LAAS
  programs after graduation. 
   We also measure our success by the number of community volunteers we engage, and acres of restored parklands and beaches that are restored (amount of trash and weeds removed and the number of native plants planted.)
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  We work closely with local Audubon chapters in species and habitat
  conservation, but LA Audubon is unique in its commitment to ongoing
  after-school environmental education programs. Los Angeles Audubon receives
  approximately $5,000 per year in funding from National/California Audubon.
  However, as a separate 501(c)(3) organization, LAAS must secure its own
  funding for local youth and community programs. We collaborate with a network
  of community organizations (Ballona Renaissance, Baldwin Hills Conservancy),
  educational institutions (UCLA, 826LA, local schools) and wildlife and
  conservation agencies (CA Dept. Fish & Wildlife, US Fish & Wildlife) to name a
  few, that share a common interest in environmental stewardship. Partnerships
  with key agencies continue to pave the way for expanded student access to
  natural public lands. The Baldwin Hills Conservancy’s Environmental Initiative
  has funded and facilitated pilot programs, studies and stewardship
  opportunities in Southwest Los Angeles County for over a decade. To date, the
  Los Angeles Audubon Baldwin Hills Internship Program stands out as one of the
  Conservancy’s most successful public/private conservation collaborations in
  the region. Creating a work force in the fields of natural resource
  management, environmental science, urban planning, and environmental education
  that reflects a true diversity of communities will be key to keeping these
  fields relevant, innovative, and effective. We are proud of our program’s
  inclusiveness, serving special education students, academic-achievers, and
  academic strugglers. All of our outdoor youth programs combine art with
  science and encourage creative thinking about plants, birds, insects and
  wildlife found in LA. Each year, we host a Conservation Art Show at an
  elementary school where students display their own art and act as docents,
  leading the public on guided tours through the exhibit and in their schoolyard
  native habitat. The entire student body gets involved via science posters,
  music, art, and dance performances all themed around nature. The Conservation
  Art Show includes the LAAS high school Restoration Leaders who contribute to
  the fun with “pollination poetry,” science “rapping,” and paper-making
  activities. The LA2050 grant will enable us to connect more people to nature
  and allow us to add an additional science-meets-art component through our
  Venice Arts partner.

  Building upon LA Audubon’s successful environmental youth education and
  community programs, we will partner with Venice Arts to implement Urban Nature
  Expressed, a collaborative, 24-week after-school arts workshop for low-income
  teens. 
   
   Venice Arts is an exemplary arts organization honored by, among others, the President’s Commission on The Arts and Humanities, whose mission is to ignite youths' imagination, mentor their creativity, and expand their sense of possibility through high quality, accessible media-based arts education programs. LA Audubon views this partnership with Venice Arts as a way for young people to dive deeper into the urban environment by combining art with science and using photography to express their discoveries in a unique and powerful way. The workshop, held at the Venice Arts’ center, will be co-taught by a Venice Arts teaching artist and documentary photographer, and a LAAS biologist/science illustrator. It is projected that 150+ youth will participate in simple experiments in art and science at a Pop-up Gallery and 200+ adults will be engaged both through the young photographers story development process, and through the exhibition of their work. Using the concept of mapping as a framework for both scientific exploration and creative production, participants will explore the six-mile bike path that travels along Ballona Creek, through the wetlands to the Pacific Ocean. In addition to conducting scientific experiments that explore the natural environment, they will investigate the people who populate the path. Creative research will include photographing and interviewing people at three or four key points and identifying a small subset of people with unique and interesting stories about whom participants will create photo essays.
   The project culminates with a Pop-up Gallery in a community adjacent to the bike path. Locations under consideration include farmer’s markets and community festivals with significant numbers of people and ample foot traffic. Teens will staff the Gallery, lead mini-workshops throughout the day, and engage other young people in simple experiments exploring science and art. Information about the Ballona Creek Bike Path will be made available. This Pop-up Gallery not only celebrates youths’ achievements but, also, promotes awareness about this beautiful slice of urban nature. LA Audubon will allocate $20,000 in grant funds directly to Venice Arts to cover costs for their portion of the workshop.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  The total program costs for Urban Nature Explored & Expressed will be
  approximately $205,000. LAAS has secured additional funding from National Fish
  & Wildlife Foundation, US Fish & Wildlife Service, Disney Conservation Fund,
  California State Parks Foundation and from private foundations and donors to
  cover the balance of the program costs. With support from LA2050, Los Angeles
  Audubon will connect more urban youth to nature and engage under-served
  communities in improving parks, schoolyards and beaches, protecting threatened
  species and preserving vital habitat. LA2050 funds will pay for buses for
  field trips throughout the school year to Ballona Wetlands, Kenneth Hahn, and
  to the Beaches, for schools that otherwise would be unable to participate.
  Inner-city youth (high school students and College Fellows) will receive
  stipends for their work. Under-served communities will benefit from this
  project, by participating in and creating healthier park environments and
  schoolyards, where students and teachers can utilize nature as a powerful
  teaching tool.

How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  We plan to scale our successful proposal by growing environmental leaders. We
  base this proposal on our past successes and activities. LAAS board members
  and staff served on the LAUSD Task Force for Outdoor Education and are
  currently conducting a Teacher Fellowship program that will show teachers how
  to replicate our program in their own schoolyards, using the outdoors as a
  classroom for all subjects with curricula aligned to meet state teaching
  standards. LAAS’ dedicated education staff has kept pace with the growing
  interest in our environmental programs by hiring student graduates from our
  program to work with under-served students as mentors and project
  coordinators. This year, NINE of our alumni taught workshops at our initial
  Outdoor Education ‘Boot Camp’ at Baldwin Hills for high school interns and
  restoration leaders. Additionally, we offer high school students a paid
  internship to study environmental science. Our program provides hands-on work
  and research experience, mentorship and community service opportunities, and
  supports students in their college application process. And, bottom line, the
  students have fun while participating in this demanding program. We plan to
  continue to expand our internship program that is investing in the hard work
  and dedication of our students who are in turn improving green spaces in urban
  LA. Our future goal is to develop and offer a Community Stewardship Program at
  a local community college. 
   
   Urban Nature Explored/Expressed will: 
   * foster a strong connection between under-served communities and local parks, beaches and open spaces
   * engage urban students in hands-on stewardship activities that improve LA’s green spaces for everyone
   * empower the next generation of environmental stewards to communicate through art the power of nature in LA
   * invest in unemployed/under-employed youth with paid internships in outdoor education and environmental conservation
   * increase the number of students having access to nature
   * increase the number of children enrolled in after-school programs
   * spark new environmental thinking, research and action through student-led community events 
   * collaborate with partners to develop creative ways to spread the importance of conserving nature in LA
