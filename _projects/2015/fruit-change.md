  Fruit Change aims to connect neighbors who have fruit trees with neighbors who
  want the fruit, subsequently fostering connections between neighbors across
  age, class, ethnic and geographic borders that may otherwise never happen.
  Those with trees will be able to trade with their neighbors, thus eliminating
  the waste of excess fruit. Those without trees can trade in sweat equity by
  picking, sorting, preserving and delivering fruit with their neighbors.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  The food growing in yards should connect us. If you've got fruit literally
  growing on trees, it should be very easy to share it with your community.
  Fruit Change aims to put a system in place to ensure neighbors connect with
  each other, so home grown food doesn’t go to waste when someone nearby could
  be eating it. Fruit Change aims to solve four problems with the current fruit
  tree situation in San Pedro.
   1: Trees often produce more fruit than the owner can consume, or even pick, so the fruit falls to the ground and rots. This attracts bugs and rodents, can stain the sidewalk and cause slipping hazards. Harvesting is a time consuming, labor intensive process. Not everyone who has a fruit tree has the time or capability to harvest it, but someone nearby does. Fruit Change will connect people who want to pick fruit with those who need someone to pick it. For example, say the owner of a lemon tree must leave town unexpectedly just as a good crop is ripening. At the same time, some kids in the neighborhood are trying to start a lemonade stand. These neighbors need to connect, and Fruit Change will make it possible by digital and face to face methods. The tree owner can make his need made public through the fruit change website or app. The kids can call or visit Fruit Change headquarters with their request for lemons. Fruit Change will connect the two. The tree owner won’t come home to a yard full of rotting lemons, and the kids will get to pick fresh, free lemons for the lemonade stand. The fruit on a tree has the ability start a mutually beneficial relationship between neighbors who otherwise may have never met.
   2: Very few people need large amounts of one type of fruit at a time, which is what a tree produces. Say six neighbors each have one tree that produces a different fruit. With Fruit Change, these neighbors can connect and trade. They’ve all eliminated a portion of their grocery bill, know exactly where this food came from, and handed off food they don’t need.
   3:People without fruit trees have no easy way of obtaining produce grown in the neighborhood. Fruit Change is at heart a barter system. If you don’t have fruit to trade, you can still bring home that mixed bag of local fruit by offering up something else. Neighbors can volunteer for pickup, delivery, sorting, etc and receive fruit for their labor.
   4: San Pedro corner markets don't sell food from the block. Fruit Change aims to empower Cottage Kitchen producers and change this.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  The first challenge is data collection. Fruit Change will create metrics for
  each address including but not limited to: amount and size of producing trees,
  owner capability and capacity to contribute, and growing season. This will be
  done by grid method by a core group.
   Next, neighbors need to be able to reach out directly to neighbors who can fulfill their needs and vis versa. We will need to organize the data collected into a user friendly interface. The information needs to be available online, by app, at a storefront, and through a local phone line for neighbors who do not have smart phones or internet access.
   A third challenge is participation. Currently, there is interest from neighbors as well as store owners. We will set and meet accelerating membership goals, so if and when the grant kicks in, we are already organized. The biggest financial challenge is obtaining necessary certifications like gleaner, backyard grower, cottage kitchen. This grant means we could get them sooner.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Membership will be measured not only in size, but in connections. For example,
  if two people connect and grow a relationship that would have never existed
  without Fruit Change, we will be able to track that, and even qualify the
  connections (picker/tree owner, canning worker/Cottage Kitchen owner).
   
   All fruit and food products will be counted, each source and destination noted. We will be able to quantify the program’s success by tracking the life of each piece of fruit and how many connections between neighbors it makes. On the membership level, this data can be used to connect directly. For example, if someone needs to make a lot of guacamole, they can contact a grower by looking up the source of a Fruit Change avocado.
   
   We will produce maps that show how much each fruit tree connected the neighbors around it with one season's yield. The maps will enable neighbors to see how much they have helped each other, while connecting the neighborhood data collectors and artists who make them.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  I've found three organizations with similar ideas, but none operates in San
  Pedro and they all have different philosophies.
   
   The first is Fallen Fruit. fallenfruit.org Their primary goal is art. My primary goal for Fruit Change is a central system to ensure all naturally growing fruit goes to someone who wants it. However, I intend to approach the founders, David Burns and Austin Young, for advice on mapping fruit trees and collaboration in community events. Their spirit and intent are in line with Fruit Change, and I intend to support their projects individually and through Fruit Change.
   
   Food Forward foodforward.org is another organization that gleans excess fruit. They are a huge organization, powered by loyal volunteers, and they donate thousands of pounds of fresh produce to organizations that feed hungry people. Food Forward is an inspiration to Fruit Change because it shows that this model can work on a very large scale. However, Food Forward is strictly volunteers gleaning fruit for charity. Fruit Change isn’t about charity. It’s about sharing and community. Members connect, give what they can, take what they need, and together build a system for making the fruit of a few available to the whole community.
   
   The Hillside Produce Cooperative hillsideproducecooperative.org started by Hynden Walch in Glassell Park, is an excellent example of fruit trading at a grass roots level. The model has been proven effective in several different neighborhoods. Once a month Hynden sends out an email calling for her neighbors to drop off whatever fruit or vegetables they have grown. She then takes one day out of the month to divide and redistribute this fruit with whatever volunteers she can get for help. Fruit Change will be started with this model, and as it grows and we collect data, we can determine the best way for neighbors to connect and help each other pick, deliver and distribute. Rather than once a month, trading and picking will be regularly scheduled events where neighbors can participate based on individual capability and availability. Fruit Change hopes to host Walch and other cooperative coordinators in order to learn and collaborate.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  At this time, there are no plans to partner with outside organizations, but as
  research continues this may change.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  Fruit Change is a barter system and can become operational on a small scale
  like the Hillside Produce Cooperative for zero dollars. With every extra bit
  of money we only expand our options for growth. With a $100,000 I believe we
  can accomplish the goals laid out in this grant application.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-

   Website and app development: $25,000

How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  San Pedro is a vibrant, multi cultural, socioeconomically diverse, historic
  community. It’s an amazing place where industry operates at a world class
  level, yet hand made tamales are still sold door to door out of a rolling
  cooler. It’s where I’ve always wanted to buy a house, and I finally did this
  summer. With the house came lemons, kumquats and guavas: lots of them. Those
  trees are our key to the city. It's the perfect place to connect a diverse
  group through the one thing we all have in common: everybody eats. 
   
   Fruit Change was founded with the belief that there's no better way to connect with the people around you than by sharing the land's bounty. This project isn’t trying to change San Pedro, or favor one group’s vision of progress over another. Fruit Change is about taking a good hard look at what we’ve got already. We need to talk to each other, figure out who’s got what, what everyone can do to help, and make the best of this great situation we’re in. 
   
   To become financially sustainable, there are currently plans to sell fruit and preserves to local markets and directly to the public, but as Fruit Change evolves we will keep an eye out for, and adapt to, opportunity. A lot of construction on the waterfront will happen in San Pedro over the next few years, meaning teams of workers will be looking to eat quick and nutritious meals on the job. There's opportunity for Fruit Change there. Mayor Garcetti has tapped Gaffey for his Great Streets Initiative. There's opportunity for Fruit Change there. 
   
   If Fruit Change is a success, there's no reason it can't happen in every neighborhood in LA. Fruit Change could include communities all over the city, making it a part of the sharing economy as common as Uber or AirB&B.
   
   As we near the end of the initial $100,000 grant, we will rely on the revenue systems we’ve built and grown to continue to fund the program. Neighbors will collaborate on ways to barter for services, secure investors, increase sales, plant new trees, invite master gardeners to teach masters classes to increase productivity and countless other ideas. Even when the fruit trees aren't producing, the neighbors will be connecting, planning, learning, and fundraising for our future.
   
   I've been a Reality TV producer for seven years. If there's one thing I can do, it's jump into a brand new world, figure out how it works, and use limited resources to make it even better. I build a great team and get everyone working at full potential.

      Fruit Change aims to connect neighbors who have fruit trees with neighbors
      who want the fruit, subsequently fostering connections between neighbors
      across age, class, ethnic and geographic borders that may otherwise never
      happen. Those with trees will be able to trade with their neighbors, thus
      eliminating the waste of excess fruit. Those without trees can trade in
      sweat equity by picking, sorting, preserving and delivering fruit with
      their neighbors.

    answer: "The food growing in yards should connect us. If you've got fruit literally growing on trees, it should be very easy to share it with your community. Fruit Change aims to put a system in place to ensure neighbors connect with each other, so home grown food doesn’t go to waste when someone nearby could be eating it. Fruit Change aims to solve four problems with the current fruit tree situation in San Pedro.\r\n1: Trees often produce more fruit than the owner can consume, or even pick, so the fruit falls to the ground and rots. This attracts bugs and rodents, can stain the sidewalk and cause slipping hazards. Harvesting is a time consuming, labor intensive process. Not everyone who has a fruit tree has the time or capability to harvest it, but someone nearby does. Fruit Change will connect people who want to pick fruit with those who need someone to pick it. For example, say the owner of a lemon tree must leave town unexpectedly just as a good crop is ripening. At the same time, some kids in the neighborhood are trying to start a lemonade stand. These neighbors need to connect, and Fruit Change will make it possible by digital and face to face methods. The tree owner can make his need made public through the fruit change website or app. The kids can call or visit Fruit Change headquarters with their request for lemons. Fruit Change will connect the two. The tree owner won’t come home to a yard full of rotting lemons, and the kids will get to pick fresh, free lemons for the lemonade stand. The fruit on a tree has the ability start a mutually beneficial relationship between neighbors who otherwise may have never met.\r\n2: Very few people need large amounts of one type of fruit at a time, which is what a tree produces. Say six neighbors each have one tree that produces a different fruit. With Fruit Change, these neighbors can connect and trade. They’ve all eliminated a portion of their grocery bill, know exactly where this food came from, and handed off food they don’t need.\r\n3:People without fruit trees have no easy way of obtaining produce grown in the neighborhood. Fruit Change is at heart a barter system. If you don’t have fruit to trade, you can still bring home that mixed bag of local fruit by offering up something else. Neighbors can volunteer for pickup, delivery, sorting, etc and receive fruit for their labor.\r\n4: San Pedro corner markets don't sell food from the block. Fruit Change aims to empower Cottage Kitchen producers and change this. "

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "The first challenge is data collection. Fruit Change will create metrics for each address including but not limited to: amount and size of producing trees, owner capability and capacity to contribute, and growing season. This will be done by grid method by a core group.\r\nNext, neighbors need to be able to reach out directly to neighbors who can fulfill their needs and vis versa. We will need to organize the data collected into a user friendly interface. The information needs to be available online, by app, at a storefront, and through a local phone line for neighbors who do not have smart phones or internet access.\r\nA third challenge is participation. Currently, there is interest from neighbors as well as store owners. We will set and meet accelerating membership goals, so if and when the grant kicks in, we are already organized. The biggest financial challenge is obtaining necessary certifications like gleaner, backyard grower, cottage kitchen. This grant means we could get them sooner."
  - name: Please explain how you will evaluate your work.
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Membership will be measured not only in size, but in connections. For example, if two people connect and grow a relationship that would have never existed without Fruit Change, we will be able to track that, and even qualify the connections (picker/tree owner, canning worker/Cottage Kitchen owner).\r\n\r\nAll fruit and food products will be counted, each source and destination noted. We will be able to quantify the program’s success by tracking the life of each piece of fruit and how many connections between neighbors it makes. On the membership level, this data can be used to connect directly. For example, if someone needs to make a lot of guacamole, they can contact a grower by looking up the source of a Fruit Change avocado.\r\n\r\nWe will produce maps that show how much each fruit tree connected the neighbors around it with one season's yield. The maps will enable neighbors to see how much they have helped each other, while connecting the neighborhood data collectors and artists who make them."

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "I've found three organizations with similar ideas, but none operates in San Pedro and they all have different philosophies.\r\n\r\nThe first is Fallen Fruit. fallenfruit.org Their primary goal is art. My primary goal for Fruit Change is a central system to ensure all naturally growing fruit goes to someone who wants it. However, I intend to approach the founders, David Burns and Austin Young, for advice on mapping fruit trees and collaboration in community events. Their spirit and intent are in line with Fruit Change, and I intend to support their projects individually and through Fruit Change.\r\n\r\nFood Forward foodforward.org is another organization that gleans excess fruit. They are a huge organization, powered by loyal volunteers, and they donate thousands of pounds of fresh produce to organizations that feed hungry people. Food Forward is an inspiration to Fruit Change because it shows that this model can work on a very large scale. However, Food Forward is strictly volunteers gleaning fruit for charity. Fruit Change isn’t about charity. It’s about sharing and community. Members connect, give what they can, take what they need, and together build a system for making the fruit of a few available to the whole community.\r\n\r\nThe Hillside Produce Cooperative hillsideproducecooperative.org started by Hynden Walch in Glassell Park, is an excellent example of fruit trading at a grass roots level. The model has been proven effective in several different neighborhoods. Once a month Hynden sends out an email calling for her neighbors to drop off whatever fruit or vegetables they have grown. She then takes one day out of the month to divide and redistribute this fruit with whatever volunteers she can get for help. Fruit Change will be started with this model, and as it grows and we collect data, we can determine the best way for neighbors to connect and help each other pick, deliver and distribute. Rather than once a month, trading and picking will be regularly scheduled events where neighbors can participate based on individual capability and availability. Fruit Change hopes to host Walch and other cooperative coordinators in order to learn and collaborate. "

      Sign up for Fruit Change if you are in San Pedro, or start a movement in
      your own neighborhood.
  - name: How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "San Pedro is a vibrant, multi cultural, socioeconomically diverse, historic community. It’s an amazing place where industry operates at a world class level, yet hand made tamales are still sold door to door out of a rolling cooler. It’s where I’ve always wanted to buy a house, and I finally did this summer. With the house came lemons, kumquats and guavas: lots of them. Those trees are our key to the city. It's the perfect place to connect a diverse group through the one thing we all have in common: everybody eats. \r\n\r\nFruit Change was founded with the belief that there's no better way to connect with the people around you than by sharing the land's bounty. This project isn’t trying to change San Pedro, or favor one group’s vision of progress over another. Fruit Change is about taking a good hard look at what we’ve got already. We need to talk to each other, figure out who’s got what, what everyone can do to help, and make the best of this great situation we’re in. \r\n\r\nTo become financially sustainable, there are currently plans to sell fruit and preserves to local markets and directly to the public, but as Fruit Change evolves we will keep an eye out for, and adapt to, opportunity. A lot of construction on the waterfront will happen in San Pedro over the next few years, meaning teams of workers will be looking to eat quick and nutritious meals on the job. There's opportunity for Fruit Change there. Mayor Garcetti has tapped Gaffey for his Great Streets Initiative. There's opportunity for Fruit Change there. \r\n\r\nIf Fruit Change is a success, there's no reason it can't happen in every neighborhood in LA. Fruit Change could include communities all over the city, making it a part of the sharing economy as common as Uber or AirB&B.\r\n\r\nAs we near the end of the initial $100,000 grant, we will rely on the revenue systems we’ve built and grown to continue to fund the program. Neighbors will collaborate on ways to barter for services, secure investors, increase sales, plant new trees, invite master gardeners to teach masters classes to increase productivity and countless other ideas. Even when the fruit trees aren't producing, the neighbors will be connecting, planning, learning, and fundraising for our future.\r\n\r\nI've been a Reality TV producer for seven years. If there's one thing I can do, it's jump into a brand new world, figure out how it works, and use limited resources to make it even better. I build a great team and get everyone working at full potential."
