  Is.Was.Will Be. seeks to document the swiftly changing neighborhood of Elysian
  Valley as it is today, while simultaneously building a comprehensive
  historical profile through research and the development of a neighborhood
  archive. Creating interactions within the community about what it is and what
  it was, will enable residents to view Elysian Valley in the context of Los
  Angeles history, and empower them to actively shape what it will be by fully
  engaging in civic dialog about new development.

  Walking down any street in Elysian Valley, one finds vegetable gardens
  overflowing with Chinese Winter Melon, families eating in front yards laden
  with fruit trees. Residents stroll along the river from first light to sunset.
  New development and aggressive purchasing of properties threatens to turn this
  unique collection of avenues into a non-descript, ‘riverfront’ destination.
  The sudden rise in land values has led to predatory real estate practices as
  individuals and corporations attempt to purchase multiple parcels. While some
  are happy to cash out, those who want to stay feel under siege. Homes,
  apartments, and family owned businesses are being swallowed up by market-rate,
  multi-use development offering the minimum affordable housing mandated by the
  city. Although growth is inevitable, this is an impersonal process of
  displacement. 
   While tales of gentrification provide a common story for many neighborhoods, none are as vulnerable as the tiny community of Elysian Valley, aka Frogtown. Comprised of fewer than 8,000 residents, this historically low-income collection of cul-de-sacs lost its connection to the larger Los Angeles community decades ago with the destruction of Chavez Ravine and the building of the I-5 Freeway.
   Through Is.Was.Will Be., Smart Gals seeks to document these rapid-fire changes, educate the public and residents about Elysian Valley history, highlight long term residents and put faces and histories to the “parcels” that developers aim to acquire. The objective is to empower the neighborhood so that residents can fully participate in the civic process, have their voices heard by local government, and influence development.
   This project will implement a system for interaction and documentation that simultaneously informs and empowers the community, enabling residents to engage fully in civic dialog about their neighborhood. Documentation processes will include formal interviews with long-term residents (some of whom are survivors of the Chavez Ravine displacement), collection of personal archival from residents, and formal assembly of an accessible archive that tells the story of the neighborhood. Smart Gals would attempt to bring this history and these interviews into local schools so that the youth of the neighborhood can learn to observe and critique the changes happening around them. 
   By sharing our methods, successes and failures, we aim to provide a template for other neighborhoods to document, enrich and empower their community.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Connecting with long-term residents: Many of the residents have no internet
  access. We will partner with local activist/Neighborhood Watch organizer who
  has longstanding relationships within the community.
   
   Language Barriers: Many of the elderly residents speak Cantonese, Tagalog or Spanish, and very little English. We will partner with the younger generation of their families to engage in personal translation to ensure these stories are told and understood.
   
   Legal Assistance with Aggressive Investors: Most of the interest in the neighborhood currently stems from profit-driven models aiming to build riverfront strip; many in the community already feels let down by local representatives and city government. Residents need to be fully informed of their rights as property owners, renters and members of a community as they face this overwhelming development.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We will gauge the success of our work primarily by the number of stories
  successfully collected, the number of local lives documented, whether by
  ourselves directly or by local youth. Motivating families to invest in their
  own stories is a key objective.
   We will set a realistic goal for percentage of residents interviewed. To be effective in one year’s time, we will begin with those who are willing to speak with us, or who have already happily shared their stories (for which only the audio has been recorded) with the neighborhood newsletter. We will conduct these interviews on camera. If interviews are not granted we will attempt to photograph them with their homes and create a written summary.
   We will make presentations of neighborhood history and development to the local elementary schools that will teach students observation and documentation skills so they may conduct their own interviews and create family histories to add to the projects’ archival database.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There are a few well-funded organizations such as Storycorps whose mission
  mirrors our own, and news investigative outlets such as Marketplace (KUSC),
  which recently produced an in-depth series on gentrification in Los Angeles,
  but we aim to combine the collection of stories with direct neighborhood
  empowerment. In doing so, we look to complementary organizations devoted to
  local activism such as Mothers of East L.A. (MELA) and the Comité de la
  Esperanza that have successfully activated the Boyle Heights community and
  contribute meaningfully to the conversations about race, class and
  gentrification in our communities.
   While there are many new organizations focused on the Los Angeles River and surrounding neighborhoods, but most are profit-centered design and development companies. Our efforts are entirely people-centered.
   Our project is unique because we will portray the "whole" by way of focusing on the individual, thus telling a story that is inherently unique. 
   Due to the modest size and predominant poverty of the neighborhood, development in Elysian Valley may come less like gradual progress and more like a flash flood. Between anxious investors and the recently discovered ‘secret’ plans for Frank Gehry to formalize plans for the river development, it may be too late to slow the tide of gentrification in Elysian Valley. And yet, by learning what is here, what we might lose, and seeing what we’ve already lost, we will create a historical record that honors the purest idea of community.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  We will partner with writer and historian Hadley Meares (KCET Departures,
  http://www.kcet.org/user/profile/hmeares) to guide the process of creating an
  in-depth, comprehensive historical profile of Elysian Valley. Estimated budget
  for professional research hours: $5,000.
   We will also partner with long-term resident David De La Torre who publishes the neighborhood newsletter, oversees Elysian Valley Neighborhood Watch (EVNW) and has worked tirelessly as an individual to positively influence the changes coming to the community. Estimated budget for connection, interview and planning hours: $10,000.
   Smart Gals Artistic Director, Christine Louise Mills, recently completed the feature documentary East L.A. Interchange, which chronicles the cultural history Boyle Heights and gentrification issues facing the community today. In her role as writer, editor and producer, Ms. Mills has made connections with individuals and organizations such as the Roybal Foundation, whom she will approach to bring aboard as members of an advisory board. Positions on the advisory board will be voluntary and not incur direct cost.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  More funding translates directly into more hours put into the project,
  multiplying the number of stories told, ensuring a comprehensive portrait of
  the neighborhood. Less funding would simply mean a smaller sampling of
  interviews, fewer hours available to catch this community already in flux. We
  would focus on alternative, affordable storytelling systems such as the
  process of teaching elementary school children to document their own homes and
  families. 
   Is.Was.Will Be. could feasibly be done on a largely volunteer basis, but could not achieve the scope or immediacy necessary to be effective in one year’s time. Residents already feel Elysian Valley is “chasing its tail” in regards to development and having a genuine voice in the process. Full funding would be necessary to get the project up to speed if we hope to accurately document the changes that have already begun.
   Smart Gals would seek additional support from the Elysian Valley Neighborhood Council, members, volunteers, and other appropriate venues.

  Research Hours (Including Hadley Meares): $7,000

   Staff to Interview, Edit & Post stories (including David de la Torre): $50,000
   Workshop Development and Implementation: $10,000
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  If we were to receive the entire $100,000, the first year of the project would
  lay the foundation for a fully produced documentary film that could reach a
  national audience. Were we to receive partial funding, we would scale back the
  mode of documentation, and focus on capturing residents and their homes and
  businesses through photographs and text, and limit the number of on-camera
  interviews.

    answer: "Walking down any street in Elysian Valley, one finds vegetable gardens overflowing with Chinese Winter Melon, families eating in front yards laden with fruit trees. Residents stroll along the river from first light to sunset. New development and aggressive purchasing of properties threatens to turn this unique collection of avenues into a non-descript, ‘riverfront’ destination. The sudden rise in land values has led to predatory real estate practices as individuals and corporations attempt to purchase multiple parcels. While some are happy to cash out, those who want to stay feel under siege. Homes, apartments, and family owned businesses are being swallowed up by market-rate, multi-use development offering the minimum affordable housing mandated by the city. Although growth is inevitable, this is an impersonal process of displacement. \r\nWhile tales of gentrification provide a common story for many neighborhoods, none are as vulnerable as the tiny community of Elysian Valley, aka Frogtown. Comprised of fewer than 8,000 residents, this historically low-income collection of cul-de-sacs lost its connection to the larger Los Angeles community decades ago with the destruction of Chavez Ravine and the building of the I-5 Freeway.\r\nThrough Is.Was.Will Be., Smart Gals seeks to document these rapid-fire changes, educate the public and residents about Elysian Valley history, highlight long term residents and put faces and histories to the “parcels” that developers aim to acquire. The objective is to empower the neighborhood so that residents can fully participate in the civic process, have their voices heard by local government, and influence development.\r\nThis project will implement a system for interaction and documentation that simultaneously informs and empowers the community, enabling residents to engage fully in civic dialog about their neighborhood. Documentation processes will include formal interviews with long-term residents (some of whom are survivors of the Chavez Ravine displacement), collection of personal archival from residents, and formal assembly of an accessible archive that tells the story of the neighborhood. Smart Gals would attempt to bring this history and these interviews into local schools so that the youth of the neighborhood can learn to observe and critique the changes happening around them. \r\nBy sharing our methods, successes and failures, we aim to provide a template for other neighborhoods to document, enrich and empower their community."
  - name: >-
      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Connecting with long-term residents: Many of the residents have no internet access. We will partner with local activist/Neighborhood Watch organizer who has longstanding relationships within the community.\r\n\r\nLanguage Barriers: Many of the elderly residents speak Cantonese, Tagalog or Spanish, and very little English. We will partner with the younger generation of their families to engage in personal translation to ensure these stories are told and understood.\r\n\r\nLegal Assistance with Aggressive Investors: Most of the interest in the neighborhood currently stems from profit-driven models aiming to build riverfront strip; many in the community already feels let down by local representatives and city government. Residents need to be fully informed of their rights as property owners, renters and members of a community as they face this overwhelming development.\r\n"
  - name: Please explain how you will evaluate your work.
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "We will gauge the success of our work primarily by the number of stories successfully collected, the number of local lives documented, whether by ourselves directly or by local youth. Motivating families to invest in their own stories is a key objective.\r\nWe will set a realistic goal for percentage of residents interviewed. To be effective in one year’s time, we will begin with those who are willing to speak with us, or who have already happily shared their stories (for which only the audio has been recorded) with the neighborhood newsletter. We will conduct these interviews on camera. If interviews are not granted we will attempt to photograph them with their homes and create a written summary.\r\nWe will make presentations of neighborhood history and development to the local elementary schools that will teach students observation and documentation skills so they may conduct their own interviews and create family histories to add to the projects’ archival database.\r\n"

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "There are a few well-funded organizations such as Storycorps whose mission mirrors our own, and news investigative outlets such as Marketplace (KUSC), which recently produced an in-depth series on gentrification in Los Angeles, but we aim to combine the collection of stories with direct neighborhood empowerment. In doing so, we look to complementary organizations devoted to local activism such as Mothers of East L.A. (MELA) and the Comité de la Esperanza that have successfully activated the Boyle Heights community and contribute meaningfully to the conversations about race, class and gentrification in our communities.\r\nWhile there are many new organizations focused on the Los Angeles River and surrounding neighborhoods, but most are profit-centered design and development companies. Our efforts are entirely people-centered.\r\nOur project is unique because we will portray the \"whole\" by way of focusing on the individual, thus telling a story that is inherently unique. \r\nDue to the modest size and predominant poverty of the neighborhood, development in Elysian Valley may come less like gradual progress and more like a flash flood. Between anxious investors and the recently discovered ‘secret’ plans for Frank Gehry to formalize plans for the river development, it may be too late to slow the tide of gentrification in Elysian Valley. And yet, by learning what is here, what we might lose, and seeing what we’ve already lost, we will create a historical record that honors the purest idea of community.\r\n"

    answer: "We will partner with writer and historian Hadley Meares (KCET Departures, http://www.kcet.org/user/profile/hmeares) to guide the process of creating an in-depth, comprehensive historical profile of Elysian Valley. Estimated budget for professional research hours: $5,000.\r\nWe will also partner with long-term resident David De La Torre who publishes the neighborhood newsletter, oversees Elysian Valley Neighborhood Watch (EVNW) and has worked tirelessly as an individual to positively influence the changes coming to the community. Estimated budget for connection, interview and planning hours: $10,000.\r\nSmart Gals Artistic Director, Christine Louise Mills, recently completed the feature documentary East L.A. Interchange, which chronicles the cultural history Boyle Heights and gentrification issues facing the community today. In her role as writer, editor and producer, Ms. Mills has made connections with individuals and organizations such as the Roybal Foundation, whom she will approach to bring aboard as members of an advisory board. Positions on the advisory board will be voluntary and not incur direct cost.\r\n"

      How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you
      cover the additional costs?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "More funding translates directly into more hours put into the project, multiplying the number of stories told, ensuring a comprehensive portrait of the neighborhood. Less funding would simply mean a smaller sampling of interviews, fewer hours available to catch this community already in flux. We would focus on alternative, affordable storytelling systems such as the process of teaching elementary school children to document their own homes and families. \r\nIs.Was.Will Be. could feasibly be done on a largely volunteer basis, but could not achieve the scope or immediacy necessary to be effective in one year’s time. Residents already feel Elysian Valley is “chasing its tail” in regards to development and having a genuine voice in the process. Full funding would be necessary to get the project up to speed if we hope to accurately document the changes that have already begun.\r\nSmart Gals would seek additional support from the Elysian Valley Neighborhood Council, members, volunteers, and other appropriate venues.\r\n"

      If we were to receive the entire $100,000, the first year of the project
      would lay the foundation for a fully produced documentary film that could
      reach a national audience. Were we to receive partial funding, we would
      scale back the mode of documentation, and focus on capturing residents and
      their homes and businesses through photographs and text, and limit the
      number of on-camera interviews.
