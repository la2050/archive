  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "A good deal of research and concentration has gone into building best practices and curriculum for early childhood social skills curriculum. However, as a low incidence population, infants who are visually impaired have gone ignored as a group that needs its own dedicated curriculum to steer a healthy life from the earliest days. \r\n\r\nBlind Children’s Center, as a model program and leader in the field, is launching a 3-year Social Skills Pilot Program, with the ultimate goal of producing a social skills curriculum specifically tailored for infants and young children who are blind or visually impaired, both within our four walls and beyond. \r\n\r\nThe 3-Year Pilot will culminate in the release of a “Social Skills Curriculum Kit” which will be made available to parents, educators and schools around the United States and throughout the world. The activities within the proposed Creative Growth Center will augment and solidify project results and help build strategy for future exploration in the area.\r\n\r\nJust as academic adaptations need to be made for our students who are visually impaired (such as Brailling reading materials), we have found that social skills adaptations must be made, too. Research reveals that as much as 90% of what human beings learn is acquired through sight. Students who have limited or no vision must acquire skills and learn concepts through different methods — such as touch in the case of reading and writing using the Braille code.\r\n\r\nResearch has found that young people who are visually impaired show a disproportionate propensity toward teenage depression. Evidence indicates that youth may experience isolation due to lack of effective social skills to build healthy bonds and relationships with peers. At a very social time where cliques are forming and children can be exclusionary, young people who are visually impaired often feel left on the outside, without the ability to look in. \r\n\r\nBest practices indicate that the early years are essential for establishing skills and learning readiness. As our program has long been based on full-inclusion, our school is a wonderful place to build the framework for a new curriculum which will allow children who are visually impaired to thrive in the sighted world all around them. It is our goal to continue to expand our presence in the community and make Los Angeles the very best place in the world for children who are blind or visually impaired to grow, learn and become happy, productive adults."

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "Due to a growth in need, in 2009 the Blind Children's Center launched a successful capital campaign to add Kindergarten, 1st and 2nd Grade to our existing preschool and infant programs. Thanks to that growth, we are now able to provide services to twice as many affected children and their families.\r\n\r\nOne challenge does persist. Once our students graduate from our program, typically as 2nd graders, we are no longer able to actively guide their growth and education. The goal is to equip our students with critical academic and life skills while they are enrolled at the Center, so when they move on to their next school, they are better equipped to contend with the challenges of being a student with a disability in a mainstream school environment.\r\n\r\nWe aim to mitigate transitional challenges by equipping parents with skills to guide their child's successful growth, and, more importantly through continued parent groups that are open to caregivers of all enrolled students and alumni. "
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Evaluation of the Program is the responsibility of the Center’s Director of Education and Family Services, Fernanda Armenta-Schmitt, Ph.D., who has been employed at the Center for 28 years. Dr. Armenta-Schmitt has extensive experience in the arena of early intervention and serving families of young children with significant disabilities, and has authored several publications dedicated to serving families with diverse backgrounds and needs.\r\n\r\nShe and the Center's specialists and teachers collaborate to develop a Specialized Education Plan for each student and their family. The preschool children’s progress is measured annually using The Oregon Project which is the standard assessment tool for visually impaired children. The Kindergarten through 2nd Grade students receive regular report cards which are reviewed through standard K-2 curriculum guidelines. Parents’ progress is measured on a regular basis, through interviews and questionnaires. "
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "We frequently collaborate with several partner organizations in the area, most notably Braille Institute of America, where some of our students attend Library events and Junior Blind of America, where some of our students attend afterschool programs. Both of the organizations are wonderful partners to us.\r\n\r\nOur organization is the only one of its kind however, a full service private school operating in accordance with state educational guidelines, with a full inclusion program (sighted students in each classroom). "
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "We have partnered with the Los Angeles-based Margie & Robert E Petersen Foundation, the Los Angeles-based Atlas Family Foundation and the Vermont-based Gibney Family Foundation for the launch of this program. They have funded the launch of the program as well as staff salaries and the future production of our Social Skills Curriculum Kit.\r\n\r\nOur ask through LA2050 is solely for the construction and outfitting of the proposed CREATIVE GROWTH CENTER, which would support the activities of the Social Skills Program at the Blind Children's Center."
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    We estimate the proposed work with cost approximately $100,000. We intend to
    cover any additional cost, if necessary, through additional grantseeking as
    well as major donor appeals. 
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "CREATIVE GROWTH CENTER\r\n\r\nAt the Blind Children's Center\r\n\r\nConstruct New Playhouse with ADA compliant restroom - $50,000\r\nEquip Playhouse with adaptive equipment - $5,000\r\n\r\nConstruct Sensory Garden - $25,000\r\nEquip Sensory Garden with adaptive equipment - $15,000\r\n \r\nUpgrade Outdoor Lunch Area - $5,000\r\n\r\nTotal Project Budget - $100,000*\r\n\r\n\r\n* All estimates include material and labor"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "At the end of the 3-year project, we will compile our findings in a user-friendly, interactive “Social Skills Curriculum Kit” which will be made available to parents, educators, early intervention programs and other schools. The potential construction and success of our Creative Growth Center will be another strategy to build social skills in our population. These results, too, should be able to be replicated and scaled by like-minded organizations should they choose to follow our lead.\r\n\r\nWe anticipate the hard work we put into this undertaking will yield an out-of-the-box curriculum that can be used as a model to tackle a very real issue facing young people who are visually impaired. With the appropriate social skills to go along with strong educational skills, our students and others like them will be equipped to make friends, live independently, and fulfill their highest potential.\r\n"
