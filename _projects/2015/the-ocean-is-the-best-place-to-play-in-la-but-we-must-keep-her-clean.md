title: The OCEAN is the best place to play in LA! But we must keep her clean!

project_summary: >-
  At least once a month, we go to various shipwrecks and reefs that are covered
  in ghost nets, which will wreak havoc on fragile marine ecosystems for decades
  or even centuries if they are not removed. Los Angeles is FULL of people who
  scuba dive, surf, swim, snorkel, kayak, windsurf, etc.- we live near the ocean
  because we LOVE her! We also do a lot of outreach for adults and kids of all
  ages: lectures, presentations, tabling events to let everyone know what is
  happening in the ocean.

  ANY school that will let us do a presentation, we will attend. For ocean
  cleanups: we are working mostly in the San Pedro Bay and off of Catalina.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  This is a project that is already underway, but we need funding in order to
  sustain it. People move to California to be near the ocean, this is a precious
  resource that affects many lives. Abandoned commercial fishing nets pose
  multiple threats- not only to the underwater world, but for the people
  enjoying the ocean. Abandoned nets create navigational hazards to boaters,
  they damage fish stocks, they cause death and destruction which directly
  impacts the enjoyment of scuba divers and other people who come to the ocean
  to play.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Our biggest barrier is funding. Strategies for overcoming this obstacle
  includes maintaining efforts to solicit donations/ grants, and to generate
  interest in our project. Invariably, every time we are invited to do a
  presentation, so many people approach us afterwards and say, "I had no idea
  this was happening!" Ghost fishing is a HUGE problem- and in Los Angeles, it
  is literally in our backyards! We also invite non-divers to come on our
  cleanup missions, so that they can see first-hand what we are doing to help
  the ocean. This has also received a very consistently positive response.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We have been keeping track of every single cleanup and every single outreach
  event, to approximate our impact on the community and of course on the ocean.
  I have an ongoing spread sheet on my computer that I keep "public," it is
  available to anyone who wishes to see it. Regarding the ocean, it is
  fascinating to see the transformation of a killing field to a healthy, vibrant
  reef once the ghost nets are removed. Documenting every single cleanup dive
  with video and/or still photography is another way that we keep track of our
  progress and evaluate our impact.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  What is unique about our project is that all of our volunteers have been
  trained in the exact same manner, which codifies the approach and makes it not
  only safer but more effective. There are other organizations that do ocean
  cleanups, but "Ghost Fishing" uses Global Underwater Explorer trained divers
  (www.gue.com), and we have projects underway in over 15 countries around the
  world.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  100% of this grant would go to ocean cleanups (primarily paying for boat
  charters and breathing gases for the scuba divers- our two biggest expenses).
  With this additional funding, we would be able to do more frequent trips and
  recruit more volunteers. We have a pool of approximately 50 volunteers (divers
  and deckhands). The people who commit to the cleanups would have their
  expenses covered on that particular day. Each time we do a cleanup, there are
  about 10-15 people involved, depending on the mission.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 â€“ how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  This funding would easily cover us for a year or more. All of the volunteers
  are already donating their time and their talents, and using their own scuba
  gear. We are getting donations here and there, plus we are now partnering with
  Fourth Element "Ocean Positive," a line of swim/ surf wear that is made from
  recycled fishing nets. They will also be giving us some funding. Lastly, we
  receive sponsorship from manufacturers of "ghost net removal" gear, namely
  Eezycut and Halcyon.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  *$200 per diver for breathing gas X 10 = $2,000 X 24 trips/ year = $48,000
   *$1,500 per boat charter X 24 trips = $36,000
   
   $48,000 + $36,000 = $84,000
   
   Remaining $16,000 for proper training/ certification through Global Underwater Explorers (GUE certifications are required for all volunteer scuba divers), as well as required training for the volunteers (CPR, first aid, oxygen for scuba diving emergencies, etc).
   
   ANY leftover funds will be carried over into the following year.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  We will keep monitoring our success with our data spread sheet, as described
  earlier. It is critical that we have the opportunity to present to as many
  schools as possible, to increase awareness of this issue. Secondly, it is
  imperative that we keep this project going! Sadly, there is no shortage of
  work for us in Los Angeles. There are ghost nets polluting our waters
  everywhere. We have more recent videos on Vimeo, but your application only
  seems to recognize YouTube.
