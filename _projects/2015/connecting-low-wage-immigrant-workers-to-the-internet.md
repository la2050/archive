title: Connecting Low Wage Immigrant Workers to the Internet
project_summary: >-
  IDEPSCA will design and implement a series of blingual English/Spanish
  trainings for low wage immigrant workers on how to use their mobile phones to
  better connect them to services in the City of LA. The trainings will include
  how to connect to free wireless networks and use apps on their phones
  including JobsLA, GoMetro, MyLA 311. We will also show workers how to use
  social media apps to connect to their government representatives and local
  neighborhood councils.

    IDEPSCA organizes and educates low immigrant workers concerned with solving
    problems in their own communities in the areas of workforce and economic
    development and worker health and safety.

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "IDEPSCA will design and implement a series of blingual English/Spanish trainings for low wage immigrant workers on how to use their mobile phones to better connect them to services in the City of LA. The trainings will include how to connect to free wireless networks and use apps on their phones including JobsLA, GoMetro, MyLA 311. We will also show workers how to use social media apps to connect to their government representatives and local neighborhood councils. These trainings will be conducted in and around the seven day labor centers in the City of Los Angeles. While the digital divide may be closing, with more people accessing mobile technology, there is still a knowledge gap when it comes to knowing how to access city services including how to catch a bus to a job, who their City Council member is, and when the next neighborhood council meeting is. Additionally, many people worry about accessing information on their cell phones because of the high cost of data access. This is why teaching people where they can access free wifi in Los Angeles is critical. According to a 2008 study we conducted in five day labor centers in Los Angeles we found that most workers (78%) owned mobile phones and used them on a regular basis. A\r\nmajority of the respondents reported using their phones primarily for work purposes and also to contact friends and family in other countries. We discovered that phone models and plans varied greatly, as did usage of specific phone features such as text, video, and photos. Interestingly, many workers knew how to\r\ntake photos using their mobile phones but did not know how to send these to others others. Mobile tech has changed much since 2008 and we would additionally like to use this opportunity to assess low immigrant worker access to mobile phones and their use of civic tech. We would also like to create a mobile phone lending library, that would allow worker members to \"check out\" a smart phone while they are at a worker center. They can use this phone to contact an employer or use one of the city apps. This would have the dual purpose of increasing access to smart phone tech, allow workers to practice skills they learned in trainings, and access city information and services. "
  How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
    - Money (financial capital)
    - Volunteers/staff (human capital)
    - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
    - 'Technical infrastructure (computers, etc.)'
    - Community outreach
  How do you plan to use these resources to make change?:
    - Conduct research
    - Engage residents and stakeholders
    - Implement a pilot or new project
    - Expand a pilot or a program
    - Mobilize for systems change
  Where will you be working?:
    - San Fernando Valley
    - City of Los Angeles
    - >-
      Neighborhoods of Pico Union, Downtown, Westlake, Hollywood, North
      Hollywood, Cypress Park, Van Nuys and Wilmingotn
  How will your proposal improve the following “Connect” metrics?:
    - Median travel time to work
    - Number of public transit riders
    - Participation in neighborhood councils
    - Government responsiveness to residents’ needs (Dream Metric)
    - >-
      Transit-accessible housing and employment (the share of housing units and
      percentage of jobs that are located near transit)
    - Total number of local social media friends and connections (Dream Metric)
    - Access to free wifi (Dream Metric)
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    One way we will evaluate our work will be via pre and post surveys. The pre
    surveys will assess how many workers across the seven day labor centers
    currently access City of LA services on their mobile phones and why or why
    not (i.e. didn't know how, was afraid to, don't have wi-fi, don't have cell
    phone, didn't know I could). At the end of 6 months of training, we will
    conduct a post survey to see if those numbers changed and the impact (jobs,
    shorter commute times, more participation in government).

Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  One of the major challenges/barriers we anticipate is that because of the
  temporary nature of work opportunities for many low wage immigrant workers, we
  may not have all the workers attend consecutive trainings. There are multiple
  strategies for overcoming this: 1- conducting the workshops on an ongoing
  basis including follow up visits, 2- creating a train the trainers model that
  will have at least one worker who is well versed in using mobile technology
  who can act as a resource for workers in between workshops sessions, and 3
  leaving visuals (ie posters,pamphlets) with instructions on how to access
  certain apps and tools on cell phones in the worker centers where we conduct
  workshops.

Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  I am not aware of other organizations doing similar work. What is unique about
  our proposed approached is that it directly meets low-income immigrant workers
  where they are at : physically in terms of locations where they are seeking
  work and other services and also in terms of access or lack there of to mobile
  tools. We believe that this approach will continue to prove that Los Angeles
  is a city that is all inclusive of immigrant community members. In 2008,
  IDEPSCA along with USC Annenberg School of Communications created an open
  source sms based storytelling platform for low wage immigrant workers. This
  model has been used globally.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  IDEPSCA operates four of the seven day labor centers in the City of Los
  Angeles. All seven centers are funded by the City of Los Angeles and monitored
  by the Los Angeles Economic & Workforce Development Department. Together,
  IDEPSCA, with the other organizations that operate day labor centers in the
  City of LA : CARECEN and YPI, have developed a shared strategic vision for the
  day labor centers to transform them into wrap around service centers that
  serve not just day laborers, but their families and neighbors. A portion of
  this includes immigrant integration. While the other organizations will not
  receive funding, it is our hope that we will be able to leverage this funding
  so that each center can have a mobile literacy project. Additionally, IDEPSCA
  has a close relationship with the MIT Center for Civic Media, which we will
  consult with throughout the project.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  The success of our proposal could be scaled in a number of ways. As a part of
  the National Day Labor Organizing Network and working closely with the AFL-CIO
  we could bring our trainings and materials to other day labor/worker centers
  across the country. This could be done by us growing our own staff to a group
  of trainers dedicated to different regions. Additionally, part of the training
  could include a train the trainer model, where we would train different
  cohorts to conduct mobile access trainings to various regions first in the
  state, then on the West Coast, followed by national growth.
