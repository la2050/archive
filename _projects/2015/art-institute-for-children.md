  Imagine an Art Gallery, a Museum, an Artist studio and a training center ALL
  under one roof where local as well as international artists can participate,
  get trained and get paid to teach art to children locally as well as around
  the world for free. Funding for Art Education in today's school is being cut
  out. This is a sincere effort to provide FREE art education and professional
  training to all those children that need it and cannot afford it.
