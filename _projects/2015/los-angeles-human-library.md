title: Los Angeles Human Library
project_summary: >-
  The SIJCC proposes LA’s first city-wide Human Library initiative. The Library
  provides a forum for people to engage in difficult conversations and gain a
  deeper understanding of diverse human experiences. Participants “check out”
  individuals who have volunteered to act as “books” labeled with titles that
  specify a topic or neighborhood they represent. Through guided conversation,
  participants are better able to connect to others in their community.

  'In one sentence, please describe what your organization does': >-
    The Silverlake Independent Jewish Community Center (SIJCC) is a leading
    center for arts, culture and Jewish education on the east side of Los
    Angeles, and strives to connect people of all different backgrounds through
    arts & cultural programming.

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "This project will connect individuals from different backgrounds and regions of Los Angeles and put them in thought-provoking conversation with one another. By categorizing the “books” with a variety of experiences and identities, we will encourage discussion of normally taboo topics in a safe space, facilitated by trained volunteers. These conversations will serve to connect disparate parts of Los Angeles’ diverse community, and foster empathy and understanding between us and our neighbors. \r\n\r\nThrough our arts and cultural programming, the SIJCC has established itself as a place where people connect. Our reach extends far beyond just the local Jewish community to bring together people of all faiths and backgrounds. \r\n\r\nWe wish to hold a Human Library on our campus, with other pop-up Libraries taking place across the city in public libraries, community centers, parks, and other public spaces. We will culminate the experience with a storytelling event held at the SIJCC, where individuals will share stories of their own experiences and/or those they’ve learned from others through this project. The storytelling event will build upon the experiences gained and lessons learned by participants throughout the various human library events around the city, and will serve as another opportunity to connect community members from across Los Angeles.  \r\n"
  How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
    - Money (financial capital)
    - Volunteers/staff (human capital)
    - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
    - 'Infrastructure (building/space/vehicles, etc.)'
    - Education/training
    - 'Technical infrastructure (computers, etc.)'
    - Community outreach
    - Network/relationship support
    - Quality improvement research
  How do you plan to use these resources to make change?:
    - Conduct research
    - Engage residents and stakeholders
    - Implement a pilot or new project
  Where will you be working?:
    - City of Los Angeles
  How will your proposal improve the following “Connect” metrics?:
    - Adults getting sufficient social & emotional support
    - Attendance at cultural events
    - Percentage of Angelenos that volunteer informally (Dream Metric)
    - Attendance at public/open streets gatherings (Dream Metric)
    - Residential segregation (Dream Metric)
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Our ultimate goal is to connect individuals from different backgrounds who wouldn’t normally interact with one another. We’ll measure this success in a few ways: by the number of people and organizations we connect with before the Library events take place, the number of events that are held around the city, and the feedback received/word of mouth generated afterward. \r\n\r\nSuccess is connecting with at least 20 organizations to partner on this event in various capacities, and organizing 6 or more Human Libraries in LA. \r\n\r\nSuccess is a well-attended storytelling event at the SIJCC at the end of this project. \r\n\r\nSuccess will also be measured through surveys given to participants to learn about their experiences and will be seen in the community’s response once the events have ended (i.e. : if we’re contacted to partner on a future Human Library or other project, or if we hear other communities are implementing this idea.)"

  This project will connect individuals from different backgrounds and regions
  of Los Angeles and put them in thought-provoking conversation with one
  another. By categorizing the “books” with a variety of experiences and
  identities, we will encourage discussion of normally taboo topics in a safe
  space, facilitated by trained volunteers. These conversations will serve to
  connect disparate parts of Los Angeles’ diverse community, and foster empathy
  and understanding between us and our neighbors. 
   
   Through our arts and cultural programming, the SIJCC has established itself as a place where people connect. Our reach extends far beyond just the local Jewish community to bring together people of all faiths and backgrounds. 
   
   We wish to hold a Human Library on our campus, with other pop-up Libraries taking place across the city in public libraries, community centers, parks, and other public spaces. We will culminate the experience with a storytelling event held at the SIJCC, where individuals will share stories of their own experiences and/or those they’ve learned from others through this project. The storytelling event will build upon the experiences gained and lessons learned by participants throughout the various human library events around the city, and will serve as another opportunity to connect community members from across Los Angeles.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Outreach to various communities throughout the city will be key in order to
  make sure a broad number of backgrounds and experiences are represented as
  books, readers, and event organizers. With these funds we will have an
  opportunity to effectively advertise the event all over the city as well as to
  rally other organizations to take part and become stakeholders in the
  project. 
   
   We will also have a paid coordinator and a volunteer committee dedicated to outreach. The committee will work with various neighborhood councils and organizations within the city who represent a wide network of communities to encourage them both to take part in hosting an event and/or to rally their communities to participate.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Our ultimate goal is to connect individuals from different backgrounds who
  wouldn’t normally interact with one another. We’ll measure this success in a
  few ways: by the number of people and organizations we connect with before the
  Library events take place, the number of events that are held around the city,
  and the feedback received/word of mouth generated afterward. 
   
   Success is connecting with at least 20 organizations to partner on this event in various capacities, and organizing 6 or more Human Libraries in LA. 
   
   Success is a well-attended storytelling event at the SIJCC at the end of this project. 
   
   Success will also be measured through surveys given to participants to learn about their experiences and will be seen in the community’s response once the events have ended (i.e. : if we’re contacted to partner on a future Human Library or other project, or if we hear other communities are implementing this idea.)
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  The Human Library Organization in Europe pioneered a similar concept. Their
  Libraries are geared towards discussions of prejudice, with “books”
  representing LGBTQ identities, mental health issues, etc. 
   
   We’re interested in focusing on geography as a subject, using the Library as a means to contract LA’s sprawl and start conversations about the history and demographics of its most rapidly changing neighborhoods. (We’re especially sensitive to these shifts, as the Center has been located in the heart of Silver Lake for 50+ years.)
   
   Locally, there has also been an annual Human Library experiment on LMU’s campus, which is in its fourth year.
   
   The SIJCC wishes to build upon these ideas and to involve organizations from across the city. Teaming up with neighborhood councils and other organizations will help us to engage diverse folks from all over LA. We’ll help empower organizations and individuals to host events, and to participate as books/attendees/volunteers, etc., putting their own unique spin on this project as well.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  We see this as a wonderful opportunity to partner with numerous organizations
  across the city. We would look to partner with the Los Angeles Public Library,
  who could host events at various library locations. We would also look to
  partner with neighborhood councils and organizations who do similar work
  bringing together people from different backgrounds and geographic regions
  across LA. We’d also look to other public spaces, like Grand Park, where we
  could host pop-up libraries.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  There are many opportunities to scale the success of the Human Library
  Project, including an annual event hosted at the SIJCC or another location,
  smaller pop-up libraries that appear annually or even on a monthly/quarterly
  schedule, or more storytelling events around the city with the goal of
  bringing people from all over LA together to share their experiences with one
  another.
