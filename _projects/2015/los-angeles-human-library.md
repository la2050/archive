title: Los Angeles Human Library
project_summary: >-
  The SIJCC proposes LA’s first city-wide Human Library initiative. The Library
  provides a forum for people to engage in difficult conversations and gain a
  deeper understanding of diverse human experiences. Participants “check out”
  individuals who have volunteered to act as “books” labeled with titles that
  specify a topic or neighborhood they represent. Through guided conversation,
  participants are better able to connect to others in their community.

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "This project will connect individuals from different backgrounds and regions of Los Angeles and put them in thought-provoking conversation with one another. By categorizing the “books” with a variety of experiences and identities, we will encourage discussion of normally taboo topics in a safe space, facilitated by trained volunteers. These conversations will serve to connect disparate parts of Los Angeles’ diverse community, and foster empathy and understanding between us and our neighbors. \r\n\r\nThrough our arts and cultural programming, the SIJCC has established itself as a place where people connect. Our reach extends far beyond just the local Jewish community to bring together people of all faiths and backgrounds. \r\n\r\nWe wish to hold a Human Library on our campus, with other pop-up Libraries taking place across the city in public libraries, community centers, parks, and other public spaces. We will culminate the experience with a storytelling event held at the SIJCC, where individuals will share stories of their own experiences and/or those they’ve learned from others through this project. The storytelling event will build upon the experiences gained and lessons learned by participants throughout the various human library events around the city, and will serve as another opportunity to connect community members from across Los Angeles.  \r\n"

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "Outreach to various communities throughout the city will be key in order to make sure a broad number of backgrounds and experiences are represented as books, readers, and event organizers. With these funds we will have an opportunity to effectively advertise the event all over the city as well as to rally other organizations to take part and become stakeholders in the project. \r\n\r\nWe will also have a paid coordinator and a volunteer committee dedicated to outreach. The committee will work with various neighborhood councils and organizations within the city who represent a wide network of communities to encourage them both to take part in hosting an event and/or to rally their communities to participate. "
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Our ultimate goal is to connect individuals from different backgrounds who wouldn’t normally interact with one another. We’ll measure this success in a few ways: by the number of people and organizations we connect with before the Library events take place, the number of events that are held around the city, and the feedback received/word of mouth generated afterward. \r\n\r\nSuccess is connecting with at least 20 organizations to partner on this event in various capacities, and organizing 6 or more Human Libraries in LA. \r\n\r\nSuccess is a well-attended storytelling event at the SIJCC at the end of this project. \r\n\r\nSuccess will also be measured through surveys given to participants to learn about their experiences and will be seen in the community’s response once the events have ended (i.e. : if we’re contacted to partner on a future Human Library or other project, or if we hear other communities are implementing this idea.)"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "The Human Library Organization in Europe pioneered a similar concept. Their Libraries are geared towards discussions of prejudice, with “books” representing LGBTQ identities, mental health issues, etc. \r\n\r\nWe’re interested in focusing on geography as a subject, using the Library as a means to contract LA’s sprawl and start conversations about the history and demographics of its most rapidly changing neighborhoods. (We’re especially sensitive to these shifts, as the Center has been located in the heart of Silver Lake for 50+ years.)\r\n\r\nLocally, there has also been an annual Human Library experiment on LMU’s campus, which is in its fourth year.\r\n\r\nThe SIJCC wishes to build upon these ideas and to involve organizations from across the city. Teaming up with neighborhood councils and other organizations will help us to engage diverse folks from all over LA. We’ll help empower organizations and individuals to host events, and to participate as books/attendees/volunteers, etc., putting their own unique spin on this project as well.   \r\n"
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    We see this as a wonderful opportunity to partner with numerous
    organizations across the city. We would look to partner with the Los Angeles
    Public Library, who could host events at various library locations. We would
    also look to partner with neighborhood councils and organizations who do
    similar work bringing together people from different backgrounds and
    geographic regions across LA. We’d also look to other public spaces, like
    Grand Park, where we could host pop-up libraries. 
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    The cost will ultimately depend on how many libraries we have, and the funds
    to cover each of them will be divided out and given to each of the event
    organizers. Below we’ve created a budget for the cost of organizing
    city-wide outreach, an estimated budget per Library (including training
    sessions for volunteers), and a budget for the culminating storytelling
    event. Any additional funds would go to funding more pop-up Libraries
    throughout the city.  
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Outreach:\r\nPaid advertising placement in newspapers and online – $4000\r\nGraphic design - $2500\r\nPrinting/signage - $2000\r\nWebsite (building & maintaining) – $1500\r\nHuman Library Coordinator - $15,000\r\nTOTAL: $25,000\r\n\r\nHuman Libraries:\r\nRentals (tables, pipe & drape, lighting, etc...) - $5000\r\nDocumentation (photo/video) – $2000\r\nTraining Sessions - $1000\r\nFood/drinks – $1000\r\nEvent Staff – $500\r\nPrinting/signage – $500\r\nTOTAL per Library: $10,000\r\nTOTAL for 6 libraries: $60,000\r\n\r\nStorytelling event at SIJCC:\r\nRentals (stage, tables, etc…) - $4000\r\nLighting – $3000\r\nPrinting/signage – $1000\r\nDocumentation (photo/video) – $3000\r\nFood/drinks - $3000\r\nEvent Staff - $1000\r\nTOTAL: $15,000\r\n"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    There are many opportunities to scale the success of the Human Library
    Project, including an annual event hosted at the SIJCC or another location,
    smaller pop-up libraries that appear annually or even on a monthly/quarterly
    schedule, or more storytelling events around the city with the goal of
    bringing people from all over LA together to share their experiences with
    one another.

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "This project will connect individuals from different backgrounds and regions of Los Angeles and put them in thought-provoking conversation with one another. By categorizing the “books” with a variety of experiences and identities, we will encourage discussion of normally taboo topics in a safe space, facilitated by trained volunteers. These conversations will serve to connect disparate parts of Los Angeles’ diverse community, and foster empathy and understanding between us and our neighbors. \r\n\r\nThrough our arts and cultural programming, the SIJCC has established itself as a place where people connect. Our reach extends far beyond just the local Jewish community to bring together people of all faiths and backgrounds. \r\n\r\nWe wish to hold a Human Library on our campus, with other pop-up Libraries taking place across the city in public libraries, community centers, parks, and other public spaces. We will culminate the experience with a storytelling event held at the SIJCC, where individuals will share stories of their own experiences and/or those they’ve learned from others through this project. The storytelling event will build upon the experiences gained and lessons learned by participants throughout the various human library events around the city, and will serve as another opportunity to connect community members from across Los Angeles.  \r\n"

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Outreach to various communities throughout the city will be key in order to make sure a broad number of backgrounds and experiences are represented as books, readers, and event organizers. With these funds we will have an opportunity to effectively advertise the event all over the city as well as to rally other organizations to take part and become stakeholders in the project. \r\n\r\nWe will also have a paid coordinator and a volunteer committee dedicated to outreach. The committee will work with various neighborhood councils and organizations within the city who represent a wide network of communities to encourage them both to take part in hosting an event and/or to rally their communities to participate. "
  - name: Please explain how you will evaluate your work.
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Our ultimate goal is to connect individuals from different backgrounds who wouldn’t normally interact with one another. We’ll measure this success in a few ways: by the number of people and organizations we connect with before the Library events take place, the number of events that are held around the city, and the feedback received/word of mouth generated afterward. \r\n\r\nSuccess is connecting with at least 20 organizations to partner on this event in various capacities, and organizing 6 or more Human Libraries in LA. \r\n\r\nSuccess is a well-attended storytelling event at the SIJCC at the end of this project. \r\n\r\nSuccess will also be measured through surveys given to participants to learn about their experiences and will be seen in the community’s response once the events have ended (i.e. : if we’re contacted to partner on a future Human Library or other project, or if we hear other communities are implementing this idea.)"

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "The Human Library Organization in Europe pioneered a similar concept. Their Libraries are geared towards discussions of prejudice, with “books” representing LGBTQ identities, mental health issues, etc. \r\n\r\nWe’re interested in focusing on geography as a subject, using the Library as a means to contract LA’s sprawl and start conversations about the history and demographics of its most rapidly changing neighborhoods. (We’re especially sensitive to these shifts, as the Center has been located in the heart of Silver Lake for 50+ years.)\r\n\r\nLocally, there has also been an annual Human Library experiment on LMU’s campus, which is in its fourth year.\r\n\r\nThe SIJCC wishes to build upon these ideas and to involve organizations from across the city. Teaming up with neighborhood councils and other organizations will help us to engage diverse folks from all over LA. We’ll help empower organizations and individuals to host events, and to participate as books/attendees/volunteers, etc., putting their own unique spin on this project as well.   \r\n"

      receive?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      We see this as a wonderful opportunity to partner with numerous
      organizations across the city. We would look to partner with the Los
      Angeles Public Library, who could host events at various library
      locations. We would also look to partner with neighborhood councils and
      organizations who do similar work bringing together people from different
      backgrounds and geographic regions across LA. We’d also look to other
      public spaces, like Grand Park, where we could host pop-up libraries.

      How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      The cost will ultimately depend on how many libraries we have, and the
      funds to cover each of them will be divided out and given to each of the
      event organizers. Below we’ve created a budget for the cost of organizing
      city-wide outreach, an estimated budget per Library (including training
      sessions for volunteers), and a budget for the culminating storytelling
      event. Any additional funds would go to funding more pop-up Libraries
      throughout the city.
