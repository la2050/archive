  This project will create a new recreational feature by transforming a
  currently vacant and deteriorated site into a unique, aesthetically pleasing,
  multiple-benefit natural park by improving the landscaping, and adding
  supporting amenities such as an amphitheater, nature trails, adventure play
  area, interpretive elements to help educate users about natural resources,
  picnic area with free Wi-Fi, and art plaza for community gathering and
  interacting. Additionally, the park will feature all California-native
  drought-tolerant landscaping which will provide habitat for local wildlife,
  provide shade, generate oxygen, and remove pollutants from the air thus
  helping to reduce the adverse impacts of global warming. The park will also
  feature a solar panel collector which will provide power for the energy needs
  of the park and will educate the public about the benefit of energy savings.
   This project will also add much needed park space to Los Angeles as there is currently a critical lack of parks to play in. The project’s close proximity of the nearby public and private schools and apartments will ensure that a good majority both youth and adults are able to access and play in the park. The park will feature areas designated for play that are made of natural components such as plants, logs, boulders, hills and trees. These components represent a unique “wild environment” in a way that provides the feeling of being in nature but is safe and manageable to young visitors. A few man-made components have been carefully integrated to support creative play, encourage confident exploration and help children develop a lasting affinity for the natural world. Seniors and other family members will similarly benefit from this open space through genuine recreational opportunities via walking trails, gathering areas for social and cultural interaction, new learning experiences, and a greatly improved environmental experience. 
   There has been much research on the subject of the benefits of outdoor play. Playing outside helps children to understand and respect nature, the environment and the interdependence of humans, animals, plants, and lifecycles. While play is crucial for a child’s development, it is also beneficial for people of all ages. Play can add joy to life, relieve stress, supercharge learning, and connect you to others and the world around you. The new Franklin-Ivar Park will provide the Los Angeles community with a safe outdoor space for more play.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  One of the reoccurring concerns expressed by the community both during the
  outreach phase of the project and in subsequent community meetings is safety.
  This concern has been addressed in the design of the park by including secure
  perimeter fencing and by strategically planting so that site lines are open
  and allow for visibility. This will continue to be addressed once the park
  opens with periodic patrols by agency staff, camera surveillance, coordination
  with the Los Angeles Police Department and Caltrans, and through the active
  use of the space by the public. The most effective deterrent to ‘bad use’ is
  positive and increased use by families, seniors, and youth, and the park has
  been designed to maximize participation by these user groups.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  As the project is located in a park-poor community, the mere existence of the
  park will be a gauge of its success as it will add new recreational space for
  families, children and the community to play in. We expect that is park will
  be heavily used, given the involvement and anticipation displayed to-date by
  the local residents. The success of the project will be evaluated, in part, by
  the frequency of its use and future stewardship. A Friends of Franklin-Ivar
  Park group may be established to ensure continued stewardship for the space,
  engage the community, encourage park use and activate the space. The picnic
  and plaza area was designed to accommodate a farmer’s market allowing
  neighbors the opportunity to interact and purchase fresh local produce. The
  children’s play area will be utilized by kids from all economic groups
  fostering friendships and improving their physical health. MRCA may conduct
  surveys to evaluate and summarize the anticipated use vs. the actual use of
  the park.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There are other organizations who have complementary goals in the Los Angeles
  area, including California State Parks and City of Los Angeles Department of
  Recreation and Parks. 
   
   The MRCA’s approach is unique because we incorporate park elements that provide more than just recreation: Our goal is to bring ‘nature’ to the City by developing natural parks that serve to also provide habitat for local wildlife, educate the public, and provide much needed public access to open space. Additionally, we approach projects in a manner that involves the surrounding community in a valuable way. The local community participated in the planning process for this park during an in-depth community outreach process through 12 community meetings to ensure that residents felt comfortable and engaged. As a result, the final design is ultimately considered to be the ‘community’s vision’. Two of the key points that informed the design direction were: Residents wanted a natural children’s play area; and natural open space areas were important to nearly every participant. 
   
   Lastly, the long term operation and maintenance of the project will be the responsibility of MRCA. The MRCA is a local public agency who’s mission is to protect land and provide public access to natural lands in southern California. Since its inception, the MRCA has designed, planned and constructed scores of natural park projects throughout Los Angeles. The MRCA’s successful operation of our existing parks is compelling proof that the long-term success of the Franklin-Ivar Park is ensured. The agency has an established reputation for high-quality maintenance and maintains a positive presence in both our urban parks and natural open spaces.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  The MRCA has partnered with a number of entities in the planning of this
  project including: 
   • Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy (Conservancy) – As the land-owner, the Conservancy is our largest partner. Due to MRCA’s expertise in urban park projects, the Conservancy has delegated long-term responsibility to plan, develop, and maintain the property.
   • City Councilmembers David Ryu and Mitch O-Farrell – Although the park is technically in Councilmember Ryu’s district, it sits on the border of the two Council Districts. MRCA met with Councilmen O’Farrell, who is supportive and committed to help in any way and has offered to facilitate, if needed, to make the project move forward in a timely manner. Councilman O’Farrell has a history of being helpful with the creation of small pocket parks as well as larger endeavors like the greening of the Los Angeles River. Councilman Ryu took office in July 2015 and is also supportive of the project.
   • Hollywood/Los Angeles Beautification Team (HLABT) – Their mission is “To improve the quality of life in Los Angeles by empowering citizens to change their environments for the better.” HLABT has been a project partner since the inception of this project and has facilitated with public meeting during the conceptual design phase.
   • Additional entities/organizations that have provided partnership along the way include –
   o Former State Assemblymember (now Los Angeles City Attorney) Mike Feuer
   o Former City of Los Angeles Councilmember Tom LaBonge
   o Mayor Eric Garcetti
   o American Music and Dance Academy (AMDA) – the owners of the properties to the south of the park site
   o Cheremoya Foundation – a nearby elementary school parent’s stakeholder group
   o Argyle Civic Association – a nearby neighborhood group to the east
   o Whitely Heights Civic Association – a nearby neighborhood association
   o Yucca Corridor Coalition – a business group to the south of the project
   o Hollywood Dell Civic Association – a nearby neighborhood homeowner’s group
   o Hollywood Central Neighborhood Council – a nearby neighborhood council
   o Hollywood United Neighborhood Council – the neighborhood council in which this project is located.
   
   If awarded, the full $100,000 would be allocated to the MRCA to implement the park project. Our agency and community partners would continue to participate in the planning, design and implementation of the project.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  The total estimated cost to construct the Franklin-Ivar Park project is $1.6
  million. We currently have $1.2 million in funding from California State Parks
  Proposition 84 grant and California Natural Resource Agency through an Urban
  Greening grant. The requested $100,000 will help MRCA to supplement the
  funding shortfall and allow us to construct the park sooner.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  1. Project Management / Construction Management : $20,000 
   2. Site Preparation : $10,000 
   3. Adventure Play Area : $35,000 
   4. Fencing/Gate(s): $25,000 
   5. Electrical: $10,000
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  The obvious measure of the park’s success will be its frequent use by the
  public and the simple fact that this currently vacant and derelict site will
  become an active place for people to play. There is currently a large desire
  and need to transform this, and other vacant lots, throughout Los Angeles into
  spaces that the public can utilize and enjoy. The mere creation and use of
  this park will be a major success and a step in the right direction to clean
  and activate Los Angeles. 
   New urban parks of similar size were recently constructed by the MRCA and serve other park-poor neighborhoods. Constant outreach through social media such as Facebook, emails and person to person contact has allowed us to reach a wider scale of people and further the success of our public programing, resulting in higher number of attendance. The same will be done with Franklin/Ivar Park. 
   Additionally, as trees and other vegetation are proven to sequester carbon and improve our air quality, the park’s tree canopy and shrubs will almost immediately clean the air. Furthermore, air quality will be improved and greenhouse gasses will be reduced due to the park’s easy access via walking and bicycling, its close proximity to public transit, and permanent designation as open-space.
