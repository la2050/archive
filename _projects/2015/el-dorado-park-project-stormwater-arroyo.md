  'DESCRIBE IN GREATER DETAIL HOW YOU WILL MAKE LA THE HEALTHIEST PLACE TO LIVE: ': "El Dorado Park will make Los Angeles (LA) a better place to live by converting 1-acre of vacant land into a multiple-benefit natural park in a park-poor, disadvantaged community. The park will add much needed open space to LA residents: There is approximately .5-acre of open space per 1,000 residents in this neighborhood. This is a stark contrast to the already park-poor LA city-wide average of 4-acres per 1,000 residents. Additionally, there is a lack of connectivity and accessibility to what open space and recreational opportunities exist. The project is part of the larger vision to create a greenway and multi-use trail along Pacoima Wash (Wash). When the trail is completed it will become a regional amenity allowing people throughout LA to enjoy the park. Increased park access and greenway paths along the Wash go a long way towards streamlining walking and biking between open spaces and residential communities who are currently stymied from access due to freeways and fences along the Wash.  Also, as a new green space in a dense urban community, the park will add a positive feature that helps balance land use.\r\nCurrently stormwater from the neighborhood crosses the site and enters the Wash untreated carrying trash, oil, and other pollution downstream to the Ocean. The project will ultimately clean the Wash, and ultimately the Ocean, by diverting and capturing this stormwater and treating it through the planned arroyos and basins on-site. The arroyo will consist of trash collectors to remove trash, sediment, and bacterial pollution. Water then travels through a swale, and enters basins to infiltrate and recharge LA’s groundwater, helping to reduce LA’s demand on imported water.\r\nThe majority of the site will become a habitat by using California native drought-tolerant plants. The park’s native plants require much less water reducing water consumption. The site currently has bare dirt and noxious weeds, an eyesore to the community. Once completed, all of the park will be landscaped with trees and shrubs, which will sequester carbon and clean our air. The park’s location in a built-out urban area will reduce the generation of pollution through its easy access via walking or biking – thereby reducing vehicle miles traveled from residents who currently drive to parks to enjoy the outdoors. All of these various approaches to improve air and water quality meet our objectives to protect LA’s land and water resources, while providing public access to parkland.\r\n"

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    An obstacle encountered in this project is to maximize the amount of
    stormwater that can be treated and collected in a 1-acre park that receives
    23 acres of runoff. Input from community during workshops requested that the
    park clean, collect, and store as much stormwater flowing through the park
    from the neighborhood as possible, but also balance usable passive open
    space for the community to utilize. The strategy is to provide resilient
    water quality treatment, retaining all of the initial runoff (e.g. trash,
    sediment, contaminants) onsite. During large storms, the site does not need
    to infiltrate all of the runoff, only allowing clean water to exit to the
    Wash. The park will hold and recharge groundwater aquifers from more than a
    ¾” storm from the site and more from the neighborhood. Additionally,
    elements such as seatwalls built into the basin innovatively allow it to be
    used by classes to gather and discuss the park stewardship and what
    materials have been collected onsite. 
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    This project is located in an underserved and park poor community, the mere
    existence of the park will be a gauge of success. It will add 1-acre of
    recreational space for the community to enjoy. We expect that this park will
    be heavily used by the neighborhood, given excitement displayed to-date by
    residents. The success of the project will also be evaluated, in part, by
    stewardship: through the water treatment elements, park users can see and
    learn what type of trash is collected at the park during runoff, spurring
    neighbors to pickup street litter immediately. We will partner with local
    community groups (such as Pacoima Beautiful) who foster environmental
    stewardship through volunteer activities that keep the community engaged and
    will activate the park. MRCA is also developing a program with partners to
    monitor the effectiveness of the stormwater treatment system. These
    organizations may also conduct park-user counts and bird counts, comparing
    pre‐ and post‐construction conditions.
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "Other organizations that are similar to MRCA are, California State Parks and City of Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks. As organizations who want to better California and LA by creating more open space and recreation, we all complement one another. MRCA stands out because we incorporate project elements that provide multiple benefits, not just recreation, into our parks: Our goal is to bring nature into the City by developing natural parks that serve to provide new public access, recreation, habitat for local wildlife, educate the public, and improve the quality and quantity of water in our watersheds. The park’s use of natural systems to manage stormwater is becoming a more standard way to design, nevertheless this type of design in semi‐arid climates is still at the forefront of innovation. Additionally, we approach projects in a manner that involves the surrounding community in a valuable way. This project began with a young resident asking why the Pacoima Wash couldn’t have the same resources and beauty as portions of the LA River in other neighborhoods of LA. From that, this idea grew into a community vision, and began a paradigm shift from standard municipal park projects. It included an in-depth community outreach process to create and review the proposed designs. As a community that faces education and language barriers, out of the box measures were needed to ensure that residents felt comfortable and engaged in the process, since these residents have often not been represented in other planning and civic processes. \r\n\r\nMRCA has also engaged multiple departments within the City of LA to envision a holistically designed project. The project is an innovative model of inter‐departmental and inter‐agency partnership. Through the development of this project, we are continuing the effort of bringing nature to the city and being the only agency to implement unique projects such as El Dorado Park in this community making this park the second of its kind along the Pacoima Wash (next to the MRCA’s Natural Park upstream in the City of San Fernando). As a new multiple-benefit park, it will not only benefit the local community but will also have a regional impact due to its location next to a future bikeway connecting to the Angeles National Forest and through the water treatment system that will clean LA’s waterways and certainly make LA a better place to live."
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    MRCA has partnered with Pacoima Beautiful, Los Angeles City Department of
    Recreation and Parks (City), and the Los Angeles County Department of Public
    Health to develop a vision document for the future Pacoima Wash Greenway.
    The El Dorado Park parcel was determined to be the priority parcel and was
    purchased by the City for the purposes of creating a park. Based on MRCA’s
    experience with implementing natural parks in urban LA, the City approached
    the MRCA with the site as a park development opportunity. The MRCA met with
    various City departments, City Council staff, and community groups to
    determine if there was still sufficient interest and resources to implement
    a project at this site. The support was overwhelming, leading the MRCA to
    prioritize the Project’s development in its Urban Projects and Watershed
    Planning Division, which is currently implementing over ten (10) natural
    parks throughout the region. If awarded, the full $100,000 would be
    allocated to the MRCA in order to implement the water quality portion of the
    park. Our agency and community partners will continue to participate in the
    Project’s planning, design and implementation. The project is also supported
    by State Senator Alex Padilla, Assembly member Felipe Fuentes, and the
    National Park Service.
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    The cost of the water quality treatment element for the project is $250,000.
    MRCA currently has $150,000 for the construction of this element. The LA
    2050 $100,000 grant would be the bridge to close the funding gap. This
    funding will help to ensure that we are able to capture, treat and
    infiltrate polluted stormwater from the neighborhood streets and prevent it
    from entering into the Pacoima Wash. It will also help to replenish our
    groundwater supply. This will have a considerable effect on the future
    quality and quantity of water in LA. This project is also being funded
    through a grant from the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy. All efforts
    will be made to keep the project within the allocated funding. If costs
    exceed projections, we would use a creative value engineering process to
    identify alternative ways to complete the scope. In past projects, MRCA
    successfully reduced costs without eliminating features by substituting
    materials, and simplifying construction methods. The requested funding
    amount is small but this small amount will add great value to this new
    community park resource.
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "If awarded the $100,000 for the stormwater treatment portion of the project will be divided as such:\r\n\r\nProject Management Staff Time/Construction Management: $25,000\r\nLabor (construction of forebay, swales, basins): $18,000\r\nMaterials (gravel, sand, soil, boulders, pipes): $44,500\r\nEquipment rental (excavator, trucks): $12,500"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "The MRCA will put into motion a desire and need for more multiple benefit parks in an already park poor Los Angeles. An obvious measure of the park’s success will be its frequent use by the public and the fact that this currently vacant and deteriorated site will become an active and beautiful place for people to enjoy. There is currently a large desire and need to increase open space by transforming vacant lots throughout Los Angeles into spaces that the public can utilize and activate. The mere creation and use of this park will be a major success and a step in the right direction to live in a clean Los Angeles.  \r\nEl Dorado Park will not only improve the quality of life in the surrounding community but will have a greater impact through the improvement of it’s water quality. Once El Dorado Park is finished it will be maintained by the City of Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks. We hope that by building this resilient multiple benefit park it will influence the City of Los Angeles to continue the effort in creating more similar parks that can improve the quality of life all over Los Angeles.\r\n"

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  This project will create a new recreational feature by transforming a
  currently vacant and deteriorated site into a unique, aesthetically pleasing,
  multiple-benefit natural park by improving the landscaping, and adding
  supporting amenities such as an amphitheater, nature trails, adventure play
  area, interpretive elements to help educate users about natural resources,
  picnic area with free Wi-Fi, and art plaza for community gathering and
  interacting. Additionally, the park will feature all California-native
  drought-tolerant landscaping which will provide habitat for local wildlife,
  provide shade, generate oxygen, and remove pollutants from the air thus
  helping to reduce the adverse impacts of global warming. The park will also
  feature a solar panel collector which will provide power for the energy needs
  of the park and will educate the public about the benefit of energy savings.
   This project will also add much needed park space to Los Angeles as there is currently a critical lack of parks to play in. The project’s close proximity of the nearby public and private schools and apartments will ensure that a good majority both youth and adults are able to access and play in the park. The park will feature areas designated for play that are made of natural components such as plants, logs, boulders, hills and trees. These components represent a unique “wild environment” in a way that provides the feeling of being in nature but is safe and manageable to young visitors. A few man-made components have been carefully integrated to support creative play, encourage confident exploration and help children develop a lasting affinity for the natural world. Seniors and other family members will similarly benefit from this open space through genuine recreational opportunities via walking trails, gathering areas for social and cultural interaction, new learning experiences, and a greatly improved environmental experience. 
   There has been much research on the subject of the benefits of outdoor play. Playing outside helps children to understand and respect nature, the environment and the interdependence of humans, animals, plants, and lifecycles. While play is crucial for a child’s development, it is also beneficial for people of all ages. Play can add joy to life, relieve stress, supercharge learning, and connect you to others and the world around you. The new Franklin-Ivar Park will provide the Los Angeles community with a safe outdoor space for more play.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  One of the reoccurring concerns expressed by the community both during the
  outreach phase of the project and in subsequent community meetings is safety.
  This concern has been addressed in the design of the park by including secure
  perimeter fencing and by strategically planting so that site lines are open
  and allow for visibility. This will continue to be addressed once the park
  opens with periodic patrols by agency staff, camera surveillance, coordination
  with the Los Angeles Police Department and Caltrans, and through the active
  use of the space by the public. The most effective deterrent to ‘bad use’ is
  positive and increased use by families, seniors, and youth, and the park has
  been designed to maximize participation by these user groups.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  As the project is located in a park-poor community, the mere existence of the
  park will be a gauge of its success as it will add new recreational space for
  families, children and the community to play in. We expect that is park will
  be heavily used, given the involvement and anticipation displayed to-date by
  the local residents. The success of the project will be evaluated, in part, by
  the frequency of its use and future stewardship. A Friends of Franklin-Ivar
  Park group may be established to ensure continued stewardship for the space,
  engage the community, encourage park use and activate the space. The picnic
  and plaza area was designed to accommodate a farmer’s market allowing
  neighbors the opportunity to interact and purchase fresh local produce. The
  children’s play area will be utilized by kids from all economic groups
  fostering friendships and improving their physical health. MRCA may conduct
  surveys to evaluate and summarize the anticipated use vs. the actual use of
  the park.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There are other organizations who have complementary goals in the Los Angeles
  area, including California State Parks and City of Los Angeles Department of
  Recreation and Parks. 
   
   The MRCA’s approach is unique because we incorporate park elements that provide more than just recreation: Our goal is to bring ‘nature’ to the City by developing natural parks that serve to also provide habitat for local wildlife, educate the public, and provide much needed public access to open space. Additionally, we approach projects in a manner that involves the surrounding community in a valuable way. The local community participated in the planning process for this park during an in-depth community outreach process through 12 community meetings to ensure that residents felt comfortable and engaged. As a result, the final design is ultimately considered to be the ‘community’s vision’. Two of the key points that informed the design direction were: Residents wanted a natural children’s play area; and natural open space areas were important to nearly every participant. 
   
   Lastly, the long term operation and maintenance of the project will be the responsibility of MRCA. The MRCA is a local public agency who’s mission is to protect land and provide public access to natural lands in southern California. Since its inception, the MRCA has designed, planned and constructed scores of natural park projects throughout Los Angeles. The MRCA’s successful operation of our existing parks is compelling proof that the long-term success of the Franklin-Ivar Park is ensured. The agency has an established reputation for high-quality maintenance and maintains a positive presence in both our urban parks and natural open spaces.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  The MRCA has partnered with a number of entities in the planning of this
  project including: 
   • Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy (Conservancy) – As the land-owner, the Conservancy is our largest partner. Due to MRCA’s expertise in urban park projects, the Conservancy has delegated long-term responsibility to plan, develop, and maintain the property.
   • City Councilmembers David Ryu and Mitch O-Farrell – Although the park is technically in Councilmember Ryu’s district, it sits on the border of the two Council Districts. MRCA met with Councilmen O’Farrell, who is supportive and committed to help in any way and has offered to facilitate, if needed, to make the project move forward in a timely manner. Councilman O’Farrell has a history of being helpful with the creation of small pocket parks as well as larger endeavors like the greening of the Los Angeles River. Councilman Ryu took office in July 2015 and is also supportive of the project.
   • Hollywood/Los Angeles Beautification Team (HLABT) – Their mission is “To improve the quality of life in Los Angeles by empowering citizens to change their environments for the better.” HLABT has been a project partner since the inception of this project and has facilitated with public meeting during the conceptual design phase.
   • Additional entities/organizations that have provided partnership along the way include –
   o Former State Assemblymember (now Los Angeles City Attorney) Mike Feuer
   o Former City of Los Angeles Councilmember Tom LaBonge
   o Mayor Eric Garcetti
   o American Music and Dance Academy (AMDA) – the owners of the properties to the south of the park site
   o Cheremoya Foundation – a nearby elementary school parent’s stakeholder group
   o Argyle Civic Association – a nearby neighborhood group to the east
   o Whitely Heights Civic Association – a nearby neighborhood association
   o Yucca Corridor Coalition – a business group to the south of the project
   o Hollywood Dell Civic Association – a nearby neighborhood homeowner’s group
   o Hollywood Central Neighborhood Council – a nearby neighborhood council
   o Hollywood United Neighborhood Council – the neighborhood council in which this project is located.
   
   If awarded, the full $100,000 would be allocated to the MRCA to implement the park project. Our agency and community partners would continue to participate in the planning, design and implementation of the project.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  The total estimated cost to construct the Franklin-Ivar Park project is $1.6
  million. We currently have $1.2 million in funding from California State Parks
  Proposition 84 grant and California Natural Resource Agency through an Urban
  Greening grant. The requested $100,000 will help MRCA to supplement the
  funding shortfall and allow us to construct the park sooner.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  1. Project Management / Construction Management : $20,000 
   2. Site Preparation : $10,000 
   3. Adventure Play Area : $35,000 
   4. Fencing/Gate(s): $25,000 
   5. Electrical: $10,000
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  The obvious measure of the park’s success will be its frequent use by the
  public and the simple fact that this currently vacant and derelict site will
  become an active place for people to play. There is currently a large desire
  and need to transform this, and other vacant lots, throughout Los Angeles into
  spaces that the public can utilize and enjoy. The mere creation and use of
  this park will be a major success and a step in the right direction to clean
  and activate Los Angeles. 
   New urban parks of similar size were recently constructed by the MRCA and serve other park-poor neighborhoods. Constant outreach through social media such as Facebook, emails and person to person contact has allowed us to reach a wider scale of people and further the success of our public programing, resulting in higher number of attendance. The same will be done with Franklin/Ivar Park. 
   Additionally, as trees and other vegetation are proven to sequester carbon and improve our air quality, the park’s tree canopy and shrubs will almost immediately clean the air. Furthermore, air quality will be improved and greenhouse gasses will be reduced due to the park’s easy access via walking and bicycling, its close proximity to public transit, and permanent designation as open-space.
