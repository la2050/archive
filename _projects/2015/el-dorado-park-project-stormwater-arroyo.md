  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    This project is located in an underserved and park poor community, the mere
    existence of the park will be a gauge of success. It will add 1-acre of
    recreational space for the community to enjoy. We expect that this park will
    be heavily used by the neighborhood, given excitement displayed to-date by
    residents. The success of the project will also be evaluated, in part, by
    stewardship: through the water treatment elements, park users can see and
    learn what type of trash is collected at the park during runoff, spurring
    neighbors to pickup street litter immediately. We will partner with local
    community groups (such as Pacoima Beautiful) who foster environmental
    stewardship through volunteer activities that keep the community engaged and
    will activate the park. MRCA is also developing a program with partners to
    monitor the effectiveness of the stormwater treatment system. These
    organizations may also conduct park-user counts and bird counts, comparing
    pre‐ and post‐construction conditions.
