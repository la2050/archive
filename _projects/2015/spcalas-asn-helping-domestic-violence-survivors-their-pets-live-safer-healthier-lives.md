  Abusers use everything at their disposal to terrorize and control those they
  batter – including the family pet, often threatening to harm or kill an animal
  if the domestic violence survivor dares leave. spcaLA’s Animal Safety Network
  (ASN)™ provides a safe refuge for the domestic violence survivors’ pets,
  free-of-charge, so that they may leave a dangerous situation without fear for
  their animals’ lives. spcaLA wants to expand ASN and break the cycle of
  violence for more people and their pets.

  Over 3 million incidents of domestic violence occur annually in the U.S. Many
  homes where spouses and children are neglected or abused are often shared by
  defenseless pets. All too often, these pets become victims. Relishing in their
  power, abusers beat, torture and kill beloved animals for the sake of hurting,
  silencing or preventing their partners from leaving. 
   Leaving can be difficult. Boarding services are expensive and most domestic violence shelters cannot house animals. Many victims face a gut wrenching decision. Do they run for a shelter and leave their beloved pet behind? Or, do they stay and risk their lives to protect their pet? According to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, “between 25 and 40 percent of domestic violence victims will not leave a dangerous situation because they do not want to abandon their pets.”
   This is where we help. Animal Safety Net (ASN)™ assists domestic violence survivors by offering free temporary housing for their pets, taking them out of harm’s way, and allowing survivors to relocate to a domestic violence shelter. While under our care, animals receive veterinary treatment, vaccinations and spay/neuter surgery. Families remain in contact with their pets through photos and updates until they are safely out of the shelter and reunited. 
   Domestic violence, child abuse, and animal abuse are all linked. Studies have found that domestic violence abusers who harm animals are twice as likely have also abused a child. These children suffer both physical and mental abuse – as the exposure to their beloved pet being hurt can have deeply adverse psychological effects. ASN helps stop this cycle of violence. This program empowers survivors to leave and seek care. Further, if animal abuse is suspected, spcaLA Humane Officers will investigate and work to prosecute the offenders. 
   At its core, ASN gives domestic violence survivors peace of mind. The comfort in knowing their adored pet is protected and cared for helps survivors escape, persevere, and begin building a safer, healthier life for themselves and their family.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Our greatest challenge is limited funding. Unlike shelter pets, ASN animals do
  not quickly cycle out of our care. These animals are often housed for extended
  periods of time and frequently require routine medication, special diet, and
  help with behavioral issues.
   These animals can also be challenging to place in foster homes. ASN clients often have two or more pets at home. Placing two animals – especially two large dogs – even without the medical and behavioral considerations often present with ASN pets, can be problematic. 
   To house and care for these often “difficult” animals, we require a designated program facility, foster compensation, and above all, consistent funding. As a nonprofit organization, we rely on public support to facilitate all of our programs, including ASN. Therefore, to combat limited funding and provide for these animals, we will continuously seek public donations and grant support.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  spcaLA wants to expand ASN to help more domestic violence survivors and their
  pets. We will evaluate our program by reviewing its development. More
  specifically, we will assess:
   - ASN foster parent database
   - program staff
   - facility space 
   - partnerships and collaboration with domestic violence shelters and humane organizations
   - # of animal abusers prosecuted
   - # of animals and survivors we support
   Successful implementation of this grant will ultimately demonstrate that more families were helped because of our program’s expansion.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  spcaLA’s ASN program was the first of its kind in the country. We have taken
  clients from as far away as Florida for lack of local resources. And, while a
  handful of humane organizations offer similar programming and some DV shelters
  added limited onsite kenneling, it is not enough. 
   The sad reality is, many animals in a domestic violence situation have been harmed. Either abused, or made to live in a state of fear, they typically need more than a bed. They need veterinary care and behavior enrichment. They need to learn how to trust people again. They need the resources and expertise that can be provided by a humane agency, like spcaLA.
   spcaLA’s approach is unique in a number of ways, on the small, day-to-day scale, spcaLA offers:
   - Transportation to and from spcaLA facilities for ASN pets
   - Safe shelter including food, toys, treats and fresh bedding 
   - Veterinary care, including spay/neuter, vaccinations, and routine care, as well as care for more in-depth issues
   - Behavior enrichment and a plan of care developed by spcaLA Animal Behavior & Training Department
   - Facilities for multiple pets and those with special medical or behavioral needs
   - spcaLA is the only nonprofit animal welfare agency in the city of Los Angeles that is also Law Enforcement. If abusers turned their wrath toward the pets in our care, spcaLA Humane Officers will investigate and gather forensic evidence, so that animal cruelty charges can be brought against the offender.
   To better accommodate the ever-growing demand for ASN services, spcaLA desires to increase these offerings by:
   - Recruiting and compensating foster parents specific to ASN (currently, spcaLA foster parents do not receive any financial compensation)
   - Hiring additional staff to manage the program
   - Repurposing existing facilities to house ASN animals and/or paying for boarding facilities
   On a larger scale, spcaLA seeks to make ASN replicable. Like our award-winning violence-prevention program, Teaching Love & Compassion, spcaLA has developed a comprehensive manual for the ASN program. The manual offers humane agencies step-by-step instructions and guidance to operate the program in their communities. As part of the LA2050 Challenge, spcaLA seeks to market the ASN manual to other humane agencies in Southern California, thereby developing a true network of support for domestic violence survivors and their pets.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Successfully expanding ASN involves the collaboration between domestic
  violence shelters, police officials, and social service agencies. To help
  survivors, they must know we’re here. These organizations help share our
  services to those who can use our support. 
   While our program involves teamwork, ASN will be managed and staffed solely by spcaLA. The entirety of the grant will go to the ASN program.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  $100,000 will play a substantial role in expanding the ASN program – a service
  the LA community deeply needs. But, to continue the program annually, ASN will
  require continuous funding. To cover these costs, spcaLA will continue to
  fundraise and allot a program budget.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  LA2050 funding will be used to do the following.
   - Hire an ASN coordinator, who will be responsible for foster parent support, recruitment, & retention, as well as managing the boarding facility, evaluating the program and working within the community to increase awareness of our services.
   - Repurpose an existing spcaLA facility to accommodate ASN pets during peak seasons (typically Oct-Feb) and/or pay for boarding of pets. Costs may include:
   o staffing (two full-time animal care attendants)
   o operating costs for the facility
   o transportation (veterinarians, clients, clients)
   o minor renovations/repairs
   o boarding costs
   - Produce and market ASN materials to other humane agencies
   - Provide veterinary care, food, and shelter to animals in the program
   We anticipate grant funds will be used as follows:
   • $10,000: Veterinary Services & Food
   • $2,500: Transportation
   • $70,000: Staff Salary
   • $1,500: Foster Compensation
   • $1,000: Marketing 
   • $15,000: Facility/Misc.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  The success of our proposal will ultimately be measured by the number of
  animals and survivors we support, as well as whether or not we are successful
  in replicating the program. Regardless of how many foster parents we’ve
  acquired, staff hired, or facilities we’ve repurposed, what is fundamentally
  important, is the number of lives we’ve improved. The number of men, women,
  and children we help escape the reign of their abuser and seek refuge. The
  number of survivors we give hope and peace of mind knowing their cherished pet
  is in good hands. The number of families we reunite and keep intact. This is
  how we measure success. 
   
   Last year, we helped 62 men, women, and children in 30 families by caring for their pets. A total of 32 dogs, 5 cats, 1 rabbit and 1 hamster were housed in safe, loving homes while their human families received much needed emotional support from domestic violence shelters across Los Angeles County. This year, we want to help more. 
   If expanding the ASN program helps save the lives of more people and pets and catches like wildfire – spreading to other humane organizations and communities - our project will be deemed successful.
