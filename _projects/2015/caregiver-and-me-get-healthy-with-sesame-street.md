  The “Caregiver and Me: Get Healthy with Sesame Street” pilot project is an
  innovative learning experience addressing the childhood obesity epidemic in
  Los Angeles County by targeting family, friend and neighbor child caregivers
  in areas with obesity rates of 30% or higher. This is a collaborative effort
  with community and government organizations familiar with the critical need
  and challenges of engaging the family, friend and neighbor community caring
  for an estimated 97,000 children in LA.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  We will make LA the Healthiest place to live by changing the trajectory of
  children’s health in targeted high need areas. Instilling healthy habits in
  children of LA County in 2016 is growing the healthy adults of 2050. How? By
  providing an educational opportunity targeting the Family, Friend and Neighbor
  (FFN) child caregiver that challenges the status quo. The Lucille & David
  Packard Foundation released a 3 dimensional report regarding FFN caregivers to
  encourage rethinking how we attempt to engage and educate them. According to
  The Early Care and Education Landscape in LA County Report, this community is
  caring for 97,000 children as they develop 90% of their brain from ages 0-5.
  These children are spending a great deal of time, during their most formative
  and vulnerable years, with individuals who are not required to (and generally
  do not) participate in educational trainings for any aspect of early childhood
  development, including health and wellness. Grandparents and other FFN
  caregivers are unknowingly contributing to the childhood obesity epidemic by
  not understanding the crucial role they play in a child’s growth and
  development. There are 11 areas in LA County with childhood obesity rates at
  30% or higher and these are the areas we are going to target.
   
   Messaging, branding, location, language, activities, training leaders and style of training must be tailored to this audience to impact all aspects of early education including healthy habits.
   
   This class will be using a successful “mommy & me” model in an innovative way. Sesame Street materials create a familiar and common ground for leader, participants and children. Sharing information about physical activity, healthy cooking and purchasing healthful foods on a budget will feel like a fun outing with the children and not a “training” for the professional caregiver. Including the children in the learning event will also empower the caregiver to do these things in her home as he/she has already experienced how to do it WITH the children.
   
   Another innovative highlight to this project is using a successful model of leadership cultivations that Magnolia Place implemented with an FFN reading club project. Trust is cited time and again as the crux of a successful project in this community therefore the leaders of our classes will be individuals from the FFN community not only establishing a trusting environment during the class but cultivating leaders within the community.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: |-
  Problem: Recruiting Attendees. 
   Strategy: Messaging, branding, location, language, activities, training leaders and style of training will be tailored to this audience’s needs and interests. We are also partnering with community based organizations that have established connections and networks to FFN caregivers including the Child Care Alliance of Los Angeles and Magnolia Place. May want to mention incentivizing the workshops - not sure if you need to mention the specifics of offering food, gift cards, or bus tokens. 
   
   Problem: Finding and Cultivating Leaders for the Classes. 
   Strategy: work with community based organizations such as Child Care Alliance of Los Angeles, Magnolia Place and Best Start Locations to get recommendations of who we can reach out to as well as put out a call to the community through these channels.
   
   Problem: Incentives for Attendance
   Strategy: We will be incentivizing with food at location, providing child care, a physical activity kit, gift cards et
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  In an effort to determine the success and adjustments necessary regarding this
  pilot project, we will create an evaluation tool - two surveys - to be taken
  before and after the class. One will be directed toward what brought them to
  the class, how they got there, if there were any barriers they had to remove
  in order to attend and what expectations they have for the class. This will
  help us assess what part of the recruiting and outreach process worked best as
  well as determine if we accurately set expectations for the experience. The
  second survey will help us determine the success of the class itself - format
  and style, materials, location, environment, class leader and will help us
  determine if they would recommend it to other community members, if they would
  come to another class style like this on another topic and if they would want
  to always keep it with the same leader and group or if signing up for a random
  class provided is attractive option.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There are other organizations doing similar work. Some focusing on child care
  and obesity prevention such as Choose Health LA Child Care, an obesity
  prevention program funded by First 5 LA and managed by Los Angeles Department
  of Public Health and Taking Healthy Steps to Success – LA County which is an
  early learning collaborative funded by Nemours. There are additional
  initiatives focusing on Family, Friend and Neighbor (FFN) care as well as
  parent engagement all meant to positively impact children in LA County. The
  Unique Factor: We are building on lessons learned from the Choose Health LA
  Child Care Project, research done by the Packard Foundation published in June
  2015 and listening to those who have been in the community share achievements
  and barriers to successful programming. We are removing known barriers
  upfront: children are invited, location will be convenient and familiar, the
  materials and class will be familiar - Sesame Street - in either spanish or
  english, incentives will be given and the class will be lead by a trusted
  person from the community. Throughout research and conversations with
  stakeholders in the FFN community trust is an element that continues to take
  precedence. Our unique caregiver & me format combined with Sesame Street
  materials, trust from from the community and the expertise of surrounding
  organizations set this project apart from current initiatives.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (LAC DPH) is a collaborative
  partner providing technical assistance and resources as needed. They will not
  receive grant funds.
   
   Child Care Alliance of Los Angeles will receive $25,000 to design the 1.5 hour class, Develop the 1.5 hour training based on the 3 Sesame Street Materials; “Mommy and Me”format, Conduct 12 trainings over the course of 1 year; Recruit FFN providers in partnership with our R&R’s (mailings, email blasts, phone calls), coordinate and host training (including food) at a local community center (Library, Parks and Rec Center, etc.), Provide child care and provide incentive materials - Physical Activity Kit
   
   Magnolia Place (Children's Bureau) will receive $15,000 to work with their existing network and additional channels of Family, Friend and Neighbor Caregivers. Magnolia Place will arrange outreach, child care, location and enable us to work within the trusting boundaries they have established with their FFN community.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  This pilot will not cost more than $100,000. We are being mindful and
  strategic about the communities we are reaching, the number of people we are
  engaging and working with partners that understand and know our targets which
  keeps costs at a minimum.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
  $25,000 to Child Care Alliance of Los Angeles to design class, conduct
  trainings, do outreach with their Child Care Resource and Referral network,
  host training at a community center, child care and incentive materials.
   $15,000 to Magnolia Place for dedicated staff person to coordinate, provide child care, outreach and liaise with existing ffn network
   $20,000 for a T&L Foundation staff person to coordinate the multiple efforts, manage budget and administer the overall project
   $20,000 Class Leaders. To train and provide incentives for leaders to learn and do the trainings within the community
   $5,000 Incentives for providers to attend
   $10,000 for outreach through different forms of media and channels in the communities. Print flyers, website, social media, text, as well as some grassroots efforts
   $2,500 for location of learning experiences
   $2,500 - Scholarship to pay for trustline application for 20 attendees interested in becoming trustlined
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  After we measure the success and lessons learned from the pilot, we are going
  to write a white paper detailing our experiences. Showing not only how the
  overall program was set up and administered but how the different groups of
  people throughout the license exempt community responded to it. The goal is to
  make it easy for other agencies to easily replicate the efforts and learn from
  our lessons for a successful license exempt outreach plan and class format.
   
   There are many changes coming to the child care world through the new federal and state regulations after the Child Care Development Block Grant was signed into law. One of these big changes is required 10 health and safety trainings. It is imperative agencies intending to train the license exempt providers receiving subsidies know how to engage this notoriously isolated group of people in a learning opportunities.
   
   Children 0-5 are in the care of family members or friends, most likely their grandparents. These caregivers know how they raised their children and their cultural preferences. They are not taking into consideration the impact they are having on the child’s weight, nutrient intake and brain development. This set of caregivers need an additional support system and messaging directed just to them. They are family members and see themselves as such, not as babysitters, caregivers, providers or teachers. Therefore, we will also reach out to organizations such as Generations United, AARP and other Grandfamilies organizations to consider what a partnership might look like to provide the class throughout these networks.
   
   The website with all of the information and how to replicate these efforts will be maintained so the general public will always have access to the white paper, lessons learned and ways to replicate what we accomplished.
