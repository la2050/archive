Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  In an effort to determine the success and adjustments necessary regarding this
  pilot project, we will create an evaluation tool - two surveys - to be taken
  before and after the class.  One will be directed toward what brought them to
  the class, how they got there, if there were any barriers they had to remove
  in order to attend and what expectations they have for the class.  This will
  help us assess what part of the recruiting and outreach process worked best as
  well as determine if we accurately set expectations for the experience.  The
  second survey will help us determine the success of the class itself - format
  and style, materials, location, environment, class leader and will help us
  determine if they would recommend it to other community members, if they would
  come to another class style like this on another topic and if they would want
  to always keep it with the same leader and group or if signing up for a random
  class provided is attractive option.  
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
  - Volunteers/staff (human capital)
  - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
