  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "Los Angeles County Innovation week has grown exponentially in the two years since its inception, and it will continue to grow under the stewardship of the Center for Innovation at the LAEDC. LAIW focuses on creating an ecosystem of innovation where the brightest and most unique ideas can flourish. We accomplish this through connecting businesses, resources, organizations, and entrepreneurs across LA County to amplify innovation. LAIW also creates a greater sense of community among the innovators in Los Angeles, and builds bridges between groups and communities who might not otherwise collaborate or interact. \r\n\r\nIn the 15th century the Medici family brought together people from all disciplines, including sculpture, science, poetry, philosophy, painting, and architecture. This produced one of the most innovative eras in world history, the Renaissance. Los Angeles is currently in the midst of its own renaissance and Innovation Week allows innovators from the city to explore fields that they would not normally be exposed to and apply this knowledge to the innovation that is taking place at their own companies and organizations. LAIW celebrates innovation broadly. This year’s 150 events highlight innovation in myriad categories including: food, art, fashion, sports, entertainment, information technology, philanthropy, biotechnology, transportation, aerospace, environment, health, mindfulness and civic and social innovation. The breadth of innovation showcased serves to provide access to all communities and fosters a sense of inclusion and connectivity across the region. \r\n\r\nInnovation is generally thought of as beneficial for profit maximizing, but the effects can also be realized through an increase in the sustainable impact that a company has on the city. Many of the companies highlighted at this year’s events have strongly integrated social responsibility into their business model. This further allows for the effects of innovation week to be felt through all communities in Los Angeles. Innovation in socially responsible practices creates a possibility for higher profits, as well as a positive effect on the diverse communities in Los Angeles. \r\n\t\r\n"

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "One of the major barriers that we face is that Los Angeles County is 88 cities, but the sectors that are particularly innovative are in very specific parts of the city (i.e. gaming in Santa Monica, etc.). We need to broaden our scope and find innovation happening outside of the obvious connections. With sufficient resources, we will be able to overcome this barrier. \r\n\r\nOne of our other main constraints is time. There is so much happening in LA all the time. This year, we expanded the event to three weeks and we were able to showcase many different sectors, even within this time restraint. Creativity loves constraint! \r\n\r\nAnother constraint this year was that, given our limited resources, we relied mostly on word of mouth and social media for our marketing campaign. There is a strong necessity for an even more targeted marketing campaign. With sufficient resources we would be able to implement a more comprehensive and strategic marketing campaign. \r\n"
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "As we move through LAIW2015, we are actively surveying all of our event hosts and participants. \r\n\r\nFor event hosts we are interested in understanding their successes, attendance and impact. We are also inquiring as to what we can do better to promote and support their individual events.\r\n\r\nFor constituents, we are interested in their overall experience, what they feel they learned and if they will come back next year. We are also asking what we can do better.\r\n\r\nOn the marketing front, we have established key performance indicators and are gathering metrics around reach, visibility and social influence.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    There are many organizations in Los Angeles County working to showcase
    various aspects of the innovation ecosystem. No one is working anywhere near
    our scope or scale. From the outset, we haven't viewed any other
    organization as a competitor, but rather everyone as potential allies. We
    subscribe to the African proverb: If you want to go far, go together. We are
    most proud of the fact that LAIW2015 has over 150 event partners including
    CicLAvia, CarsLA, DigitalLA, Innovate Pasadena, the city of Long Beach,
    General Assembly, Cross Campus, WeWork, and the Idea Hub.
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    These resources will be utilized entirely by the Center for Innovation to
    build LAIW2016 into a global recognized festival.
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    To reach the scale of SXSW or Art Basel Miami, we will ultimately need to
    raise 1 million dollars. The additional costs will be covered through
    corporate and philanthropic sponsorship.
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "COST\r\nStaff members\t              55K\r\nMarketing\t                      14K\r\nWebsite\t                              10K\r\nEvent kickoff\t                      10K\r\nSocial media agency\t        5K\r\nPR agency\t                        2K\r\nSupplies\t                                1K\r\nComputer\t                        1K\r\nTravel\t                                1K\r\nResearch \t                        1K\r\n__________________________\r\nTOTAL                                100K\r\n\r\n"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    Year one of Innovation Week realized 36 events. LAIW2015 has 150 events. Our
    goal for next year is to have separate tracts for Technology, Philanthropy,
    Food/Art/Fashion, Civic and Social Innovation sponsored by companies and
    organizations. Eventually, this festival will have comprehensive themed
    programs within the greater overall frame with Pavilions for each of the
    tracts.
