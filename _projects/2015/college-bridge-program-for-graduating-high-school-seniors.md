    Graduating high school seniors experience what researchers are calling "The
    Summer Melt".  Summer Melt is that period between graduating high school and
    starting college, where students who are college eligible or who have
    already been accepted to college, will not enroll in classes for the fall
    semester.  Recent studies by Harvard University's Center for Education
    Policy Research found that an estimated 20 percent of graduating seniors
    from urban school districts in places such as greater Boston, suburban
    Atlanta, Dallas and Fort Worth, Texas, abandon their plans to attend college
    over the summer. The Ripple Effect will create a 3-week summer bridge
    program for graduating high school seniors to address this educational
    concern.  Focusing on first generation college students, the bridge program
    will focus on developing basic math and English skills, and college
    readiness skills (time management, study techniques, financial aid, creating
    schedule of classes, etc.).  These sessions will be taught by an English and
    a math teacher, and by a college counselor. Students will also participate
    in weekly field trips to different cultural and/or educational events and/or
    locations. These field trips will be chaperoned by volunteers and the
    college counselor.  We will offer 2 bridge sessions, with 30 students in
    each session.  Students that successfully complete the program will receive
    a $300 stipend.  We will also provide a monthly Metro pass for those
    students in need of reliable transportation.  Beyond the bridge program, the
    coordinator will follow up with students during their first year of
    college.  They will be responsible for assisting students as they navigate
    their various college systems.  Our goal is to assist these 1st time college
    students successfully make the transition into college.  And by providing
    follow up services throughout the 1st year, we believe that students will be
    more likely to continue onto their 2nd year of college.

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    Since the target population is first generation college students, we
    understand that the process of going to college and being prepared for
    college can be overwhelming for students.  At times, they will want to give
    up and not continue on with the bridge program. To overcome this barrier,
    every student that completes the 3 week program will receive a $300
    stipend.  The idea is to reward those students who remain dedicated, and
    persevere in completing the program.  
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    We have two objectives we want to measure. (1) Can The Ripple Effect through
    the summer bridge program assist 60 young people transition into their first
    semester of college.  (2) If we provide follow up services through the first
    year, how many students can we assist to be academically successful and
    persist into their 2nd year of college. After the summer bridge program is
    over, we will assess how many students enroll in and attend their fall
    classes.  If students did not enroll in classes, or enrolled in classes, but
    did not attend their fall classes, we will follow up with students to better
    understand why they did not enroll or attend classes.  Once students
    complete their spring semester, we will assess again if students plan to
    enroll for their 2nd year of college.  We will communicate with students
    either via e-mail and/or phone call.  By gathering this data, the
    organization can assess the areas of weakness and strength in our program,
    and where we can make improvements.
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    Several colleges do provide some level of summer bridge programs for their
    incoming freshman.  However, those summer bridge programs are specifically
    for their students entering those colleges. And sometimes, those bridge
    programs have various eligibility requirements for students to even be
    accepted into the program.  These requirements can sometimes eliminate
    students who would benefit greatly from a summer bridge program.  What The
    Ripple Effect plans to do is provide summer bridge programs for graduating
    high school seniors, regardless of where they plan to attend college.  Our
    program would be open to any graduating high school senior who is a first
    generation students, regardless of gender, race, academic ability and/or
    socioeconomic status.  We also believe by incorporating some additional
    support services for students, like the stipend, bus passes for those
    needing reliable transportation and follow up services, we are providing a
    value added component to our programs.  
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    The Ripple Effect will be working with three partners, the Skills Foundation
    in Whittier, E.M.E.R.G.E in Los Angeles, and Fit to Play in Anaheim.  These
    3 organizations will be assisting with recruiting students, providing
    instructors for the bridge program, providing volunteers and providing
    locations for the bridge program to be held.  Each organization will receive
    $1,000 from the grant.  
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    The Ripple Effect is currently in the process of looking for other grant
    opportunities to provide these summer bridge programs.  By continuing to
    develop relationships with organizations, like E.M.E.R.G.E., the Skills
    Foundation and Fit to Play, The Ripple Effect is positioning itself to be a
    viable candidate for other grants.  Our goal is to grow the number of
    sessions we can offer to students from 2 sessions to 4 sessions.  We would
    want to keep each session at 30 students, as that is a manageable number of
    students to service in one session.
