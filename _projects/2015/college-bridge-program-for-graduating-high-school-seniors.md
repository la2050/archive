  Graduating high school seniors experience what researchers are calling "The
  Summer Melt". Summer Melt is that period between graduating high school and
  starting college, where students who are college eligible or who have already
  been accepted to college, will not enroll in classes for the fall semester.
  Recent studies by Harvard University's Center for Education Policy Research
  found that an estimated 20 percent of graduating seniors from urban school
  districts in places such as greater Boston, suburban Atlanta, Dallas and Fort
  Worth, Texas, abandon their plans to attend college over the summer. The
  Ripple Effect will create a 3-week summer bridge program for graduating high
  school seniors to address this educational concern. Focusing on first
  generation college students, the bridge program will focus on developing basic
  math and English skills, and college readiness skills (time management, study
  techniques, financial aid, creating schedule of classes, etc.). These sessions
  will be taught by an English and a math teacher, and by a college counselor.
  Students will also participate in weekly field trips to different cultural
  and/or educational events and/or locations. These field trips will be
  chaperoned by volunteers and the college counselor. We will offer 2 bridge
  sessions, with 30 students in each session. Students that successfully
  complete the program will receive a $300 stipend. We will also provide a
  monthly Metro pass for those students in need of reliable transportation.
  Beyond the bridge program, the coordinator will follow up with students during
  their first year of college. They will be responsible for assisting students
  as they navigate their various college systems. Our goal is to assist these
  1st time college students successfully make the transition into college. And
  by providing follow up services throughout the 1st year, we believe that
  students will be more likely to continue onto their 2nd year of college.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Since the target population is first generation college students, we
  understand that the process of going to college and being prepared for college
  can be overwhelming for students. At times, they will want to give up and not
  continue on with the bridge program. To overcome this barrier, every student
  that completes the 3 week program will receive a $300 stipend. The idea is to
  reward those students who remain dedicated, and persevere in completing the
  program.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We have two objectives we want to measure. (1) Can The Ripple Effect through
  the summer bridge program assist 60 young people transition into their first
  semester of college. (2) If we provide follow up services through the first
  year, how many students can we assist to be academically successful and
  persist into their 2nd year of college. After the summer bridge program is
  over, we will assess how many students enroll in and attend their fall
  classes. If students did not enroll in classes, or enrolled in classes, but
  did not attend their fall classes, we will follow up with students to better
  understand why they did not enroll or attend classes. Once students complete
  their spring semester, we will assess again if students plan to enroll for
  their 2nd year of college. We will communicate with students either via e-mail
  and/or phone call. By gathering this data, the organization can assess the
  areas of weakness and strength in our program, and where we can make
  improvements.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Several colleges do provide some level of summer bridge programs for their
  incoming freshman. However, those summer bridge programs are specifically for
  their students entering those colleges. And sometimes, those bridge programs
  have various eligibility requirements for students to even be accepted into
  the program. These requirements can sometimes eliminate students who would
  benefit greatly from a summer bridge program. What The Ripple Effect plans to
  do is provide summer bridge programs for graduating high school seniors,
  regardless of where they plan to attend college. Our program would be open to
  any graduating high school senior who is a first generation students,
  regardless of gender, race, academic ability and/or socioeconomic status. We
  also believe by incorporating some additional support services for students,
  like the stipend, bus passes for those needing reliable transportation and
  follow up services, we are providing a value added component to our programs.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  The Ripple Effect will be working with three partners, the Skills Foundation
  in Whittier, E.M.E.R.G.E in Los Angeles, and Fit to Play in Anaheim. These 3
  organizations will be assisting with recruiting students, providing
  instructors for the bridge program, providing volunteers and providing
  locations for the bridge program to be held. Each organization will receive
  $1,000 from the grant.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 â€“ how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  We believe to provide two sessions of a summer bridge program servicing 60
  students, it will cost approximately $62,000.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
  This would be expenses for 2 sessions of the bridge program, servicing a total
  of 60 students.
   
   instructors for the program  $5,000 ($40/hour)
   expenses for field trip  $7,500 (6 field trips)
   materials for students  $6,000 ($100/students)
   lunch for students  $12,600 ($7/day per student)
   buses for field trips  $3,600 (6 field trips)
   metro cards for students  $2,100 
   partners assistance  $3,000 ($1,000/partner)
   coordinator fee  $4,200 ($350/month for 12 months)
   student stipends  $18,000 ($300/student)
   TOTAL  $62,000
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  The Ripple Effect is currently in the process of looking for other grant
  opportunities to provide these summer bridge programs. By continuing to
  develop relationships with organizations, like E.M.E.R.G.E., the Skills
  Foundation and Fit to Play, The Ripple Effect is positioning itself to be a
  viable candidate for other grants. Our goal is to grow the number of sessions
  we can offer to students from 2 sessions to 4 sessions. We would want to keep
  each session at 30 students, as that is a manageable number of students to
  service in one session.
