  Graduating high school seniors experience what researchers are calling "The
  Summer Melt".  Summer Melt is that period between graduating high school and
  starting college, where students who are college eligible or who have already
  been accepted to college, will not enroll in classes for the fall semester. 
  Recent studies by Harvard University's Center for Education Policy Research
  found that an estimated 20 percent of graduating seniors from urban school
  districts in places such as greater Boston, suburban Atlanta, Dallas and Fort
  Worth, Texas, abandon their plans to attend college over the summer. The
  Ripple Effect will create a 3-week summer bridge program for graduating high
  school seniors to address this educational concern.  Focusing on first
  generation college students, the bridge program will focus on developing basic
  math and English skills, and college readiness skills (time management, study
  techniques, financial aid, creating schedule of classes, etc.).  These
  sessions will be taught by an English and a math teacher, and by a college
  counselor. Students will also participate in weekly field trips to different
  cultural and/or educational events and/or locations. These field trips will be
  chaperoned by volunteers and the college counselor.  We will offer 2 bridge
  sessions, with 30 students in each session.  Students that successfully
  complete the program will receive a $300 stipend.  We will also provide a
  monthly Metro pass for those students in need of reliable transportation. 
  Beyond the bridge program, the coordinator will follow up with students during
  their first year of college.  They will be responsible for assisting students
  as they navigate their various college systems.  Our goal is to assist these
  1st time college students successfully make the transition into college.  And
  by providing follow up services throughout the 1st year, we believe that
  students will be more likely to continue onto their 2nd year of college.   
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We have two objectives we want to measure. (1) Can The Ripple Effect through
  the summer bridge program assist 60 young people transition into their first
  semester of college.  (2) If we provide follow up services through the first
  year, how many students can we assist to be academically successful and
  persist into their 2nd year of college. After the summer bridge program is
  over, we will assess how many students enroll in and attend their fall
  classes.  If students did not enroll in classes, or enrolled in classes, but
  did not attend their fall classes, we will follow up with students to better
  understand why they did not enroll or attend classes.  Once students complete
  their spring semester, we will assess again if students plan to enroll for
  their 2nd year of college.  We will communicate with students either via
  e-mail and/or phone call.  By gathering this data, the organization can assess
  the areas of weakness and strength in our program, and where we can make
  improvements.
