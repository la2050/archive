project_summary: >-
  We would like to expand our enterprise to be able to reach more homes and
  facilities that produce compostable wasted, process more compost, sell more
  soil, and employ more people. To do this, we need more land to process waste
  and a larger fleet... Ultimately we would like to handle large amounts of the
  city's precious compostable waste that would otherwise be going to the dump.
