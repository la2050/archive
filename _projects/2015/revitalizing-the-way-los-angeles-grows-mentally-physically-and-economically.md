project_summary: >-
  Our "Green Works Project" seeks to build on existing research that shows how
  nature and built environments directly affect human health and well-being.
  Additionally, by creating local economic development and sustainable food
  chains we want to end the food deserts that plague Los Angeles. 
Please specify below: >-
  Applied Technology Center (High School); Bell Gardens High School; South Los
  Angeles elementary and high schools (TBD)

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Percentage of LA communities that are resilient: The "Green Works Project"
  creates an opportunity to gather and build upon existing data that that
  supports the theory of "Green Cities: Good Health." 
   
   Access to healthy food & obesity rates: GREENBOXFARMS can grow one acre of produce in 320 cubic feet, use 80% less water than traditional farming, and grow produce 365 days a year, regardless of climate, weather, or location.
   
   Exposure to air toxins & percentage of tree canopy cover: Our farms have vegetation both inside and out, allowing us to utilize space efficiently, improving air quality, and promote biodiversity. 
   
   Prevalence of adverse childhood experiences & rates of mental illness: In essence, GREENBOXFARMS will create healthy and resilient communities through outreach, research, and the creation of local food chains.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: |-
  One barrier we may face are zoning codes for our urban farm units. 
   
   If we face zoning issues we are ready to meet with local policy makers to show them the the physical, mental, and economic benefits of our farms. 
   
   With this knowledge, we are positive our leaders will adopt sustainable policies that will allow us to grow healthy communities.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  With the help of our partners, here are a few ways we will measure the success
  of our project:
   
   - Conduct research with students to see how their interactions with nature affect their wellbeing and habits. (Prevalence of adverse childhood experiences, rates of mental illness, access to healthy food, obesity rates, and percentage of LA communities that are resilient)
   
   - The amount of produce grown and their distribution mileage from source (Access to healthy food, percentage of LA communities that are resilient, exposure to air toxins)
   
   - Vegetation mapping (Percentage of tree canopy cover)
   
   - The percentage of locally sourced project materials (Percentage of LA communities that are resilient)
   
   - The amount of money donated to schools via produce sales (Percentage of LA communities that are resilient)
   
   These metrics will deliver insight on key issues regarding community health, sustainability, and economic development.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There are other companies that grow hydroponic produce (only two in Los
  Angeles), but what makes GREENBOXFARMS unique is that we are driven by social
  change. (People, environment, economy, and social equity)
   
   Our holistic process views the community as a whole, and connects stakeholders, students, educators, designers, and policy makers with data so we can create the healthiest place to possibly live.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  We have partnerships with high schools in the Los Angeles area. We are also in
  the process of partnering with LA based universities so they can assist in the
  research portion of our project. 
   
   The high schools will not receive direct grant money. They will receive a GREENBOXFARM on campus, along with an education program for students, and 5% of produce sales.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  Because our farms are modular, mobile, and stackable we can directly control
  how much our Green Works Project will cost. 
   
   If for any reason we need additional financial support will will seek funding from venture capitalist, local organizations, and other grant providers.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  Research & Development: $5,000
   GREENBOXFARM (individual unit): $25,000
    : $25,000
   Salaries (including benefits and tax): $44,400
   Communications: $600
   
   Total: $100,000
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  GREENBOXFARMS have a small environmental footprint and are modular, mobile,
  and stackable. Because of this design, we will be able to easily scale up by
  leveraging venture capital funds and income from produce sales.
   
   In the future we would like to create pop up grocery stores. These grocery stores would be made out of recycled shipping containers and would employ local residents.

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "One barrier we may face are zoning codes for our urban farm units. \r\n\r\nIf we face zoning issues we are ready to meet with local policy makers to show them the the physical, mental, and economic benefits of our farms. \r\n\r\nWith this knowledge, we are positive our leaders will adopt sustainable policies that will allow us to grow healthy communities."

(Prevalence of adverse childhood experiences, rates of mental illness, access to healthy food, obesity rates, and percentage of LA communities that are resilient)\r\n\r\n- The amount of produce grown and their distribution mileage from source (Access to healthy food, percentage of LA communities that are resilient, exposure to air toxins)\r\n\r\n- Vegetation mapping (Percentage of tree canopy cover)\r\n\r\n- The percentage of locally sourced project materials (Percentage of LA communities that are resilient)\r\n\r\n- The amount of money donated to schools via produce sales (Percentage of LA communities that are resilient)\r\n\r\nThese metrics will deliver insight on key issues regarding community health, sustainability, and economic development.

    answer: "GREENBOXFARMS have a small environmental footprint and are modular, mobile, and stackable. Because of this design, we will be able to easily scale up by leveraging venture capital funds and income from produce sales.\r\n\r\nIn the future we would like to create pop up grocery stores. These grocery stores would be made out of recycled shipping containers and would employ local residents."
