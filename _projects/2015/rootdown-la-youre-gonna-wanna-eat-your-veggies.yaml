title: RootDown LA - Youre Gonna Wanna Eat Your Veggies!
project_summary: >-
  South LA youth, who now run RootDown LA, know how to build demand for, and
  create supplies of fresh produce, directly in their neighborhoods. Our goal
  this year is to support these young people to begin to develop their own
  for-profit healthy food ventures, incorporating the nutrition and culinary
  educational activities they already expertly facilitate, and the produce from
  the garden networks they installed and maintain, at our South Los Angeles
  Youth-driven Neighborhood Food System sites.

Where will you be working?:
  - South LA
How do you plan to use these resources to make change?:
  - Engage residents and stakeholders
  - Implement a pilot or new project
  - Expand a pilot or a program
  - Mobilize for systems change
  - Create jobs for youth in South Los Angeles
How will your proposal improve the following “Live” metrics?:

  - Number of households below the self-sufficiency index
  - Obesity rates
  - Prevalence of adverse childhood experiences (Dream Metric)
  - Percentage of LA communities that are resilient (Dream Metric)
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  RDLA’s greatest success can be observed in the passion and commitment of our
  first program participants, who are advocates for, and now run the majority of
  our programs; five are paid employees, who train and manage the next
  generations of younger youth interns.  You can find them all online - their
  collective enthusiasm is reflected in our Facebook, Twitter and Instagram
  accounts, which they post in, regularly.  Since its inception, RDLA has used
  both formative and summative assessment methods, employing qualitative and
  quantitative tools.  We measure progress of the organization in terms of the
  depth of our partnerships in the community, and our relevance where we work,
  as is expressed by constant demand for us to increase our programming.  More
  specifically: intake/outtake surveys are used to measure our impact on program
  participants’ knowledge, behavioral change, and self-confidence relating to
  healthy food in our series classes. Focus groups capture long term change. 
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
  - Money (financial capital)
  - Volunteers/staff (human capital)
  - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
  - 'Infrastructure (building/space/vehicles, etc.)'
  - 'Technical infrastructure (computers, etc.)'
  - Community outreach
  - Network/relationship support
