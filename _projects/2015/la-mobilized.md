  LA Mobilized is an initiative to showcase how LA can change how we move, and
  how the city can change around us. With new transportation priorities, Los
  Angeles has the opportunity to evolve into a more sustainable and equitable
  city. To tap into this potential, LA needs to democratize planning so
  residents can co-create the future.
