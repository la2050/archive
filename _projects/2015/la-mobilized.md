  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "Los Angeles faces major challenges as well as opportunities to evolve into a more equitable and sustainable city. In particular, with a new mobility plan in the City of Los Angeles and transit expansion underway countywide, there is an opportunity to create more equitable places through democratic and community-based planning for active transportation, transit, and more sustainable living patterns. Like many advocates, we see the need for changes in policy, plans and the built environment. But at this point in time, the change that it perhaps most needed is increased openness to change itself-tied to more democratic and creative ways to engage residents in planning, particularly low-income, communities of color that have traditionally been locked out of decision making processes. \r\n\r\nThe project will build on the Community Alternative 7 (CA7) as a case study of how residents are democratizing planning. A coalition of environmental justice organizations based in communities impacted by pollution from goods movement in that corridor organized to create their own serious alternative to this huge infrastructure plan.  Our project will support advocacy for CA7 and we will host a training by CA7 advocates for residents interested in helping shape the future of transportation in their own areas.\r\nThe project will identify and engage residents impacted by existing or proposed freeways and transit projects, using training workshops such as the Place It! workshops that facilitate residents expressing their experience how planning and design shape how we live, and to translate their dreams and ideas into physical forms. By conducting workshops, particularly small scale workshops focused on involving youth, women, and low income residents,  the project will inspire more residents to support changes to their neighborhoods and to Los Angeles. \r\nThe project will simultaneously identify case studies of transformative city change linked to mobility to recommend policy and planning reforms that can make it easier for the City of Los Angeles to evolve. We will identify examples of activism on mobility from the Los Angeles region as well as how other cities have changed through shifts in mobility. We will showcase these on a website and in an exhibition. We will examine key procedures in the City Charter, general plan etc. that could be modified to open up more space for creative, democratic planning and the evolution of LA into a more sustainable, equitable city. "
  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "There is widespread suspicion of development, change, and planning processes- some of it warranted due to past redevelopment, displacement, sprawl, and lack of transparency- and decision making have evolved to bake suspicion, delay and a lack of transformative thinking into land use and other processes. Our strategy for overcoming this suspicion is to link the need for more democratic and creative planning with structural reforms to allow positive community initiated or supported projects to move forward and catalyze wider change. \r\n"
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: " - number of participants in workshops\r\n- number of views of project website\r\n- attendance at training and at exhibition\r\n-engagement with advocates, residents and policy makers on urban change opportunities and structural reforms\r\n"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "There are a number of organizations conducting advocacy on aspects around mobility in the LA region. Move LA works on transit expansion and transportation funding. The LA County Bike coalition, Multicultural Communities for Mobility,and LA Walks work on active transportation. Investing in Place works on transportation funding and equity. Alliance for Community Transit (ACT-LA) focuses on transit and equity. Several local coalitions work on street changing initiatives and regional environmental justice movement advocate around pollution from freight and freeways. Our approach is unique because it combines a focus on mobility with exploration of models of planning and governance reforms that can facilitate change- on transportation issues and other topics. \r\n"

  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "We will create a website as a living source of ideas for change and case studies of successful innovation, and continue to maintain the site past the initial community workshops and projects. \r\nWe will collect ideas from our workshops along with example of places around the world where change has successfully been implemented; and links to books, articles, blogs and opinions related to changing transportation and related urban change. The website will be searchable – and readable in different layers by our different audiences.\r\nWe hope that the C7 case study, ideas from Place It! workshops, examples of transportation and mobility approaches, , will point to ideas for  for planning and policy reform will add up to a wider and stronger constituency of residents seeking to affect transportation and mobility. in Los Angeles."

The LA County Bike coalition, Multicultural Communities for Mobility,and LA Walks work on active transportation. Investing in Place works on transportation funding and equity. Alliance for Community Transit (ACT-LA) focuses on transit and equity.

The website will be searchable – and readable in different layers by our different audiences.\r\nWe hope that the C7 case study, ideas from Place It! workshops, examples of transportation and mobility approaches, , will point to ideas for  for planning and policy reform will add up to a wider and stronger constituency of residents seeking to affect transportation and mobility. in Los Angeles."
