  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "LA, Inc. is reputed in the foster care industry for utilizing technology through innovative ways to increase civic engagement while serving other populations alongside. We build alliances with multiple digital and physical platforms to voice opinions, share ideas, leverage services & resources, influence elected officials, and contract with local government. \r\n\r\nOver the 20 years of service we have connected to various organizations that allows us to recruit high volumes of volunteers, receive monetary contracts and make strong partnerships, that include USC, LA Unified School District, Department Children and Family Services, County of Los Angeles Probation Department, Worksource Centers, Verizon & So Cal Gas, just to name a few. We are proud to have a sponsored CA Assembly Bill #1148 unanimously passed mandating that foster youth aging out of the system have their vital life documents. i.e. social security cards, birth certificates and a photo I.D.  By LA being the largest foster care population in the country, this will be an iterative process that will be responsive and transparent in providing these services to other populations, as we are meeting the demands for our foster youth. \r\n\r\nLA, Inc. has designed intellectual property technology platform that electronically maintains vital life documents, amongst other features such as various data collection and information management processes. The purpose is to allow disenfranchised populations access to their documents to show proof of their identity which allows service consistency and to connect to multiple services, such as, transportation, housing, medical, education, employment, voting, attend events, but not limited to. This increases civic engagement, social connectedness which meets our services goals of educational attainment, employment preparedness and self-efficacy. By allowing foster youth to connect to services, we re-connect them as self-sufficient and contributing LA citizens."

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    Bureaucracy!!! We have been overcoming bureaucracy by continuing to build
    our relationships with public agencies that have guardianship & juridical
    rights over our youth population. We are making our relationships stronger
    and stronger as we go through different service contracts and they
    understand our vision and come to realize our approach is extremely
    effective. We work together by adding support to public agencies such LAUSD
    & DFCS.  Our tactic is not to criticize or go against them; but to bring
    solutions, blood, sweat and tears to the table – ADVOCACY!  For example LA
    DFCS system has a huge under taking in being able to manage and keep approx.
    40,000 people of all races, ages and backgrounds alive at one time. People
    always say “the system is broken,” well the system is tough.  This
    transcends to diverse disenfranchised populations that have to go through
    the same systems. It is just a matter of connecting our efforts, continually
    telling our story and building capacity!!!
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    LA, Inc. has participated in several different evaluation processes due to
    the array of funding streams.  We can adapt to what will work best with
    LA2050. Our main comprehensive evaluation process was implemented and is
    conducted with our partnership with USC. It consist of: 1.) Logic Model
    Development to identify the goals, activities, services, and desired
    results; and 2.) Goals Based Evaluation Plan to focus on short term goals to
    track progress towards meeting long term goals during the project year
    (formative). The required methods of data collection and assessment will be
    incorporated with LA2050 target metrics and operating procedures that will
    be carried out on a daily, weekly, and/or monthly basis to support effective
    project management and decision making. Thus, the project's comprehensive
    evaluation plan will consist of appropriate and specific
    quantitative/qualitative measures that can be modified as needed.
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "As far as competition, there are no other organizations actually gathering and maintaining documents for foster youth to be able to access their own personal identifiable information. A feasibility report was conducted by USC for LA, Inc. that indicated there are limited resources that deal with vital life documents. Primarily, a demand and market for obtaining and securing this information does exist. However, over the years various for profit companies have charged individuals to obtain vital life documents however, they do not maintain vital life documents for people. \r\n\r\nWe are proud to say over the last 4 years of introducing our technology platform, to the HUGE bureaucracy of agencies, we have numerous awards, letters of support & certificates of recognitions. Even our national advocate for foster youth, Congresswoman Bass has endorsed the need for our program.  "
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    The current partners we have are actually contributing to the services of
    meeting the goals of the program. The collaboration with the LAUSD program
    for tutoring services, the cost to my partner is included in the contract.
    LA, Inc. is a direct service provider, meaning that the $100,000.00 goes to
    the youth we serve for their monthly metro cards, food, electronic
    communication, monthly life skills workshops, special events, computers,
    cell phones and case management for assessments and referrals to additional
    services that they need or aspire. We are known as the mother of our foster
    youth.  Since the inception of our organization, 1996 we still have former
    foster youth that come to us for different services. We have been the one
    single continuous connection they have had since being in the foster care
    system. The budget below will show the additional expenses that keep our
    foster youth and former foster youth engaged, out of trouble and motivated.
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    Using a collaborative approach we have several streams of funding to meet
    the matching requirements.  Our strong partnership with USC allows us to
    leverage countless resources, services and monetary support from different
    departments. We will also introduce this opportunity to previous LA, Inc.
    unrestricted funders such as Weingart Foundation, California Community
    Foundation, Boeing Foundation, CarMax Foundation, Southern CA Gas, and
    Verizon Foundation.  The issue with our prior unrestricted funders is that
    they base how much they fund us from our last year’s budget amounts.  After
    we re-organized from a brick and mortar service provider to a virtual
    provider our budget decreased tremendously.  We do not receive enough money
    to implement our technology platform. All other funding’s are for
    educational and employment services.  We are currently submitting a proposal
    to Annenberg Foundation and will include the LA2050 opportunity. Also, we
    are finalizing another contract with LAUSD. We can negotiate with them on
    how to leverage LA2050 requirements with the population we are servicing. 
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Please note that this is a percentage of the cost to build capacity to reach 1,000 foster youth.  Of course depending on the streams of funding percentages this will vary.
