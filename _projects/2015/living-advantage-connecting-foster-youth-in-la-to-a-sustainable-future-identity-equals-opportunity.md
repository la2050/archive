project_summary: >-
  LA, Inc. will expand our reach & give quality services to 1,000 at risk and
  foster youth in LA, who are in danger of dropping out of school, being
  unemployed, becoming homeless and incarcerated. Our approach is through
  collaboration to connect, engage & interact with LA service providers. Some
  goals… high school students will graduate on time, be college and/or career
  prepared and receive social and emotional support for higher self-esteem.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  LA, Inc. is reputed in the foster care industry for utilizing technology
  through innovative ways to increase civic engagement while serving other
  populations alongside. We build alliances with multiple digital and physical
  platforms to voice opinions, share ideas, leverage services & resources,
  influence elected officials, and contract with local government. 
   
   Over the 20 years of service we have connected to various organizations that allows us to recruit high volumes of volunteers, receive monetary contracts and make strong partnerships, that include USC, LA Unified School District, Department Children and Family Services, County of Los Angeles Probation Department, Worksource Centers, Verizon & So Cal Gas, just to name a few. We are proud to have a sponsored CA Assembly Bill #1148 unanimously passed mandating that foster youth aging out of the system have their vital life documents. i.e. social security cards, birth certificates and a photo I.D. By LA being the largest foster care population in the country, this will be an iterative process that will be responsive and transparent in providing these services to other populations, as we are meeting the demands for our foster youth. 
   
   LA, Inc. has designed intellectual property technology platform that electronically maintains vital life documents, amongst other features such as various data collection and information management processes. The purpose is to allow disenfranchised populations access to their documents to show proof of their identity which allows service consistency and to connect to multiple services, such as, transportation, housing, medical, education, employment, voting, attend events, but not limited to. This increases civic engagement, social connectedness which meets our services goals of educational attainment, employment preparedness and self-efficacy. By allowing foster youth to connect to services, we re-connect them as self-sufficient and contributing LA citizens.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Bureaucracy!!! We have been overcoming bureaucracy by continuing to build our
  relationships with public agencies that have guardianship & juridical rights
  over our youth population. We are making our relationships stronger and
  stronger as we go through different service contracts and they understand our
  vision and come to realize our approach is extremely effective. We work
  together by adding support to public agencies such LAUSD & DFCS. Our tactic is
  not to criticize or go against them; but to bring solutions, blood, sweat and
  tears to the table – ADVOCACY! For example LA DFCS system has a huge under
  taking in being able to manage and keep approx. 40,000 people of all races,
  ages and backgrounds alive at one time. People always say “the system is
  broken,” well the system is tough. This transcends to diverse disenfranchised
  populations that have to go through the same systems. It is just a matter of
  connecting our efforts, continually telling our story and building capacity!!!
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  LA, Inc. has participated in several different evaluation processes due to the
  array of funding streams. We can adapt to what will work best with LA2050. Our
  main comprehensive evaluation process was implemented and is conducted with
  our partnership with USC. It consist of: 1.) Logic Model Development to
  identify the goals, activities, services, and desired results; and 2.) Goals
  Based Evaluation Plan to focus on short term goals to track progress towards
  meeting long term goals during the project year (formative). The required
  methods of data collection and assessment will be incorporated with LA2050
  target metrics and operating procedures that will be carried out on a daily,
  weekly, and/or monthly basis to support effective project management and
  decision making. Thus, the project's comprehensive evaluation plan will
  consist of appropriate and specific quantitative/qualitative measures that can
  be modified as needed.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  As far as competition, there are no other organizations actually gathering and
  maintaining documents for foster youth to be able to access their own personal
  identifiable information. A feasibility report was conducted by USC for LA,
  Inc. that indicated there are limited resources that deal with vital life
  documents. Primarily, a demand and market for obtaining and securing this
  information does exist. However, over the years various for profit companies
  have charged individuals to obtain vital life documents however, they do not
  maintain vital life documents for people. 
   
   We are proud to say over the last 4 years of introducing our technology platform, to the HUGE bureaucracy of agencies, we have numerous awards, letters of support & certificates of recognitions. Even our national advocate for foster youth, Congresswoman Bass has endorsed the need for our program.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  The current partners we have are actually contributing to the services of
  meeting the goals of the program. The collaboration with the LAUSD program for
  tutoring services, the cost to my partner is included in the contract. LA,
  Inc. is a direct service provider, meaning that the $100,000.00 goes to the
  youth we serve for their monthly metro cards, food, electronic communication,
  monthly life skills workshops, special events, computers, cell phones and case
  management for assessments and referrals to additional services that they need
  or aspire. We are known as the mother of our foster youth. Since the inception
  of our organization, 1996 we still have former foster youth that come to us
  for different services. We have been the one single continuous connection they
  have had since being in the foster care system. The budget below will show the
  additional expenses that keep our foster youth and former foster youth
  engaged, out of trouble and motivated.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  Using a collaborative approach we have several streams of funding to meet the
  matching requirements. Our strong partnership with USC allows us to leverage
  countless resources, services and monetary support from different departments.
  We will also introduce this opportunity to previous LA, Inc. unrestricted
  funders such as Weingart Foundation, California Community Foundation, Boeing
  Foundation, CarMax Foundation, Southern CA Gas, and Verizon Foundation. The
  issue with our prior unrestricted funders is that they base how much they fund
  us from our last year’s budget amounts. After we re-organized from a brick and
  mortar service provider to a virtual provider our budget decreased
  tremendously. We do not receive enough money to implement our technology
  platform. All other funding’s are for educational and employment services. We
  are currently submitting a proposal to Annenberg Foundation and will include
  the LA2050 opportunity. Also, we are finalizing another contract with LAUSD.
  We can negotiate with them on how to leverage LA2050 requirements with the
  population we are servicing.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
  Please note that this is a percentage of the cost to build capacity to reach
  1,000 foster youth. Of course depending on the streams of funding percentages
  this will vary. We will pay wages directly for foster youth to help us on the
  LA2050 Campaign.
