  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: "Public libraries are a wonderful social invention, especially when they become dynamic centers for community, learning, reading, and connection. For the general public, and especially for neglected populations, these spaces are important for growing literacy and artistic capacities. Tia Chucha's Centro Cultural is looking forward to conducting poetry workshops that tap into the unique life stories of patrons at as many as 30 of the 72 L.A.-area libraries. We will bring to life the poetic word, the story, the book through a series of workshops, each of which will culminate in Open Mic events. \r\n\r\nTia Chucha's proceeds from the Native American/Native Mexican philosophies that all people, all animals, the earth and the sky, are inexorably connected. For indigenous peoples everything is the arts (that's why there is no word for \"arts\" among most tribes). And all human beings have an inexhaustible, abundant and creative wellspring within that can be tapped into at any time.\r\n\r\nPoetry is one of the ecstatic arts for change and is being renewed by young people today through poetry slams, Hip Hop, publishing, and digital technology. This is happening at a time when poetry in the U.S. is being highly marginalized. Even in the world’s poorest countries, poetry is honored and publicly respected. But, in the U.S, the center of culture is mostly for entertainment and commercial value.\r\n\r\nOur “Poetry is Life, Poetry is Story” workshops will draw out the storehouse of stories within persons, families, communities to remember who we are, what are our relationships, and where we are going. Poetry means \"to make,\" to shape, to find beauty, just like the earth does constantly, after one understands the truth (science) and the good (morality)--a morality which is not imposed or for the control of others, but is based on how to properly interact with all beings, all genders, all so-called races, all nations, all tribes. \r\n\r\nThe artists we will involve in this important work appreciate the need people have to see and be seen, to hear and be heard, and to nurture these experiences to the fullest. Like water and bread, they feed hearts hungry for place and meaning through story and poetry. The workshops will allow our artist facilitators to inspire new artistic voices of all ages, encouraging them to share their stories and gifts with the public. In turn these instructors will be paid for their time and talents. This poetry workshop series is a win-win proposal for everyone.\r\n"

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "One major challenge is the size of the city of L.A.-- 503 square miles. \r\n\r\nYet Luis J. Rodriguez, Tia Chucha's cofounder, has fostered poetry across the entire city. Appointed by Mayor Eric Garcetti as Poet Laureate of Los Angeles, Luis began his two year term in January 2015. Working closely with the LA Public Library and the city's Dept of Cultural Affairs, in the first six months of 2015 Luis did talks, read poetry or conducted writing workshops in some 70 events in libraries, schools, book fests, community festivals, graduations, and more, addressing around 10,000 people, and millions more through English and Spanish language media.  \r\n\r\nOur connections, beginning with Luis’s, will help us organize across the vast distance between libraries. And aside from Luis’s knowledge of the various  libraries, we are in contact with a network of librarians and workshop facilitators equally anxious to bring poetry to this public venue. All assets will be used to overcome the barrier of distance.\r\n"
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "For almost fifteen years Tia Chucha’s has been a beacon of cultural and literary inclusion in the NE San Fernando Valley. And while we have had visitors from as far away as Germany and Chile, our day-to-day reach has been primarily the local population. Our programs in Pacoima and occasional offsite booktables, student visits, and seasonal major events have also extended our reach.\r\n\r\nThe library workshops are an opportunity to take our work to the next level, placing our programming and poet artists in neighborhoods which may have never experienced our unique offerings before. Our evaluations will include how many new people we have introduced to writing poetry, the size of the audiences that come to the culmination open mics at each site, and the poet teachers we are able to employ for these special workshops. All these elements will be part of measuring the impact of our efforts."
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "Thankfully, there are others in the city who also hold the power of poetry in high regard.\r\n\r\nOne group stands out for their ability to draw from and give to the most marginalized populations through poetry. That organization is Street Poets, which works with inner-city youth through poetry expression. They organize reading events in various locations. They do recordings and workshops in schools and other community venues. They also have a performance van so that various poets can set up spontaneous (or organized) readings anywhere, anytime. \r\n\r\nGet Lit Players and Say Word are also nonprofits that work in various schools to help young people memorize classic poems for performance, and also to create their own work. We do not see ourselves in competition with Get Lit Players, Say Word, Street Poets, and similar organizations. Rather, we see ourselves as complementing and extending this work further.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, Tia Chucha's proposes to expand the scale of this poetry work to as many library locations as possible. What’s more, our unique efforts will go beyond primarily school-age youth. We will involve youth, teens, young adults, adults and elders--weaving the whole range of ages and experiences into a tapestry of stories through poetry that can help these varied generations see and hear each other in new ways through the magic of creative and courageous words. In addition, our workshops will be in both English and Spanish, which will break demographic barriers based on language. And we will of course employ diverse poetry artists in the process.\r\n\r\nWhat’s more, in March 2016, our Tia Chucha Press (which has published socially engaged cross-cultural poetry books for 27 years) will release the most comprehensive poetry anthology of LA-area poets in city history, \"Coiled Serpent: Poets Arising from the Cultural Quakes & Shifts of Los Angeles\". This new resource will be incorporated to display the poetic wealth of the city, and serve to encourage these new writers to continue developing their skills and telling their story.\r\n\r\nTia Chucha’s will use poetry and story as a doorway for a more literate, reading and writing public. We are confident that such literacy can be a true reflection of personal and community authority and authenticity. We know this to be the case because we have seen it happen through our work.\r\n"
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "We are happy to have the enthusiastic collaboration of amazing partners for this project. \r\n\r\nAs mentioned before, Luis J. Rodriguez, Tia Chucha's cofounder, award-winning author and the new Poet Laureate of L.A., is on board to help make this project a success. Again, his connections to the LA Public Library and the city's Department of Cultural Affairs will prove invaluable. His reach with huge numbers of people across the city will assist with publicity. And his knowledge of and relationship to poets and poetry will be of much use to this project. Tia Chucha’s poetry press will be a great asset as well.\r\n\r\nTo further solidify connections to libraries in the city, we are pleased to have the support of the impressively energetic L.A. chapter of REFORMA for this project. Established in 1971 as an affiliate of the American Library Association (ALA), the national organization REFORMA actively seeks to promote the development of library collections to include Spanish-language and Latino oriented materials; the recruitment of more bilingual and bicultural library professionals and support staff; the development of library services and programs that meet the needs of the Latino community, and more. For their assistance in identifying and securing the libraries where the workshops will be conducted we have allocated $10,000 from the award to REFORMA LA.\r\n \r\nIn addition, our relationship with the L.A. Poet Society will now extend to this project. This non-profit community organization works to create and bridge the creative community all over Los Angeles county and partner with literary LA. LAPS is extremely passionate about bringing literacy to underserved youth, joining efforts of bringing literary programming to diverse neighborhoods, and publishing the creatives of LA. They enjoy fiscal sponsorship through 100 Thousand Poets for Change, a global movement, uniting the world using art as a fundamental basis for peace, healing, and sustainability in all communities. We have allocated $45,000 for workshop instructors and facilitators with the majority of those funds going toward the instructors that L.A. Poet Society will be providing.   \r\n\r\nBeyond these partners, we look forward to incorporating a solid crew of poet artists who have proven their commitment to community and the arts through their years of voluntarily facilitating Tia Chucha’s open mic nights.\r\n"
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    We have budgeted the project at $100,000 and do not anticipate exceeding our
    projected budget. If in the rare case we do exceed our budget we can tap
    into our revenue generated by our bookstore sales as well as solicit
    donations and sponsorships through our Board of Directors.  
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Overhead allocation for lead organization:    $15,000\r\nProject Coordinator:                                         $20,000\r\nWorkshop Instructors and Facilitators:          $45,000\r\nPublicity and Marketing:                                  $5,000\r\nDocumentation:                                                $5,000\r\nPartner contribution (Reforma LA)                 $10,000"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "This project presents our organization with the exciting possibility of laying the foundation for a new level of creative work throughout the city of Los Angeles, both during this project and continuing afterwards. Our consistent interest in engaging and building authentic empowered communities through the arts is a matter of record. As we prepare to celebrate our fifteenth-year milestone in 2016, we are meeting with stakeholders at all levels of the organization--from board members, staff members, collaborators, facilitators, volunteers and  community members--to envision the next period of our growth, sustainability and relevance to the community we serve. \r\n\r\nThis examination of our trajectory includes reimagining the boundaries of who and where that community exists, and how we can collectively reach it. The need to infuse the arts into a whole new myriad of community spaces and activities is essential to revitalizing the discussion of what it means to be alive, creative and present in the world. Our surroundings and relationships reveal the need for new ideas, new ways of solving our common problems and of appreciating our shared dreams. The prospect of putting the full creative weight of the arts and artists into the mix to make a real difference citywide is worth contributing our gifts to and supporting.\r\n\r\nThis project is expressive of our desire to move this work further along these lines, now and in the future.\r\n\r\nBecause of the unique approach of community engagement through this project we have begun to identify other foundations that have this as their funding priorities such as the James Irvine Foundation and their Exploring Engagement Fund Grant. We also hope that this project can be a catalyst to bring together many more collaborators around Los Angeles who are doing great work around poetry and expand the partnership to potentially develop a city-wide crowdsourcing campaign to expand the work to a larger scale.
