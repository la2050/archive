  Bresee will make LA the best place to play by transforming an underutilized
  parking lot into a state-of-the-art multi-sport facility. Bresee’s Safe Place
  to Play Multi-Sport Court will provide over 2,500 youth and families in
  Central Los Angeles with healthy physical activity, safe alternatives to gang
  involvement, and positive youth development. Bresee’s two side-by side sport
  courts will be used for basketball, soccer, adult community leagues, zumba
  classes, and community events.
   
   Bresee serves people living in Central Los Angeles. President Obama recently identified Bresee’s underserved urban area as one of the first five national “Promise Zones,” due to the high level of economic need. Youth in Bresee’s Central Los Angeles Sports programs face underperforming schools with dropout rates at 40%, high rates of gang violence and drug use (with youth indicating that they “often face intimidation from gang members”) and 60% of individuals are overweight or obese. Understanding the value of sports in preventing childhood obesity, protecting students from gang involvement, and teaching important lessons in teamwork and character, Bresee’s program offers a variety of free services to youth and adults, with an emphasis on youth development
   
   By transforming Bresee’s underutilized parking lot into a state-of-the-art multi-sport facility, Bresee will provide over 2,500 youth and families with:
   
   1. YOUTH DEVELOPMENT AND COMPETITIVE LEAGUES: Over 600 youth (ages 11-18) will be trained through ongoing competitive soccer and basketball leagues and recreational sports. Students will not only improve their athletic skills and physical health but also learn character, discipline and sportsmanship. 
   2. ADULT LEAGUES: Bresee will foster healthy community among 140 local adults through evening league play. 
   3. LAFC YOUTH LEADERSHIP ACADEMY: Bresee will replicate its successful South Los Angeles LAFC program at its Central Los Angeles community center. LAFC is a unique partnership between the Los Angles Police Department 77th Division, schools, non-profits, and collegiate/professional soccer players. Bresee’s Central LA LAFC will train and mentor 15 at-risk high schoolers to conduct soccer training and organize soccer clinics for over 300 neighborhood youth annually.
   4. FAMILY EVENTS: Bresee will provide 1,000 family members with free activities (movie nights, zumba) that increase interaction between family members of different generations.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Bresee does not anticipate that any factors may interfere with achieving its
  desired objectives. With over 25 years of youth education and enrichment
  program experience, Bresee has been able to overcome challenges as they come
  without it affecting the overall effectiveness of its programs.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Bresee’s Athletics Director, Sports Coordinator, and LAFC Director evaluate
  work through maintaining attendance using Bresee’s customized internal
  database, administering pre-/post-tests, collecting report cards, and
  collecting testimonials showing qualitative impact. Relevant data is reviewed
  quarterly to ensure progress and completion of objectives. 
   
   However, the true measure of Bresee’s success will be the youth who overcome risk factors, pursuing their education, achieving their potential and learning the value of service. Carlos, a 12 year old who was struggling in school but fell in love with soccer at Bresee, exemplifies this: “Bresee’s soccer program taught me the pillars of character: responsibility, respect, citizenship, caring, fairness, and trustworthiness. I began using them at home, school and Bresee. Bresee taught me how to work hard to achieve my goals. My goals are to go to college, become a soccer player, and be a good role model to my five siblings.”
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Though there are organizations that provide sport leagues in the Central Los
  Angeles community, Bresee differs from them in three ways. First, Bresee
  provides free programming, in comparison with other agencies that provide
  soccer and basketball programming at a fee which the low-income youth Bresee
  serves cannot afford. Second, Bresee’s sport leagues emphasize character and
  leadership development in all aspects of practice and competitive play.
  Programs instill character using the Character Counts curriculum and address
  health issues and juvenile delinquency using the US Soccer and Pure Game
  Curriculum. Lastly, Bresee’s Safe Place to Play Multi-Sport Court programming
  takes place in the context of a holistic afterschool setting, where sports
  leagues, youth development programs, and family activities are offered in
  conjunction with programs in Academics, Career-readiness, STEM, Arts, Service,
  Family Services, and Gang Prevention. 
   
   Bresee’s approach is unique in that it provides mentors and coaches who model and teach character and leadership, giving students who might otherwise seek role models from gangs a positive alternative. In addition, Bresee offers opportunity for healthy physical activity and exceptional soccer and basketball training, improving physical health and developing students’ identities as athletes. It also provides paid leadership opportunities as interns, creating jobs for young people and building the next generation of community change agents. Lastly, it connects family members across different generations by providing activities including zumba, family movie nights, and community sports leagues.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Bresee’s has forged key partnerships with local stakeholders and community
  organizations including: 
   
   • CENTRAL CITY BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION, provides Bresee youth with a competitive basketball experience playing against other local agencies including HOLA, Casa de Amigos, YMCA, and Salvation Army. 
   • YOUTH PREMIER SOCCER LEAGUE, Bresee’s indoor and outdoor soccer teams compete against AJAX, Virgil Middle School, and Children’s Institute.
   • LAPD 77TH DIVISION, provides at least one officer at designated LAFC events, assists with community outreach, and provides leadership and character development during LAFC’s summer training. LAFC youth leaders conduct soccer clinics at 77th Division for the participants LAPD Cadet Community Youth Programs.
   • Los Angeles newest soccer team MLS LAFC, UCLA, USC, CSU Northridge, Loyola Marymount, Colorado Rapids player James Riley and MLS player Mike Lahoud, provide guest coaches and access to professional/collegiate level games. 
   • Pure Game provides the STAR & SOCCER character and education curriculum for soccer leaders. This curriculum teaches youth positive values through the sport of soccer and supports Bresee with its goal of developing character-driven leaders who will transform Los Angeles.
   
   In order to provide services that equip Bresee’s young athletes to excel in sports and in life, Bresee partners with the Wilshire FamilySource Center to provide afterschool youth programs and wrap around family services. Bresee works closely with Virgil Middle School, Belmont High School, Miguel Contreras Learning Complex, Camino Nuevo High School, and Central City Value High School to recruit students for its athletics programs. 
   
   All of Bresee’s community partners are unpaid volunteers with the exception of Pure Game. Bresee will provide Pure Game with $10,000 to equip Bresee's staff and high school interns with training on the STAR & SOCCER character and education curriculum.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  The total budget for Bresee’s multi-sport safe place to play is $194,160.
  Bresee has secured $14,500 through in-kind support, $73,730 from the Finish
  Line Youth Foundation, $15,000 from KaBoom!/ US Soccer Foundation, and $10,000
  from ESPN, Inc. Fundraising expenses are covered through Bresee’s existing
  general operating support grants from foundation’s including The Rose Hills
  Foundation ($50,000), and The Ralph M. Parsons Foundation ($75,000). 
   
   Bresee will cover additional costs through its diversified portfolio of funders. Bresee operates on a $1.8 million budget annually, with more than 80% of operating expenses allocated directly to programs. Of its annual budget, 50% is funded by foundation grants, 40% by government grants, and 10% by individual donors and events. Through an auction, sponsorships, and donations at the annual Dinner & Auction event, Bresee is able to raise unrestricted funds for its programs. In 2014, this event raised over $150,000. Bresee is also supported by a diverse board, which raised over $250,000 in 2014, over $90,000 more than 2013, demonstrating increasing fundraising capacities. Last year, 100% of Bresee’s 13 board members contributed financially to Bresee. Bresee maintains regular contact with stakeholders and individual donors through annual reports, website, social media, bi-monthly mail appeals, and e-newsletters. Bresee’s development team continues to focus on writing grants and seeking new funding sources, specifically including funders interested in programs in the South Los Angeles area. Bresee’s demonstrated ability to secure matching funds is evident in that it raised over $900,000 in foundation and corporate support in 2014.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
  Bresee respectfully requests $100,000 to allocate towards the completion of it
  Safe Place to Play Multi-Sport Court and program related costs. Below are the
  budget justifications:
   
   Personnel: Bresee will hire a part-time Sports Coordinator ($25,000) to coordinate all sport court programming. Bresee will also employ a part-time LAFC Director ($25,000) to replicate and oversee Bresee’s Central Los Angeles LAFC program. Bresee will provide 15 high school interns with a stipend of $1,000 each ($15,000 total).
   
   Program Supplies: Bresee will purchase basketball backboard extensions ($10,000), and two scoreboards ($5,000). Other programmatic materials include athletic equipment ($5,000), and audiovisual equipment ($3,000) to facilitate Family Movie Nights, and Zumba classes.
   
   Training: Pure Game will provide training on Curriculum ($10,000).
   
   Maintenance: Spray washing and sweeping the court surface and any other maintenance related costs ($2,000).
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Bresee plans to scale the success of its Safe Place to Play Multi-Sport Court
  by serving as a model for KaBoom! and the US Soccer Foundation’s Lets Play
  Initiative, which seeks to transform underutilized spaces in underserved
  neighborhoods into designated places to play. This will allow Bresee to lead
  the way in creating safe places where youth and families have access to
  healthy physical activity, safe alternatives to gang involvement, and positive
  youth development activities.
   
   Additionally, Bresee is currently seeking to partner with the new Major League Soccer Team LAFC to replicating its sports programming in other high need areas of Los Angeles including East Los Angeles, West Los Angeles, South Los Angeles, Pacoima, Mar Vista, and Venice. Lastly, Bresee envisions current program participants returning as college graduates to expand services to other areas in Los Angeles and to continue Bresee’s track record of creating the next generation of community leaders.

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Bresee will make LA the best place to play by transforming an underutilized parking lot into a state-of-the-art multi-sport facility. Bresee’s Safe Place to Play Multi-Sport Court will provide over 2,500 youth and families in Central Los Angeles with healthy physical activity, safe alternatives to gang involvement, and positive youth development. Bresee’s two side-by side sport courts will be used for basketball, soccer, adult community leagues, zumba classes, and community events.\r\n\r\nBresee serves people living in Central Los Angeles. President Obama recently identified Bresee’s underserved urban area as one of the first five national “Promise Zones,” due to the high level of economic need. Youth in Bresee’s Central Los Angeles Sports programs face underperforming schools with dropout rates at 40%, high rates of gang violence and drug use (with youth indicating that they “often face intimidation from gang members”) and 60% of individuals are overweight or obese. Understanding the value of sports in preventing childhood obesity, protecting students from gang involvement, and teaching important lessons in teamwork and character, Bresee’s program offers a variety of free services to youth and adults, with an emphasis on youth development\r\n\r\nBy transforming Bresee’s underutilized parking lot into a state-of-the-art multi-sport facility, Bresee will provide over 2,500 youth and families with:\r\n\r\n1.\tYOUTH DEVELOPMENT AND COMPETITIVE LEAGUES: Over 600 youth (ages 11-18) will be trained through ongoing competitive soccer and basketball leagues and recreational sports. Students will not only improve their athletic skills and physical health but also learn character, discipline and sportsmanship.  \r\n2.\tADULT LEAGUES: Bresee will foster healthy community among 140 local adults through evening league play. \r\n3.\tLAFC YOUTH LEADERSHIP ACADEMY: Bresee will replicate its successful South Los Angeles LAFC program at its Central Los Angeles community center. LAFC is a unique partnership between the Los Angles Police Department 77th Division, schools, non-profits, and collegiate/professional soccer players. Bresee’s Central LA LAFC will train and mentor 15 at-risk high schoolers to conduct soccer training and organize soccer clinics for over 300 neighborhood youth annually.\r\n4.\tFAMILY EVENTS: Bresee will provide 1,000 family members with free activities (movie nights, zumba) that increase interaction between family members of different generations. \r\n"

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      Bresee does not anticipate that any factors may interfere with achieving
      its desired objectives. With over 25 years of youth education and
      enrichment program experience, Bresee has been able to overcome challenges
      as they come without it affecting the overall effectiveness of its
      programs.
  - name: Please explain how you will evaluate your work.
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Bresee’s Athletics Director, Sports Coordinator, and LAFC Director evaluate work through maintaining attendance using Bresee’s customized internal database, administering pre-/post-tests, collecting report cards, and collecting testimonials showing qualitative impact. Relevant data is reviewed quarterly to ensure progress and completion of objectives.  \r\n\r\nHowever, the true measure of Bresee’s success will be the youth who overcome risk factors, pursuing their education, achieving their potential and learning the value of service. Carlos, a 12 year old who was struggling in school but fell in love with soccer at Bresee, exemplifies this: “Bresee’s soccer program taught me the pillars of character: responsibility, respect, citizenship, caring, fairness, and trustworthiness. I began using them at home, school and Bresee. Bresee taught me how to work hard to achieve my goals. My goals are to go to college, become a soccer player, and be a good role model to my five siblings.” \r\n"
  - name: >-
      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Though there are organizations that provide sport leagues in the Central Los Angeles community, Bresee differs from them in three ways. First, Bresee provides free programming, in comparison with other agencies that provide soccer and basketball programming at a fee which the low-income youth Bresee serves cannot afford. Second, Bresee’s sport leagues emphasize character and leadership development in all aspects of practice and competitive play. Programs instill character using the Character Counts curriculum and address health issues and juvenile delinquency using the US Soccer and Pure Game Curriculum. Lastly, Bresee’s Safe Place to Play Multi-Sport Court programming takes place in the context of a holistic afterschool setting, where sports leagues, youth development programs, and family activities are offered in conjunction with programs in Academics, Career-readiness, STEM, Arts, Service, Family Services, and Gang Prevention. \r\n\r\nBresee’s approach is unique in that it provides mentors and coaches who model and teach character and leadership, giving students who might otherwise seek role models from gangs a positive alternative. In addition, Bresee offers opportunity for healthy physical activity and exceptional soccer and basketball training, improving physical health and developing students’ identities as athletes. It also provides paid leadership opportunities as interns, creating jobs for young people and building the next generation of community change agents. Lastly, it connects family members across different generations by providing activities including zumba, family movie nights, and community sports leagues. \r\n"

      receive?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Bresee’s has forged key partnerships with local stakeholders and community organizations including: \r\n\r\n• CENTRAL CITY BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION, provides Bresee youth with a competitive basketball experience playing against other local agencies including HOLA, Casa de Amigos, YMCA, and Salvation Army.  \r\n• YOUTH PREMIER SOCCER LEAGUE, Bresee’s indoor and outdoor soccer teams compete against AJAX, Virgil Middle School, and Children’s Institute.\r\n• LAPD 77TH DIVISION, provides at least one officer at designated LAFC events, assists with community outreach, and provides leadership and character development during LAFC’s summer training. LAFC youth leaders conduct soccer clinics at 77th Division for the participants LAPD Cadet Community Youth Programs.\r\n• Los Angeles newest soccer team MLS LAFC, UCLA, USC, CSU Northridge, Loyola Marymount, Colorado Rapids player James Riley and MLS player Mike Lahoud, provide guest coaches and access to professional/collegiate level games. \r\n• Pure Game provides the STAR & SOCCER character and education curriculum for soccer leaders. This curriculum teaches youth positive values through the sport of soccer and supports Bresee with its goal of developing character-driven leaders who will transform Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nIn order to provide services that equip Bresee’s young athletes to excel in sports and in life, Bresee partners with the Wilshire FamilySource Center to provide afterschool youth programs and wrap around family services. Bresee works closely with Virgil Middle School, Belmont High School, Miguel Contreras Learning Complex, Camino Nuevo High School, and Central City Value High School to recruit students for its athletics programs. \r\n\r\nAll of Bresee’s community partners are unpaid volunteers with the exception of Pure Game. Bresee will provide Pure Game with $10,000 to equip Bresee's staff and high school interns with training on the STAR & SOCCER character and education curriculum.\r\n"

      How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you
      cover the additional costs?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "The total budget for Bresee’s multi-sport safe place to play is $194,160. Bresee has secured $14,500 through in-kind support, $73,730 from the Finish Line Youth Foundation, $15,000 from KaBoom!/ US Soccer Foundation, and $10,000 from ESPN, Inc. Fundraising expenses are covered through Bresee’s existing general operating support grants from foundation’s including The Rose Hills Foundation ($50,000), and The Ralph M. Parsons Foundation ($75,000). \r\n\r\nBresee will cover additional costs through its diversified portfolio of funders. Bresee operates on a $1.8 million budget annually, with more than 80% of operating expenses allocated directly to programs. Of its annual budget, 50% is funded by foundation grants, 40% by government grants, and 10% by individual donors and events. Through an auction, sponsorships, and donations at the annual Dinner & Auction event, Bresee is able to raise unrestricted funds for its programs. In 2014, this event raised over $150,000. Bresee is also supported by a diverse board, which raised over $250,000 in 2014, over $90,000 more than 2013, demonstrating increasing fundraising capacities. Last year, 100% of Bresee’s 13 board members contributed financially to Bresee. Bresee maintains regular contact with stakeholders and individual donors through annual reports, website, social media, bi-monthly mail appeals, and e-newsletters. Bresee’s development team continues to focus on writing grants and seeking new funding sources, specifically including funders interested in programs in the South Los Angeles area. Bresee’s demonstrated ability to secure matching funds is evident in that it raised over $900,000 in foundation and corporate support in 2014.\r\n"

    answer: "Bresee plans to scale the success of its Safe Place to Play Multi-Sport Court by serving as a model for KaBoom! and the US Soccer Foundation’s Lets Play Initiative, which seeks to transform underutilized spaces in underserved neighborhoods into designated places to play. This will allow Bresee to lead the way in creating safe places where youth and families have access to healthy physical activity, safe alternatives to gang involvement, and positive youth development activities.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Bresee is currently seeking to partner with the new Major League Soccer Team LAFC to replicating its sports programming in other high need areas of Los Angeles including East Los Angeles, West Los Angeles, South Los Angeles, Pacoima, Mar Vista, and Venice. Lastly, Bresee envisions current program participants returning as college graduates to expand services to other areas in Los Angeles and to continue Bresee’s track record of creating the next generation of community leaders.\r\n"
