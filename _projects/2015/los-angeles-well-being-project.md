  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "As a former board member of the City of Los Angeles' Neighborhood Council system that implemented the first Health & Wellness committee, one major challenge is the “education/awareness” around the subject matter of “well-being”.  The vast majority at this time defines “health & wellness” as issues related strictly to physical exercise, smoking, and diet.  Yet the term well-being reflects a holistic range across ten (10) values which include: health, access to education/culture & arts, governance, community vitality, time balance, work, psychological/financial well-being, social support and environment.  \r\n\r\nWe are currently at the tipping point of making this game-changing shift and winning the LA 2050 Grants Challenge will help to overcome this challenge coupled with a clever messaging campaign that would educate the public on this multifaceted subject matter in the most simple and catchy phrase."
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "The Los Angeles Wellbeing Project’s Vision 80 will be evaluated based on a single index ranging from 0 to 100 with the goal to exceed 80 based on the data collected from respondents from the Gross National Happiness Index surveys.  An example of the output that this methodology can provide can be seen at the website: http://www.happycity.us/los-angeles.html\r\n\r\nIn order to work in conjunction with the goals set forth by LA 2050, our “Los Angeles Wellbeing Project’s Vision 80” will aim to target meeting those goals by 2050. \r\n"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "In 2013, the City of Santa Monica was awarded $1 million from Bloomberg Philanthropies to launch the \"Santa Monica Wellbeing Project\" (http://wellbeing.smgov.net/about/wellbeing-project).  HappyCity Los Angeles will work collaboratively with the team to adopt its methodology to expand the work beyond Santa Monica to the Greater Los Angeles.    \r\n\r\nOur approach will be unique in that the goal would be to expand the work in the future to other cities across the U.S. with Los Angeles leading the way via the outcomes from the \"Los Angeles Well-Being Project\". \r\n "
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.

  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    We would use the funding that the City of Santa Monica was granted of $1M as
    our benchmark to accomplish a project of this magnitude but will attempt to
    complete the project without outsourcing the work to other consultants (i.e.
    RAND Corporation) in order to reduce the costs.  In doing so, we will likely
    be able lower the cost by 25-35% and rather than creating our own technology
    platforms to use as tools for the data collection, we will use a low cost or
    free platform such as those offered from Google and/or partner with
    organizations such as the Happiness Alliance to use their resources to
    reduce the overall technical infrastructure costs of the project.  Any
    amount that is over $100,000 will be raised via crowdfunding specifically
    designed for nonprofits (i.e. GiveGab).
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "A detailed budget can be found at the Google Spreadsheet link provided below: \r\n\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NlSxpaZcIcYF8BB0-WjixGPDWBHK2GvsxESKmNM0ozA/edit#gid=0"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "The Los Angeles Well-Being Project will  be designed to be able to scale to other cities across the U.S. via its technology infrastructure.   HappyCity also has volunteer hosts in other cities and has a goal to expand to 10 cities by March 2016, all which would adopt the methodology that will be developed through this project.\r\n\r\n"
