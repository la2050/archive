  "Let's remember that happiness is a powerful tool for improving health.
  Creating more happiness in our lives and the lives of the people around us can
  be one of the most important steps we can take to creating a healthier and
  stronger world" – U.S. Surgeon General, Dr. Vivek Murthy
  (https://youtu.be/8AMcNQKeKpg)
   
   The Los Angeles Well-being Project’s Vision 80 is a strategy to measure and improve our current state of well-being to lead us toward health, rather than sickness – while shifting toward resilience, healthy, and equitable mobility for all. First implemented in Bhutan in 2010 with the concept that was introduced in the 1970s, Vision 80 is intended on gaining momentum in major cities across the U.S. 
   
   The concept implies that sustainable development should take a holistic approach towards notions of progress and give equal importance to non-economic aspects of well-being. Furthermore, the concept has been explained by its four pillars: good governance, sustainable socio-economic development, cultural preservation, and environmental conservation. 
   
   The process to make Los Angeles the healthiest place to live will be examined through the lens of exploring our well-being by first defining what Los Angeles needs to thrive, then to get the data that would show how Los Angeles measures up and lastly by getting the community and government leaders together to take action on what is needed to make the improvement.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  As a former board member of the City of Los Angeles' Neighborhood Council
  system that implemented the first Health & Wellness committee, one major
  challenge is the “education/awareness” around the subject matter of
  “well-being”. The vast majority at this time defines “health & wellness” as
  issues related strictly to physical exercise, smoking, and diet. Yet the term
  well-being reflects a holistic range across ten (10) values which include:
  health, access to education/culture & arts, governance, community vitality,
  time balance, work, psychological/financial well-being, social support and
  environment. 
   
   We are currently at the tipping point of making this game-changing shift and winning the LA 2050 Grants Challenge will help to overcome this challenge coupled with a clever messaging campaign that would educate the public on this multifaceted subject matter in the most simple and catchy phrase.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  The Los Angeles Wellbeing Project’s Vision 80 will be evaluated based on a
  single index ranging from 0 to 100 with the goal to exceed 80 based on the
  data collected from respondents from the Gross National Happiness Index
  surveys. An example of the output that this methodology can provide can be
  seen at the website: http://www.happycity.us/los-angeles.html
   
   In order to work in conjunction with the goals set forth by LA 2050, our “Los Angeles Wellbeing Project’s Vision 80” will aim to target meeting those goals by 2050.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  In 2013, the City of Santa Monica was awarded $1 million from Bloomberg
  Philanthropies to launch the "Santa Monica Wellbeing Project"
  (http://wellbeing.smgov.net/about/wellbeing-project). HappyCity Los Angeles
  will work collaboratively with the team to adopt its methodology to expand the
  work beyond Santa Monica to the Greater Los Angeles. 
   
   Our approach will be unique in that the goal would be to expand the work in the future to other cities across the U.S. with Los Angeles leading the way via the outcomes from the "Los Angeles Well-Being Project".
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  A 20% allocation of the $100,000 grant award is currently estimated for our
  partners. 
   
   USC Dornsife Department of Psychology, Los Angeles Promise Zones Project (a White House initiative in collaboration with the U.S. Dept of Housing & Urban Development & Youth Policy Institute), Office of Mayor Eric Garcetti (Sustainable City pLAn & Plan for a Healthy Los Angeles), City of Los Angeles Neighborhood Councils, City of Santa Monica (Santa Monica Wellbeing Project), RAND Corporation, the New Economics Foundation, Centre for Bhutan Studies & GNH Research and the United Nations (17 Sustainable Development Goals), Rockefeller Foundation's 100 Resilient Cities campaign and more.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  We would use the funding that the City of Santa Monica was granted of $1M as
  our benchmark to accomplish a project of this magnitude but will attempt to
  complete the project without outsourcing the work to other consultants (i.e.
  RAND Corporation) in order to reduce the costs. In doing so, we will likely be
  able lower the cost by 25-35% and rather than creating our own technology
  platforms to use as tools for the data collection, we will use a low cost or
  free platform such as those offered from Google and/or partner with
  organizations such as the Happiness Alliance to use their resources to reduce
  the overall technical infrastructure costs of the project. Any amount that is
  over $100,000 will be raised via crowdfunding specifically designed for
  nonprofits (i.e. GiveGab).
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-

   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NlSxpaZcIcYF8BB0-WjixGPDWBHK2GvsxESKmNM0ozA/edit#gid=0
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  The Los Angeles Well-Being Project will be designed to be able to scale to
  other cities across the U.S. via its technology infrastructure. HappyCity also
  has volunteer hosts in other cities and has a goal to expand to 10 cities by
  March 2016, all which would adopt the methodology that will be developed
  through this project.

    explanation: ''
    answer: "\"Let's remember that happiness is a powerful tool for improving health. Creating more happiness in our lives and the lives of the people around us can be one of the most important steps we can take to creating a healthier and stronger world\" – U.S. Surgeon General, Dr. Vivek Murthy (https://youtu.be/8AMcNQKeKpg)\r\n\r\nThe Los Angeles Well-being Project’s Vision 80 is a strategy to measure and improve our current state of well-being to lead us toward health, rather than sickness – while shifting toward resilience, healthy, and equitable mobility for all.  First implemented in Bhutan in 2010 with the concept that was introduced in the 1970s, Vision 80 is intended on gaining momentum in major cities across the U.S. \r\n\r\nThe concept implies that sustainable development should take a holistic approach towards notions of progress and give equal importance to non-economic aspects of well-being.  Furthermore, the concept has been explained by its four pillars: good governance, sustainable socio-economic development, cultural preservation, and environmental conservation.  \r\n\r\nThe process to make Los Angeles the healthiest place to live will be examined through the lens of exploring our well-being by first defining what Los Angeles needs to thrive, then to get the data that would show how Los Angeles measures up and lastly by getting the community and government leaders together to take action on what is needed to make the improvement.  \r\n"

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "As a former board member of the City of Los Angeles' Neighborhood Council system that implemented the first Health & Wellness committee, one major challenge is the “education/awareness” around the subject matter of “well-being”.  The vast majority at this time defines “health & wellness” as issues related strictly to physical exercise, smoking, and diet.  Yet the term well-being reflects a holistic range across ten (10) values which include: health, access to education/culture & arts, governance, community vitality, time balance, work, psychological/financial well-being, social support and environment.  \r\n\r\nWe are currently at the tipping point of making this game-changing shift and winning the LA 2050 Grants Challenge will help to overcome this challenge coupled with a clever messaging campaign that would educate the public on this multifaceted subject matter in the most simple and catchy phrase."
  - name: Please explain how you will evaluate your work.
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "The Los Angeles Wellbeing Project’s Vision 80 will be evaluated based on a single index ranging from 0 to 100 with the goal to exceed 80 based on the data collected from respondents from the Gross National Happiness Index surveys.  An example of the output that this methodology can provide can be seen at the website: http://www.happycity.us/los-angeles.html\r\n\r\nIn order to work in conjunction with the goals set forth by LA 2050, our “Los Angeles Wellbeing Project’s Vision 80” will aim to target meeting those goals by 2050. \r\n"

    answer: "In 2013, the City of Santa Monica was awarded $1 million from Bloomberg Philanthropies to launch the \"Santa Monica Wellbeing Project\" (http://wellbeing.smgov.net/about/wellbeing-project).  HappyCity Los Angeles will work collaboratively with the team to adopt its methodology to expand the work beyond Santa Monica to the Greater Los Angeles.    \r\n\r\nOur approach will be unique in that the goal would be to expand the work in the future to other cities across the U.S. with Los Angeles leading the way via the outcomes from the \"Los Angeles Well-Being Project\". \r\n "

      How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you
      cover the additional costs?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      We would use the funding that the City of Santa Monica was granted of $1M
      as our benchmark to accomplish a project of this magnitude but will
      attempt to complete the project without outsourcing the work to other
      consultants (i.e. RAND Corporation) in order to reduce the costs.  In
      doing so, we will likely be able lower the cost by 25-35% and rather than
      creating our own technology platforms to use as tools for the data
      collection, we will use a low cost or free platform such as those offered
      from Google and/or partner with organizations such as the Happiness
      Alliance to use their resources to reduce the overall technical
      infrastructure costs of the project.  Any amount that is over $100,000
      will be raised via crowdfunding specifically designed for nonprofits (i.e.
      GiveGab).
