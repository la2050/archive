project_summary: >-
  Building on the success of the first of a two-year pilot, we’ll recruit a
  second group of young people from LA County – those underrepresented in local
  public leadership, such as young women, young people of color, and LGBTQ youth
  – and train them using the Front Line Leaders Academy’s leadership development
  model to take on greater civic participation roles. We’ll also provide support
  to the first cohort of young leaders trained last year as they continue
  community service.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Front Line Leaders Academy – Los Angeles (FLLA-LA) will train 20 young leaders
  dedicated to creating lasting change in their communities throughout Los
  Angeles County. FLLA-LA covers a wide range of civic participation leadership
  skills: how to be an effective campaign manager, finance director,
  communications director, field organizer, and even candidate. FLLA-LA equips
  young people with the skills and confidence to become effective leaders, and
  prepares them to work on a campaign in any capacity as well as to assume key
  roles in non-profits, local government, and community leadership. In the
  application and selection process, we look for applicants who are committed
  and have the potential to create change in their communities – now and over
  the long-term.
   
   Participants in the inaugural 2014 FLLA-LA are making strides toward many CONNECT metrics outlined in LA2050. Fellows return to their communities with the ability to increase participation in neighborhood councils through traditional organizing; one FLLA-LA alumni hosted a community event focused on uplifting the concerns of men and boys of color. Fellows also return with an ability to impact government’s responsiveness to citizen needs; an FLLA-LA graduate organized a meeting with the Mayor of Los Angeles to discuss concerns of his neighborhood and community members. Another FLLA-LA graduate interviewed Los Angeles city officials on the “digital divide” and discussed the unequal access to technology among Angelinos. Fellows also work toward improving rates of volunteerism and community involvement; an FLLA-LA graduate facilitated a conference to 140 low-income and first-generation high school students encouraging civic participation. Another graduate facilitated a “Chicano Youth Leadership Conference” to 140-low-income and first-generation high school students on the topic of civic participation.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  PFAW Foundation traditionally focuses on national youth leadership development
  programs. Thus, a primary challenge is recruiting for and within the specific
  community of Los Angeles. To overcome this, we have worked since 2014 building
  partnerships with like-minded organizations and individuals in LA County in
  our effort to recruit and identify the most promising young leaders for
  FLLA-LA. We are already benefiting from partnerships in tangible ways: we
  received over 60 applications this year from young people who were referred to
  us by a partner organization, young elected official, or FLLA alumnus. We are
  especially seeking to recruit people traditionally marginalized from the
  political process and underrepresented in public leadership, including young
  women, young people of color, and LGBTQ youth. Through partnerships, we will
  not only train a class of young leaders, but we will also bring resources,
  support, and connections to these leaders beyond their eight-month fellowship.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  -Recruit a group of 15-20 diverse young leaders from Los Angeles County – with
  an emphasis on youth traditionally marginalized from the political process and
  underrepresented in public leadership, including young women, young people of
  color, and LGBTQ youth on people of color and women – to participate in the
  second pilot local Front Line Leaders Academy.
   
   -Train the 15-20 young Los Angeles-based leaders in the areas of candidacy, management, finance, communications, and field which will culminate in their developing a mock individual, district-specific “campaign” plan.
   
   -Cultivate relationships with Los Angeles based partner organizations and recruit and train members of the Young Elected Officials Network to facilitate FLLA in-person trainings and ongoing opportunities to build relationships and skills outside the formal training space.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Unlike other similar training programs that provide instruction over the
  course of one weekend, Front Line Leaders Academy (FLLA) commits to an
  intensive training, over the course of six months. The training takes place
  during four in-person weekends using a retreat-style format. Training done in
  this style with a small group gives FLLA participants – whether they all come
  from the same geographical region or reflect a national scope – an opportunity
  to form bonds with other like-minded emerging leaders and to develop a
  built-in network of other progressive leaders, key factors carrying out
  successful social justice work. With the FLLA-Los Angeles pilot, in
  particular, participants are able to establish and build a network of
  knowledgeable young progressive leaders who live and work in the same
  community. 
   
   The curriculum of FLLA’s six-month training emphasizes a broad range of competencies required for young leaders to assume key roles in campaigns or nonprofits, or as candidates. The “candidacy” training (what it means to be a candidate) helps fellows to connect their personal stories to their long-term goals, as they consider whether they would run for an elected office or contribute toward developing other leaders within their communities. Preparing a field campaign, another critical area, emphasizes developing a comprehensive understanding about what running in a campaign entails, the importance of voter contact, data management, recurring and retaining volunteers, and educating and mobilizing volunteers. On the finance side, fellows explore the various aspects of creating a financial plan for a campaign and how to identify potential donors. Examining the nuts and bolts of developing a communications plan is the fourth key area. The final focus area is campaign management, where fellows learn best practices on how to manage people and projects. 
   
   All FLLA participants are required to complete an individual mock “campaign” plan, and in the case of the LA fellows, their plan is district-specific. This plan is one of the most tangible outcomes of Front Line Leaders Academy and it is based on assignments completed by fellows throughout the Academy, through which they apply the skills gained through the weekend trainings. After completing each training weekend, fellows turn in parts of their campaign plan based on a potential campaign they plan to staff or on a theoretical race for elected office.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  The LA County-based organizations among which we are establishing and
  cultivating relationships include: Center for Asian Americans United for Self
  Empowerment, Hispanics Organized for Political Equality, Community Coalition,
  Bend the Arc, NationBuild, California Emerge, New Leaders Council, Greenlining
  Institute, San Gabriel Valley Mountains Forever Leadership Academy, LAANE,
  Advancement Project California, California Forward, Drug Policy Alliance,
  Southern California Latino Policy Institute, Los Angeles African American
  Women’s Public Policy Institute, and Wilderness Society. We also have
  identified approximately eight young elected leaders, some of whom are members
  of PFAW Foundation’s Youth Elected Officials Network and who hold various
  offices within the county, to assist with recruitment and to serve as mentors
  and/or trainings and speakers during the eight-month training. These
  partnerships are informal and these organizations will give of their time and
  resources on a volunteer basis.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  This project consists of two components: 1) recruiting and training 20 young
  leaders from Los Angeles County for the 2015 FLLA-LA class and 2) offering
  enhanced alumni programming for the graduates of the 2014 FLLA-LA class.
  Estimated costs for recruiting and training the 2015 FLLA-LA class, the first
  part of this project, are $160,000. This budget includes staff support;
  travel, meals and lodging for the 20 participants, trainers and staff;
  consulting fees for trainers; and printing and production of training
  materials. Several funders have already committed their support for this part
  of the project including Annenberg Foundation ($50,000), California Community
  Foundation ($25,000) and McGrath Abrams Foundation $10,000); and we are
  continuing to identify potential funders to cover the remaining costs. The
  estimated costs for our project’s second part, providing support to graduates
  of the 2014 FLLA-LA class, are $118,000. This budget includes additional
  training; travel, meals and lodging for the FLLA grads, trainers and staff;
  consulting fees for trainers; and printing and production of training
  materials. We are currently identifying potential funders for this phase of
  the project.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
  If granted $100,000 through LA2050, we will use $75,000 toward recruiting and
  training the 2015 class of FLLA-LA class and $25,000 toward supporting
  graduates of the 2014 FLLA-LA class.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  While there are no formal plans to scale the success of FLLA-LA, the program
  itself provides a natural scaling effect due to the long-term effects of
  investing in leadership development and the work these leaders will undertake
  for years to come. It is our hope that FLLA-LA graduates will remain in Los
  Angeles and will build upon their successes toward improving
  interconnectedness in the Los Angeles community. These young leaders will
  pursue issue advocacy work, electoral advocacy work, and neighborhood- and
  community-based coalition building toward creating fundamental changes in the
  community. More important than the initial returns from the program is the
  capacity these young leaders now have to advocate for change in the long-term
  with the varied skills acquired from the FLLA-LA program.
   
   Since its inception in 2006, FLLA has launched the careers of 136 young leaders: 73 percent of FLLA graduates have gone on to hold leadership roles in nonprofits and community groups; 65 percent have increased civic participation through work on issue-based or electoral campaigns; and 20 percent have subsequently run for local elected office (59 percent of these won their races). The skills attained during the FLLA-LA will allow these young leaders to ascend to positions of influence in the community, thus allowing them to work to improve the community from within. An investment in FLLA-LA is an investment in developing local leaders in the Los Angeles community who desire to create change from within. FLLA graduates possess versatile skill sets that enable them to work in varied ways toward improving the community. Furthermore, the graduates apply these skills in their work well beyond their final moments of instruction – graduation from FLLA-LA marks the beginning of a career’s worth of civic engagement work and community enrichment.

      Building on the success of the first of a two-year pilot, we’ll recruit a
      second group of young people from LA County – those underrepresented in
      local public leadership, such as young women, young people of color, and
      LGBTQ youth – and train them using the Front Line Leaders Academy’s
      leadership development model to take on greater civic participation roles.
      We’ll also provide support to the first cohort of young leaders trained
      last year as they continue community service.

    answer: "Front Line Leaders Academy – Los Angeles (FLLA-LA) will train 20 young leaders dedicated to creating lasting change in their communities throughout Los Angeles County. FLLA-LA covers a wide range of civic participation leadership skills: how to be an effective campaign manager, finance director, communications director, field organizer, and even candidate. FLLA-LA equips young people with the skills and confidence to become effective leaders, and prepares them to work on a campaign in any capacity as well as to assume key roles in non-profits, local government, and community leadership. In the application and selection process, we look for applicants who are committed and have the potential to create change in their communities – now and over the long-term.\r\n\r\nParticipants in the inaugural 2014 FLLA-LA are making strides toward many CONNECT metrics outlined in LA2050. Fellows return to their communities with the ability to increase participation in neighborhood councils through traditional organizing; one FLLA-LA alumni hosted a community event focused on uplifting the concerns of men and boys of color. Fellows also return with an ability to impact government’s responsiveness to citizen needs; an FLLA-LA graduate organized a meeting with the Mayor of Los Angeles to discuss concerns of his neighborhood and community members. Another FLLA-LA graduate interviewed Los Angeles city officials on the “digital divide” and discussed the unequal access to technology among Angelinos. Fellows also work toward improving rates of volunteerism and community involvement; an FLLA-LA graduate facilitated a conference to 140 low-income and first-generation high school students encouraging civic participation. Another graduate facilitated a “Chicano Youth Leadership Conference” to 140-low-income and first-generation high school students on the topic of civic participation."

    answer: >-
      PFAW Foundation traditionally focuses on national youth leadership
      development programs. Thus, a primary challenge is recruiting for and
      within the specific community of Los Angeles. To overcome this, we have
      worked since 2014 building partnerships with like-minded organizations and
      individuals in LA County in our effort to recruit and identify the most
      promising young leaders for FLLA-LA. We are already benefiting from
      partnerships in tangible ways: we received over 60 applications this year
      from young people who were referred to us by a partner organization, young
      elected official, or FLLA alumnus. We are especially seeking to recruit
      people traditionally marginalized from the political process and
      underrepresented in public leadership, including young women, young people
      of color, and LGBTQ youth. Through partnerships, we will not only train a
      class of young leaders, but we will also bring resources, support, and
      connections to these leaders beyond their eight-month fellowship.

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Unlike other similar training programs that provide instruction over the course of one weekend, Front Line Leaders Academy (FLLA) commits to an intensive training, over the course of six months. The training takes place during four in-person weekends using a retreat-style format.  Training done in this style with a small group gives FLLA participants – whether they all come from the same geographical region or reflect a national scope – an opportunity to form bonds with other like-minded emerging leaders and to develop a built-in network of other progressive leaders, key factors carrying out successful social justice work. With the FLLA-Los Angeles pilot, in particular, participants are able to establish and build a network of knowledgeable young progressive leaders who live and work in the same community.  \r\n\r\nThe curriculum of FLLA’s six-month training emphasizes a broad range of competencies required for young leaders to assume key roles in campaigns or nonprofits, or as candidates.  The “candidacy” training (what it means to be a candidate) helps fellows to connect their personal stories to their long-term goals, as they consider whether they would run for an elected office or contribute toward developing other leaders within their communities.  Preparing a field campaign, another critical area, emphasizes developing a comprehensive understanding about what running in a campaign entails, the importance of voter contact, data management, recurring and retaining volunteers, and educating and mobilizing volunteers.  On the finance side, fellows explore the various aspects of creating a financial plan for a campaign and how to identify potential donors.  Examining the nuts and bolts of developing a communications plan is the fourth key area.  The final focus area is campaign management, where fellows learn best practices on how to manage people and projects.  \r\n\r\nAll FLLA participants are required to complete an individual mock “campaign” plan, and in the case of the LA fellows, their plan is district-specific.  This plan is one of the most tangible outcomes of Front Line Leaders Academy and it is based on assignments completed by fellows throughout the Academy, through which they apply the skills gained through the weekend trainings.  After completing each training weekend, fellows turn in parts of their campaign plan based on a potential campaign they plan to staff or on a theoretical race for elected office.\r\n"

      This project consists of two components: 1) recruiting and training 20
      young leaders from Los Angeles County for the 2015 FLLA-LA class and 2)
      offering enhanced alumni programming for the graduates of the 2014 FLLA-LA
      class.  Estimated costs for recruiting and training the 2015 FLLA-LA
      class, the first part of this project, are $160,000.  This budget includes
      staff support; travel, meals and lodging for the 20 participants, trainers
      and staff; consulting fees for trainers; and printing and production of
      training materials.  Several funders have already committed their support
      for this part of the project including Annenberg Foundation ($50,000),
      California Community Foundation ($25,000) and McGrath Abrams Foundation
      $10,000); and we are continuing to identify potential funders to cover the
      remaining costs.  The estimated costs for our project’s second part,
      providing support to graduates of the 2014 FLLA-LA class, are $118,000. 
      This budget includes additional training; travel, meals and lodging for

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "While there are no formal plans to scale the success of FLLA-LA, the program itself provides a natural scaling effect due to the long-term effects of investing in leadership development and the work these leaders will undertake for years to come. It is our hope that FLLA-LA graduates will remain in Los Angeles and will build upon their successes toward improving interconnectedness in the Los Angeles community. These young leaders will pursue issue advocacy work, electoral advocacy work, and neighborhood- and community-based coalition building toward creating fundamental changes in the community. More important than the initial returns from the program is the capacity these young leaders now have to advocate for change in the long-term with the varied skills acquired from the FLLA-LA program.\r\n\r\nSince its inception in 2006, FLLA has launched the careers of 136 young leaders: 73 percent of FLLA graduates have gone on to hold leadership roles in nonprofits and community groups; 65 percent have increased civic participation through work on issue-based or electoral campaigns; and 20 percent have subsequently run for local elected office (59 percent of these won their races). The skills attained during the FLLA-LA will allow these young leaders to ascend to positions of influence in the community, thus allowing them to work to improve the community from within. An investment in FLLA-LA is an investment in developing local leaders in the Los Angeles community who desire to create change from within. FLLA graduates possess versatile skill sets that enable them to work in varied ways toward improving the community. Furthermore, the graduates apply these skills in their work well beyond their final moments of instruction – graduation from FLLA-LA marks the beginning of a career’s worth of civic engagement work and community enrichment."
