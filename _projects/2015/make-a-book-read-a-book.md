    BookArtsLA will offer onsite book arts projects for public elementary school
    programs affording teachers an innovative, quality curriculum enhancement. 
    Understanding the classroom teacher’s requisite adherence to state
    standards, each of our book arts projects can align to a specific curricular
    subject.  Students and teachers learn deeply by creating connections in a
    given subject area via the making of hand-made books.
  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "BookArtsLA, as an organization, believes that hands on experiences create an environment more conducive to authentic, deep learning.  BookArtsLA, though our “Make a Book, Read a Book” program, will engage elementary age students by teaching the art of handmade books.  Teachers trained by BookArtsLA staff will visit elementary classrooms in the LA area to both create books that enhance student learning but also, at the same time, teach classroom teachers the concepts and techniques of making books.  Once the program is completed at each school site, classroom teachers should be able to use these skills to enhance classroom learning for any grade level.  \r\n\r\nBookArtsLA, in collaboration with site administrators and faculty, will work with the chosen grade level to design and implement a project related to one subject area, e.g. science, social studies or language arts.  \r\n\r\nThis program will target grades 3, 4 and 5 for the initial project.  BookArtsLA will train two teams (of two teachers) to deliver a program to a class once a week, for 1-2 hours, for 4 consecutive weeks.  Schools may have more than one class in the program.  The class teacher will participate in the program along with the students creating a potential mentor for other teachers.\r\n\r\nAn unfortunate by-product of the new State and Federal Standards is the teacher’s perception that the classroom teaching is constrained by conforming to the standards.  BookArtsLA believes it is possible to create a learning environment that uses some unconventional methodology to meet all of the curricular needs of teachers and students by teaching a subject more deeply via the production of student made books.\r\n\r\nWhat skills are enhances by making book?  \r\n1.\tSmall Motor skills \r\n2.\tCritical thinking\r\n3.\tResearch ability\r\n4.\tLiteracy\r\n5.\tDrawing\r\n6.\tStorytelling\r\n7.\tConfidence\r\nSkills that promote learning and critical thinking are necessary for success in school.\r\n\r\nA four week class will consist of the following:\r\n•\tWeek 1:  Discussion about what a book is, tools to make books and hands-on experimentation.  \r\n•\tWeek 2: Students create pages of images and text for their book.  \r\n•\tWeek 3:  Students create pages combining pictures and words and assemble their books.\r\n•\tWeek 4:  Students make any last minute changes and present their books to classmates.

  BookArtsLA, as an organization, believes that hands on experiences create an
  environment more conducive to authentic, deep learning. BookArtsLA, though our
  “Make a Book, Read a Book” program, will engage elementary age students by
  teaching the art of handmade books. Teachers trained by BookArtsLA staff will
  visit elementary classrooms in the LA area to both create books that enhance
  student learning but also, at the same time, teach classroom teachers the
  concepts and techniques of making books. Once the program is completed at each
  school site, classroom teachers should be able to use these skills to enhance
  classroom learning for any grade level. 
   
   BookArtsLA, in collaboration with site administrators and faculty, will work with the chosen grade level to design and implement a project related to one subject area, e.g. science, social studies or language arts. 
   
   This program will target grades 3, 4 and 5 for the initial project. BookArtsLA will train two teams (of two teachers) to deliver a program to a class once a week, for 1-2 hours, for 4 consecutive weeks. Schools may have more than one class in the program. The class teacher will participate in the program along with the students creating a potential mentor for other teachers.
   
   An unfortunate by-product of the new State and Federal Standards is the teacher’s perception that the classroom teaching is constrained by conforming to the standards. BookArtsLA believes it is possible to create a learning environment that uses some unconventional methodology to meet all of the curricular needs of teachers and students by teaching a subject more deeply via the production of student made books.
   
   What skills are enhances by making book? 
   1. Small Motor skills 
   2. Critical thinking
   3. Research ability
   4. Literacy
   5. Drawing
   6. Storytelling
   7. Confidence
   Skills that promote learning and critical thinking are necessary for success in school.
   
   A four week class will consist of the following:
   • Week 1: Discussion about what a book is, tools to make books and hands-on experimentation. 
   • Week 2: Students create pages of images and text for their book. 
   • Week 3: Students create pages combining pictures and words and assemble their books.
   • Week 4: Students make any last minute changes and present their books to classmates. Student take their newly created books home.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: |-
  Difficulty in connecting with educators to put program in place. 
   
   We are currently providing a prototype of the program in a private school as an after school activity. With this experience and knowledge we will be able to approach our target schools to implement this new program in their school curriculum. Teachers will take part in the learning methods with their class.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: |-
  Survey participants, administrations and our own metric for success which are:
   • Did children enjoy the process of creating their own books?
   • Did students learn about their chosen subject?
   • Did they increase their reading and writing skills?
   • Did teachers feel that students increased their skills and enthusiasm for their subject and school?
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Currently, BookArtsLA does not believe that an organization exists in the Los
  Angeles area whose mission is to teach or promote learning by making books.
   
   BookArtsLA is the only book arts organization in the Los Angeles area that provides outreach to the public via classes, lectures, library programs and other public events. Other arts organizations bring visual arts programs to schools. Our intent is to enhance leaning and literacy via handmade books.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': None
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  We are currently focusing on underserved elementary schools in our immediate
  area. This program can be expand by:
   1. Identify schools out of our immediate area and implement the program with the assistance of new participating schools. The program would concentrate on grades 3-5.
   2. Prototype the program in a middle school grades 6-8. Adjust and expand into the local schools as a start.
   3. Reach out to the wider school system and invite schools to apply to the program.
   4. Publish the results of the program so other schools are aware of the program.
