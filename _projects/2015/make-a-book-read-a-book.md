Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "BookArtsLA, as an organization, believes that hands on experiences create an environment more conducive to authentic, deep learning.  BookArtsLA, though our “Make a Book, Read a Book” program, will engage elementary age students by teaching the art of handmade books.  Teachers trained by BookArtsLA staff will visit elementary classrooms in the LA area to both create books that enhance student learning but also, at the same time, teach classroom teachers the concepts and techniques of making books.  Once the program is completed at each school site, classroom teachers should be able to use these skills to enhance classroom learning for any grade level.  \r\n\r\nBookArtsLA, in collaboration with site administrators and faculty, will work with the chosen grade level to design and implement a project related to one subject area, e.g. science, social studies or language arts.  \r\n\r\nThis program will target grades 3, 4 and 5 for the initial project.  BookArtsLA will train two teams (of two teachers) to deliver a program to a class once a week, for 1-2 hours, for 4 consecutive weeks.  Schools may have more than one class in the program.  The class teacher will participate in the program along with the students creating a potential mentor for other teachers.\r\n\r\nAn unfortunate by-product of the new State and Federal Standards is the teacher’s perception that the classroom teaching is constrained by conforming to the standards.  BookArtsLA believes it is possible to create a learning environment that uses some unconventional methodology to meet all of the curricular needs of teachers and students by teaching a subject more deeply via the production of student made books.\r\n\r\nWhat skills are enhances by making book?  \r\n1.\tSmall Motor skills \r\n2.\tCritical thinking\r\n3.\tResearch ability\r\n4.\tLiteracy\r\n5.\tDrawing\r\n6.\tStorytelling\r\n7.\tConfidence\r\nSkills that promote learning and critical thinking are necessary for success in school.\r\n\r\nA four week class will consist of the following:\r\n•\tWeek 1:  Discussion about what a book is, tools to make books and hands-on experimentation.  \r\n•\tWeek 2: Students create pages of images and text for their book.  \r\n•\tWeek 3:  Students create pages combining pictures and words and assemble their books.\r\n•\tWeek 4:  Students make any last minute changes and present their books to classmates.  Student take their newly created books home.\r\n"
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Survey participants, administrations and our own metric for success which are:\r\n•\tDid children enjoy the process of creating their own books?\r\n•\tDid students learn about their chosen subject?\r\n•\tDid they increase their reading and writing skills?\r\n•\tDid teachers feel that students increased their skills and enthusiasm for their subject and school?\r\n"
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
  - Money (financial capital)
  - Volunteers/staff (human capital)
  - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
  - 'Technical infrastructure (computers, etc.)'
