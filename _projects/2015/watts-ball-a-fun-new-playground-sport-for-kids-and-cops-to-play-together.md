'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  With all the bad news in recent years about violence and strife between police
  officers and residents of poor or predominantly black neighborhoods, it's
  clear that change is needed. Though bodycams, accountability, and better
  communication are important, there are no quick fixes. It's said in a proverb
  that the best time to plant an apple tree is 20 years ago and the second best
  time is now. What if we could plant seeds now that would transform the way
  police officers interacted with residents in South LA for generations to come?
  What if, using play and community building, we could build the foundation for
  a better relationship between cops and the citizens they protect, starting
  right now?
   
   WATTS BALL is a new playground game or alt sport. Each team consists of Blockers and Strikers, and the object of the game is to get the ball in your team's goal. However, there are two things that makes this game very different: it is played around Watts Towers, and every team is made of an equal split of kids and cadets from the police academy.
   
   For the cadets, playing with the kids will give them a new perspective on who exactly is in the community they're protecting, and what's at stake. For the kids, playing with the cadets will help them build trust and combat preconceived notions about the role of police in their neighborhood. For years to come, the players will remember their shared team experiences, victories, and challenges, and the spirit of good sportsmanship and team play will be a welcome new kind of interaction between these two populations that, historically, have been all too often connected only in tragic situations.
   
   The added benefit of this proposal is that the game is played at Watts Towers to revitalize this LA landmark that is in peril of neglect and underfunding.
   
   Once neighborhood and regional leagues are established and tournament play becomes regularized - culminating in a first-ever championship Watts Ball team! - we can spread the rules and practices of the game to other communities throughout LA and beyond, but it will always be heralded as a true Los Angeles original, like Hollywood and Fortune Cookies.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  It's hard to get people excited about a new game; most people, kids and
  adults, are more likely to play a game they already know. We hope to apply our
  experience and expertise as professional game designers and reality TV
  challenge creators to design a new playground sport that kids and cops will
  both want to try and test their competitive spirit. Furthermore, we hope to
  attract participants with spiffy team jerseys, a party-like atmosphere at the
  competitions, and exciting prizes for winning teams.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We'll play test the game with our network of seasoned new-game enthusiasts.
  We'll debrief with the kid players and their families as well as the cadets
  via in-person interviews and anonymized reports to find out what we could do
  to make playing the game and participating in a team more appealing. But make
  no mistake, we want to build something that will last a long time and change
  the city in a meaningful way for good, so we want to always have an eye on the
  long-term success of the project: 5, 10, 15 years down the line. So getting
  feedback from the players is critical, but we must always remember that in the
  olden days, baseball was played without a glove and never at night. Sports
  change over time. Watts Ball will change too.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  The Police Athletic League (P.A.L.) is probably the organization that mostly
  closely resembles the end result we're trying to achieve. However it seems the
  LA branch of PAL is somewhat neglected; in fact, if you go to the web site and
  call the numbers associated with the different regions, not one of them is
  still a valid number. It's understandable that this arm of the police
  department is not the most robust currently. We hope to infuse some new
  resources and energy, tracking down the officers who have experience with such
  matters, and apply what they know to help make this project a success.
   
   We co-founded Play Folk here in Los Angeles, a club dedicated to playing rare and unusual games. In Brooklyn, the "alt sport" (alternative sport) Circle Rules Football is probably the closest analogue, and it is still enjoyed in league play to this day. There are other communities throughout the US and Europe dedicated to playing alternative games, but none that are using a new, site-specific game specifically to strengthen community ties between cops and kids.
