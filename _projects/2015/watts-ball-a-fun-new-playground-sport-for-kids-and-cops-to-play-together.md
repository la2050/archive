  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to play.: "With all the bad news in recent years about violence and strife between police officers and residents of poor or predominantly black neighborhoods, it's clear that change is needed. Though bodycams, accountability, and better communication are important, there are no quick fixes. It's said in a proverb that the best time to plant an apple tree is 20 years ago and the second best time is now. What if we could plant seeds now that would transform the way police officers interacted with residents in South LA for generations to come? What if, using play and community building, we could build the foundation for a better relationship between cops and the citizens they protect, starting right now?\r\n\r\nWATTS BALL is a new playground game or alt sport. Each team consists of Blockers and Strikers, and the object of the game is to get the ball in your team's goal. However, there are two things that makes this game very different: it is played around Watts Towers, and every team is made of an equal split of kids and cadets from the police academy.\r\n\r\nFor the cadets, playing with the kids will give them a new perspective on who exactly is in the community they're protecting, and what's at stake. For the kids, playing with the cadets will help them build trust and combat preconceived notions about the role of police in their neighborhood. For years to come, the players will remember their shared team experiences, victories, and challenges, and the spirit of good sportsmanship and team play will be a welcome new kind of interaction between these two populations that, historically, have been all too often connected only in tragic situations.\r\n\r\nThe added benefit of this proposal is that the game is played at Watts Towers to revitalize this LA landmark that is in peril of neglect and underfunding.\r\n\r\nOnce neighborhood and regional leagues are established and tournament play becomes regularized - culminating in a first-ever championship Watts Ball team! - we can spread the rules and practices of the game to other communities throughout LA and beyond, but it will always be heralded as a true Los Angeles original, like Hollywood and Fortune Cookies."

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    It's hard to get people excited about a new game; most people, kids and
    adults, are more likely to play a game they already know. We hope to apply
    our experience and expertise as professional game designers and reality TV
    challenge creators to design a new playground sport that kids and cops will
    both want to try and test their competitive spirit. Furthermore, we hope to
    attract participants with spiffy team jerseys, a party-like atmosphere at
    the competitions, and exciting prizes for winning teams. 
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    We'll play test the game with our network of seasoned new-game enthusiasts.
    We'll debrief with the kid players and their families as well as the cadets
    via in-person interviews and anonymized reports to find out what we could do
    to make playing the game and participating in a team more appealing. But
    make no mistake, we want to build something that will last a long time and
    change the city in a meaningful way for good, so we want to always have an
    eye on the long-term success of the project: 5, 10, 15 years down the line.
    So getting feedback from the players is critical, but we must always
    remember that in the olden days, baseball was played without a glove and
    never at night. Sports change over time. Watts Ball will change too.
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "The Police Athletic League (P.A.L.) is probably the organization that mostly closely resembles the end result we're trying to achieve. However it seems the LA branch of PAL is somewhat neglected; in fact, if you go to the web site and call the numbers associated with the different regions, not one of them is still a valid number. It's understandable that this arm of the police department is not the most robust currently. We hope to infuse some new resources and energy, tracking down the officers who have experience with such matters, and apply what they know to help make this project a success.\r\n\r\nWe co-founded Play Folk here in Los Angeles, a club dedicated to playing rare and unusual games. In Brooklyn, the \"alt sport\" (alternative sport) Circle Rules Football is probably the closest analogue, and it is still enjoyed in league play to this day. There are other communities throughout the US and Europe dedicated to playing alternative games, but none that are using a new, site-specific game specifically to strengthen community ties between cops and kids."
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': None now
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    We will custom build site-specific sports to other landmarks in similar
    communities around the country to help make Watts Ball a reality in other
    cities.
