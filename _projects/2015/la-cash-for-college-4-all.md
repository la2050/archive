  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "LA Cash for College was developed in response to a Tomas Rivera Policy Institute study which found that while the majority of Latino parents wanted their children to pursue college, their knowledge about how to get into and pay for college was objectively low. The study made clear recommendations to help address these knowledge deficits, including better informing parents about the process of accessing college, launching a long-term public services announcement campaign in English/Spanish to improve parent's college knowledge, and increasing the scope, frequency, and visibility of college events such as college nights, open houses, and campus visits.\r\n\r\nSince 2001, LA Cash for College has been building a college-going culture in L.A. using a three-pronged approach of 1) informing students and families about college preparation and financing their education, 2) assisting them in applying for aid, and 3) rewarding positive behaviors like applying for aid. Each step of the way, students and their parents are encouraged to pursue their college aspirations.\r\n\r\nInform: Beginning the campaign each year, the annual College and Career Convention is designed to help participants understand the accessibility of college, features expert-led presentations on college life and academic preparation, interactive career demonstrations, information sessions about scholarships and other financial aid, as well as an Exhibition Hall of local, state and national college and university admissions recruiters.\r\n\r\nAssist: Then, in partnership with the California Student Aid Commission, LA Cash for College hosts over 150 free annual workshops that assist students and families complete their financial aid applications from January 1st to March 2nd. Workshops are conducted with a wide network of community partners and trained volunteers from colleges, universities and businesses to provide one-on-one assistance to help students complete the FAFSA, the California Dream Act application, Pell and Cal grants. Eligible students qualify for up to $18,000 and free financial aid they never have to pay back.\r\n\r\nReward: Finally, there is a scholarship reception in May, which features prominent guest speakers and local elected officials, to award a limited number of $1,000 incentive scholarships to participating students from the Convention or a Workshop.\r\n\r\nThe campaign has assisted nearly 240,000 students prepare for college, apply for financial aid and secure $3.3 million in scholarships."

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "Starting with the 2017-2018 Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form, students will be able to apply beginning October 1 instead of January 1. In addition, the FAFSA form will allow applicants to automatically import their income tax data from two years prior. Although both policy changes will make it easier for low-income students to access college financial aid, LA Cash for College will have to restructure its programming timeline.\r\n\r\nBased on the new timeline, LA Cash for College would continue to host the Convention in October, but would begin giving the financial aid completion workshops in October instead of January. The workshops would go from a 2-month period to a 5-month period, extending staff time and program resources dedicated to coordinating them.\r\n\r\nAnother challenge is adapting to the modes of communication used by students to consume information. Last year, CSAC launched a smart phone app offering financial aide resources that we would like to build on."
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "LA Cash for College evaluates both the Convention and the Financial Aid Completion Workshops each year in order to maintain the quality programming that has made us the region's largest college and financial aid information program. Students who attend the Convention fill out a form with demographic and economic data in order to enter a lottery for a $1,000 scholarship. This information tells us who we are serving. In  addition, we send attendees an electronic survey asking them for feedback on the convention.\r\n\r\nStudents who participate in the Financial Aid Completion Workshops must complete an Exit Survey, which is sent to the CSAC to be eligible for the $1,000 scholarship lottery. The surveys inform our program on the quality of the workshops and areas of the workshops that can be improved. The survey also allows students to request follow-up help if they were unable to complete either their FAFSA or California Dream Act application at the workshop."
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "In 2011, a student aid policy analysis by Mark Kantrowitz found that of the students that didn't fill out a FAFSA, 60.7% thought they were ineligible, 22.9% had no information on how to apply, and 18.9% thought it was too much work to apply.\r\n\r\nLA Cash for College's approach is unique because it provides resources and builds capacity locally, greatly enhancing other organizations' capacity to inform and assist Los Angeles students, exponentially increasing the amount of students who are impacted by the LA Cash for College program.\r\n\r\nIn addition to reaching more students through LA Cash for College's extensive network of partners, the program incentivizes student participation by offering students an opportunity to win a $1,000 for attending the Convention or completing a FAFSA application at a free Financial Aid Completion Workshop."
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    UNITE-LA believes collaboration is at the heart of its work. In particular,
    the LA Cash for College campaign could not accomplish its wide outreach
    without the supports from partners. Over 150 community partners help make LA
    Cash for College a reality through opening up their space, volunteering time
    and hosting workshops. As part of the $!00,000 grant, UNITE-LA would set
    aside $10,000 towards 20 buses that community partners could utilize for
    participation in the College and Career Convention. In addition, $10,000
    would be set aside for $1,000 incentive scholarships that will support youth
    from 10 community partner organizations. A total of 30 community partners
    will receive some supports through this grant averaging in value of $750 to
    pay for costs associated with transportation, financial aid informational
    resources, and materials for the Convention and Workshops. 
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    LA Cash for College's budget is $350,000 and includes program salaries as
    well as program expenses, such as: the Convention, student transportation,
    stipends for workshop sites to help offset some costs, and scholarships. LA
    Cash for College receives some funding from the California Student Aid
    Commission, the City of Los Angeles, and private funders, such as the Kresge
    Foundation. LA Cash for College staff also pursues corporate sponsorships
    and in-kind supports to offset budget items.
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "$10,000 towards buses that community partners will uses to bring students to the Convention\r\n$10,000 to give ten $1,000 incentive scholarships for participation in the Convention\r\n$22,500 for supports to 30 community partnerships (averaging $750/community partner) that would pay for transportation to the Convention, supplies for the Financial Aid Completion Workshops, and resources throughout the year\r\n$25,000 to develop the California Student Aid Commission's smart phone application, which was recently launched but doesn't incorporate local information. LA Cash for College would like to develop the app further to include information about where and when LA Cash for College Financial Aid Completion Workshops are being held, a schedule of events happening during the College and Career Convention, and college and financial aid information and resources that can directly be accessed throughout the year.\r\n$32,500 toward LA Cash for College staff salaries."
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "The LA Cash for College program recently launched its new website. With the new website, the program is developing better ways of reaching students, including: blogs from staff members and experts about college access issues, an integrated social media strategy, text messaging to students, and intentional emailing.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the website, the LA Cash for College team plans to develop the California Student Aid Commission's smart phone app by linking to the LA Cash for College Campaign. Understanding the ways in which students consume information today, the app will attract more students, give us the ability to measure which resources are most useful to them, and guide our future information and assistance strategies. The application will also allow our program to attract, organize and coordinate volunteers."
