  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "LA Cash for College was developed in response to a Tomas Rivera Policy Institute study which found that while the majority of Latino parents wanted their children to pursue college, their knowledge about how to get into and pay for college was objectively low. The study made clear recommendations to help address these knowledge deficits, including better informing parents about the process of accessing college, launching a long-term public services announcement campaign in English/Spanish to improve parent's college knowledge, and increasing the scope, frequency, and visibility of college events such as college nights, open houses, and campus visits.\r\n\r\nSince 2001, LA Cash for College has been building a college-going culture in L.A. using a three-pronged approach of 1) informing students and families about college preparation and financing their education, 2) assisting them in applying for aid, and 3) rewarding positive behaviors like applying for aid. Each step of the way, students and their parents are encouraged to pursue their college aspirations.\r\n\r\nInform: Beginning the campaign each year, the annual College and Career Convention is designed to help participants understand the accessibility of college, features expert-led presentations on college life and academic preparation, interactive career demonstrations, information sessions about scholarships and other financial aid, as well as an Exhibition Hall of local, state and national college and university admissions recruiters.\r\n\r\nAssist: Then, in partnership with the California Student Aid Commission, LA Cash for College hosts over 150 free annual workshops that assist students and families complete their financial aid applications from January 1st to March 2nd. Workshops are conducted with a wide network of community partners and trained volunteers from colleges, universities and businesses to provide one-on-one assistance to help students complete the FAFSA, the California Dream Act application, Pell and Cal grants. Eligible students qualify for up to $18,000 and free financial aid they never have to pay back.\r\n\r\nReward: Finally, there is a scholarship reception in May, which features prominent guest speakers and local elected officials, to award a limited number of $1,000 incentive scholarships to participating students from the Convention or a Workshop.\r\n\r\nThe campaign has assisted nearly 240,000 students prepare for college, apply for financial aid and secure $3.3 million in scholarships."

  LA Cash for College was developed in response to a Tomas Rivera Policy
  Institute study which found that while the majority of Latino parents wanted
  their children to pursue college, their knowledge about how to get into and
  pay for college was objectively low. The study made clear recommendations to
  help address these knowledge deficits, including better informing parents
  about the process of accessing college, launching a long-term public services
  announcement campaign in English/Spanish to improve parent's college
  knowledge, and increasing the scope, frequency, and visibility of college
  events such as college nights, open houses, and campus visits.
   
   Since 2001, LA Cash for College has been building a college-going culture in L.A. using a three-pronged approach of 1) informing students and families about college preparation and financing their education, 2) assisting them in applying for aid, and 3) rewarding positive behaviors like applying for aid. Each step of the way, students and their parents are encouraged to pursue their college aspirations.
   
   Inform: Beginning the campaign each year, the annual College and Career Convention is designed to help participants understand the accessibility of college, features expert-led presentations on college life and academic preparation, interactive career demonstrations, information sessions about scholarships and other financial aid, as well as an Exhibition Hall of local, state and national college and university admissions recruiters.
   
   Assist: Then, in partnership with the California Student Aid Commission, LA Cash for College hosts over 150 free annual workshops that assist students and families complete their financial aid applications from January 1st to March 2nd. Workshops are conducted with a wide network of community partners and trained volunteers from colleges, universities and businesses to provide one-on-one assistance to help students complete the FAFSA, the California Dream Act application, Pell and Cal grants. Eligible students qualify for up to $18,000 and free financial aid they never have to pay back.
   
   Reward: Finally, there is a scholarship reception in May, which features prominent guest speakers and local elected officials, to award a limited number of $1,000 incentive scholarships to participating students from the Convention or a Workshop.
   
   The campaign has assisted nearly 240,000 students prepare for college, apply for financial aid and secure $3.3 million in scholarships.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Starting with the 2017-2018 Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)
  form, students will be able to apply beginning October 1 instead of January 1.
  In addition, the FAFSA form will allow applicants to automatically import
  their income tax data from two years prior. Although both policy changes will
  make it easier for low-income students to access college financial aid, LA
  Cash for College will have to restructure its programming timeline.
   
   Based on the new timeline, LA Cash for College would continue to host the Convention in October, but would begin giving the financial aid completion workshops in October instead of January. The workshops would go from a 2-month period to a 5-month period, extending staff time and program resources dedicated to coordinating them.
   
   Another challenge is adapting to the modes of communication used by students to consume information. Last year, CSAC launched a smart phone app offering financial aide resources that we would like to build on.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  LA Cash for College evaluates both the Convention and the Financial Aid
  Completion Workshops each year in order to maintain the quality programming
  that has made us the region's largest college and financial aid information
  program. Students who attend the Convention fill out a form with demographic
  and economic data in order to enter a lottery for a $1,000 scholarship. This
  information tells us who we are serving. In addition, we send attendees an
  electronic survey asking them for feedback on the convention.
   
   Students who participate in the Financial Aid Completion Workshops must complete an Exit Survey, which is sent to the CSAC to be eligible for the $1,000 scholarship lottery. The surveys inform our program on the quality of the workshops and areas of the workshops that can be improved. The survey also allows students to request follow-up help if they were unable to complete either their FAFSA or California Dream Act application at the workshop.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  In 2011, a student aid policy analysis by Mark Kantrowitz found that of the
  students that didn't fill out a FAFSA, 60.7% thought they were ineligible,
  22.9% had no information on how to apply, and 18.9% thought it was too much
  work to apply.
   
   LA Cash for College's approach is unique because it provides resources and builds capacity locally, greatly enhancing other organizations' capacity to inform and assist Los Angeles students, exponentially increasing the amount of students who are impacted by the LA Cash for College program.
   
   In addition to reaching more students through LA Cash for College's extensive network of partners, the program incentivizes student participation by offering students an opportunity to win a $1,000 for attending the Convention or completing a FAFSA application at a free Financial Aid Completion Workshop.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  UNITE-LA believes collaboration is at the heart of its work. In particular,
  the LA Cash for College campaign could not accomplish its wide outreach
  without the supports from partners. Over 150 community partners help make LA
  Cash for College a reality through opening up their space, volunteering time
  and hosting workshops. As part of the $!00,000 grant, UNITE-LA would set aside
  $10,000 towards 20 buses that community partners could utilize for
  participation in the College and Career Convention. In addition, $10,000 would
  be set aside for $1,000 incentive scholarships that will support youth from 10
  community partner organizations. A total of 30 community partners will receive
  some supports through this grant averaging in value of $750 to pay for costs
  associated with transportation, financial aid informational resources, and
  materials for the Convention and Workshops.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  The LA Cash for College program recently launched its new website. With the
  new website, the program is developing better ways of reaching students,
  including: blogs from staff members and experts about college access issues,
  an integrated social media strategy, text messaging to students, and
  intentional emailing.
   
   In addition to the website, the LA Cash for College team plans to develop the California Student Aid Commission's smart phone app by linking to the LA Cash for College Campaign. Understanding the ways in which students consume information today, the app will attract more students, give us the ability to measure which resources are most useful to them, and guide our future information and assistance strategies. The application will also allow our program to attract, organize and coordinate volunteers.
