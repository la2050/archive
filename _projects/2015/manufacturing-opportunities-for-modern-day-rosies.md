'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Jobs to Move America advocates for policies that incentivize creation of
  quality jobs when transit agencies like LA Metro procure buses & railcars.
  Through the Modern Rosies Project, we will increase recruitment, training,
  hiring & support & promote equity & safety programs for women in the LA
  transit manufacturing industry.
   We will do this by advocating for strong policy language supporting women’s equal inclusion in manufacturing jobs to be adopted by transit agencies as part of the bidding documents under the JMA US Employment Plan & by manufacturers through JMA partner agreements. The Modern Rosies project is part of this advocacy.
   The Modern Rosies project will seek to: Change perception of women’s roles & abilities in the manufacturing workplace; create opportunities for women in transit manufacturing; highlight the issues facing women in manufacturing & promote women’s achievements in the industry. 
   We will:
   Address discrimination, sexual harassment, wage, & leadership gaps, & use policy and education to change the industry’s approach to hiring, training, & promoting women, & develop or strengthen programs to train & support women in manufacturing.
   Win policy language with LA Metro and other regional transit agencies that sets standards for hiring, promotion, training & retention policies & practices and work with companies on best practices.
   Bring women’s groups into our LA coalition and build a network of supporting groups.
   Establish a women only Pre-Employment Training Program & a pilot program for welding & electrical workers.
   Coordinate job training, job placement, support & retention services provided by our partners.
   Choose an employer to implement a pilot program for women in the industry.
   Work with training providers & employers to recruit more women & place them in manufacturing jobs.
   Support women workers with on-the-job mentoring, women’s peer groups, professional development, links to support services, & leadership development.
   The outcomes of the project will be:
   The WomenCanBuild exhibit is shown in at least one other location in LA, such as Cal Tech.
   At least a 10% increase in representation of women in LA’s transit manufacturing workforce over five years.
   Reduced complaints of discrimination & harassment. 
   Successful outreach program to women & girls.
   Developed pipeline for women to enter manufacturing with support systems
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Women face barriers to success in manufacturing plants that build heavy
  equipment where there are virtually no women welders, electricians, painters
  or general assemblers. There is rampant sexual harassment, pay & promotion
  disparities & limitation of opportunities because of the perception that women
  are not capable of doing heavy manufacturing work, although a modern factory
  makes this case redundant.
   To overcome these obstacles, we will advocate for policy language in RFPs put out by LA Metro & other regional transit agencies that requires bidders to commit to anti-sexual harassment & pay equity programs; create programs to work with community & educational institutions to overcome gender discrimination & low representation of women; build a committee of Modern Rosies (women working in LA transportation manufacturing) & train them to make presentations, speak to the press, advocate with their employers, & inspire young women to see themselves as “modern Rosies.”
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  The work will be evaluated based on data from transit agencies, employers and
  our partner organizations as well as surveys of women workers and employers of
  women and independent research.
   Our primary criteria for evaluating the success of WomenCanBuild over time will be:
   The number of women hired for transit manufacturing jobs in the region 
   The % of women in LA transit manufacturing compared to the national rate of 13% 
   The experience of those women based on surveys.
   The experience of employers with their women employees based on surveys
   The increase in manufacturing activity in the LA region and particularly transit manufacturing.
   The number of formerly incarcerated women and women veterans who receive training and are hired in manufacturing jobs.
   The recruitment and retention rates for women in manufacturing.
   Number of transit manufacturing jobs created in the region
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  JMA is the only program that will increase US manufacturing jobs in the
  transit industry and the that advocates for bringing more women into that
  industry through contracting policies and public pressure.
   The JMA policy, when adopted by transit agencies for their procurements, results in recruitment, training, hiring & support for disadvantaged workers including women. LA Metro was the first transit agency in the country to adopt the policy for its procurements & we are already seeing more women hired for manufacturing jobs under Metro’s contracts as a result. This project will allow us to develop additional gender specific policy language and advocate for the adoption of that language with transit agencies.
   JMA is the only organization that is linking policy, outreach, organizing & arts & culture to fight for women’s inclusion & fair treatment in manufacturing jobs created in the massive build out of the LA transportation system. 
   We use art to promote Modern Day Rosies in our travelling exhibit “Women Can Build: Re-envisioning Rosie,” a photography exhibit including a research report revealing the overlooked contributions of the skilled and hard-working women who build our 21st Century transportation, channeling the spirit of Rosie the Riveter. 
   The Women Can Build exhibit features large photographs by Pulitzer Prize winner Deanne Fitzmaurice and stories of 15 modern day "Rosies," alongside never-before-exhibited historic photographs of WWII era Rosie the Riveter manufacturing workers from the Library of Congress, connecting past and present.
   We are the only organization that we know of in LA that is educating manufacturers—industry wide-- about recruitment, training & hiring of women as well as treating them fairly once on the job. JMA’s workforce development task force that works with manufacturers includes academics, workforce agencies, unions & other experts who assist manufacturers in managing issues related to women in manufacturing.
   Our partnerships are also unique. We have partners like WINTER that bring special expertise in placing women in non-traditional jobs. Other partners include technical colleges & union apprentice programs that have expertise in providing training for women in non-traditional jobs, & workforce development agencies that refer women to training programs. 
   Only JMA provides the unique connective tissue to bring the job creation, policy incentives, & training programs to transit agencies & manufacturers
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Partners in creating and providing training for women include LA Trade
  Technical College, Transportation Department; IBEW Local 11 electrical workers
  union apprenticeship program; LA County Federation of Labor, AFLCIO, and SMART
  Local 135, the sheet metal & railroad workers union apprenticeship program,
  among others.
   Partners in recruiting women for manufacturing jobs include Playa Vista Jobs & Women in Nontraditional Employment (WINTER).
   Our academic partner in LA is the Program for Environmental and Regional Equity at USC.
   We partnered with the LA County Metropolitan Transportation Authority in the launch of the Women Can Build photography exhibit at Union Station. As LA Metro issues RFPs for manufacture of buses & railcars, we will work with the agency to ensure that the strongest language regarding training, jobs & support for women is included in the RFPs & that the bidders’ ability to comply with those standards is a significant factor in selection of the winning bid.
   We also collaborate with LA area manufacturing employers including companies that have already worked under JMA policies—Kinkisharyo International (Japanese firm), BYD (Chinese firm), Bombardier (Canadian firm). As RFPs are issued, we will seek out new firms that are willing & capable to abide by JMA policies & support women in manufacturing.
   We plan to use $80,000 of the award in personnel expense to employ a full time JMA/LAANE staff person to manage the project. We will subgrant $10,000 to WINTER to work with LA area companies & recruit women and with LA Trade Tech & other schools which, along with union apprenticeship programs, will provide training to women in manufacturing skills. 
   We will allocate $10,000 for the cost of mounting an additional photography exhibit at either Cal Tech or another iconic and appropriate location in the region
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  We believe that $100,000 is sufficient to launch the Manufacturing
  Opportunities for Modern Rosies project and to operate during the project’s
  first year. We will use existing staff to support the new project coordinator.
  In particular, we will allocate 20% of the time of Jake Williams, a mechanical
  engineer on our staff who is developing the overall apprenticeship curricula
  for transportation manufacturing jobs, & 20% of the time of Nadine Levyfield,
  our communications specialist, to help develop collateral material, maintain &
  upgrade the www.womencanbuild.org website & to support periodic media events.
  We will also continue to raise additional funds to expand the project to other
  cities outside of LA County and to travel the Women Can Build photography
  exhibit to New York, Illinois and Washington DC.
   Jobs to Move America has other foundation, private & union support to cover general operating & program expenses as well as project staff. This would be the first grant for the Modern Rosies Project, which will be a significant expansion of the Women Can Build photography project, which was launched in May through an exhibit at LA Union Station. This grant would allow us to build a broad based advocacy and public education project to pressure for the inclusion and fair treatment of women in LA’s newly expanding transportation manufacturing industry.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  JMA Women Can Build Project Coordinator salary: $60,000
   Benefits: $15,000
   Overhead, Furniture & Equipment: $5,000
   Subgrant to WINTER & LA Trade Tech & other schools to help with recruitment and the development of a training curriculum: $10,000
   WomenCanBuild exhibit at LA location: $10,000
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Through the Jobs to move America coalition, we plan to bring the Modern Rosies
  project to Illinois, New York & Washington DC. We are already working with the
  U.S Department of Transportation on bringing the Rosie exhibit to DC. 
   National JMA supports regional JMA coalitions in the Greater Chicago area, Sacramento & the Greater New York area. We expect to establish a presence soon in upstate New York, Minneapolis-St. Paul, & Washington State as funding becomes available. We will organize professionally curated WCB exhibits in some of these locations in partnership with the federal government & large transit agencies to seed the ground for an expansion of the larger Modern Rosies project.
   Regional transportation agencies such as LA Metro, Metrolink, Long Beach transit, California High Speed Rail and a new high speed rail line between LA and Las Vegas have projected many billions of dollars’ worth of projects for which there will be RFPs for manufacturers over the next 10-20 years. We will continue to work with these agencies to ensure that recruitment, training, hiring & support for women workers will be a priority in each of these RFPs. Overall, we believe that, with a strong program, LA can continue to attract and retain large bus, railcar and related parts factories to the LA region and create a model, modern manufacturing sector that reflects the values of inclusion and diversity that are part of the LA 2050 plan.
   While hiring and inclusion of women in major industries has been a renewed topic of conversation in major media, that discussion has primarily focused on hiring of professional women and support for women in executive positions. The fact that women are so unwelcome and excluded from LA’s heavy manufacturing workforce (where jobs tend to be better than in the growing retail, service and food processing sectors) is seldom discussed in the media or in the halls of political power. The reality is that women have to muster huge courage to apply to be welders and electricians in LA factories in the face of so much prejudice and harassment. That is why the Modern Rosies project is a crucial component of an agenda for a progressive LA future and will continue to grow in LA and around the country,

    answer: "Jobs to Move America advocates for policies that incentivize creation of quality jobs when transit agencies like LA Metro procure buses & railcars. Through the Modern Rosies Project, we will increase recruitment, training, hiring & support & promote equity & safety programs for women in the LA transit manufacturing industry.\r\nWe will do this by advocating for strong policy language supporting women’s equal inclusion in manufacturing jobs to be adopted by transit agencies as part of the bidding documents under the JMA US Employment Plan & by manufacturers through JMA partner agreements. The Modern Rosies project is part of this advocacy.\r\nThe Modern Rosies project will seek to: Change perception of women’s roles & abilities in the manufacturing workplace; create opportunities for women in transit manufacturing; highlight the issues facing women in manufacturing & promote women’s achievements in the industry. \r\nWe will:\r\nAddress discrimination, sexual harassment, wage, & leadership gaps, & use policy and education to change the industry’s approach to hiring, training, & promoting women, & develop or strengthen programs to train & support women in manufacturing.\r\nWin policy language with LA Metro and other regional transit agencies that sets standards for hiring, promotion, training & retention policies & practices and work with companies on best practices.\r\nBring women’s groups into our LA coalition and build a network of supporting groups.\r\nEstablish a women only Pre-Employment Training Program & a pilot program for welding & electrical workers.\r\nCoordinate job training, job placement, support & retention services provided by our partners.\r\nChoose an employer to implement a pilot program for women in the industry.\r\nWork with training providers & employers to recruit more women & place them in manufacturing jobs.\r\nSupport women workers with on-the-job mentoring, women’s peer groups, professional development, links to support services, & leadership development.\r\nThe outcomes of the project will be:\r\nThe WomenCanBuild exhibit is shown in at least one other location in LA, such as Cal Tech.\r\nAt least a 10% increase in representation of women in LA’s transit manufacturing workforce over five years.\r\nReduced complaints of discrimination & harassment. \r\nSuccessful outreach program to women & girls.\r\nDeveloped pipeline for women to enter manufacturing with support systems\r\n\r\n"

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Women face barriers to success in manufacturing plants that build heavy equipment where there are virtually no women welders, electricians, painters or general assemblers. There is rampant sexual harassment, pay & promotion disparities & limitation of opportunities because of the perception that women are not capable of doing heavy manufacturing work, although a modern factory makes this case redundant.\r\nTo overcome these obstacles, we will advocate for policy language in RFPs put out by LA Metro & other regional transit agencies that requires bidders to commit to anti-sexual harassment & pay equity programs; create programs to work with community & educational institutions to overcome gender discrimination & low representation of women; build a committee of Modern Rosies (women working in LA transportation manufacturing) & train them to make presentations, speak to the press, advocate with their employers, & inspire young women to see themselves as “modern Rosies.” \r\n\r\n"
  - name: Please explain how you will evaluate your work.

    answer: "The work will be evaluated based on data from transit agencies, employers and our partner organizations as well as surveys of women workers and employers of women and independent research.\r\nOur primary criteria for evaluating the success of WomenCanBuild over time will be:\r\nThe number of women hired for transit manufacturing jobs in the region \r\nThe % of women in LA transit manufacturing compared to the national rate of 13% \r\nThe experience of those women based on surveys.\r\nThe experience of employers with their women employees based on surveys\r\nThe increase in manufacturing activity in the LA region and particularly transit manufacturing.\r\nThe number of formerly incarcerated women and women veterans who receive training and are hired in manufacturing jobs.\r\nThe recruitment and retention rates for women in manufacturing.\r\nNumber of transit manufacturing jobs created in the region\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "JMA is the only program that will increase US manufacturing jobs in the transit industry and the that advocates for bringing more women into that industry through contracting policies and public pressure.\r\nThe JMA policy, when adopted by transit agencies for their procurements, results in recruitment, training, hiring & support for disadvantaged workers including women.  LA Metro was the first transit agency in the country to adopt the policy for its procurements & we are already seeing more women hired for manufacturing jobs under Metro’s contracts as a result.  This project will allow us to develop additional gender specific policy language and advocate for the adoption of that language with transit agencies.\r\nJMA is the only organization that is linking policy, outreach, organizing & arts & culture to fight for women’s inclusion & fair treatment in manufacturing jobs created in the massive build out of the LA transportation system.  \r\nWe use art to promote Modern Day Rosies in our travelling exhibit “Women Can Build: Re-envisioning Rosie,”  a photography exhibit including a research report revealing the overlooked contributions of the skilled and hard-working women who build our 21st Century transportation, channeling the spirit of Rosie the Riveter. \r\nThe Women Can Build exhibit features large photographs by Pulitzer Prize winner Deanne Fitzmaurice and stories of 15 modern day \"Rosies,\" alongside never-before-exhibited historic photographs of WWII era Rosie the Riveter manufacturing workers from the Library of Congress, connecting past and present.\r\nWe are the only organization that we know of in LA that is educating manufacturers—industry wide-- about recruitment, training & hiring of women as well as treating them fairly once on the job.  JMA’s workforce development task force that works with manufacturers includes academics, workforce agencies, unions & other experts who assist manufacturers in managing issues related to women in manufacturing.\r\nOur partnerships are also unique. We have partners like WINTER that bring special expertise in placing women in non-traditional jobs. Other partners include technical colleges & union apprentice programs that have expertise in providing training for women in non-traditional jobs, & workforce development agencies that refer women to training programs. \r\nOnly JMA provides the unique connective tissue to bring the job creation, policy incentives, & training programs to transit agencies & manufacturers\r\n\r\n"

      Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on
      this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner
      receive?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Partners in creating and providing training for women include LA Trade Technical College, Transportation Department; IBEW Local 11 electrical workers union apprenticeship program; LA County Federation of Labor, AFLCIO, and SMART Local 135, the sheet metal & railroad workers union apprenticeship program, among others.\r\nPartners in recruiting women for manufacturing jobs include Playa Vista Jobs & Women in   Nontraditional Employment (WINTER).\r\nOur academic partner in LA is the Program for Environmental and Regional Equity at USC.\r\nWe partnered with the LA County Metropolitan Transportation Authority in the launch of the Women Can Build photography exhibit at Union Station.  As LA Metro issues RFPs for manufacture of buses & railcars, we will work with the agency to ensure that the strongest language regarding training, jobs & support for women is included in the RFPs & that the bidders’ ability to comply with those standards is a significant factor in selection of the winning bid.\r\nWe also collaborate with LA area manufacturing employers including companies that have already worked under JMA policies—Kinkisharyo International (Japanese firm), BYD (Chinese firm), Bombardier (Canadian firm). As RFPs are issued, we will seek out new firms that are willing & capable to abide by JMA policies & support women in manufacturing.\r\nWe plan to use $80,000 of the award in personnel expense to employ a full time JMA/LAANE staff person to manage the project.  We will subgrant $10,000 to WINTER to work with LA area companies & recruit women and with LA Trade Tech & other schools which, along with union apprenticeship programs, will provide training to women in manufacturing skills.  \r\nWe will allocate $10,000 for the cost of mounting an additional photography exhibit at either Cal Tech or another iconic and appropriate location in the region\r\n\r\n"
  - name: >-
      How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you
      cover the additional costs?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "We believe that $100,000 is sufficient to launch the Manufacturing Opportunities for Modern Rosies project and to operate during the project’s first year.  We will use existing staff to support the new project coordinator.  In particular, we will allocate 20% of the time of Jake Williams, a mechanical engineer on our staff who is developing the overall apprenticeship curricula for transportation manufacturing jobs, & 20% of the time of Nadine Levyfield, our communications specialist, to help develop collateral material, maintain & upgrade the www.womencanbuild.org website & to support periodic media events.  We will also continue to raise additional funds to expand the project to other cities outside of LA County and to travel the Women Can Build photography exhibit to New York, Illinois and Washington DC.\r\nJobs to Move America has other foundation, private & union support to cover general operating & program expenses as well as project staff. This would be the first grant for the Modern Rosies Project, which will be a significant expansion of the Women Can Build photography project, which was launched in May through an exhibit at LA Union Station.  This grant would allow us to build a broad based advocacy and public education project to pressure for the inclusion and fair treatment of women in LA’s newly expanding transportation manufacturing industry.\r\n\r\n"

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Through the Jobs to move America coalition, we plan to bring the Modern Rosies project to Illinois, New York & Washington DC.   We are already working with the U.S Department of Transportation on bringing the Rosie exhibit to DC.   \r\nNational JMA supports regional JMA coalitions in the Greater Chicago area, Sacramento & the Greater New York area.  We expect to establish a presence soon in upstate New York, Minneapolis-St. Paul, & Washington State as funding becomes available. We will organize professionally curated WCB exhibits in some of these locations in partnership with the federal government & large transit agencies to seed the ground for an expansion of the larger Modern Rosies project.\r\nRegional transportation agencies such as LA Metro, Metrolink, Long Beach transit, California High Speed Rail and a new high speed rail line between LA and Las Vegas have projected many billions of dollars’ worth of projects for which there will be RFPs for manufacturers over the next 10-20 years. We will continue to work with these agencies to ensure that recruitment, training, hiring & support for women workers will be a priority in each of these RFPs.  Overall, we believe that, with a strong program, LA can continue to attract and retain large bus, railcar and related parts factories to the LA region and create a model, modern manufacturing sector that reflects the values of inclusion and diversity that are part of the LA 2050 plan.\r\nWhile hiring and inclusion of women in major industries has been a renewed topic of conversation in major media, that discussion has primarily focused on hiring of professional women and support for women in executive positions.  The fact that women are so unwelcome and excluded from LA’s heavy manufacturing workforce (where jobs tend to be better than in the growing retail, service and food processing sectors) is seldom discussed in the media or in the halls of political power.  The reality is that women have to muster huge courage to apply to be welders and electricians in LA factories in the face of so much prejudice and harassment.  That is why the Modern Rosies project is a crucial component of an agenda for a progressive LA future and will continue to grow in LA and around the country,\r\n\r\n"
