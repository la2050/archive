title: Manufacturing Opportunities for Modern Day Rosies
project_summary: "Rosie the Riveter illustrated how women factory workers could fill manufacturing jobs during WW II. Today women workers have few opportunities in the US transit manufacturing industry.  The Modern Rosies Project aims to recruit women to factory jobs and influence manufacturers to hire women. Our travelling exhibit of modern day Rosie the Riveters raises awareness of the hardworking and capable women who are building America’s 21st century transportation and reminds people that women CAN build\r\n"

'In one sentence, please describe what your organization does': "Modern Rosies aims to attract women—Rosie the Riveters—to the manufacturing jobs created by the work of Jobs to Move America, a project of LAANE that uses public procurement of equipment, such as buses and trains, to jump start manufacturing in LA.\r\n"

Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: "Jobs to Move America advocates for policies that incentivize creation of quality jobs when transit agencies like LA Metro procure buses & railcars. Through the Modern Rosies Project, we will increase recruitment, training, hiring & support & promote equity & safety programs for women in the LA transit manufacturing industry.\r\nWe will do this by advocating for strong policy language supporting women’s equal inclusion in manufacturing jobs to be adopted by transit agencies as part of the bidding documents under the JMA US Employment Plan & by manufacturers through JMA partner agreements. The Modern Rosies project is part of this advocacy.\r\nThe Modern Rosies project will seek to: Change perception of women’s roles & abilities in the manufacturing workplace; create opportunities for women in transit manufacturing; highlight the issues facing women in manufacturing & promote women’s achievements in the industry. \r\nWe will:\r\nAddress discrimination, sexual harassment, wage, & leadership gaps, & use policy and education to change the industry’s approach to hiring, training, & promoting women, & develop or strengthen programs to train & support women in manufacturing.\r\nWin policy language with LA Metro and other regional transit agencies that sets standards for hiring, promotion, training & retention policies & practices and work with companies on best practices.\r\nBring women’s groups into our LA coalition and build a network of supporting groups.\r\nEstablish a women only Pre-Employment Training Program & a pilot program for welding & electrical workers.\r\nCoordinate job training, job placement, support & retention services provided by our partners.\r\nChoose an employer to implement a pilot program for women in the industry.\r\nWork with training providers & employers to recruit more women & place them in manufacturing jobs.\r\nSupport women workers with on-the-job mentoring, women’s peer groups, professional development, links to support services, & leadership development.\r\nThe outcomes of the project will be:\r\nThe WomenCanBuild exhibit is shown in at least one other location in LA, such as Cal Tech.\r\nAt least a 10% increase in representation of women in LA’s transit manufacturing workforce over five years.\r\nReduced complaints of discrimination & harassment. \r\nSuccessful outreach program to women & girls.\r\nDeveloped pipeline for women to enter manufacturing with support systems\r\n\r\n"
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "The work will be evaluated based on data from transit agencies, employers and our partner organizations as well as surveys of women workers and employers of women and independent research.\r\nOur primary criteria for evaluating the success of WomenCanBuild over time will be:\r\nThe number of women hired for transit manufacturing jobs in the region \r\nThe % of women in LA transit manufacturing compared to the national rate of 13% \r\nThe experience of those women based on surveys.\r\nThe experience of employers with their women employees based on surveys\r\nThe increase in manufacturing activity in the LA region and particularly transit manufacturing.\r\nThe number of formerly incarcerated women and women veterans who receive training and are hired in manufacturing jobs.\r\nThe recruitment and retention rates for women in manufacturing.\r\nNumber of transit manufacturing jobs created in the region\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
