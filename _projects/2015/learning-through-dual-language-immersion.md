  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "Substantial research and scholarly articles have touted the benefits of bilingual and multilingual education as a means of increasing connectivity among groups, overcoming stereotypes, creating stronger social bonds and increasing both the intelligence and emotional state of students as they become adults. \r\n\r\nEducation Secretary Arne Duncan has regularly voiced his support and the need for additional resources to be devoted to dual language instruction as a means for creating more well-rounded native English speakers and increasing the graduation and success rates of English-language learners.\r\n\r\nThe 90-10 model, which is based off Canada's model of teaching native English speakers French and vice versa, has shown that those immersed in a two-way language educational model from elementary school often outperform their peers who are only learning in one language, including in language arts and math.\r\n\r\nThe California Department of Education lists 201 current schools that offer some form of dual immersion, 58 of which are located in Los Angeles County, which represents almost 30% of all dual immersion programs in California.  This year, the Association of Two-Way & Dual Language Education (ATDLE), a national organization providing resources and implementation for dual immersion programs throughout the United States, awarded Patrick Henry Elementary with its Certificate of Excellence Award for dual language education.  Only one school is given the award per year out of more than 1,000 dual immersion schools overseen by ATDLE.\r\n\r\nThe award and longstanding success of Patrick Henry Elementary demonstrates why the Patrick Henry Foundation is  positioned to make Los Angeles the best to learn.  Last year, we funded iPads and 3D printers for two pilot projects at Patrick Henry Elementary and neighboring Keller Middle School.  The iPads are being used to incorporate digital learning methods into the dual language model with great success.  Likewise, the 3D printer pilot project has enabled increased creativity and art through experiential learning.\r\n\r\nAdditional resources will allow the Patrick Henry Foundation to convert the successes of the pilot project into fully funded ongoing educational opportunities throughout Los Angeles.  \r\n\r\nThe Patrick Henry Foundation also created a program entitled Beyond the Bell that offers a variety of enrichment courses both before and after school, including chess, music and engineering.  Extra funding would increase this programs reach. \r\n"

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "One of the barriers that we have faced to date, and will likely continue to face, is the administrative delays that are often associated with large public school districts.  For example, iPads purchased through Long Beach Unified or another school district in Los Angeles are property of the school, are maintained by them and insured by them.  However, there are significant delays from the date of purchase to the date of delivery that often prevent organizations from being able to quickly adapt to new technologies and needs.\r\n\r\nOne way we have overcome this barrier is by making direct purchases through the foundation and donating them to the specific school site, which enables us to monitor the resources, track them, insure them and exercise greater control.  In doing so, we can cut through delays when needed and innovate far quicker than we would be able to do otherwise."
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Our board regularly meets to evaluate the progress of the foundation.  We have internal policies and procedures in place to track the data with respect to how our donations have benefited the school and what programs are working more than others.\r\n\r\nFortunately, we have been able to target highly dedicated teachers and staff members who volunteer their time because they want the additional educational tools and resources the foundation can provide outside the normal channels from a publicly funded request.  As a result, the staff and teachers, who are liaisons to the board, monitor and report back on the programs implemented by the foundation, which we then double check.\r\n\r\nThe foundation also conducts annual surveys of staff, faculty, students and parents of the schools we service in order to obtain feedback.  Our 2014 survey results, in conjunction with the California Office to Reform Education (CORE) survey, demonstrates Patrick Henry is one of the highest rated programs."
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "There are other Los Angeles based non-profit organizations focused on providing extracurricular and enrichment opportunities to students beginning in elementary school.  There are also organizations formed out of parent endowed programs from specific elementary schools, middles schools and high schools that raise funds to enhance educational opportunities.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Patrick Henry Foundation is unique in that its focus is on expanding education and social bonds through dual language learning and arts.  We have modeled ourselves on the best practices of other foundations and organizations that have a similar focus on single language learning and combined those practices with organizations that promote cultural diversity and language skills.\r\n\r\nIn doing so, we have created a niche focus in the dual immersion and language arts sector of elementary schools and our goal is grow our programs and export our model to other neighboring schools to increase bilingual and multilingual education and arts."
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "The Patrick Henry Foundation is a standalone organization.  While we have received directed funds from various organizations, such as the WM Keck Foundation, for science-related projects, we do not have direct partners or collaborators who would receive a portion of any funds granted.  \r\n\r\nThat said, several other neighboring schools have contacted the foundation and expressed an interest in having similar organizations established at their respective school sites.  Additional funds would enable the foundation to export our programs to other elementary schools in need.\r\n\r\nShould the grant be awarded, the entirety of the funds would be accounted for in creating and implementing dual language education programs and pilot projects at our current location, which are in great need, with the goal of expanding our reach to other neighboring institutions if applicable."
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': "In 2014, the foundation raised just over $58,000, with 84% being donated directly back to various project funding requests of the school, teachers, staff, parents and students (all with a focus on dual language learning).\r\n\r\nWe are currently on target to double the amount of funds raised this year through direct donations from parents and stakeholders, partnerships with local businesses and various fundraising events that raise awareness about dual language learning.  \r\n\r\nGrant funding is an additional resource that will enable us to cover the unfunded requests of our faculty, teachers and students, which are voluminous.  For example, converting the iPad pilot project into a fully funded project at just Patrick Henry Elementary would cost more than $60,000 for equipment, training and implementation.  Those costs would reduce for subsequent years until equipment needed to be replaced, which we estimate to be every 2-3 years.\r\n\r\nWhile the grant would cover a substantial amount of requests, there are always needs for additional funds in public schools to increase educational opportunities for students."
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Our project goals are constantly developing based on requests of teachers, faculty, students and parents, with the approval and oversight of the foundation.\r\n\r\nA $100,000 grant would be used to expand current pilot programs and purchase additional equipment and tools for dual language learning as follows:\r\n\r\n1) $62,715.91 would allow us to purchase 5 iPads, cases, and insurance, with taxes and shipping, for each of the 19 classrooms in need (dual language and arts skills);\r\n2) $6,500 for purchase of applications, software and licensing for dual language programs (dual language skills);\r\n3) $2,500 for training on implementation of new equipment in classroom (dual language skills);\r\n4) $25,165 for 7 Robo 3D printers and 7 HP Stream 13 inch laptops with printing filament and taxes included (dual language engineering and arts skills);\r\n5) $3,119.09 for increased Beyond the Bell learning programs (dual language, arts, engineering, music and cultural courses)\r\n\r\nCost overruns covered by foundation."
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    A successful grant application and implementation of the proposed projects
    would allow the foundation to leverage our current stakeholders for
    additional targeted contributions.  Success tends to beget success and if
    our current donors, local businesses and parent community are able to see
    the results on a grand scale, we can use those successes to increase our
    likelihood of obtaining ongoing funds from other sources.
