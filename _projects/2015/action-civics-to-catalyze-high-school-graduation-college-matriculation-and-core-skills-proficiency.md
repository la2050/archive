project_summary: >-
  JSA has had substantial success in forming a partnership with Alliance College
  Ready Public Schools to provide our model to their students. Based on this
  early success, we are proposing a scale-up that will bring our work to
  thousands more Alliance students, helping them develop professional and
  personal skills, graduate on-time, and complete college. The partnership will
  help students form on-campus "Action Civics" clubs as well as attend regional
  events and residential summer programs.
