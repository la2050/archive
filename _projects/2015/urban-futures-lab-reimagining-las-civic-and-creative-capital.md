  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: "Urban Futures Lab creates work that matters. It reimagines Los Angeles’ civic and creative capital by altering how young adults from under-resourced communities of color access opportunities that employ their inventiveness and support their professional aspirations. The Lab provides young adult Fellows with career-building skills that simultaneously strengthen the region through work of social consequence. It prepares Fellows to pursue higher-earning professions that require varied skill sets through direct work on Public Matters projects. Unlike conventional service learning or workforce development programs that focus on “the job, ” the Lab focuses on Fellows’ career arcs. \r\n\r\nYoung adults have the financial imperative to work, the desire to pursue meaningful work, but lack outlets, professional networks, or structure. Often, those pursuing higher education don’t have access to paid civic opportunities. Most young adults lack the on-going mentorship and support essential for their educational and professional growth. For those who desire to work in cross-disciplinary fields or create their own jobs, the challenges are even greater. They are even more formidable for young adults from resource-poor LA neighborhoods. \r\n\r\nThrough Urban Futures Lab, Public Matters senior staff act as project leaders and mentors, guiding Fellows’ work in LA neighborhoods. Fellows work in project-based teams, interacting with Public Matters’ vast network of multi-sector partners and collaborators. \r\n\r\nUrban Futures Lab Fellows are paid living wages to use creative, visual and critical thinking skills in neighborhood-based projects. Fellows participate in regular expert-led workshops and trainings. Concentrated summer labs and retreats add in-depth learning. Fellows gain career and life skills that include: \r\n\r\n•\tProject Conceptualization, Design, and Implementation\r\n•\tLeadership and Communication\r\n•\tCommunity Engagement and Relationship Building \r\n•\tPublic Speaking, Performances and Presentations\r\n•\tMentoring \r\n•\tCreative Skills (including Media Production, Social Marketing + Design)\r\n•\tPersonal and Community Health\r\n•\tCultural and Economic Development\r\n\r\nAnticipated projects include Hidden Hi Fi, an arts and cultural economic development project in Historic Filipinotown; an urban planning and design project with East LA high school students; assisting the LA Kitchen to develop a line of healthy, affordable snacks; and Market Makeovers that address healthy food access."

   Young adults have the financial imperative to work, the desire to pursue meaningful work, but lack outlets, professional networks, or structure.

   Through Urban Futures Lab, Public Matters senior staff act as project leaders and mentors, guiding Fellows’ work in LA neighborhoods. Fellows work in project-based teams, interacting with Public Matters’ vast network of multi-sector partners and collaborators. 
   
   Urban Futures Lab Fellows are paid living wages to use creative, visual and critical thinking skills in neighborhood-based projects. Fellows participate in regular expert-led workshops and trainings. Concentrated summer labs and retreats add in-depth learning. Fellows gain career and life skills that include: 
   
   • Project Conceptualization, Design, and Implementation
   • Leadership and Communication
   • Community Engagement and Relationship Building 
   • Public Speaking, Performances and Presentations
   • Mentoring 
   • Creative Skills (including Media Production, Social Marketing + Design)
   • Personal and Community Health
   • Cultural and Economic Development
   
   Anticipated projects include Hidden Hi Fi, an arts and cultural economic development project in Historic Filipinotown; an urban planning and design project with East LA high school students; assisting the LA Kitchen to develop a line of healthy, affordable snacks; and Market Makeovers that address healthy food access.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Urban Futures Lab must overcome the dual pressures of time and money faced by
  young adults of limited means. Fellows will include college students, recent
  graduates and part-time students – many trapped in the web of financial aid,
  overcrowded classes, and family pressures. 
   
   Scheduling is a challenge. Our projects take place across LA. Some Fellows can only travel via public transit. Public Matters’ flexible team-based project model can accommodate both geography and diverse schedules. Whenever possible, Fellows work in their own or nearby communities, addressing aforementioned transportation concerns while strengthening local knowledge and investment in projects. 
   
   To address financial concerns, we will provide Fellows with living wages and sufficient hours to circumvent the need for other, lower-paying, unskilled jobs. Through one-on-one mentoring, senior staff will work with Fellows to design schedules that support their educational and professional goals.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We will evaluate two tracks: Fellows’ learning/career development and Fellows’
  impact on LA neighborhoods. 
   
   We will evaluate learning/career development at various points during a Fellows’ tenure through metrics including: contribution to projects; quality of work; partner/client feedback. We will gauge written, verbal and visual communication skills, time management, project implementation and capacity for independent work. Fellows will maintain a portfolio with client references and their own reflections, allowing us to track their progress. 
   
   To assess Public Matters and Fellows’ impact on neighborhoods, we will use evaluation methods that track their contributions as part of Public Matters’ projects. In general, we employ mixed-methods evaluations – quantitative (surveys) and qualitative data (structured interviews and direct observation). Fellows will participate as both subjects and participants in our research, and thereby expand their own research skill set.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Most programs for young adults of color tend to focus on the extremes:
  advancement opportunities for the “cream of the crop;” safety nets for the
  most at-risk. Our experience of working with youth of color for 10 years at
  Public Matters and for decades independently tells us that the talent pool is
  deeper than currently recognized: the proverbial cream is thicker than
  thought. There are countless talented, committed, smart and capable young
  adults of color who are hindered by systemic problems of poor education,
  poverty and associated health and social stresses. 
   
   Urban Futures Lab is an atypical workforce development program. Most programs, particularly those serving low-income communities of color, focus on a singular vocation. The Lab prepares Fellows for careers at the intersection of arts, business, media, public health, urban planning, and community change, among others. It trains them in hard and soft skills that translate across industries and professions, and prepares them to thrive in a 21st century job market. Young adults today will change jobs with more frequency than their predecessors. The Lab also engrains in Fellows the belief that careers driven by commitment to civics, community, and equity are both viable and accessible. 
   
   The central distinguishing feature of Urban Futures Lab is its Fellowship structure. The Fellowship prioritizes continued learning, collaborative group work, case studies, professional networking and mentoring—beyond just performance of daily work tasks. A key component will be regularly scheduled lunch and career-building workshops that expose Fellows to professionals in their fields of interest. Many of our potential Fellows, particularly those who have been exposed to Public Matters’ interdisciplinary work as high school students, are looking for jobs that don’t fit narrow categorizations. A hybrid urban planning/ public health/community activist only finds their way—whether they come from resources or not—if they have access to the right mentors, networks and guidance. Public Matters will draw on, and build, its vast network of partners and collaborators (large and small institutions and organizations, universities and local businesses) to ensure that Fellows access forward-thinking and inspiring individuals.
   
   Our goal is to equip these young adults with the skills to access professions with higher earning potential, in careers that fully realize their creativity, ambition, and commitment to community.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Public Matters work is predicated on partnerships. As a social enterprise, we
  also rely on a client-based, earned-income model. The LA2050 award lowers the
  barriers for entry, and clients’ cost to work with Public Matters and Urban
  Futures Lab. It also supports the Fellowship component of the Lab. Therefore,
  partners will receive Public Matters and Fellows’ services but they will not
  receive direct funds from the LA2050 award. 
   
   Among the partnerships and projects that we anticipate will be part of Fellows’ work and training over the next two years are: 
   
   • Hidden Hi Fi, an arts, culture and equitable development project with the Pilipino Workers Center, Big City Forum and Metro in Historic Filipinotown. Hidden Hi Fi illuminates neighborhood assets through interactive events, tours, and experiences. Fellows lead cultural tours, build relationships with local businesses, develop revenue-sharing models, and create marketing materials for Jeepney tours. Fellows learn business, marketing, public speaking, community history, and community development skills. 
   
   • An urban planning and design project with East LA Renaissance Academy (ELARA). Fellows, likely some past ELARA graduates, will mentor teens and develop leadership, communications, design and planning skills. 
   
   • “B.O.S.S.” (The Bureau Of Super Snacks/ Bocadillos Optimizados Súper Saludables), a program with the LA Kitchen to provide low-cost healthy, nutritious and culturally appropriate snacks on LA’s eastside. Fellows will undertake product planning and development of a healthy snack line, including branding, social marketing, and community outreach and partnership development. Fellows will work directly with local organizations, schools and institutional partners. Additional skills gained will include Food Manager’s certifications and food handling training, product development, healthy eating and nutrition, financial literacy, business development and promotion.
   
   • Market Makeover projects to improve healthy food access. Fellows will lead the physical transformation of existing corner stores; education and community engagement; and social marketing to change health behaviors and increase fresh fruit and vegetable consumption. Potential projects include a project in Elysian Valley with River Wild LLC. 
   
   • A partnership with the LA Times Youth site, highschool.latimes.com, will also allow Fellows and community members to contribute media about projects and neighborhoods.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Our plan is to scale carefully and gradually. This is particularly true in
  what is a pilot phase for the Lab. Scaling up means going deeper with projects
  and relationships, and increasing the level of services and social change we
  can offer a client, the surrounding community, and Fellows. 
   
   Our first priority is to make sure the Lab meets our Fellows’ needs and aspirations as they grow through the program. As the Lab grows, we will increase the range of projects and locations offered to Fellows. Greater geographic and content diversity will build Fellows’ knowledge and awareness of the region, expanding their networks and skill sets. We will expose Fellows to different neighborhoods, food, cultures, and customs. With growth, we will facilitate field trips and visits to places and groups doing innovative work in LA. 
   
   We also plan to create partnerships with community colleges and business development programs to provide entrepreneurial training and college credit to Fellows. 
   
   We intend to develop partnerships with groups that have the capacity to hire Fellows as they complete their time with the Lab. Groups like PolicyLink have told us that while they recruit from well respected universities, these hires often lack knowledge of how communities function. Fellows hailing from communities served by groups like PolicyLink and savvy in community processes, would be ideal hires. 
   
   Public Matters’ work has a multiplier effect. We have seen this time and again. Our projects strengthen individuals and communities. For example, in Market Makeovers, students learn about healthy eating and nutrition, change their diet, their families’ diet, and help their parents lose weight. Parents become advocates and share the information with friends and relatives. Students lead healthy cooking demonstrations and decide to enter related fields like nutrition, public health, and planning. They plan to return to help their communities. In “The Truth About Flavor,” we worked with South LA high school students to create media about small flavored cigarillos. We built a partnership with the City Attorney’s Tobacco Enforcement Program. Students’ media played a role in the City’s recent decision to enforce greater penalties on tobacco sales to minors and to create a new Responsible Retailer Initiative. Public Matters’ goal is to continue to deepen and improve our engagement with young adults and prepare them for vibrant careers as creative thinkers and civic leaders.
