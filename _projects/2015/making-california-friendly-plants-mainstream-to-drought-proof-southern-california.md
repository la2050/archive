  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    Number of households converted to California friendly landscaping.  Our
    target with this hundred thousand dollars: 1,000,000 households with
    California friendly landscaping across Southern California.  We're working
    closely with academic researchers using NAIP satellite imagery to study the
    diffusion of California friendly plants and will use the results of that
    study to help evaluate how many Californians this campaign converts to new
    landscaping.  In addition, for a separate yet synergistic project we're
    working on pioneering a voluntary, bottom-up effort to put the entire
    lifecycle of California's water usage data in a centralized platform.  That
    database will enable us to ask at a granular level the actual water savings
    of shifting to California friendly plants and target areas for future
    landscape maintenance education.
