  'DESCRIBE IN GREATER DETAIL HOW YOU WILL MAKE LA THE HEALTHIEST PLACE TO LIVE: ': "California faces its worst drought in over a century, compounding long term trends. The state's water supply system was largely built a generation ago for a state with half the population, and in recent years California's key water supply resources in the Bay Delta and Colorado river are under stress from rising usage, climate change, and long-term geological damage.\r\n\r\nOn April 1, 2015, Governor Brown stood in the Sierras in an empty field normally five feet deep in snow at this time of year and declared a historically unprecedented statewide 25% urban water conservation mandate. With outdoor landscaping representing roughly half of urban water usage, Governor Brown and the water community have identified ornamental lawns as a key opportunity in the larger effort to increase water conservation.\r\n\r\nFor generations, lawns have occupied a special place in the California mind.  The Post WWII era saw abundant material wealth and water supplies, which manifested in lush lawns and landscaping.  D.J. Waldie memorialized this lifestyle in his book “Holy Land.”\r\n \r\n“The seven model yards were planted with mature shrubs and full lawns… Buyers waited in line, some watching their children in a supervised playground.”\r\n \r\nFormer State Librarian Kevin Starr highlights the broader connection to suburban life in his book “Golden Dreams.”\r\n \r\n“…a place where middle class Americans might love, reproduce, succeed, fail, live, and die in American circumstances enlivened by day-to-day hope and immemorial pleasures, struggles, questions and rhythms of daily life.” \r\n \r\nWe’re launching this campaign to educate the next generation of Californians on how simply shifting from thirsty ornamental lawns to California friendly landscaping can increase our drought resiliency dramatically and deepen our connection to our community.\r\n\r\nRather than struggling like Biggie Badger and his friends with over-the-top water conservation actions like bathing halfway or skipping showers, we can save the water we need simply by converting lawns we aren’t using for anything except decoration to beautiful drought friendly landscaping.\r\n\r\nMoreover, this generational shift in outdoor landscaping offers a great opportunity to get to know your neighbors and understand how we’re all dependent on the environment that was here before us.  \r\n"

  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    Number of households converted to California friendly landscaping.  Our
    target with this hundred thousand dollars: 1,000,000 households with
    California friendly landscaping across Southern California.  We're working
    closely with academic researchers using NAIP satellite imagery to study the
    diffusion of California friendly plants and will use the results of that
    study to help evaluate how many Californians this campaign converts to new
    landscaping.  In addition, for a separate yet synergistic project we're
    working on pioneering a voluntary, bottom-up effort to put the entire
    lifecycle of California's water usage data in a centralized platform.  That
    database will enable us to ask at a granular level the actual water savings
    of shifting to California friendly plants and target areas for future
    landscape maintenance education. 
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "We are laser focused on California friendly plants as the next frontier of water conservation.  The water community is spending millions of dollars on general conservation messaging yet there's a big opportunity in public education focused on California friendly plants.  The history of water conservation market transformation (low flow toilets for example) has shown that transforming conservation behavior requires an integrated regional approach.  That's exactly what this campaign will deliver.\r\n\r\nMore than one-half of California’s urban water usage goes to outdoor landscaping, and in making California friendly plants mainstream, Southern California has the opportunity to cut that usage by more than half, achieving a million acre feet in sustainable conservation.  SCWC’s California Friendly Plant Campaign will build on the unprecedented regional turf rebate momentum -- the largest outdoor rebate program in American history -- and many recently browned lawns to achieve a “tipping point” in making California friendly plants mainstream with the big goal of converting one million households to California friendly landscaping in six months.  "
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "The Southern California Water Committee (SCWC) has deep relationships with the water community and civic leadership across the region.  We intend to continue to work closely with the Metropolitan Water District, LADWP, Moulton Niguel Water District, Upper San Gabriel Water District, Foothill Municipal Water District and countless other water utilities.  In addition, we will leverage our \"civic reach\" through our board and ask the Good community to help extend this campaign from that base into community nonprofits, local schools, and across the spectrum of civic life.\r\n\r\nWe recognize that this historic drought is an issue that demands that all of us -- water managers, teachers, environmentalists, video artists, and everyone else that calls this place home -- work together as Californians.\r\n\r\nClimate change challenges future water supply assumptions, yet by working smartly and collaboratively, we can prepare California for whatever the future holds.  This positive, proactive public education campaign represents a golden opportunity to build on momentum in turf rebates and seize the opportunity to plant seeds for California’s sustainable water future this winter. "
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': "We have budgeted $250,000 for the campaign.  We anticipated substantial in-kind resources from our utility partners (such as workshop and materials production) along with coordinating existing resources and public education efforts.  In addition, we are currently fundraising through additional grant sources and water community working relationships.  This campaign is flexible and can scale up or down depending on the level of resources we receive.  Additional funding will be used to develop a \"micro-VC\" fund to strategically fund actions by community organizations like the YMCA to help make California friendly plants mainstream.  This investment will pay long term dividends, and as a back of the envelope calculation, the value of a million acre-feet of demand reduction across the next 50 years is worth over $18 billion in today's dollars assuming a 5% hyperbolic discount rate.  \r\n\r\nYet with ~2% market penetration from rebates, we are firmly in the early phase of making CA friendly plants mainstream and the path forward to turf market transformation is by no means guaranteed.  Imagine two very possible scenarios of where we could be a year from now:\r\n\r\n1.\tBalkanized efforts lead to lost momentum towards market transformation\r\nUtilities are confused about the next step in market transformation after rebates and there's lots of balkanized ad hoc efforts – varying rebates without a regional focus, sprinklings of workshops, etc.  After spending half a billion dollars and forcing people to brown out their lawns, the rain returns this winter and many Californians re-establish their lawns.  CA friendly plants don't become mainstream and most folks think native plants mean cactus.  \r\n2.\tIntegrated effort reaches the tipping point to turf market transformation\r\nThe water community coordinates it's marketing and public education efforts in partnership with community nonprofits like California Native Plant Society, CA Conservation Corps and a host of other local groups.  That sustained, focused community level effort aligns with regional marketing messages to make CA friendly plants mainstream and beautiful drought tolerant yards become an environmental status symbol like a Tesla or Prius.  This \"new normal\" of CA friendly plants doesn't mean eliminating all turf for purposes like sports or children playing though removing the vast majority of ornamental turf saves Southern California a million acre feet in demand and safeguards our water future.\r\n\r\nLet's choose 2."

The Big Drought offers an engaging children's story and CNPS approved curriculum in order to encourage children to come home and convince their parents to convert to CA friendly plants.

   • Benchmark water and energy use across customers, customer classes, and utilities;
   • Assess the effectiveness of demand management strategies within a utility and across utilities;
   • Improve the effectiveness of data generated from AMI systems;
   • Improve demand forecasts for water wholesalers;
   • Streamline and standardize reporting to the California Urban Water Conservation Council, state agencies, and other agencies and organizations;
   • Better understand the impacts of various conservation actions including but not limited to rebates, public education, and marketing;
   • Evaluate the effectiveness and equity of different rate structures;
   • Assess the effectiveness of utilities’ responses within a particular utility as well as across utilities to past and present state mandated actions;
   • Identify the current utility data landscape;
   • Identify gaps and challenges in data collection and management;
   • Merge utility data with data outside the utility (e.g., account-level water or energy use with U.S. Census data) to explore a broad range of hypotheses and questions;
   • Drive innovation in the water and energy sectors.

    answer: "California faces its worst drought in over a century, compounding long term trends. The state's water supply system was largely built a generation ago for a state with half the population, and in recent years California's key water supply resources in the Bay Delta and Colorado river are under stress from rising usage, climate change, and long-term geological damage.\r\n\r\nOn April 1, 2015, Governor Brown stood in the Sierras in an empty field normally five feet deep in snow at this time of year and declared a historically unprecedented statewide 25% urban water conservation mandate. With outdoor landscaping representing roughly half of urban water usage, Governor Brown and the water community have identified ornamental lawns as a key opportunity in the larger effort to increase water conservation.\r\n\r\nFor generations, lawns have occupied a special place in the California mind.  The Post WWII era saw abundant material wealth and water supplies, which manifested in lush lawns and landscaping.  D.J. Waldie memorialized this lifestyle in his book “Holy Land.”\r\n \r\n“The seven model yards were planted with mature shrubs and full lawns… Buyers waited in line, some watching their children in a supervised playground.”\r\n \r\nFormer State Librarian Kevin Starr highlights the broader connection to suburban life in his book “Golden Dreams.”\r\n \r\n“…a place where middle class Americans might love, reproduce, succeed, fail, live, and die in American circumstances enlivened by day-to-day hope and immemorial pleasures, struggles, questions and rhythms of daily life.” \r\n \r\nWe’re launching this campaign to educate the next generation of Californians on how simply shifting from thirsty ornamental lawns to California friendly landscaping can increase our drought resiliency dramatically and deepen our connection to our community.\r\n\r\nRather than struggling like Biggie Badger and his friends with over-the-top water conservation actions like bathing halfway or skipping showers, we can save the water we need simply by converting lawns we aren’t using for anything except decoration to beautiful drought friendly landscaping.\r\n\r\nMoreover, this generational shift in outdoor landscaping offers a great opportunity to get to know your neighbors and understand how we’re all dependent on the environment that was here before us.  \r\n"

    answer: "Far too many people think the plants native to Los Angeles start and end with cactus.  As Irvine Ranch’s Water Issue Survey from June 2015 illustrates, “customers are not aware of the potential of drought-tolerant landscaping to be more than a “desert” look.”  We're going to confront that barrier head on by showing how beautiful California friendly plants can be and educating families on the merits of drought friendly landscaping.\r\n\r\nWe're working with a big coalition across the water community and So Cal civic life to change this landscape paradigm.  Bringing together leading water utilities, nonprofit partners and civic data science talent, this project is focused on supporting and building on existing water community efforts to break through those myths and achieve a “tipping point” towards market transformation. \r\n\r\nThe goal is to show the value of California friendly plants so that the \"new normal\" of outdoor landscaping is drought tolerant.\r\n\r\n"

      Number of households converted to California friendly landscaping.  Our
      target with this hundred thousand dollars: 1,000,000 households with
      California friendly landscaping across Southern California.  We're working
      closely with academic researchers using NAIP satellite imagery to study
      the diffusion of California friendly plants and will use the results of
      that study to help evaluate how many Californians this campaign converts
      to new landscaping.  In addition, for a separate yet synergistic project
      we're working on pioneering a voluntary, bottom-up effort to put the
      entire lifecycle of California's water usage data in a centralized
      platform.  That database will enable us to ask at a granular level the
      actual water savings of shifting to California friendly plants and target
      areas for future landscape maintenance education.

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "We are laser focused on California friendly plants as the next frontier of water conservation.  The water community is spending millions of dollars on general conservation messaging yet there's a big opportunity in public education focused on California friendly plants.  The history of water conservation market transformation (low flow toilets for example) has shown that transforming conservation behavior requires an integrated regional approach.  That's exactly what this campaign will deliver.\r\n\r\nMore than one-half of California’s urban water usage goes to outdoor landscaping, and in making California friendly plants mainstream, Southern California has the opportunity to cut that usage by more than half, achieving a million acre feet in sustainable conservation.  SCWC’s California Friendly Plant Campaign will build on the unprecedented regional turf rebate momentum -- the largest outdoor rebate program in American history -- and many recently browned lawns to achieve a “tipping point” in making California friendly plants mainstream with the big goal of converting one million households to California friendly landscaping in six months.

    answer: "The Southern California Water Committee (SCWC) has deep relationships with the water community and civic leadership across the region.  We intend to continue to work closely with the Metropolitan Water District, LADWP, Moulton Niguel Water District, Upper San Gabriel Water District, Foothill Municipal Water District and countless other water utilities.  In addition, we will leverage our \"civic reach\" through our board and ask the Good community to help extend this campaign from that base into community nonprofits, local schools, and across the spectrum of civic life.\r\n\r\nWe recognize that this historic drought is an issue that demands that all of us -- water managers, teachers, environmentalists, video artists, and everyone else that calls this place home -- work together as Californians.\r\n\r\nClimate change challenges future water supply assumptions, yet by working smartly and collaboratively, we can prepare California for whatever the future holds.  This positive, proactive public education campaign represents a golden opportunity to build on momentum in turf rebates and seize the opportunity to plant seeds for California’s sustainable water future this winter.

      How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you
      cover the additional costs?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "We have budgeted $250,000 for the campaign.  We anticipated substantial in-kind resources from our utility partners (such as workshop and materials production) along with coordinating existing resources and public education efforts.  In addition, we are currently fundraising through additional grant sources and water community working relationships.  This campaign is flexible and can scale up or down depending on the level of resources we receive.  Additional funding will be used to develop a \"micro-VC\" fund to strategically fund actions by community organizations like the YMCA to help make California friendly plants mainstream.  This investment will pay long term dividends, and as a back of the envelope calculation, the value of a million acre-feet of demand reduction across the next 50 years is worth over $18 billion in today's dollars assuming a 5% hyperbolic discount rate.  \r\n\r\nYet with ~2% market penetration from rebates, we are firmly in the early phase of making CA friendly plants mainstream and the path forward to turf market transformation is by no means guaranteed.  Imagine two very possible scenarios of where we could be a year from now:\r\n\r\n1.\tBalkanized efforts lead to lost momentum towards market transformation\r\nUtilities are confused about the next step in market transformation after rebates and there's lots of balkanized ad hoc efforts – varying rebates without a regional focus, sprinklings of workshops, etc.  After spending half a billion dollars and forcing people to brown out their lawns, the rain returns this winter and many Californians re-establish their lawns.  CA friendly plants don't become mainstream and most folks think native plants mean cactus.  \r\n2.\tIntegrated effort reaches the tipping point to turf market transformation\r\nThe water community coordinates it's marketing and public education efforts in partnership with community nonprofits like California Native Plant Society, CA Conservation Corps and a host of other local groups.  That sustained, focused community level effort aligns with regional marketing messages to make CA friendly plants mainstream and beautiful drought tolerant yards become an environmental status symbol like a Tesla or Prius.  This \"new normal\" of CA friendly plants doesn't mean eliminating all turf for purposes like sports or children playing though removing the vast majority of ornamental turf saves Southern California a million acre feet in demand and safeguards our water future.\r\n\r\nLet's choose 2."

    answer: "The data science work in this public education campaign integrates into a long term strategy to drought proof Southern California.  A group of leading water utilities are working together to put the entire lifecycle of California's water usage data in a centralized cloud platform through a new initiative called the \"California Water Data Collaborative\" being developed in partnership with UC Davis Center for Water and Energy Efficiency and the California Urban Water Conservation Council.  This project offers a long term investment in improved data infrastructure across the water community with a spectrum of operational efficiency and demand management benefits.  Analytical experts can work together to achieve water efficiency to:\r\n•\tCollaborate within and across utilities, as well as with a range of other stakeholders;\r\n•\tImprove utility system performance, including leak loss detection and repair, pressure management, and prioritization of projects within capital improvement programs;\r\n•\tBenchmark water and energy use across customers, customer classes, and utilities;\r\n•\tAssess the effectiveness of demand management strategies within a utility and across utilities;\r\n•\tImprove the effectiveness of data generated from AMI systems;\r\n•\tImprove demand forecasts for water wholesalers;\r\n•\tStreamline and standardize reporting to the California Urban Water Conservation Council, state agencies, and other agencies and organizations;\r\n•\tBetter understand the impacts of various conservation actions including but not limited to rebates, public education, and marketing;\r\n•\tEvaluate the effectiveness and equity of different rate structures;\r\n•\tAssess the effectiveness of utilities’ responses within a particular utility as well as across utilities to past and present state mandated actions;\r\n•\tIdentify the current utility data landscape;\r\n•\tIdentify gaps and challenges in data collection and management;\r\n•\tMerge utility data with data outside the utility (e.g., account-level water or energy use with U.S. Census data) to explore a broad range of hypotheses and questions;\r\n•\tDrive innovation in the water and energy sectors.\r\n\r\nIn the twentieth century, California's invested in pioneering physical infrastructure to safeguard our water future and create an unprecedented era of water supply.  This new virtual infrastructure will ensure California's water future into the next century by powering an unprecedented era of water efficiency.\r\n"
