  'DESCRIBE IN GREATER DETAIL HOW YOU WILL MAKE LA THE HEALTHIEST PLACE TO LIVE: ': "California faces its worst drought in over a century, compounding long term trends. The state's water supply system was largely built a generation ago for a state with half the population, and in recent years California's key water supply resources in the Bay Delta and Colorado river are under stress from rising usage, climate change, and long-term geological damage.\r\n\r\nOn April 1, 2015, Governor Brown stood in the Sierras in an empty field normally five feet deep in snow at this time of year and declared a historically unprecedented statewide 25% urban water conservation mandate. With outdoor landscaping representing roughly half of urban water usage, Governor Brown and the water community have identified ornamental lawns as a key opportunity in the larger effort to increase water conservation.\r\n\r\nFor generations, lawns have occupied a special place in the California mind.  The Post WWII era saw abundant material wealth and water supplies, which manifested in lush lawns and landscaping.  D.J. Waldie memorialized this lifestyle in his book “Holy Land.”\r\n \r\n“The seven model yards were planted with mature shrubs and full lawns… Buyers waited in line, some watching their children in a supervised playground.”\r\n \r\nFormer State Librarian Kevin Starr highlights the broader connection to suburban life in his book “Golden Dreams.”\r\n \r\n“…a place where middle class Americans might love, reproduce, succeed, fail, live, and die in American circumstances enlivened by day-to-day hope and immemorial pleasures, struggles, questions and rhythms of daily life.” \r\n \r\nWe’re launching this campaign to educate the next generation of Californians on how simply shifting from thirsty ornamental lawns to California friendly landscaping can increase our drought resiliency dramatically and deepen our connection to our community.\r\n\r\nRather than struggling like Biggie Badger and his friends with over-the-top water conservation actions like bathing halfway or skipping showers, we can save the water we need simply by converting lawns we aren’t using for anything except decoration to beautiful drought friendly landscaping.\r\n\r\nMoreover, this generational shift in outdoor landscaping offers a great opportunity to get to know your neighbors and understand how we’re all dependent on the environment that was here before us.  \r\n"

  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    Number of households converted to California friendly landscaping.  Our
    target with this hundred thousand dollars: 1,000,000 households with
    California friendly landscaping across Southern California.  We're working
    closely with academic researchers using NAIP satellite imagery to study the
    diffusion of California friendly plants and will use the results of that
    study to help evaluate how many Californians this campaign converts to new
    landscaping.  In addition, for a separate yet synergistic project we're
    working on pioneering a voluntary, bottom-up effort to put the entire
    lifecycle of California's water usage data in a centralized platform.  That
    database will enable us to ask at a granular level the actual water savings
    of shifting to California friendly plants and target areas for future
    landscape maintenance education. 
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "We are laser focused on California friendly plants as the next frontier of water conservation.  The water community is spending millions of dollars on general conservation messaging yet there's a big opportunity in public education focused on California friendly plants.  The history of water conservation market transformation (low flow toilets for example) has shown that transforming conservation behavior requires an integrated regional approach.  That's exactly what this campaign will deliver.\r\n\r\nMore than one-half of California’s urban water usage goes to outdoor landscaping, and in making California friendly plants mainstream, Southern California has the opportunity to cut that usage by more than half, achieving a million acre feet in sustainable conservation.  SCWC’s California Friendly Plant Campaign will build on the unprecedented regional turf rebate momentum -- the largest outdoor rebate program in American history -- and many recently browned lawns to achieve a “tipping point” in making California friendly plants mainstream with the big goal of converting one million households to California friendly landscaping in six months.

In addition, we will leverage our \"civic reach\" through our board and ask the Good community to help extend this campaign from that base into community nonprofits, local schools, and across the spectrum of civic life.\r\n\r\nWe recognize that this historic drought is an issue that demands that all of us -- water managers, teachers, environmentalists, video artists, and everyone else that calls this place home -- work together as Californians.\r\n\r\nClimate change challenges future water supply assumptions, yet by working smartly and collaboratively, we can prepare California for whatever the future holds.

   • Improve utility system performance, including leak loss detection and repair, pressure management, and prioritization of projects within capital improvement programs;
   • Benchmark water and energy use across customers, customer classes, and utilities;
   • Assess the effectiveness of demand management strategies within a utility and across utilities;
   • Improve the effectiveness of data generated from AMI systems;
   • Improve demand forecasts for water wholesalers;
   • Streamline and standardize reporting to the California Urban Water Conservation Council, state agencies, and other agencies and organizations;
   • Better understand the impacts of various conservation actions including but not limited to rebates, public education, and marketing;
   • Evaluate the effectiveness and equity of different rate structures;
   • Assess the effectiveness of utilities’ responses within a particular utility as well as across utilities to past and present state mandated actions;
   • Identify the current utility data landscape;
   • Identify gaps and challenges in data collection and management;
   • Merge utility data with data outside the utility (e.g., account-level water or energy use with U.S. Census data) to explore a broad range of hypotheses and questions;
   • Drive innovation in the water and energy sectors.
