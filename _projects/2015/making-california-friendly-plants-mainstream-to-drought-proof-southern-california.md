    Number of households converted to California friendly landscaping.  Our
    target with this hundred thousand dollars: 1,000,000 households with
    California friendly landscaping across Southern California.  We're working
    closely with academic researchers using NAIP satellite imagery to study the
    diffusion of California friendly plants and will use the results of that
    study to help evaluate how many Californians this campaign converts to new
    landscaping.  In addition, for a separate yet synergistic project we're
    working on pioneering a voluntary, bottom-up effort to put the entire
    lifecycle of California's water usage data in a centralized platform.  That
    database will enable us to ask at a granular level the actual water savings
    of shifting to California friendly plants and target areas for future
    landscape maintenance education.

  California faces its worst drought in over a century, compounding long term
  trends. The state's water supply system was largely built a generation ago for
  a state with half the population, and in recent years California's key water
  supply resources in the Bay Delta and Colorado river are under stress from
  rising usage, climate change, and long-term geological damage.
   
   On April 1, 2015, Governor Brown stood in the Sierras in an empty field normally five feet deep in snow at this time of year and declared a historically unprecedented statewide 25% urban water conservation mandate. With outdoor landscaping representing roughly half of urban water usage, Governor Brown and the water community have identified ornamental lawns as a key opportunity in the larger effort to increase water conservation.
   
   For generations, lawns have occupied a special place in the California mind. The Post WWII era saw abundant material wealth and water supplies, which manifested in lush lawns and landscaping. D.J. Waldie memorialized this lifestyle in his book “Holy Land.”
    
   “The seven model yards were planted with mature shrubs and full lawns… Buyers waited in line, some watching their children in a supervised playground.”
    
   Former State Librarian Kevin Starr highlights the broader connection to suburban life in his book “Golden Dreams.”
    
   “…a place where middle class Americans might love, reproduce, succeed, fail, live, and die in American circumstances enlivened by day-to-day hope and immemorial pleasures, struggles, questions and rhythms of daily life.” 
    
   We’re launching this campaign to educate the next generation of Californians on how simply shifting from thirsty ornamental lawns to California friendly landscaping can increase our drought resiliency dramatically and deepen our connection to our community.
   
   Rather than struggling like Biggie Badger and his friends with over-the-top water conservation actions like bathing halfway or skipping showers, we can save the water we need simply by converting lawns we aren’t using for anything except decoration to beautiful drought friendly landscaping.
   
   Moreover, this generational shift in outdoor landscaping offers a great opportunity to get to know your neighbors and understand how we’re all dependent on the environment that was here before us.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Far too many people think the plants native to Los Angeles start and end with
  cactus. As Irvine Ranch’s Water Issue Survey from June 2015 illustrates,
  “customers are not aware of the potential of drought-tolerant landscaping to
  be more than a “desert” look.” We're going to confront that barrier head on by
  showing how beautiful California friendly plants can be and educating families
  on the merits of drought friendly landscaping.
   
   We're working with a big coalition across the water community and So Cal civic life to change this landscape paradigm. Bringing together leading water utilities, nonprofit partners and civic data science talent, this project is focused on supporting and building on existing water community efforts to break through those myths and achieve a “tipping point” towards market transformation. 
   
   The goal is to show the value of California friendly plants so that the "new normal" of outdoor landscaping is drought tolerant.

  Number of households converted to California friendly landscaping. Our target
  with this hundred thousand dollars: 1,000,000 households with California
  friendly landscaping across Southern California. We're working closely with
  academic researchers using NAIP satellite imagery to study the diffusion of
  California friendly plants and will use the results of that study to help
  evaluate how many Californians this campaign converts to new landscaping. In
  addition, for a separate yet synergistic project we're working on pioneering a
  voluntary, bottom-up effort to put the entire lifecycle of California's water
  usage data in a centralized platform. That database will enable us to ask at a
  granular level the actual water savings of shifting to California friendly
  plants and target areas for future landscape maintenance education.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  We are laser focused on California friendly plants as the next frontier of
  water conservation. The water community is spending millions of dollars on
  general conservation messaging yet there's a big opportunity in public
  education focused on California friendly plants. The history of water
  conservation market transformation (low flow toilets for example) has shown
  that transforming conservation behavior requires an integrated regional
  approach. That's exactly what this campaign will deliver.
   
   More than one-half of California’s urban water usage goes to outdoor landscaping, and in making California friendly plants mainstream, Southern California has the opportunity to cut that usage by more than half, achieving a million acre feet in sustainable conservation. SCWC’s California Friendly Plant Campaign will build on the unprecedented regional turf rebate momentum -- the largest outdoor rebate program in American history -- and many recently browned lawns to achieve a “tipping point” in making California friendly plants mainstream with the big goal of converting one million households to California friendly landscaping in six months.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  The Southern California Water Committee (SCWC) has deep relationships with the
  water community and civic leadership across the region. We intend to continue
  to work closely with the Metropolitan Water District, LADWP, Moulton Niguel
  Water District, Upper San Gabriel Water District, Foothill Municipal Water
  District and countless other water utilities. In addition, we will leverage
  our "civic reach" through our board and ask the Good community to help extend
  this campaign from that base into community nonprofits, local schools, and
  across the spectrum of civic life.
   
   We recognize that this historic drought is an issue that demands that all of us -- water managers, teachers, environmentalists, video artists, and everyone else that calls this place home -- work together as Californians.
   
   Climate change challenges future water supply assumptions, yet by working smartly and collaboratively, we can prepare California for whatever the future holds. This positive, proactive public education campaign represents a golden opportunity to build on momentum in turf rebates and seize the opportunity to plant seeds for California’s sustainable water future this winter.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  The data science work in this public education campaign integrates into a long
  term strategy to drought proof Southern California. A group of leading water
  utilities are working together to put the entire lifecycle of California's
  water usage data in a centralized cloud platform through a new initiative
  called the "California Water Data Collaborative" being developed in
  partnership with UC Davis Center for Water and Energy Efficiency and the
  California Urban Water Conservation Council. This project offers a long term
  investment in improved data infrastructure across the water community with a
  spectrum of operational efficiency and demand management benefits. Analytical
  experts can work together to achieve water efficiency to:
   • Collaborate within and across utilities, as well as with a range of other stakeholders;
   • Improve utility system performance, including leak loss detection and repair, pressure management, and prioritization of projects within capital improvement programs;
   • Benchmark water and energy use across customers, customer classes, and utilities;
   • Assess the effectiveness of demand management strategies within a utility and across utilities;
   • Improve the effectiveness of data generated from AMI systems;
   • Improve demand forecasts for water wholesalers;
   • Streamline and standardize reporting to the California Urban Water Conservation Council, state agencies, and other agencies and organizations;
   • Better understand the impacts of various conservation actions including but not limited to rebates, public education, and marketing;
   • Evaluate the effectiveness and equity of different rate structures;
   • Assess the effectiveness of utilities’ responses within a particular utility as well as across utilities to past and present state mandated actions;
   • Identify the current utility data landscape;
   • Identify gaps and challenges in data collection and management;
   • Merge utility data with data outside the utility (e.g., account-level water or energy use with U.S. Census data) to explore a broad range of hypotheses and questions;
   • Drive innovation in the water and energy sectors.
   
   In the twentieth century, California's invested in pioneering physical infrastructure to safeguard our water future and create an unprecedented era of water supply. This new virtual infrastructure will ensure California's water future into the next century by powering an unprecedented era of water efficiency.
