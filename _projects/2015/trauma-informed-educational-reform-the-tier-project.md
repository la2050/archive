  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "Los Angeles, like other large metropolitan areas, has multiple challenges when it comes to educating all of our children and adolescents in the most equitable manner. There has been more and more research over the last 20 years that documents how children who have been exposed to trauma are at high risk for not achieving educational attainment.  Providing these students with equal access to a quality education is the new educational reform imperative for the 21st Century. States, such as Connecticut, Washington, Wisconsin, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, New York, to name a few, are addressing these educational challenges faced by traumatized students by having their public school systems become trauma informed. School districts in California are catching on as well. For example, Richmond, Santa Cruz, Humboldt, San Francisco, and San Diego are training their public school teachers about trauma and its impact on learning. There needs to be a system-wide movement in Los Angeles as well.\r\nThe Trauma Informed Educational Reform (TIER) Project will bring together school districts in Los Angeles County to start the process of becoming trauma informed. This process will start with an in-depth training by school district teams on trauma and trauma informed educational practices. These teams will develop action plans on how to implement trauma informed practices and policies across the district. The TIER Project will provide technical assistance to districts as they become trauma informed. By having Los Angeles schools become trauma informed, the goal of high educational attainment will be accessible for all students; thereby making Los Angeles the “best place to learn.”\r\n"

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    One of the challenges of the TIER Project is having full representation from
    all school districts. This challenge will be addressed by extensive outreach
    at the local and state level for buy-in by the school districts. The TIER
    Project will meet will parents, school board members, state education
    leaders, local policymakers, and other educational stakeholders to influence
    all school districts to participate. And some schools districts may not be
    ready to take on this major educational reform. We will assist school
    districts in seeking additional funding from foundations and government
    grants to address staff costs for professional development release time.
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    We propose a mixed methods approach for this study in order to capture the
    full range of important effects, including knowledge gains, changes in
    attitudes and beliefs and ultimately whether the participants were able to
    bring trauma informed practice back to their individual school districts.  
    Examining the impact of the TIER project through these multiple techniques,
    using qualitative and quantitative methods, will improve the accuracy of
    results through the collection and analysis of different types of data.  For
    example, we will collect data on the rates of suspensions and expulsions,
    absenteeism and truancy and drop-out rates. Also, we will collect data that
    documents the experiences of the participants of the training and
    implementing of their action plans.
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    There are organizations who are training individual schools, such as Echo
    Parenting and LA Child Guidance, to become trauma-informed. LAUSD provides
    crisis and trauma interventions in their district for children who have been
    identified as having trauma. There are other services providers, like
    Children’s Institute International, who use small groups for traumatized
    children which pulls them out of the classroom to attend support groups.
    Unfortunately, many children who have experienced traumatic events may not
    qualify for a diagnosis of PTSD or funding for mental health services; and
    therefore not receive specialized mental health services.  The TIER Project
    recognizes that trauma impacts students in very insidious ways that
    traditional mental health approaches might not recognize. Children in the
    mental health system get labelled with a diagnosis which can be seen as
    stigmatizing and may become a barrier to receiving services. The TIER
    Project advocates a cultural shift in the educational system that would
    benefit all children especially students with histories of trauma. The goal
    is not to replace mental health services or to change educational staff into
    therapists, but to embed trauma informed practices into the educational
    system thereby mitigating poor educational outcomes. Training teams from
    various school districts will have a greater impact on the 1.7 million
    school-age children in Los Angeles County. Also, this will provide for
    greater uniformity across individual schools, incorporate unique
    characteristics related to the functioning of individual districts, and
    empower them to take the leadership role in this transformation process.
    Furthermore, the TIER Project benefits all children in the classroom without
    having to target or stigmatize traumatized students
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    UCLA Social Welfare Department is the lead agency for the TIER Project. The
    project will collaborate with Peace Over Violence, a private non-profit
    which has a long history in providing prevention and intervention services
    in the public schools to address interpersonal violence. Peace Over Violence
    has community educators who go into the public schools to train educational
    staff on recognizing dating and sexual violence. POV will receive about
    $20,000 from the Project.
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    The TIER Project is budgeted at $100,000 to accomplish the goals of training
    80 school districts and providing some technical assistance. We are seeking
    additional funding to deepen the technical assistance to school districts
    and to reduce their costs of release time for staff and other incidentals
    related to implementation.
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Project Budget\r\n-project manager 8 hours per week @ $45/hr x 50 weeks=$18,000\r\n-80 school districts send 10 people each (800 people) to a 2-day training. Twice a month trainings will occur@ 60 people per training. Each training about $3060 x 14 trainings=$42,840 \r\nCost of each training ($3060)\r\n•\t60 manuals @$6=$360\r\n•\tFood for 60 participants @$5 ea=$300\r\n•\tRent of training location=$800\r\n•\t2 trainers@ $50 per hour for 16 hours=$1600\r\n•\tTotal cost=$3060 per training\r\n-8 hours of consultation @ $45 per hour x 80=$28,800\r\n- Evaluation of $5000\r\n-Administrative support 8 hours/week x $15/hour x 44 weeks=$5280\r\nTotal Budget: $99,560\r\n"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "Our project already involves all the school districts in LA County. While we will offer this opportunity to all the school districts in LA County, experience would suggest that some will not be in a position to take advantage of this while others will want to have additional staff trained.  One of the primary outcomes of this work will be developing and refining a model of delivery for Trauma Informed practice.  Secondarily, we will gain an increased understanding of how to do a better job of providing this type of large scale training to educators and educational staff. This will serve as an important “proof-of-concept” which could easily be expanded to those districts that do not participate or to other counties or even brought down to the individual district level and ultimately to the individual school level, depending on the need of the district or school.  Expanding this training to the school level would represent a significant increase in scope. \r\nThe TIER Project can provide more technical support to the school districts during the implementation phase. We anticipate that districts will encounter challenges along the way and providing more direct support and consultation will further ensure their success in transforming their educational systems. Additionally, we want school districts to become the ambassadors of this work in that they will disseminate their learnings about trauma and trauma informed care to all of their community partners and other educational stakeholders with the TIER Project’s support. The vision for this work is that all service providers for children and adults will be trauma informed.\r\n\r\n"
