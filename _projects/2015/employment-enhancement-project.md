  The Employment Enhancement Project will provide business attire and
  pre-employment training to low-income residents of Los Angeles.  The resources
  provided by Clothes The Deal, will help Los Angeles residents obtain
  employment and achieve their career goals.
Please specify below: All low-income job seekers in Los Angeles
category: live
'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Clothes The Deal will provide the services of business attire and
  pre-employment training. Services will remain available to all low-income
  residents of Los Angeles. The business attire and skills to maintain a
  professional image will help remove the barrier of physical appearance. The
  preemployment training will help create career plans, and assist those served
  to maintaining a forward career mobility pathway. Services will provide needed
  assets, skills, and self-confidence. Goals of increased employment
  opportunities, career goals, and self-confidence will help increase wages,
  health benefits and overall quality of life.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Outreach to highly at-risk populations. Collaborate with established npo's and
  community leaders.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Clothes The Deal will evaluate job placement rates for clients served. For all
  clients receiving services, a service invoice will be created. Clients contact
  information will be collected and stored. Clothes The Deal will evaluate job
  placement rates for a 6 month period after services are rendered. Employment
  rates will be compared to baseline employment rates provided by collaborating
  employment organizations/ Clothes the Deal will also measure qualitative data
  with testimonials and questionnaires.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There are other organizations that provide similar work, but have limitations
  to their services. Dress to Impress operates similar programs but only serve
  women. This leaves half of the population unable to access the needed
  resources.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Clothes The Deal works with 96 various nonprofit organizations that provide
  employment services. The project will work closely with 20 different
  nonprofits that operate in communities of high unemployment and poverty rates.
  The collaborators will help ensure all clients referred for project services
  are low-income and job ready. Collaborators will be able to have their clients
  access the project services on an as needed basis. Collaborators will not
  receive any direct funding from the $100,000 grant, but will receive in-kind
  benefits of the access to Clothes The Deal's services. If Clothes The Deal is
  awarded the $100,000 grant award, the project will increase services to 1,000
  clients referred from collaborators. The in-kind value of services provided to
  collaborators is valued at $135,000.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  Direct costs of the project will total $123,046. The remaining direct costs
  will be provided by private foundation and internal fundraising from Clothes
  The Deal. The project also requires in-kind expenses of $113,300 for
  occupancy, utilities, volunteer staff, and business attire required for the
  project. In-kind expenses will be provided by Clothes The Deal and project
  collaborators. Clothes The Deal and project collaborators have secured and
  pledged the in-kind funding for the project if awarded the $100,000 grant.
