  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    Outreach to highly at-risk populations.  Collaborate with established npo's 
    and community leaders. 
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    Clothes The Deal will evaluate job placement rates for clients served.  For
    all clients receiving services, a service invoice will be created.  Clients
    contact information will be collected and stored.  Clothes The Deal will
    evaluate job placement rates for a 6 month period after services are
    rendered.  Employment rates will be compared to baseline employment rates
    provided by collaborating employment organizations/  Clothes the Deal will
    also measure qualitative data with testimonials and questionnaires.  
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    There are other organizations that provide similar work, but have
    limitations to their services.  Dress to Impress operates similar programs
    but only serve women.  This leaves half of the population unable to access
    the needed resources.
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    Clothes The Deal works with 96 various nonprofit organizations that provide
    employment services.  The project will work closely with 20 different
    nonprofits that operate in communities of high unemployment and poverty
    rates. The collaborators will help ensure all clients referred for project
    services are low-income and job ready.  Collaborators will be able to have
    their clients access the project services on an as needed basis. 
    Collaborators will not receive any direct funding from the $100,000 grant,
    but will receive in-kind benefits of the access to Clothes The Deal's
    services.  If Clothes The Deal is awarded the $100,000 grant award, the
    project will increase services to 1,000 clients referred from
    collaborators.  The in-kind value of services provided to collaborators is
    valued at $135,000. 
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    Job placement rates from clients served will be measured to multiple base
    line employment rates.  Base line employment rates include collaborators
    previous reporting periods, census data from zip codes served (low-income
    neighborhoods of South Los Angeles, East Los Angeles, North Long Beach,
    Inglewood, San Gabriel Valley, San Fernando, Lancaster, and Palmdale).
