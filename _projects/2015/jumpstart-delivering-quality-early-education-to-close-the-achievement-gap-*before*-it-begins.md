  Jumpstart: Delivering Quality Early Education To Close the Achievement Gap
  *Before* it Begins
project_summary: >-
  Jumpstart recruits and trains college students and older adults (ages 55+) to
  implement a data-driven preschool curriculum in low-income communities,
  helping children circumvent the achievement gap by ensuring that they build
  the language, literacy, and socio-emotional skills most vital to school
  success. Jumpstart seeks to expand our program, particularly in South LA and
  East LA, to continue fostering intergenerational learning and improving the
  academic outcomes of low-income children.

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "Somewhere among today’s preschoolers sit our future presidents, scientists, and entrepreneurs. Yet, by virtue of living in a low-income neighborhood, thousands of children in America are deprived of access to quality child care and early education programs, thus entering kindergarten already behind national benchmarks for early literacy and math. Research shows that these same children who start behind, stay behind—they are more likely to drop out of high school, be incarcerated for violent crime, and experience significantly lower earning potential upon entering the workforce. \r\n\r\nLos Angeles is no exception to this trend. In a county where almost 20% of all families live in poverty, only 44% of children enrolled in the Los Angeles Unified School District demonstrate grade-level reading and writing proficiency by the third grade. \r\n\r\nBy recruiting and training college students and older adults, called Corps members, to implement a research-based curriculum in preschool classrooms, Jumpstart works systemically and strategically to close the achievement gap *before*  it begins. Our curriculum is uniquely designed to help children build the key language, literacy, and socio-emotional skills deemed by early education experts to be most vital for school readiness. Corps members deliver our high-quality program to the same small group of children twice weekly for an entire year, leveraging reduced adult-child ratios in Jumpstart classrooms to provide children with consistent, targeted individual instruction.\r\n\r\nCorps members receive 55+ hours of professional-grade training in early education best practices and methodology to support their implementation of Jumpstart’s outcomes-based program. They provide their partner preschool teachers with much needed resources and support over the course of the year, while simultaneously developing valuable workplace and leadership skills. The highly structured nature of the Jumpstart program instills in college Corps members the values of time management, teamwork, effective communication, and grit that are intrinsic both to success in their academic studies and to competitiveness in the job market. Our older adult Corps members experience significant health benefits, such as improved mobility and mental acuity. Informed by their experiences in the classroom, Jumpstart Corps members become early education advocates for life, and many seek out careers in education and human services related fields. "

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "While in discussion with current and prospective partners, Jumpstart has learned a great deal about the growing need for quality early education programming in Los Angeles. However, capacity and funding limitations impact our ability to expand at a rate fast enough to fully meet demand. \r\n\r\nJumpstart is committed to intentional, strategic growth. We have identified South LA and East LA as communities of need, and will prioritize the expansion of those sites that directly serve these communities; specifically, our program at California State University Dominguez Hills and California State University Los Angeles. In the 2014-15 program year, both sites exceeded their goals for Corps member recruitment and children served. We are also deploying greater numbers of our older adult Corps members from our community site to classrooms in Compton and East LA, to reach additional children who may not be served by our regular college program. "
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Jumpstart’s “School Success Checklist”, a targeted adaptation of the High/Scope Perry Child Observation Record, evaluates children three times annually against fifteen key developmental metrics that research has indicated are vital to school readiness. This year, we commit to:\r\n\r\n- Serving 1,360 preschool children\r\n- 65% of children will make gains of 1+ developmental level(s)\r\n- Distribute over 3,000 books to families in communities where we serve\r\n\r\nIn Pre-Service, Mid-Year, and Post-Service Surveys, Corps members report on academic, professional, and personal gains made through their experiences in the Jumpstart program. We commit to:\r\n\r\n- Recruiting and training 422 Corps members\r\n- 85% of Corps members will report Jumpstart improves their leadership and connection to their community\r\n- 85% of college Corps members will report Jumpstart helps them academically\r\n- 70% of older adult Corps members will report feeling \"somewhat satisfied\" to \"very satisfied\" with their health"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "While there are a multitude of organizations in Los Angeles addressing the challenges of the academic achievement gap, few to none provide direct, sustained support to our youngest learners—children ages three to five. For example, LA2050’s “Collaborating with the Crowd” publication indicated that only 8 submissions in the “Learn” category considered enrollment in early education programs as a metric to impact during last year’s challenge. The work being done to end educational inequity has predominantly targeted those children who have already entered the K-12 education system. Jumpstart is filling a growing need as the only supplemental early education program of its kind. Jumpstart’s work not only sets children on a path to overcome the achievement gap; we’re intervening early to ensure that the gap never forms in the first place. \r\n\r\nJumpstart Corps members, caring and well-trained adults with the tools and insights to make a measurable impact on preschool students, work with the same small group of three to four children for 8+ hours each week, for an entire year.  Jumpstart leverages these small adult-child ratios to provide consistent, individualized instruction to preschool children, maximizing their academic outcomes. Corps members work closely and collaboratively with their partner children’s families and preschool staff to cultivate a culture of learning. \r\n\r\nJumpstart support college Corps members in pursuing careers in education and human services, and have recently begun piloting workforce development initiatives to support our alumni in moving into teacher prep programs. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the older adults of our Los Angeles Community Corps serve several hundred children in the Los Angeles region not reached by our regular college program. These older adults often experience significant health benefits and reintegration into their communities by being a part of the program, due to their regular physical interaction with local children and families, as well as the additional resources provided by Jumpstart, such as case management and trainings in conflict resolution and healthy lifestyle changes. By pairing the two most vulnerable ends of the generational spectrum, we have seen the birth of a symbiotic relationship that encourages intergenerational learning in Los Angeles communities.  "
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "Jumpstart currently enjoys strong relationships with many of Los Angeles’ leading early education providers. We have a formal, written partnership with Los Angeles Unified School District to bring Jumpstart’s programs and services to early learning centers and preschools throughout the District. Jumpstart also works with the Los Angeles County Office of Education delegate agencies, one of the oldest and largest providers of Head Start in the country, among many other school districts and umbrella organizations that provide early education in low-income communities. \r\n\r\nJumpstart has identified South Los Angeles and East Los Angeles as two potential areas for program growth and expansion, and is fortunate to have the support of local partners such as Compton Unified School District; Proyecto Pastoral; and the Mexican American Opportunity Foundation (MAOF). \r\n\r\nJumpstart Los Angeles currently has 7 college program sites and 1 community site for our older adult Corps members. Our college and university partners include the University of Southern California; University of California Los Angeles; Pitzer College; Pepperdine University; California State University Northridge; California State University Los Angeles; California State University Dominguez Hills.\r\n\r\nAt this time, Jumpstart will be leading all growth efforts and program delivery and implementation, and will be the recipient of all grants awarded."
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "Growing awareness and momentum regarding the importance of early childhood education provides an unprecedented opportunity for Jumpstart to increase its reach and impact. Our strategic priorities are to enrich the learning experiences of children from low-income communities; cultivate a high quality early education workforce; and inspire public support and investment in high quality early learning. \r\n\r\nTo take advantage of the opportunities before us and realize our strategic priorities, Jumpstart commits to deepening and expanding the knowledge and capacity of our staff, and ensuring that the children we serve and the Corps members we work with receive the best possible opportunities to learn and to lead. We seek to grow our program, particularly in the communities of South LA and East LA, where demand for our services is especially high. \r\n\r\nKnowledge of Jumpstart’s operating model is made explicit to every program site. Each site uses the same tools to track key performance data and implements the same pre-designed curriculum, which standardizes the classroom instruction process into teachable routines while still leaving a degree of latitude for individual customization as needed by the site or the child. This standardization has been instrumental in enabling the replication of the Jumpstart program across the Los Angeles region. \r\n\r\nJumpstart operates on a licensee model, which leverages partner universities’ existing fixed-cost infrastructures and financial resources for more cost-effective scaling. Jumpstart plans to grow its program first at established university sites with a history of success, and then seek further opportunities to begin new sites after establishing a clear theory of change and confirmed support from key players at our partner universities, preschools, and school districts. \r\n\r\nMeetings between Jumpstart’s program leadership, our partner preschools and partner universities, and prospective new partners occur on an on-going basis. The conditions for success and program goals for Jumpstart’s 2015-16 program year have already been determined. Thanks to the efforts of our site managers at California State University, Dominguez Hills; California State University, Los Angeles; and the Los Angeles Community Corps, recruitment and training of Corps members have already begun, and Jumpstart is currently taking measurable steps toward program expansion in the South LA and East LA regions."
