  Jumpstart: Delivering Quality Early Education To Close the Achievement Gap
  *Before* it Begins
project_summary: >-
  Jumpstart recruits and trains college students and older adults (ages 55+) to
  implement a data-driven preschool curriculum in low-income communities,
  helping children circumvent the achievement gap by ensuring that they build
  the language, literacy, and socio-emotional skills most vital to school
  success. Jumpstart seeks to expand our program, particularly in South LA and
  East LA, to continue fostering intergenerational learning and improving the
  academic outcomes of low-income children.

    Jumpstart recruits and trains college students and older adults (ages 55+)

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "Somewhere among today’s preschoolers sit our future presidents, scientists, and entrepreneurs. Yet, by virtue of living in a low-income neighborhood, thousands of children in America are deprived of access to quality child care and early education programs, thus entering kindergarten already behind national benchmarks for early literacy and math. Research shows that these same children who start behind, stay behind—they are more likely to drop out of high school, be incarcerated for violent crime, and experience significantly lower earning potential upon entering the workforce. \r\n\r\nLos Angeles is no exception to this trend. In a county where almost 20% of all families live in poverty, only 44% of children enrolled in the Los Angeles Unified School District demonstrate grade-level reading and writing proficiency by the third grade. \r\n\r\nBy recruiting and training college students and older adults, called Corps members, to implement a research-based curriculum in preschool classrooms, Jumpstart works systemically and strategically to close the achievement gap *before*  it begins. Our curriculum is uniquely designed to help children build the key language, literacy, and socio-emotional skills deemed by early education experts to be most vital for school readiness. Corps members deliver our high-quality program to the same small group of children twice weekly for an entire year, leveraging reduced adult-child ratios in Jumpstart classrooms to provide children with consistent, targeted individual instruction.\r\n\r\nCorps members receive 55+ hours of professional-grade training in early education best practices and methodology to support their implementation of Jumpstart’s outcomes-based program. They provide their partner preschool teachers with much needed resources and support over the course of the year, while simultaneously developing valuable workplace and leadership skills. The highly structured nature of the Jumpstart program instills in college Corps members the values of time management, teamwork, effective communication, and grit that are intrinsic both to success in their academic studies and to competitiveness in the job market. Our older adult Corps members experience significant health benefits, such as improved mobility and mental acuity. Informed by their experiences in the classroom, Jumpstart Corps members become early education advocates for life, and many seek out careers in education and human services related fields. "
