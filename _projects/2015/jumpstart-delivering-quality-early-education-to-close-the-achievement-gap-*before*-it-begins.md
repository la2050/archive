project_summary: >-
  Jumpstart recruits and trains college students and older adults (ages 55+) to
  implement a data-driven preschool curriculum in low-income communities,
  helping children circumvent the achievement gap by ensuring that they build
  the language, literacy, and socio-emotional skills most vital to school
  success. Jumpstart seeks to expand our program, particularly in South LA and
  East LA, to continue fostering intergenerational learning and improving the
  academic outcomes of low-income children.

  Somewhere among today’s preschoolers sit our future presidents, scientists,
  and entrepreneurs. Yet, by virtue of living in a low-income neighborhood,
  thousands of children in America are deprived of access to quality child care
  and early education programs, thus entering kindergarten already behind
  national benchmarks for early literacy and math. Research shows that these
  same children who start behind, stay behind—they are more likely to drop out
  of high school, be incarcerated for violent crime, and experience
  significantly lower earning potential upon entering the workforce. 
   
   Los Angeles is no exception to this trend. In a county where almost 20% of all families live in poverty, only 44% of children enrolled in the Los Angeles Unified School District demonstrate grade-level reading and writing proficiency by the third grade. 
   
   By recruiting and training college students and older adults, called Corps members, to implement a research-based curriculum in preschool classrooms, Jumpstart works systemically and strategically to close the achievement gap *before* it begins. Our curriculum is uniquely designed to help children build the key language, literacy, and socio-emotional skills deemed by early education experts to be most vital for school readiness. Corps members deliver our high-quality program to the same small group of children twice weekly for an entire year, leveraging reduced adult-child ratios in Jumpstart classrooms to provide children with consistent, targeted individual instruction.
   
   Corps members receive 55+ hours of professional-grade training in early education best practices and methodology to support their implementation of Jumpstart’s outcomes-based program. They provide their partner preschool teachers with much needed resources and support over the course of the year, while simultaneously developing valuable workplace and leadership skills. The highly structured nature of the Jumpstart program instills in college Corps members the values of time management, teamwork, effective communication, and grit that are intrinsic both to success in their academic studies and to competitiveness in the job market. Our older adult Corps members experience significant health benefits, such as improved mobility and mental acuity. Informed by their experiences in the classroom, Jumpstart Corps members become early education advocates for life, and many seek out careers in education and human services related fields.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  While in discussion with current and prospective partners, Jumpstart has
  learned a great deal about the growing need for quality early education
  programming in Los Angeles. However, capacity and funding limitations impact
  our ability to expand at a rate fast enough to fully meet demand. 
   
   Jumpstart is committed to intentional, strategic growth. We have identified South LA and East LA as communities of need, and will prioritize the expansion of those sites that directly serve these communities; specifically, our program at California State University Dominguez Hills and California State University Los Angeles. In the 2014-15 program year, both sites exceeded their goals for Corps member recruitment and children served. We are also deploying greater numbers of our older adult Corps members from our community site to classrooms in Compton and East LA, to reach additional children who may not be served by our regular college program.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Jumpstart’s “School Success Checklist”, a targeted adaptation of the
  High/Scope Perry Child Observation Record, evaluates children three times
  annually against fifteen key developmental metrics that research has indicated
  are vital to school readiness. This year, we commit to:
   
   - Serving 1,360 preschool children
   - 65% of children will make gains of 1+ developmental level(s)
   - Distribute over 3,000 books to families in communities where we serve
   
   In Pre-Service, Mid-Year, and Post-Service Surveys, Corps members report on academic, professional, and personal gains made through their experiences in the Jumpstart program. We commit to:
   
   - Recruiting and training 422 Corps members
   - 85% of Corps members will report Jumpstart improves their leadership and connection to their community
   - 85% of college Corps members will report Jumpstart helps them academically
   - 70% of older adult Corps members will report feeling "somewhat satisfied" to "very satisfied" with their health
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  While there are a multitude of organizations in Los Angeles addressing the
  challenges of the academic achievement gap, few to none provide direct,
  sustained support to our youngest learners—children ages three to five. For
  example, LA2050’s “Collaborating with the Crowd” publication indicated that
  only 8 submissions in the “Learn” category considered enrollment in early
  education programs as a metric to impact during last year’s challenge. The
  work being done to end educational inequity has predominantly targeted those
  children who have already entered the K-12 education system. Jumpstart is
  filling a growing need as the only supplemental early education program of its
  kind. Jumpstart’s work not only sets children on a path to overcome the
  achievement gap; we’re intervening early to ensure that the gap never forms in
  the first place. 
   
   Jumpstart Corps members, caring and well-trained adults with the tools and insights to make a measurable impact on preschool students, work with the same small group of three to four children for 8+ hours each week, for an entire year. Jumpstart leverages these small adult-child ratios to provide consistent, individualized instruction to preschool children, maximizing their academic outcomes. Corps members work closely and collaboratively with their partner children’s families and preschool staff to cultivate a culture of learning. 
   
   Jumpstart support college Corps members in pursuing careers in education and human services, and have recently begun piloting workforce development initiatives to support our alumni in moving into teacher prep programs. 
   
   Additionally, the older adults of our Los Angeles Community Corps serve several hundred children in the Los Angeles region not reached by our regular college program. These older adults often experience significant health benefits and reintegration into their communities by being a part of the program, due to their regular physical interaction with local children and families, as well as the additional resources provided by Jumpstart, such as case management and trainings in conflict resolution and healthy lifestyle changes. By pairing the two most vulnerable ends of the generational spectrum, we have seen the birth of a symbiotic relationship that encourages intergenerational learning in Los Angeles communities.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Jumpstart currently enjoys strong relationships with many of Los Angeles’
  leading early education providers. We have a formal, written partnership with
  Los Angeles Unified School District to bring Jumpstart’s programs and services
  to early learning centers and preschools throughout the District. Jumpstart
  also works with the Los Angeles County Office of Education delegate agencies,
  one of the oldest and largest providers of Head Start in the country, among
  many other school districts and umbrella organizations that provide early
  education in low-income communities. 
   
   Jumpstart has identified South Los Angeles and East Los Angeles as two potential areas for program growth and expansion, and is fortunate to have the support of local partners such as Compton Unified School District; Proyecto Pastoral; and the Mexican American Opportunity Foundation (MAOF). 
   
   Jumpstart Los Angeles currently has 7 college program sites and 1 community site for our older adult Corps members. Our college and university partners include the University of Southern California; University of California Los Angeles; Pitzer College; Pepperdine University; California State University Northridge; California State University Los Angeles; California State University Dominguez Hills.
   
   At this time, Jumpstart will be leading all growth efforts and program delivery and implementation, and will be the recipient of all grants awarded.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': |-
  The projected cost of Jumpstart’s 2015-16 program is $2,015,601.
   
   Jumpstart is a solvent and strong organization with experienced leadership; national and regional boards committed to supporting fundraising; long-term funders; and national and local strategic plans for sustainability. Our local staff has been successful at diversifying funds to include private foundations, corporations, individuals, and state/federal government sources.
   
   Jumpstart is fortunate to enjoy partnerships with many of Los Angeles' leading education supporters and funders, including the Dwight Stuart Youth Fund; The Ralph M. Parsons Foundation; The Eisner Foundation; and The Green Foundation; as well as leading corporations such as Ernst & Young; Kaiser Permanent; Wells Fargo; and the Capital Group Companies.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  Site Management -- $35,000
   Program Management-- $30,000
   Development -- $5,000
   Associated fringe and taxes-- $16,900
   Corps members stipends-- $10,000
   Administrative costs-- $3,100
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Growing awareness and momentum regarding the importance of early childhood
  education provides an unprecedented opportunity for Jumpstart to increase its
  reach and impact. Our strategic priorities are to enrich the learning
  experiences of children from low-income communities; cultivate a high quality
  early education workforce; and inspire public support and investment in high
  quality early learning. 
   
   To take advantage of the opportunities before us and realize our strategic priorities, Jumpstart commits to deepening and expanding the knowledge and capacity of our staff, and ensuring that the children we serve and the Corps members we work with receive the best possible opportunities to learn and to lead. We seek to grow our program, particularly in the communities of South LA and East LA, where demand for our services is especially high. 
   
   Knowledge of Jumpstart’s operating model is made explicit to every program site. Each site uses the same tools to track key performance data and implements the same pre-designed curriculum, which standardizes the classroom instruction process into teachable routines while still leaving a degree of latitude for individual customization as needed by the site or the child. This standardization has been instrumental in enabling the replication of the Jumpstart program across the Los Angeles region. 
   
   Jumpstart operates on a licensee model, which leverages partner universities’ existing fixed-cost infrastructures and financial resources for more cost-effective scaling. Jumpstart plans to grow its program first at established university sites with a history of success, and then seek further opportunities to begin new sites after establishing a clear theory of change and confirmed support from key players at our partner universities, preschools, and school districts. 
   
   Meetings between Jumpstart’s program leadership, our partner preschools and partner universities, and prospective new partners occur on an on-going basis. The conditions for success and program goals for Jumpstart’s 2015-16 program year have already been determined. Thanks to the efforts of our site managers at California State University, Dominguez Hills; California State University, Los Angeles; and the Los Angeles Community Corps, recruitment and training of Corps members have already begun, and Jumpstart is currently taking measurable steps toward program expansion in the South LA and East LA regions.
