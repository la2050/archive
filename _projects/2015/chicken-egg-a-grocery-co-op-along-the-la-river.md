title: 'Chicken & Egg: A Grocery Co-op along the LA RIver'
project_summary: "River Wild LLC propose to re-boot a beloved local grocery store and create a Co-op sourcing neighborhood goods, creating local jobs and educating local schools.\r\n\r\nLacking healthy food access, missing basic amenities and the real estate gold rush along the LA River have left modest neighborhoods without economic development drivers. As our LA River Cafe project proved, pop-up to permanent cottage businesses can meet the needs for jobs, healthy alternatives and locally operated small businesses. "

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "Being accused of gentrification in Latino communities suspicious of any change or new development. \r\n\r\nRiver Wild has spent 5 years cultivating a local reputation in Elysian Valley, Atwater Village and Lincoln Heights - three LA River communities, each lacking a healthy grocery alternative and each with empty storefronts in strategic locations. \r\n\r\nThe variety of income and demographics is telling us our community based economic development model has potential for growth and investment up and down the LA River.\r\n\r\nWe listen well. This might be our greatest advantage. Recognizing our collective tendency to contribute, we are in constant \"absorption\" mode. Walking the River, visiting business owners, meeting with residents is always informative. "
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Metrics are gold but Listening is Platinum. Proving every penny spent went to a positive community outcome is the first priority. Profitability is second, due to the cooperative nature of this enterprise. We look for individual and collaborative  impact in how residents, river tourists and local institutions will use and adopt to a local grocery after decades without one.\r\n\r\nWe plan on keeping extensive accounting and paying to set up software to track procurement and sales and hire an accountant for quarterly audits. Even in an 800 square foot grocery, we think that careful tracking of cash flow, re-evaluation of inventory, price point creation through community outreach and surveys are essential.\r\n\r\nThe creative leasing strategy affords us with a 3 month start-up period and a subsidized rent-free period to construct, create and modify with less stress.\r\n\r\nWe are interviewing Co-op groups on national and regional scales, to find the best supply of goods that are not grown in Frogtown."
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "Public Matters' Market Makeover Program, the Healthy Neighborhood Market Network, LA Food Policy Council, Compra (LURN), LA Kitchen are all great organizations doing similar work and we draw inspiration from these groups and are collaborating with them, so a complementary approach is key.  \r\n\r\nWhereas these aforementioned organizations adhere to policy initiatives, rely on longer range planning, and conduct workshops to create programs, River Wild, by nature, goes directly to proof of concept with their brand of low cost pop-up project. This community co-op is a chance to build a healthy grocery co-op immediately in a neighborhood that has lacked a basic grocery for over 30 years. \r\n\r\nRiver Wild is about relationship building. We have a great productive relationship with Councilman O'Farrell's office, work with River non-profits and city river organizations. Their willingness to participate in our economic development projects is a testament to our unique judo skills.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage is that we go straight to a demonstration project. We created a pop-up health fair because a nurse told us that each neighborhood has an LA County Health Department staff assigned to it. We invited them after a 15 year hiatus and created the event around them.  https://youtu.be/RnUr_qG3VkI\r\n\r\nWe have a willing landlord, a food desert scenario, a largely Latino neighborhood, a low walking index, a moderate income community, a supportive councilman, and a renewed, although unfunded interest in the LA River.  \r\n\r\nThe River Wild co-founders each have backgrounds in urban planning, architecture, community development, labor and small sustainable food business start-ups.\r\n\r\nThese are stand-out factors will contribute to this unique grass roots approach.\r\n"
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "River Wild is collaborating already on the LA2050 Listens grant to lay important outreach and conduct the first workshop for the Co-op in our October 11th Pop-Up Community Dinner called \"Growing a Healthy Food Economy in Elysian Valley. \r\n\r\nOur collaboration from the LA2050 Listens event will ideally continue beyond if we land the challenge grant. \r\n\r\nLA Food Policy Council, The Healthy Neighborhood Market Network,  2 community gardens, Farm LA, the Elysian Valley Neighborhood Watch, Public Matters, St Anne's Church, Partners of Dorris Elementary School, Kruegermann's Pickles and Cafecito Organico are some of the collaborators in this endeavor.  \r\n\r\nPublic Matters could receive $8,000 to do outreach in local schools. St. Anne's Church and Partners of Dorris Elementary School would receive a Co-op sponsored \"Pay it forward\" grant to invest in nutritional education at these two neighborhood institutions. \r\n\r\nNo other collaborator has been identified as requiring payment, especially the foundations and non-profits. \r\n\r\nOur business model is to invest in local micro businesses to procure fresh produce, prepared foods and locally made dry goods, so there is a partnership there, of course."
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': "The entire Grocery Co-Op will cost $135,000 - $175,000. We have interviewed with the www.fundrise.com, a crowdsource site which offers creative business model for a neighborhood to invest in a retail development. This affords Elysian Valley residents a pride of ownership or \"stock\" in seeing the Grocery thrive. \r\n\r\nCal-FreshWorks is offering Technical Assistance. River Wild began applying for Opportunity Fund's low interest loans. The LA Food Policy Council has offered us a Kiva Zip loan  and the LURN network  is offering a membership in its Compra buying collective for small grocers and River Wild will inquire into their micro-financing program as well.\r\n\r\nHealthy Neighborhood Markets Network has \"adopted\" our project and they see an opportunity to create a ground-up model.  We would likely also open up a ioby.org or an Indiegogo campaign to complement the \"lasagna\" financing for this business model.  \r\n\r\nWe are also investing our own privately sourced funds to show we have skin in the game.  \r\n\r\nThe most conventional of other opportunities for financing would be to apply for a small business loan for working capital.  It should be noted that the Lopez family (owner of the empty grocery store) are in negotiations with River Wild to secure a 3 year lease. \r\n\r\nThis LA2050 Challenge grant funding would not be used for rent, but capital improvements, outreach, labor and related expenses."
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "The LA River Co-op Budget:  \r\n$20,000 - Local construction job hires, store employees and development team ( Store employees @$16/hr; Operation and managers @$25/hr; Development Team @$40/hr.)\r\n$15,000 Design, Construction & light remodel\r\n$12,000  Operations & Start-up (procurement, billing, bookkeeping software, cashier, internet) \r\n$12,000 Produce, dairy, staples, prepared food, beverages for 3 months; $10,000 Contingency, Reserve Equity\r\n$8,000  Integrated Outreach to schools by Public Matters Urban Fellows\r\n$8,000 Fixtures, cabinets, counters, cooler refurbishment\r\n$4,000 Electrical and plumbing\r\n$3,000 Building permits & fees, Health Inspections\r\n$3,000 Procurement, Delivery on Bike Path Program\r\n$3,000 Co-op buying membership fees,T health licenses\r\n$1,000  Marketing, social media, online and print ads\r\n$500   Petty Cash for local produce purchase\r\n$250 \"Pay It Forward\" Scholarship or Grant Local Church\r\n$250 \"Pay It Forward\" Scholarship or Grant Local School\r\n$100,000 total"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "A LA2050 grant would immediately go to creating economic development by providing local jobs and creating a pop-up amenity that will become a permanent, creatively cooperative business. \r\n\r\nWe can't wait to use our extensive social media network and do old-fashioned door to door outreach. We will be both low-tech and high tech during our get out the vote step.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Co-op will create a more walkable neighborhood (currently a 38 on the index -- we want that number to be 83). It will reduce care use (elderly residents do not have cars and public buses are infrequent). \r\n\r\nMoreover, more households share a single car and the Co-op reduces carbon footprints by sourcing local goods to sell at the store. \r\n\r\nPop-ups are low-cost ways of testing business and urban plans. As our videos show (https://youtu.be/6wb0g2teozc) we let the physical project inform our hypothesis. \r\n\r\nWe film all our events to share our progress, for it is the process that teaches us, not necessarily the end-product. We always create information graphics and maps for events that are useful after events, and make a lot of our content available on our various media outlets.  We will be a food hub where people can check in daily to find out if there are local foods coming into the exchange. \r\n\r\nWe believe that this type of open sourcing and transparency help promote our community building philosophy.    \r\n\r\nWe excel at extending budgets and creating tight collaborations so that budgets get more \"bang for the buck\".  The multi layered and aligned programming allows more than one organization to claim success from our work.\r\n\r\nEach day we stock our Co-op, sell a locally grown apple, or have a conversation with a happy, elderly neighbor will be immensely gratifying on a human level.  For the fulfillment of the LA2050 Challenge grant goals, we feel that with such great resources offered by our collaborators, through our intensive studies of local history, and through street level interviews with neighbors and naysayers, we will succeed in spades. \r\n\r\nWe pride ourselves on immediate impact that is sometimes temporal, but always constructive and experiential, not just filed in a report that sits on a shelf. \r\n\r\nLastly, we believe that any LA River project needs to be accessible to all people, races, economic backgrounds. We have been focusing on basic services, not high-end boutique that marginalizes long time residents. The bigger the customer base, the greater chance at success."

   Moreover, more households share a single car and the Co-op reduces carbon footprints by sourcing local goods to sell at the store. 
   
   Pop-ups are low-cost ways of testing business and urban plans. As our videos show (https://youtu.be/6wb0g2teozc) we let the physical project inform our hypothesis. 
   
   We film all our events to share our progress, for it is the process that teaches us, not necessarily the end-product. We always create information graphics and maps for events that are useful after events, and make a lot of our content available on our various media outlets. We will be a food hub where people can check in daily to find out if there are local foods coming into the exchange. 
   
   We believe that this type of open sourcing and transparency help promote our community building philosophy. 
   
   We excel at extending budgets and creating tight collaborations so that budgets get more "bang for the buck". The multi layered and aligned programming allows more than one organization to claim success from our work.
   
   Each day we stock our Co-op, sell a locally grown apple, or have a conversation with a happy, elderly neighbor will be immensely gratifying on a human level. For the fulfillment of the LA2050 Challenge grant goals, we feel that with such great resources offered by our collaborators, through our intensive studies of local history, and through street level interviews with neighbors and naysayers, we will succeed in spades. 
   
   We pride ourselves on immediate impact that is sometimes temporal, but always constructive and experiential, not just filed in a report that sits on a shelf. 
   
   Lastly, we believe that any LA River project needs to be accessible to all people, races, economic backgrounds. We have been focusing on basic services, not high-end boutique that marginalizes long time residents. The bigger the customer base, the greater chance at success.
