  In 2013, the Alliance for Children’s Rights and Children’s Law Center sought
  an engaging way to meaningfully educate and empower every transition-age
  youth, ages 16-24, or “TAY” in L.A. County. Together they created the Know
  Before You Go campaign (B4UGO), which features multimodal platforms to help
  TAY and organization’s serving them in the areas of work, school, life,
  health, money and more. This campaign was created for foster youth, informed
  by foster youth. That novel concept alone connects

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  L.A. County is vast, with many diverse communities within its borders,
  including our country’s largest population of foster children. Once removed
  from their parents’ homes, many live with non-family members or in group
  homes; and they relocate and change schools more than six times. This
  transiency makes it difficult to learn vital life skills, garner work
  experience or make a plan for the future. They are isolated, and as they age
  out, this persists and sets them up for a life of instability. 
   
   In 2013, the Alliance for Children’s Rights and Children’s Law Center sought an engaging way to meaningfully educate and empower every transition-age youth, ages 16-24, or “TAY” in L.A. County. Together they created the Know Before You Go campaign (B4UGO), which features multimodal platforms to help TAY and organization’s serving them in the areas of work, school, life, health, money and more. This campaign was created for foster youth, informed by foster youth. That novel concept alone connects TAY, gives them a voice and a lifeline accessible in print or from their phone or computer. 
   
   Connection hallmarks of Know Before You Go platforms: (1) Print Toolkit: Foster youth are provided a packet of resources at court by their attorney building a connection with one of their key advocates; (2) B4UGO app: GPS-based mapping and notifications connect TAY with food banks, housing, clinics and more across L.A. County. LA2050 can make a 2.0 version of the app possible with filtered content, zip code searching and account login (based on TAY focus groups); (3) Knowb4ugo.org: The first website created for foster youth in L.A. County is a clearinghouse of information that is necessary to achieve success in life, school and work. LA2050 will connect more TAY to this new resource while increasing features. Soft launch in October 2015; (4) YouTube Channel: This first-of-its-kind web series is a talk show-style hip and entertaining series of videos starring foster youth talking about things like how to get a job, roommates, social media and more. There is nothing like it and it will give TAY a YouTube community, build connections with each other, and a new forum for conversation. The first season is in production and LA2050 can make season two a reality. See attached pilot video. (5) @knowb4ugola: A new Twitter account to bolster all communications for the campaign connecting more TAY to the tools on a platform they use daily.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  This campaign has 15,000 distributed print packets and 3,300 app users.
  Thousands more TAY, plus those who care for them, have yet to tap into all the
  new platforms. Making these tools available to connect TAY with the community
  is possible, using two key strategies to overcome the challenge of awareness
  and to increase our user base:
   1. The Alliance, widely known as an excellent collaborator, will work in partnership with other youth service organizations, through whose networks we will expand Know Before You Go’s reach.
   2. This grant will allow us to partner with a communications firm to create a multi-pronged promotion strategy.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  To evaluate the success of expanding Know Before You Go Campaign, we will
  track these measures:
   # hardcopies distributed
   # app downloads
   # hits on knowb4ugo.org
   # YouTube views, subscribers, shares, comments
   # Twitter followers @knowb4ugola or prevalence of the use of #knowb4ugo
   
   We will compare the popularity of the different platforms, and we will request monthly feedback from the Young Leaders group that is part of a local collective impact project, the Opportunity Youth Collaborative, to test the usefulness and validity of content and delivery. This information will inform further development of the campaign.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  No other organizations similar to the Alliance, such as Public Counsel, United
  Friends, iFoster, etc,. have a comprehensive project such as Know Before You
  Go, but they value it and are taking advantage of it for the TAY they serve.
  Through Know Before You Go and the Alliance NextStep Program’s participation
  in the L.A. Opportunity Youth Collaborative, which has 50 partners who are
  working together to break down siloes that keep resources for TAY separate,
  this campaign will succeed in helping TAY reconnect with the community.
   
   There are similar veined initiatives in terms of leveraging video and online learning, but nothing is as multi-faceted or comprehensive as Know Before You Go, and nothing else targets foster youth in L.A. County to help them reconnect. There is no other YouTube channel for foster youth, by foster youth. There is no other app built specifically for foster youth. 
   
   The Storyboard Project has a YouTube channel that shares testimonial-style videos of youth sharing their stories, but it is not framed around the skills and information youth need to succeed in the world. Unlike Know Before You Go, it is not tied to a website with comprehensive information or to an app.
   
   Think of Us is a national organization that is developing an online platform to support foster youth, but it is not targeted at TAY in Los Angeles, and is also just getting off the ground.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Plans for the next year include collaboration with the Department of Children
  and Family Services, L.A County Probation, iFoster, 211, and Children’s Law
  Center to evolve the B4UGO smartphone app into a county-wide collaboration.
  These partners see that Know Before You Go is becoming the “go-to” resource
  for foster youth in L.A. County. Their partnership will create a richer pool
  of resources for TAY and will ensure consistency of messaging across these key
  organizations, greater distribution support, and the opportunity to add
  different interactivity to the app. These partners will receive no direct
  funding from this grant but do access all of the platforms for their clients
  and will help to expand content by contributing information about their
  programs.
   
   ManifestWorks, an entertainment industry job preparation program, is the production partner on the YouTube web series and will receive $30,000 to complete season two. ManifestWorks will receive $15,000 for its work, while also using foster youth and formerly incarcerated young adults to create the videos as part of their workforce training program. Endertech, a web and app designer, will receive $50,000 for completely redeveloping the smartphone app and continue designing the website. A communications consultant, yet to be identified, will receive $7,500 for creating and implementing a marketing plan. 
   
   Dozens of foster youth focus groups guided development of this project and continue to influence content, design and special feature decisions for all platforms. Some of the youth will be compensated for participating in the development of season two of the YouTube Channel series.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  The entire project will occur during a period of approximately nine months and
  will cost $179,582. 
   The Conrad N. Hilton Foundation already committed $30,000 to the KB4UGO Campaign. The remaining $49,582 not covered by these two grants will be covered through fund raising efforts, which include grant applications, fund raising events, and gifts and donations. 
   
   The LA2050 Grant Challenge funding will take us a long way toward accomplishing the goal of reconnecting foster youth with our community, helping them not only to access resources, but also to regain that feeling of belonging they lost when they had to leave their birth homes.

How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Know Before You Go launched as a successful print toolkit. Now 15,000 have
  been distributed throughout L.A. County, providing pertinent information to
  transition age youth (TAY). The toolkit has been instrumental in training
  hundreds of providers on resources available to TAY, and while it has been a
  change agent, it is expensive to print and not easily updated. The new
  knowb4ugo.org website replaces the print toolkit while adding value beyond the
  toolkit’s capability. For instance, a webpage on job readiness can link
  directly to an upcoming job recruitment event. Using the app and Twitter page
  in conjunction with the webpage ensures maximized reach and alerts users to
  new information instantly. Our goal is to eliminate hearing “I wish someone
  would have told me” by creating an effective, available, and appealing way of
  instantly sharing information and resources with this previously disconnected
  population of L.A. County.
   
   In the child welfare community, the KB4UGO toolkit and app are seen as the “go to” resource for TAY by TAY, social workers, attorneys, foster parents, and organizations. Created and designed with youth in mind, TAY participated in development. This sets the campaign apart and positioned it to become a national model. Organizations in other states, and even in other countries, have asked to leverage the campaign’s concepts, especially the B4UGO app. YouTube, Twitter, the app, and the website are all adaptable media that can evolve, grow, deepen and be useful for TAY everywhere, who are transient and can be difficult to reach. This campaign allows us to reach them where they are, respond to their needs, and speak to them in their own language. We do not yet have a YouTube video to embed, but here is a link to what we have:
