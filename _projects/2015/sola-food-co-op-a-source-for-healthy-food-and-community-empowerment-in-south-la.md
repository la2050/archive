  SoLA Food Co-op a source for healthy food and community empowerment in South
  LA
organization_id: '2016195'
areas_impacted: ''
partners: ''
project_summary: >-
  SoLA  seeks to provide better access to natural, organic and non GMO foods in
  South LA in the form of a full service grocery cooperative. We envision our
  store as a place not only for shopping but for learning , in cooking and
  nutrition classes, and for the community to gather, share prepared foods,
  fresh juices, and organic coffee. We feel that in an area long overlooked,
  with too few grocery stores, that is a food desert, a health foods cooperative
  is a brilliant solution. 
Please specify below: In the Leimert Park area
category: 00playlive
'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  There are far fewer grocery stores per person in South LA than there are in
  West LA. Many people here who have the means, travel outside of our area to
  buy organic, healthy foods. That means the area suffers from retail leakage,
  money leaving the community. The community drives more than it should have to,
  to reach healthy food stores, increasing our carbon footprint. Some of our
  supporters travel by bus, taking as many as six buses to shop at Whole Foods.
   The South LA community deserves the same options in healthy eating as other parts of the city. 
   SoLA raises awareness in the South LA community around healthy eating practices. It is our practice to teach ways of addressing the diet related illnesses our community is plagued with, through fun events,nutrition classes, and workshops.
    SoLA will bring a strong sense of pride of ownership to our neighborhood and our member/owners. There has never been a beautiful full service health food store of the type we envision in this part of LA.
   As a cooperative, SoLA's profits will be distributed among it's members, further enriching this community.
    Instead of a food desert, SoLA will create an oasis, an oasis of accessibility, inclusion, self-sufficiency, health, nutritional education and economic empowerment.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Most healthy co-ops open with 800-1,000 members. Since our incorporation in
  2014 we've seen how hard it is to sell the co-op memberships. While our list
  serv is nearly 1,700 subscribers, less than one tenth of those have actually
  become members. Our challenge is to reach more people and to reach those that
  are able to buy now. Resources from LA2050 will support an advertising and
  outreach campaign.The ad campaign will include mailing, advertising in local
  papers and on radio stations, possibly even billboards.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We'll evaluate our work through new memberships attained, growing our
  community of supporters, and by being closer to our goal of opening a food
  co-op. Additionally, we will track awareness of our project in the community
  through actions outlined in our business plan: surveys conducted at community
  workshops, follow-ups to our feasibility study(surveys), implementing a
  successful crowdfunding campaign, and engaging Cooperative Development
  Services.
   There will be evidence of our growth through hiring a qualified Bookkeeper and Project Manager to implement our growth strategy. With this personnel in place we will grow and achieve our goals sooner
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There are two other healthy food stores forming in South LA .Neither one is a
  cooperative, one or both are b-corps. Neither has opened doors yet. They are
  situated in the Vermont corridor well east of Leimert Park in the Crenshaw
  corridor where SoLA plans to be. One is With Love Community Market and Café (
  18th St and Vermont), the other is Community Services Unlimited (66th and
  Vermont).
   
   SoLA's profits will belong to the members, that's the big difference.The profits of the co-op are shared and therefore reenter the community through our members.
   
    We also plan to be a store with classroom space, a deli, in store eating space, a bulk buying section as well as organic produce. SoLA is a unique opportunity for South LA to take charge of it's food sources and it's health and to reap the financial benefits of doing so.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Since it's inception, SoLA has sought advice from cooperative development
  organizations. We will continue to refer to these our "elders" as we grow.
  They are: California Center for Cooperative Development, and Food Co-op
  Initiative. There is no cost to SoLA for the expertise and advice of these
  organizations. Our work with the consulting group specifically geared toward
  helping build new co-ops,CDS Consulting Co-op, will cost $7,000 for the
  initial assessment workshop with SoLA's board of directors, in which a
  strategic plan is created, and an additional $7,000 for their continued
  consult in a maintenance program for one year.
   SoLA plans to create corporate sponsored memberships for needy families, partnering with organizations like Groceryships, to invite graduates of their program to receive sponsorships to become members of the co-op.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  Our completed store will cost approximately 1.5 million dollars. Ideally, 30 %
  of start-up costs will come from membership equity. Additional funding will
  include bank loans, member loans , grants, and donations.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
  Assessment , strategy , and maintenance program for start up co-ops with CDS
  Consulting Co-op $14,000 
   Travel expenses for CDS rep to come to LA $2,000
   http://www.cdsconsulting.coop/start_coop/4in3_support_program/to
   
   Project Manager( independent contractor fee) $35,000
   
   Advertising and promotional materials $15,000
   
   Accountant/ bookkeeper, (independent contractor fee) $10,000
   
   Fundraising events costs $18,000
   
   Educational community workshops costs $6,000
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  A $100,000 dollar award will bring us closer to the grand opening of SoLA Food
  Co-op and providing this much needed resource for our South LA community. At
  the end of the grant year and a successful advertising campaign, we have set a
  goal of achieving 700 members, and having a financial strategy and systems in
  place to clearly define the next steps for the cooperative. With this level of
  membership we'll be ready to secure a site for the store and begin financing
  toward hiring a general manager,designing and equipping the store, obtaining
  inventory,and opening.

      DESCRIBE IN GREATER DETAIL HOW YOU WILL MAKE LA THE HEALTHIEST PLACE TO
      LIVE: 
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: " There are far fewer grocery stores per person in South LA than there are in West LA. Many people here who have the means, travel outside of  our area to buy organic, healthy foods. That means the area suffers from retail leakage, money leaving the community. The community drives more than it should have to, to reach healthy food stores, increasing our carbon footprint. Some of our supporters travel by bus, taking as many as six buses to shop at Whole Foods.\r\nThe South LA community deserves the same options in healthy eating as other parts of the city. \r\nSoLA raises awareness in the South LA community around healthy eating practices. It is our practice to teach ways of addressing  the diet related illnesses our community is plagued with, through fun events,nutrition classes, and workshops.\r\n SoLA will bring a strong sense of pride of ownership to our neighborhood and our member/owners. There has never been a beautiful full service health food store of the type we envision in this part of LA.\r\nAs a cooperative, SoLA's profits will be distributed among it's members, further enriching this community.\r\n Instead of a food desert, SoLA will create an oasis, an oasis of accessibility, inclusion, self-sufficiency, health, nutritional education and economic empowerment."

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      Most healthy co-ops open with 800-1,000 members. Since our incorporation
      in 2014 we've seen how hard it is to sell the co-op memberships. While our
      list serv is nearly 1,700 subscribers, less than one tenth of those have
      actually become members.  Our challenge is to reach more people and to
      reach those that are able to buy now. Resources from LA2050 will support
      an advertising and outreach campaign.The ad campaign will include
      mailing,  advertising in local papers and on radio stations, possibly even
      billboards. 
  - name: Please explain how you will evaluate your work.
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "We'll evaluate our work through new memberships attained, growing our community of supporters, and by being closer to our goal of opening a food co-op. Additionally, we will track awareness of our project in the community through actions outlined in our business plan: surveys conducted at community workshops, follow-ups to our feasibility study(surveys), implementing a successful crowdfunding campaign, and engaging Cooperative Development Services.\r\nThere will be evidence of our growth through hiring a qualified Bookkeeper and Project Manager to implement our growth strategy. With this personnel in place we will grow and achieve our goals sooner"

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "There are two other healthy food stores forming in South LA .Neither one is a cooperative, one or both are b-corps. Neither has opened doors yet. They are situated in the Vermont corridor well east of Leimert Park in the Crenshaw corridor where SoLA plans to be. One is With Love Community Market and Café ( 18th St and Vermont), the other is Community Services Unlimited (66th and Vermont).\r\n\r\nSoLA's profits will belong to the members, that's the big difference.The profits of the co-op are shared and therefore reenter the community through our members.\r\n\r\n We also plan to be a store with classroom space, a deli, in store eating space, a bulk buying section as well as organic produce. SoLA is a unique opportunity for South LA to take charge of it's food sources and it's health and to reap the financial benefits of doing so."

      Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on
      this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner
      receive?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Since it's inception, SoLA has sought advice from cooperative development organizations. We will continue to refer to these our \"elders\" as we grow. They are: California Center for Cooperative Development, and Food Co-op Initiative. There is no cost to SoLA for the expertise and advice of these organizations. Our work with the consulting group specifically geared toward helping build new co-ops,CDS Consulting Co-op, will cost $7,000 for the initial assessment workshop with SoLA's board of directors, in which a strategic plan is created, and an additional $7,000 for their continued consult in a maintenance program for one year.\r\nSoLA  plans to create corporate sponsored memberships for needy families, partnering with organizations like Groceryships, to invite graduates of their program to receive sponsorships to become members of the co-op."

      Our completed store will cost approximately 1.5 million dollars. Ideally,
      30 % of start-up costs will come from membership equity. Additional
      funding will include bank loans, member loans , grants, and donations.

      A $100,000 dollar award will bring us closer to  the grand opening of SoLA
      Food Co-op and providing this much needed resource for our South LA
      community. At the end of the grant year and a successful advertising
      campaign, we have set a goal of achieving 700 members, and having a
      financial strategy and systems in place to clearly define the next steps
      for the cooperative. With this level of membership we'll be ready to
      secure a site for the store and begin financing toward hiring a general
      manager,designing and equipping the store, obtaining inventory,and
      opening.
