title: >-
  SoLA Food Co-op a source for healthy food and community empowerment in South
  LA
project_summary: >-
  SoLA  seeks to provide better access to natural, organic and non GMO foods in
  South LA in the form of a full service grocery cooperative. We envision our
  store as a place not only for shopping but for learning , in cooking and
  nutrition classes, and for the community to gather, share prepared foods,
  fresh juices, and organic coffee. We feel that in an area long overlooked,
  with too few grocery stores, that is a food desert, a health foods cooperative
  is a brilliant solution.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  There are far fewer grocery stores per person in South LA than there are in
  West LA. Many people here who have the means, travel outside of our area to
  buy organic, healthy foods. That means the area suffers from retail leakage,
  money leaving the community. The community drives more than it should have to,
  to reach healthy food stores, increasing our carbon footprint. Some of our
  supporters travel by bus, taking as many as six buses to shop at Whole Foods.
   The South LA community deserves the same options in healthy eating as other parts of the city. 
   SoLA raises awareness in the South LA community around healthy eating practices. It is our practice to teach ways of addressing the diet related illnesses our community is plagued with, through fun events,nutrition classes, and workshops.
    SoLA will bring a strong sense of pride of ownership to our neighborhood and our member/owners. There has never been a beautiful full service health food store of the type we envision in this part of LA.
   As a cooperative, SoLA's profits will be distributed among it's members, further enriching this community.
    Instead of a food desert, SoLA will create an oasis, an oasis of accessibility, inclusion, self-sufficiency, health, nutritional education and economic empowerment.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Most healthy co-ops open with 800-1,000 members. Since our incorporation in
  2014 we've seen how hard it is to sell the co-op memberships. While our list
  serv is nearly 1,700 subscribers, less than one tenth of those have actually
  become members. Our challenge is to reach more people and to reach those that
  are able to buy now. Resources from LA2050 will support an advertising and
  outreach campaign.The ad campaign will include mailing, advertising in local
  papers and on radio stations, possibly even billboards.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We'll evaluate our work through new memberships attained, growing our
  community of supporters, and by being closer to our goal of opening a food
  co-op. Additionally, we will track awareness of our project in the community
  through actions outlined in our business plan: surveys conducted at community
  workshops, follow-ups to our feasibility study(surveys), implementing a
  successful crowdfunding campaign, and engaging Cooperative Development
  Services.
   There will be evidence of our growth through hiring a qualified Bookkeeper and Project Manager to implement our growth strategy. With this personnel in place we will grow and achieve our goals sooner
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There are two other healthy food stores forming in South LA .Neither one is a
  cooperative, one or both are b-corps. Neither has opened doors yet. They are
  situated in the Vermont corridor well east of Leimert Park in the Crenshaw
  corridor where SoLA plans to be. One is With Love Community Market and Café (
  18th St and Vermont), the other is Community Services Unlimited (66th and
  Vermont).
   
   SoLA's profits will belong to the members, that's the big difference.The profits of the co-op are shared and therefore reenter the community through our members.
   
    We also plan to be a store with classroom space, a deli, in store eating space, a bulk buying section as well as organic produce. SoLA is a unique opportunity for South LA to take charge of it's food sources and it's health and to reap the financial benefits of doing so.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Since it's inception, SoLA has sought advice from cooperative development
  organizations. We will continue to refer to these our "elders" as we grow.
  They are: California Center for Cooperative Development, and Food Co-op
  Initiative. There is no cost to SoLA for the expertise and advice of these
  organizations. Our work with the consulting group specifically geared toward
  helping build new co-ops,CDS Consulting Co-op, will cost $7,000 for the
  initial assessment workshop with SoLA's board of directors, in which a
  strategic plan is created, and an additional $7,000 for their continued
  consult in a maintenance program for one year.
   SoLA plans to create corporate sponsored memberships for needy families, partnering with organizations like Groceryships, to invite graduates of their program to receive sponsorships to become members of the co-op.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  A $100,000 dollar award will bring us closer to the grand opening of SoLA Food
  Co-op and providing this much needed resource for our South LA community. At
  the end of the grant year and a successful advertising campaign, we have set a
  goal of achieving 700 members, and having a financial strategy and systems in
  place to clearly define the next steps for the cooperative. With this level of
  membership we'll be ready to secure a site for the store and begin financing
  toward hiring a general manager,designing and equipping the store, obtaining
  inventory,and opening.
