  The Thrive Center at Samohi was conceived as part of a suite of strategies to
  address critical challenges faced by people in our community. These challenges
  were identified through development of a broad definition of wellbeing first
  as part of our youth-focused Santa Monica Cradle to Career Initiative and then
  scaled to the community at large through our award-winning Wellbeing Project.
  Based on these definitions, we developed mechanisms to measure levels of
  wellbeing in our community. The Youth Wellbeing Report Card, released in 2012
  and updated in 2014, revealed striking baseline findings about the state of
  mental health and rate of substance abuse among our children, especially among
  high school students. Success of the Thrive Center will be measured in both
  micro and macro terms - outputs like rate of use, clinical contact hours,
  number of faculty trained, as well as moving the dial on adolescent mental
  health and substance abuse rates as shown in the youth wellbeing report card.

  - Money (financial capital)
  - Volunteers/staff (human capital)
  - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
  - Education/training
  - 'Technical infrastructure (computers, etc.)'
