  Teens are facing a mental health crisis due to a complex interplay of factors
  that takes many forms, including substance abuse, social isolation,
  depression, and suicidal ideation. The Thrive Center at Santa Monica High
  School will tackle the crisis head-on through coordinated wellbeing services
  and positive psychology. This next generation school-based health center will
  be a place where teens learn how to do more than just survive - they will find
  the support and tools needed to thrive.

  As a regional Title 1 school, Samohi serves a diverse population of 3,100
  students from a wide range of cultures, backgrounds, and households. Samohi is
  also at the frontline of an unprecedented adolescent mental health crisis
  experienced locally, regionally, and nationally. According to Centers for
  Disease Control, 20% of American children ages 3-17 have a mental health
  issue, a rate that has steadily increased since 1994, with suicide as the
  leading cause of death among this age group in 2014. Regionally, over 16% of
  youth in LA County suffer from emotional and mental health problems, with 32%
  of 7th-12th graders reporting depressive feelings and nearly 20% experiencing
  suicidal thoughts (UCLA Center for Policy & Research). In our own backyard, we
  have found shockingly high rates of substance abuse, depression, social
  isolation, and thoughts of suicide among Santa Monica high school students
  that exceed regional averages. 
   
   Adolescent mental and behavioral health issues stem from a complex interplay of factors. Reliance on traditional clinical approaches to address this crisis is not getting the job done. Santa Monica will become the first city and school district in LA County to create a center providing coordinated services focused on youth wellbeing. The Thrive Center at Samohi will not be your typical school-based health center. It will be more than a dingy office with a bowl of condoms, a nurse, and some DARE posters. The Thrive Center at Samohi will be a vibrant space putting cutting-edge wellbeing research into practice. Youth will learn strategies to address the full spectrum of factors influencing their personal wellbeing, both in the immediate and long-term. Co-created with students, activities will focus on both mental and physical health, including stress management, building connections with others, and other wellbeing-boosters. This will serve as the foundation for lifelong empowerment to better understand and take charge of improving one’s personal wellbeing. The Thrive Center at Samohi will be a key component in a suite of collective impact strategies to actively improve the health and wellbeing of our community’s most valuable resource: our youth. 
   
   Mental health issues impact communities regardless of background, economics, or other demographic characteristics. What we learn in Santa Monica will be open and scalable to communities throughout Los Angeles dealing with this adolescent mental and behavioral health crisis.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  1: No Model Exists. We will revolutionize school-based health services using
  wellbeing research and positive psychology. As an internationally-recognized
  leader, we can leverage lessons learned and established partnerships to
  develop an effective, sustainable program. 
   3: Student Skepticism. School-based health centers are clinical with an undeniable hospital vibe. As such, use rates are typically low. The Thrive Center will be radically different. The space and services will be co-created with students and oriented toward positivity. 
   3: Adult Skepticism. Wellbeing is often confused with happiness, and therefore easily dismissed. We have been working for 4 years to build awareness and solidify wellbeing as a credible framework for understanding the myriad factors impacting people’s lives. We have established mechanisms for measuring wellbeing and a network of supporters. Hard data, early adopters, and updated educator and service provider training will help us to counter skepticism.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  The Thrive Center at Samohi was conceived as part of a suite of strategies to
  address critical challenges faced by people in our community. These challenges
  were identified through development of a broad definition of wellbeing first
  as part of our youth-focused Santa Monica Cradle to Career Initiative and then
  scaled to the community at large through our award-winning Wellbeing Project.
  Based on these definitions, we developed mechanisms to measure levels of
  wellbeing in our community. The Youth Wellbeing Report Card, released in 2012
  and updated in 2014, revealed striking baseline findings about the state of
  mental health and rate of substance abuse among our children, especially among
  high school students. Success of the Thrive Center will be measured in both
  micro and macro terms - outputs like rate of use, clinical contact hours,
  number of faculty trained, as well as moving the dial on adolescent mental
  health and substance abuse rates as shown in the youth wellbeing report card.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  School-based health services is not a new concept. Over 2,000 programs exist
  nationwide, with 271 in California and 72 in LA County. The majority of
  programs focus on a narrow clinical set of traditional services. Clinical
  services are an important 1st step, but only a small fraction take youth
  engagement and limited wellness-oriented services into account. 
   
   There are other evolving models as well. In Los Angeles, the LA Trust for Children’s Health has worked with LAUSD to update their school-based mental health centers to deal with the current crisis. Located at 14 high priority areas, these Wellness Centers are more in alignment with the goals of The Thrive Center and we have partnered with the LA Trust to learn from their example. Our project seeks to take the concept further by combining their lessons learned with our work in advancing community wellbeing. 
    
   Wellbeing services are emerging as effective ways to address the complex interplay of factors in mental and behavioral health. For example, CalState Northridge established the Oasis Center in response to a growing mental health crisis on campus. While CSUN’s program is not targeted to the same demographic as The Thrive Center, it is an important contribution to this next generation of wellbeing-oriented school-based health services. 
   Beyond LA, there is a growing coalition reimagining the potential of school-based health programs. The San Francisco Wellness Initiative is a dedicated to improving the health, wellbeing, and academic success of the city’s 16,000 public high school students. The program is similar in that it is based on an updated view of health. Services provided by adolescent health professionals will help students learn to deal with the various mental health stressors they encounter. This initiative is not a competitor of The Thrive Center. Rather it is evidence that this emerging holistic focus on coordinated wellbeing services is the next frontier of school-based health services. 
   Our program is different in that it is data-driven, partnership-based, and will be co-created with students to ensure the end result meets the needs of and appeals to our primary end users. While we are starting small, Samohi is a Title 1 school with a highly diverse population, 20% of which live in surrounding areas of LA. This, plus our existing partnerships, will help us establish an open knowledge sharing network with a built-in reach well beyond the borders of Santa Monica.

  The Thrive Center is part of a suite of strategies to address the health and
  wellbeing of children from cradle to career. Bringing this concept to life
  will require a multi-agency collective impact approach. Led by the City of
  Santa Monica and SMMUSD, Thrive Center partners include:

'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  As part of a collective impact collaborative, The Thrive Center is supported
  by the City of Santa Monica, SMMUSD, and partners through direct funding and
  in-kind services. Start up costs include resources needed to secure a physical
  location, planning resources to develop and implementation and service plan,
  and one time technical infrastructure. Total project implementation is
  estimated to cost approximately $300,000, as follows: 
   
   Facilities: $50k
   Health Services Staff, Infrastructure & Service Delivery Tracking: $100k 
   Coordinated Mental Health Care & Direct Student services: $75k
   Mindfulness Capacity Building Program Development: $30k
   Human Centered Design Services: $25k
   
   Ongoing operation is estimated to cost $75k-$100k annually, depending on services provided and hours of operation. Both startup and ongoing operation costs are in line with national averages, according to the Alliance for School-Based Health Centers. 
   
   Startup and ongoing operation costs above and beyond the $100k LA2050 grant will be funded through a $200k 4-year grant from the City of Santa Monica and a $50k in-kind contribution from SMMUSD for facilities. As part of its partnership in the project, Venice Family Clinic will also use its expertise in securing health reimbursements to assist with ongoing operation costs. Other potential funding could come via Federal health care reform, which has provided a much-needed financial boost for school-based health centers. For the first time in history, dedicated funding has been allocated for these services ($200M over 4 years for the construction and equipment for centers). Thrive Center partners will explore all available funding options to ensure continued operation of this program.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
  100% of this $100,000 grant will be applied directly toward startup costs to
  create The Thrive Center at Samohi, to be broken down as follows: 
   
   Venice Family Clinic: Administrative support and fundraising activities, $25k
   Family Services of Santa Monica: Inter-agency coordination to create and deliver services: $25k
   Yes For Schools: Additional program design and service delivery: $30k
   Human Centered Design Partner TBD: Co-creation of physical space and supporting technology: $10k
   LA Trust for Children’s Health: Technical assistance with program development: $10k
   
   Additional startup and ongoing costs will be covered by in kind contributions, existing partnerships, City grant funds, and other sources.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  The Thrive Center is a highly scalable concept with the potential to reach
  tens of thousands of young people throughout Los Angeles. Growing this project
  can be achieved in 3 phases.
   
   Immediate scalability will focus on reaching all 3,000 students at Samohi, over 20% of whom live in low income communities throughout Los Angeles. Our multi-pronged strategy for reaching the entire school population includes student co-creation, integrated school-wide health nudges, and embedding wellbeing science and positive psychology into curriculum, training, school culture, and student support activities. By involving students in the design of services, space, and outreach, we will ensure that the Center is created with end users in mind from the start, thereby increasing its uptake among the student community. Health nudges are a flexible and proven to work. They can include text message campaigns, modifications to the school cafeteria and other common spaces based on the science of choice architecture, and modernized public health messages based on principles of behavioral psychology. Finally, by integrating wellbeing into regular faculty training and student support services, concepts including mindfulness, mindset training, and positive psychology will become embedded into the school day.
   
   The next level of scale will extend this pilot program beyond Samohi to SMMUSD’s robust school-based mental health infrastructure that provides support services for students at 4 Title 1 schools, including John Adams Middle School. Based on what we learn about growing wellbeing services at Samohi, we will be able to replicate our model throughout an existing school-based mental health service infrastructure that will reach students throughout Santa Monica’s school district.
   
   The third level will focus reach beyond Santa Monica through our established relationships with the LA Trust for Children’s Health and Alliance for School Based Health Centers. By creating an open knowledge sharing network through these partnerships, we will help disseminate The Thrive Center wellbeing services model for replication in at least 14 existing student wellness centers located in high priority areas throughout Los Angeles.

  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "The Thrive Center is a highly scalable concept with the potential to reach tens of thousands of young people throughout Los Angeles. Growing this project can be achieved in 3 phases.\r\n\r\nImmediate scalability will focus on reaching all 3,000 students at Samohi, over 20% of whom live in low income communities throughout Los Angeles. Our multi-pronged strategy for reaching the entire school population includes student co-creation, integrated school-wide health nudges, and embedding wellbeing science and positive psychology into curriculum, training, school culture, and student support activities. By involving students in the design of services, space, and outreach, we will ensure that the Center is created with end users in mind from the start, thereby increasing its uptake among the student community. Health nudges are a flexible and proven to work. They can include text message campaigns, modifications to the school cafeteria and other common spaces based on the science of choice architecture, and modernized public health messages based on principles of behavioral psychology. Finally, by integrating wellbeing into regular faculty training and student support services, concepts including mindfulness, mindset training, and positive psychology will become embedded into the school day.\r\n\r\nThe next level of scale will extend this pilot program beyond Samohi to SMMUSD’s robust school-based mental health infrastructure that provides support services for students at 4 Title 1 schools, including John Adams Middle School. Based on what we learn about growing wellbeing services at Samohi, we will be able to replicate our model throughout an existing school-based mental health service infrastructure that will reach students throughout Santa Monica’s school district.\r\n\r\nThe third level will focus reach beyond Santa Monica through our established relationships with the LA Trust for Children’s Health and Alliance for School Based Health Centers. By creating an open knowledge sharing network through these partnerships, we will help disseminate The Thrive Center wellbeing services model for replication in at least 14 existing student wellness centers located in high priority areas throughout Los Angeles.

    answer: "As a regional Title 1 school, Samohi serves a diverse population of  3,100 students from a wide range of cultures, backgrounds, and households. Samohi is also at the frontline of an unprecedented adolescent mental health crisis experienced locally, regionally, and nationally. According to Centers for Disease Control, 20% of American children ages 3-17 have a mental health issue, a rate that has steadily increased since 1994, with suicide as the leading cause of death among this age group in 2014. Regionally, over 16% of youth in LA County suffer from  emotional and mental health problems, with 32% of 7th-12th graders reporting depressive feelings and nearly 20% experiencing suicidal thoughts (UCLA Center for Policy & Research). In  our own backyard, we have found shockingly high rates of substance abuse, depression, social isolation, and thoughts of suicide among Santa Monica high school students that exceed regional averages. \r\n\r\nAdolescent mental and behavioral health issues stem from a complex interplay of factors. Reliance on traditional clinical approaches to address this crisis is not getting the job done. Santa Monica will become the first city and school district in LA County to create a center providing coordinated services focused on youth wellbeing. The Thrive Center at Samohi will not be your typical school-based health center. It will be more than a dingy office with a bowl of condoms, a nurse, and some DARE posters. The Thrive Center at Samohi will be a vibrant space putting cutting-edge wellbeing research into practice. Youth will learn strategies to address the full spectrum of factors influencing their personal wellbeing, both in the immediate and long-term. Co-created with students, activities will focus on both mental and physical health, including stress management, building connections with others, and other wellbeing-boosters. This will serve as the foundation for lifelong empowerment to better understand and take charge of improving one’s personal wellbeing. The Thrive Center at Samohi will be a key component in a suite of collective impact strategies to actively improve the health and wellbeing of our community’s most valuable resource: our youth. \r\n\r\nMental health issues impact communities regardless of background, economics, or other demographic characteristics. What we learn in Santa Monica will be open and scalable to communities throughout Los Angeles dealing with this adolescent mental and behavioral health crisis."

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''

    answer: "1: No Model Exists. We will revolutionize school-based health services using wellbeing research and positive psychology. As an internationally-recognized leader, we can leverage lessons learned and established partnerships to develop an effective, sustainable program. \r\n3: Student Skepticism. School-based health centers are clinical with an undeniable hospital vibe. As such, use rates are typically low. The Thrive Center will be radically different. The space and services will be co-created with students and oriented toward positivity. \r\n3: Adult Skepticism. Wellbeing is often confused with happiness, and therefore easily dismissed. We have been working for 4 years to build awareness and solidify wellbeing as a credible framework for understanding the myriad factors impacting people’s lives. We have established mechanisms for measuring wellbeing and a network of supporters. Hard data, early adopters, and updated educator and service provider training will help us to counter skepticism."

      The Thrive Center at Samohi was conceived as part of a suite of strategies
      to address critical challenges faced by people in our community. These
      challenges were identified through development of a broad definition of
      wellbeing first as part of our youth-focused Santa Monica Cradle to Career
      Initiative and then scaled to the community at large through our
      award-winning Wellbeing Project. Based on these definitions, we developed
      mechanisms to measure levels of wellbeing in our community. The Youth
      Wellbeing Report Card, released in 2012 and updated in 2014, revealed
      striking baseline findings about the state of mental health and rate of
      substance abuse among our children, especially among high school students.
      Success of the Thrive Center will be measured in both micro and macro
      terms - outputs like rate of use, clinical contact hours, number of
      faculty trained, as well as moving the dial on adolescent mental health
      and substance abuse rates as shown in the youth wellbeing report card.

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "School-based health services is not a new concept. Over 2,000 programs exist nationwide, with 271 in California and 72 in LA County. The majority of programs focus on a narrow clinical set of traditional services. Clinical services are an important 1st step, but only a small fraction take youth engagement and limited wellness-oriented services into account. \r\n\r\nThere are other evolving models as well. In Los Angeles, the LA Trust for Children’s Health has worked with LAUSD to update their school-based mental health centers to deal with the current crisis. Located at 14 high priority areas, these Wellness Centers are more in alignment with the goals of The Thrive Center and we have partnered with the LA Trust to learn from their example. Our project seeks to take the concept further by combining their lessons learned with our work in advancing community wellbeing. \r\n \r\nWellbeing services are emerging as effective ways to address the complex interplay of factors in mental and behavioral health. For example, CalState Northridge established the Oasis Center in response to a growing mental health crisis on campus. While CSUN’s program is not targeted to the same demographic as The Thrive Center, it is an important contribution to this next generation of wellbeing-oriented school-based health services. \r\nBeyond LA, there is a growing coalition reimagining the potential of school-based health programs. The San Francisco Wellness Initiative is a dedicated to improving the health, wellbeing, and academic success of the city’s 16,000 public high school students. The program is similar in that it is based on an updated view of health. Services provided by adolescent health professionals will help students learn to deal with the various mental health stressors they encounter. This initiative is not a competitor of The Thrive Center. Rather it is evidence that this emerging holistic focus on coordinated wellbeing services is the next frontier of school-based health services. \r\nOur program is different in that it is data-driven, partnership-based, and will be co-created with students to ensure the end result meets the needs of and appeals to our primary end users. While we are starting small, Samohi is a Title 1 school with a highly diverse population, 20% of which live in surrounding areas of LA. This, plus our existing partnerships, will help us establish an open knowledge sharing network with a built-in reach well beyond the borders of Santa Monica."

      How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you
      cover the additional costs?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "As part of a collective impact collaborative, The Thrive Center is supported by the City of Santa Monica, SMMUSD, and partners through direct funding and in-kind services. Start up costs include resources needed to secure a physical location, planning resources to develop and implementation and service plan, and one time technical infrastructure. Total project implementation is estimated to cost approximately $300,000, as follows: \r\n\r\nFacilities: $50k\r\nHealth Services Staff, Infrastructure & Service Delivery Tracking: $100k \r\nCoordinated Mental Health Care & Direct Student services: $75k\r\nMindfulness Capacity Building Program Development: $30k\r\nHuman Centered Design Services: $25k\r\n\r\nOngoing operation is estimated to cost $75k-$100k annually, depending on services provided and hours of operation. Both startup and ongoing operation costs are in line with national averages, according to the Alliance for School-Based Health Centers. \r\n\r\nStartup and ongoing operation costs above and beyond the $100k LA2050 grant will be funded through a $200k 4-year grant from the City of Santa Monica and a $50k in-kind contribution from SMMUSD for facilities. As part of its partnership in the project, Venice Family Clinic will also use its expertise in securing health reimbursements to assist with ongoing operation costs. Other potential funding could come via Federal health care reform, which has provided a much-needed financial boost for school-based health centers. For the first time in history, dedicated funding has been allocated for these services ($200M over 4 years for the construction and equipment for centers). Thrive Center partners will explore all available funding options to ensure continued operation of this program. "

    answer: "The Thrive Center is a highly scalable concept with the potential to reach tens of thousands of young people throughout Los Angeles. Growing this project can be achieved in 3 phases.\r\n\r\nImmediate scalability will focus on reaching all 3,000 students at Samohi, over 20% of whom live in low income communities throughout Los Angeles. Our multi-pronged strategy for reaching the entire school population includes student co-creation, integrated school-wide health nudges, and embedding wellbeing science and positive psychology into curriculum, training, school culture, and student support activities. By involving students in the design of services, space, and outreach, we will ensure that the Center is created with end users in mind from the start, thereby increasing its uptake among the student community. Health nudges are a flexible and proven to work. They can include text message campaigns, modifications to the school cafeteria and other common spaces based on the science of choice architecture, and modernized public health messages based on principles of behavioral psychology. Finally, by integrating wellbeing into regular faculty training and student support services, concepts including mindfulness, mindset training, and positive psychology will become embedded into the school day.\r\n\r\nThe next level of scale will extend this pilot program beyond Samohi to SMMUSD’s robust school-based mental health infrastructure that provides support services for students at 4 Title 1 schools, including John Adams Middle School. Based on what we learn about growing wellbeing services at Samohi, we will be able to replicate our model throughout an existing school-based mental health service infrastructure that will reach students throughout Santa Monica’s school district.\r\n\r\nThe third level will focus reach beyond Santa Monica through our established relationships with the LA Trust for Children’s Health and Alliance for School Based Health Centers. By creating an open knowledge sharing network through these partnerships, we will help disseminate The Thrive Center wellbeing services model for replication in at least 14 existing student wellness centers located in high priority areas throughout Los Angeles.
