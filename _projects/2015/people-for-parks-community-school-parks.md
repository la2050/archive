  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to play.: "People for Parks works towards the day when all Angelenos can walk to a park. As part of this effort, we will open six Community School Parks in LA in 2016 and empower parents and community members to participate in park activity and sustainability so that these spaces thrive for years to come.  \r\n\r\nCommunity School Parks (CSPs) are supervised school-site playgrounds that are open to the public on weekends, holidays and summers and feature dynamic programming carried out by school staff. \r\n\r\nIn 2012, PFP tore up asphalt, replaced it with grassy fields and tracks and opened life-changing CSPs at Vine and Trinity Street Elementary schools. Using the formerly closed school sites as space for physical activity has led to healthier living, better nutrition, family and community strengthening, documented improvements in academics and reduction in obesity. They also helped families feel safer about playing in the neighborhood, as school principals confirmed major drops in vandalism and other signs of trouble. \r\n\r\n90% of youth in Boston and New York live within 1/4 mile of a park compared with 33% of LA children. The LA Unified School District is the second largest landowner in LA. Unlocking its school playgrounds on weekends brings parks to underserved communities, where parents are overworked and 86% of children are eligible for free/reduced lunches; 72% are Hispanic/Latino.\r\n\r\nOpening six new Community School Parks means 25,000-30,000 more Angelenos will have access to a safe park 1/4 mile or less from home. Once afraid to go outside in areas with the highest reported percentages of gang activity, children and families will enjoy park time at their own school campus surrounded by friends and staff. \r\n\r\nResidents will discover a vibrant park and enjoy programming run by dedicated specialists. Activities include organized sports, fitness exercises, intergenerational activities, art/crafts, storytelling, outdoor learning, gardening, ecology and multi-cultural events. Baseball clinics and other team-building activities held at the parks by our newest partner, the LA Dodgers, are in the planning phases.\r\n\r\nCommunity members will also receive training and support on park programming, maintenance and shared use through our Incubator, which helps ensure CSP sustainability and scalability.\r\n\r\nOne parent says it all-- The park staff members lovingly assist our kids with crafts, sports and other physical fitness games and also keep the area secure for our entire family.”"

Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Opening six Community School Parks in a year is an extensive undertaking. We
  have the proven blueprint but need more manpower. We will hire two community
  organizers who, along with board members and current staff, will engage
  residents, train volunteers and coordinate the opening and programming of our
  new parks.
   
   People for Parks’ Community School Parks project includes mobilizing parents and other school community members to participate in park programming, upkeep and shared use facilitation. We realize, however, that community availability depends on family responsibilities, work schedules and language concerns. PFP faces this challenge by taking the community’s lead in assessing how best to participate. In some cases, this means providing resources for parents to garden at school parks. In others, it means creating CSP councils or coordinating canvasing activities. Learning from community members about the sustainability strategies that work best for them will ensure success.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  The first marker of success will be the opening of six Community School Parks.
  Park use statistics by LAUSD enrichment staff will evaluate the goal that each
  park serves at least 300-500 patrons per month for recreation and 500+ for
  special events. 
   
   Scores from LAUSD’s Physical Fitness Summary, statewide 5th grade obesity testing and academic scores will help us evaluate the quality and vibrancy of parks.
   
   Surveys, youth enrichment assessments and interviews with school staff, parents, children and community members will also help us grade park effectiveness and impact on LA2050 dream metrics--park access, vibrancy, crime reduction, feeling safe in neighborhoods, intergenerational play, numbers in afterschool programs, quality of informal spaces--as well as fitness, health and community building. 
   
   General data from and consultation with the LA County Dept. of Public Health ‘Joint Use Moving People to Play’ task force will be used by PFP to maintain the quality of evaluations.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  People for Parks (PFP) is currently the only organization actively opening
  LAUSD school playgrounds as parks that offer supervised play and programming
  for the community on weekends, holidays and summers. 
   
   What makes us unique is a) the scale at which we are engaged in transforming LAUSD school playgrounds into parks; b) our fast track permit process, allowing schools to join People for Parks’ existing service agreement with LAUSD; c) the youth enrichment programming offered at parks during non-school hours and d) the trainings and toolkits provided for residents, parents and school staff to take on greater roles in CSP management so as to ensure sustainability, minimize future operating costs and strengthen each school community. 
   
   People for Parks is aware of and linked with several groups that are doing complementary work focused on greening, restoring or expanding existing city parks, or purchasing property and building new parks. These organizations include The Trust for Public Land, the Hollywood/LA Beautification Team, The Neighborhood Land Trust, Tree People, Muir Ranch, Koreatown Youth and Community Center and the LA Parks Foundation. PFP remains in contact with these groups regarding possible partnerships and looks forward to engaging with others.
   
   As members of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health “Joint Use Moving People to Play” (JUMPP) task force, PFP is also in contact with organizations dedicated to empowering kids and adults to be more physically active by expanding joint or shared use recreation facilities. These groups offer community access arrangements, but not at our current scale or service area. PFP consults with JUMPP on our current Community School Parks project and looks forward to collaborating more extensively with JUMPP partners on future projects. 
   
   PFP is also aware of several community groups such as the Wonderland School PTA and Brentwood Green, whose co-founder is PFP’s current president. They use individual contributions, community fundraisers and grants to gain access to their school playgrounds and offer programming during non-school hours. Each of these groups is located in affluent communities so their strategies are not fully applicable to the sites PFP would open using LA2050 funds. Their approaches are nevertheless sources of inspiration and through partnership and consultation can inform how community groups at our six proposed sites can play active roles in park sustainability.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Our primary collaboration is with LAUSD, and more specifically Beyond the Bell
  (BTB), which is the district’s after school youth enrichment arm. We have
  enjoyed working with BTB since 2012. As detailed in our budget below, BTB
  staff will unlock school playgrounds and provide supervision and programming
  at six schools every Saturday or Sunday for one full year. LAUSD custodians
  will provide basic maintenance and bathroom upkeep, where applicable. The
  total amount charged for these services per park is $5,700, which comes to
  $34,200 for all six schools. This would make up approximately 34% of the grant
  funds.
   
   The Community School Parks model has also brought together diverse agency partners to collaborate on long-term solutions in support of community access to school sites for public recreation. We will continue corresponding with these partners as we carry out the grant, should we receive it. None of these partners would receive portions of our LA2050 grant.
   
   The LA Promise Zone project is one of ten federal anti-poverty “promise” initiatives in the US dedicated to making under-resourced communities more livable. A crucial part of this mission is expanding park space and turning schools into community hubs. The LA Promise Zone covers sections of Hollywood, Koreatown and Pico Union. As Promise Zone partners, People for Parks receives technical support from the L.A. Promise Zone network. This ranges from strategizing with other Promise Zone partners on executing project goals to assistance with federal grants. 
    
   LA’s County Department of Public Health “Joint Use Moving People to Play” (JUMPP) is dedicated to empowering kids and adults to be more physically active by expanding joint or shared use recreational opportunities. As members of the JUMPP task force, People for Parks will receive consulting assistance on data evaluation and community training, especially as it concerns making the language around joint/shared use more accessible to the general public.
   
   Other partners include the L.A. Department of Parks and Recreation, the L.A. Mayor’s Office, the Trust for Public Land, the Hollywood/LA Beautification Team, Tree People, the Koreatown Youth and Community Center, the LA Dodgers, Big Sunday, Muir Ranch, Enrich LA, various LA neighborhood councils as well as parent and volunteer groups.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Scaling up the success of our pilot sites is crucial. PFP has started this
  process by identifying 20 partially greened schoolyards that are locked off
  from their communities. We conducted needs assessments based on school and
  community feedback and local park accessibility. These sites are ready to be
  opened, but require shared use agreements and funding for park
  supervision/programming. 
   
   The first six schools in this group are those listed on this grant. As such, the LA2050 grant would be part of our move to scale up. 
   
   The tools we use to ensure a) the sustainability of these six parks and b) the scalability of our Community School Parks project (so that we can open additional parks) are administered through our Community School Parks Incubator.
   
   People for Parks’ CSP Incubator is a community-driven empowerment strategy that equips parents, school staff and neighbors with the resources needed to oversee existing CSPs and form new ones. PFP provides communities with funding, materials and trainings on park maintenance, programming, shared use policy, CSP wellness council coordination and an interactive website developed by PFP. We also offer communities the option to join our current service agreement with LAUSD, which provides programming, supervision and shared use access. The work is undertaken by the People for Parks CSP Incubator committee, community organizers, parents, former LAUSD facilities staff, and parkland use experts.
   
   Community School Parks Incubator trainings and toolkit also include:
   o Joint/Shared Use: Education on what entails and how it positively impacts schools and neighborhoods. 
   o Parent Involvement: Following the lead of and supporting parents in leadership roles in park activities such as gardening, park maintenance, activities club formation, and canvassing for local support. At Berendo, for example, we will provide greening assistance for a group of parents eager to enhance gardens in the schools’ grassy play spaces. Doing so will increase park vibrancy, attracting additional community involvement and support.
   o Civic Engagement: Engaging parents, teachers and stakeholders to elevate community voice in Community School Park formation/maintenance. Organizing participation in key neighborhood, city and district policy meetings. 
   o Fundraising:Training and assistance for community members seeking funds for ongoing park activity. Includes assistance requesting funds from the county, city and neighborhood councils.
