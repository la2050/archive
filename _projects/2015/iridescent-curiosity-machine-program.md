    Iridescent proposes to provide year-long STEM hands on curriculum and
    support to students, teachers and parents from two selected Title 1
    elementary schools in Los Angeles.  Iridescent will implement a model that
    deeply engages and trains parents, educators and STEM mentors - to
    collectively support students in high quality, hands-on STEM learning. 
  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "Iridescent’s approach connects families in underserved communities with scientists and engineers from academia and industry and nurtures these relationships over time with the help of technology. Iridescent supports:\t\t\t\t\t\r\n• Strong Parental Training & Involvement: Parents learn alongside their children to acquire knowledge and skills to support their children’s development of critical thinking and problem- solving skills.\t\r\n• Multi-year access to STEM experts from Industry & Universities: STEM professionals are trained to develop and teach unique hands-on projects and provide multi-year mentorship to deepen conceptual knowledge\t\t\r\n• Technology Platform for Scale & Multi-year Engagement: Iridescent trains parents and educators to use its online curriculum and mentoring platform\r\nIridescent will support up to 300/school, and will:\r\nSupport 8 educators through in-person and online training, in using the Curiosity Machine curriculum in their classroom and in out-of-school programs to increase parental involvement and build a strong learning community. \r\nRecruit and train LA based STEM mentors (university students and/or industry professionals) to mentor students online, support educators using the curriculum in class, and lead the Curiosity Machine Course after school with students and their families. \r\nIridescent will support 40 parents, who will learn to facilitate hands-on STEM projects, foster a growth mindset and help children develop critical thinking skills. Parents will have access to all training modules to deepen their learning.\r\nSupport the implementation of 2 Curiosity Machine Courses at each school with the goals to inspire participants with cutting-edge innovations from industry and research, build a long-term relationship between engineers and families, model the engineering design process and effective strategies for working through failure, and introduce the Curiosity Machine platform as a resource for continued learning at home.\r\nIridescent was recently part of a five-year NSF longitudinal study that revealed that after its programs:\r\n90% of the students understood science and engineering better\r\n88% of students had a better understanding of what jobs are available in those fields.\r\n91% of parents said they would encourage their child to pursue a STEM education or career.\t\t\r\n94% of parents did more hands-on science projects with their children at home, demonstrating that involving parents is effective in extending learning beyond the program."

  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Iridescent will evaluate program data from each stakeholder group (engineers, parents, educators and students).\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nStudent learning gains: Based on prior results and external evaluations, we anticipate students will make gains across two main areas: interest in STEM careers and higher education, and increase in higher-order cognitive traits of persistence, creativity, curiosity and the engineering design process. Trained mentors will score projects according to evidence-based assessment rubric. A technology-based platform such as Curiosity Machine allows evidence-based assessment for each student – with efficiency and scale – instead of relying on pen and paper pre- and post- surveys.\t\r\nImpact on Parents & Teachers: We will use validated surveys to assess the impact of Iridescent’s training parents and teachers. All surveys will use validated questions and are based on research on self-efficacy, STEM project based learning, parental involvement, educator efficacy and mindsets."

  Technovation gives girls the opportunity to create mobile apps to solve
  problems in their community. Through this program young girls will develop
  their technical and entrepreneurial skills while creating solutions for local
  communities. In creating local app solutions for local problems, young girls
  in LA can possibly discover the next big start-up idea. 
   
   girls get to create cool app ideas through Technovation in the following way:
   Teams of middle school and high school girls work together to complete an intensive, 50-hour curriculum. The girls are supported by a teacher (or after-school coordinator) and paired with a mentor who is a female tech professional. The curriculum is open, online and freely accessible to all. Through the program, the girls learn to:
   1. Identify a problem in their community: Girls work in teams and identify an idea for a mobile app that will help solve a problem in their community
   2. Program an app: Teams develop the actual app using a visual, block-based language called App Inventor (developed by MIT) that requires no prior knowledge of programming.
   3. Develop and deliver a pitch: Teams develop a business plan, videotape and submit their app and demo pitches for review.
   Ten finalist teams are then be chosen and flown out to Silicon Valley to pitch their apps and business plans to potential investors. The winning teams are awarded $20,000 in seed funding to take their app to market.
   
   The program will kick-off with a Girls make App Day workshop where all teams will meet with their mentors and attend a workshop focussed on the app Inventor platform. All local teams will have the opportunity to present their app ideas at the Regional Pitch event. the winning team will also have the opportunity to visit San Francisco for the World Pitch event, event if they are not selected in the top 10.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  We anticipate two major challenges for this program. We aim to reach to the
  under-served sections of the community. Convincing parents and students from
  this community to register for the program may be challenging. We hope to
  overcome this challenge by involving students from previous Technovation
  seasons as our spokespersons to share their personal experiences. We hope that
  personal stories from the same demographic group will inspire the girls to the
  value of this opportunity.
   We also anticipate the possibility of not finding adequate number of mentors to guide local teams. Since our program is global and many are mentored visually, we hope to connect local teams with mentors from across U.S. and other countries through our platform.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  All participants, mentors, teachers and students, are required to submit pre
  and post-program surveys. Results from these surveys help identify the
  learning goals of the girls and assess impact of the program on these goals.
   Anecdotal evidence gathered through case studies will also help to measure impact.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Given the low number of women in tech careers, there are many program focused
  on programming education to youth. We see organizations working with youth,
  such as Girls Scouts, Peace Corps, UN Women and UNESCO, as our distribution
  partners. We work with these organizations to offer Technovation as a
  potential youth program for their members/target audience. Technovation is the
  only GLOBAL program for GIRLS that combines problem solving with technical and
  entrepreneurial skills in one program. 
   Technovation is unique in the following ways:
   1. It combines technology and entrepreneurship. Our curriculum encourages girls to identify a problem in their community and create an app to solve it. So the girls directly identify and define the problem they are working on. Through our curriculum, girls develop problem solving, public speaking and other essential life skills.
   2. The mentoring component allows the girls to connect with role models and develop lifelong relationships. 
   3. Technovation mentors themselves gain job-related skills of mobile app development, entrepreneurship and leadership.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Iridescent aims to work with local schools and organizations to identify the
  high needs students. A Technovation Regional Ambassador will work with local
  schools on student outreach. The Regional Ambassador will recruit schools
  teachers as Technovation coaches, who will help to facilitate team sessions.
  Professionals from local companies are expected to volunteer time to mentor
  the girls and walk them through the Technovation curriculum. 
   
   Iridescent’s curriculum is free and open, we do not anticipate huge costs in implementing the program. The Regional ambassador will receive a monthly stipend for managing the program on the ground. Teachers and mentors are expected to volunteer their time.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Technovation is in the process of scaling up. We had app submissions from
  across 30 plus countries in 2015. For the 2016 season, we are hoping to expand
  to new countries and scale in existing ones. This grant will allow us to offer
  the program to more girls in LA area. We will have the resources to support
  the girls through a Regional Ambassador and largely local mentors, thereby
  improving the quality of the program.
   Technovation model is easy to replicate and scale. With an online curriculum and option of in-person or virtual mentoring, teachers or students in any part of the world can create teams and participate in the competition.
   For the 2017 cycle, we hope to recruit the participants from the 2016 cycle as student ambassadors to help with outreach and support for future teams. 
   We recently launched a platform to involve Technovation Alumnae in scaling the program. SprEdTech, created by Amrita Venkatraman, a Technovation alumnae, is an initiative to encourage girls (grade 6 to grade 12) to develop an early interest in technology. Technovation alumnae are encouraged to become ambassadors through SprEdTech and spread the word about using coding and technology to create innovative products. Ambassadors will recruit and mentor future Technovation teams, lead technology workshops, and much more!
