'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Technovation gives girls the opportunity to create mobile apps to solve
  problems in their community. Through this program young girls will develop
  their technical and entrepreneurial skills while creating solutions for local
  communities. In creating local app solutions for local problems, young girls
  in LA can possibly discover the next big start-up idea. 
   
   girls get to create cool app ideas through Technovation in the following way:
   Teams of middle school and high school girls work together to complete an intensive, 50-hour curriculum. The girls are supported by a teacher (or after-school coordinator) and paired with a mentor who is a female tech professional. The curriculum is open, online and freely accessible to all. Through the program, the girls learn to:
   1. Identify a problem in their community: Girls work in teams and identify an idea for a mobile app that will help solve a problem in their community
   2. Program an app: Teams develop the actual app using a visual, block-based language called App Inventor (developed by MIT) that requires no prior knowledge of programming.
   3. Develop and deliver a pitch: Teams develop a business plan, videotape and submit their app and demo pitches for review.
   Ten finalist teams are then be chosen and flown out to Silicon Valley to pitch their apps and business plans to potential investors. The winning teams are awarded $20,000 in seed funding to take their app to market.
   
   The program will kick-off with a Girls make App Day workshop where all teams will meet with their mentors and attend a workshop focussed on the app Inventor platform. All local teams will have the opportunity to present their app ideas at the Regional Pitch event. the winning team will also have the opportunity to visit San Francisco for the World Pitch event, event if they are not selected in the top 10.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  We anticipate two major challenges for this program. We aim to reach to the
  under-served sections of the community. Convincing parents and students from
  this community to register for the program may be challenging. We hope to
  overcome this challenge by involving students from previous Technovation
  seasons as our spokespersons to share their personal experiences. We hope that
  personal stories from the same demographic group will inspire the girls to the
  value of this opportunity.
   We also anticipate the possibility of not finding adequate number of mentors to guide local teams. Since our program is global and many are mentored visually, we hope to connect local teams with mentors from across U.S. and other countries through our platform.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  All participants, mentors, teachers and students, are required to submit pre
  and post-program surveys. Results from these surveys help identify the
  learning goals of the girls and assess impact of the program on these goals.
   Anecdotal evidence gathered through case studies will also help to measure impact.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Given the low number of women in tech careers, there are many program focused
  on programming education to youth. We see organizations working with youth,
  such as Girls Scouts, Peace Corps, UN Women and UNESCO, as our distribution
  partners. We work with these organizations to offer Technovation as a
  potential youth program for their members/target audience. Technovation is the
  only GLOBAL program for GIRLS that combines problem solving with technical and
  entrepreneurial skills in one program. 
   Technovation is unique in the following ways:
   1. It combines technology and entrepreneurship. Our curriculum encourages girls to identify a problem in their community and create an app to solve it. So the girls directly identify and define the problem they are working on. Through our curriculum, girls develop problem solving, public speaking and other essential life skills.
   2. The mentoring component allows the girls to connect with role models and develop lifelong relationships. 
   3. Technovation mentors themselves gain job-related skills of mobile app development, entrepreneurship and leadership.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Iridescent aims to work with local schools and organizations to identify the
  high needs students. A Technovation Regional Ambassador will work with local
  schools on student outreach. The Regional Ambassador will recruit schools
  teachers as Technovation coaches, who will help to facilitate team sessions.
  Professionals from local companies are expected to volunteer time to mentor
  the girls and walk them through the Technovation curriculum. 
   
   Iridescent’s curriculum is free and open, we do not anticipate huge costs in implementing the program. The Regional ambassador will receive a monthly stipend for managing the program on the ground. Teachers and mentors are expected to volunteer their time.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': '100000'
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  Technovation Budget:
   
   LA studio space - $25,000
   Technovation Staff time - $15,000
   Website and platform - $8,000
   PR and outreach - $2,000
   Regional ambassador stipend - $100,00
   Events- Girls Make app Day and Regional pitch event - $5,000
   Prizes for local winners - $7,000
   Travel for regional winners to World Pitch event - $15,000
   Admin costs - $13,000
   Total - $100,000
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Technovation is in the process of scaling up. We had app submissions from
  across 30 plus countries in 2015. For the 2016 season, we are hoping to expand
  to new countries and scale in existing ones. This grant will allow us to offer
  the program to more girls in LA area. We will have the resources to support
  the girls through a Regional Ambassador and largely local mentors, thereby
  improving the quality of the program.
   Technovation model is easy to replicate and scale. With an online curriculum and option of in-person or virtual mentoring, teachers or students in any part of the world can create teams and participate in the competition.
   For the 2017 cycle, we hope to recruit the participants from the 2016 cycle as student ambassadors to help with outreach and support for future teams. 
   We recently launched a platform to involve Technovation Alumnae in scaling the program. SprEdTech, created by Amrita Venkatraman, a Technovation alumnae, is an initiative to encourage girls (grade 6 to grade 12) to develop an early interest in technology. Technovation alumnae are encouraged to become ambassadors through SprEdTech and spread the word about using coding and technology to create innovative products. Ambassadors will recruit and mentor future Technovation teams, lead technology workshops, and much more!

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "Iridescent’s approach connects families in underserved communities with scientists and engineers from academia and industry and nurtures these relationships over time with the help of technology. Iridescent supports:\t\t\t\t\t\r\n• Strong Parental Training & Involvement: Parents learn alongside their children to acquire knowledge and skills to support their children’s development of critical thinking and problem- solving skills.\t\r\n• Multi-year access to STEM experts from Industry & Universities: STEM professionals are trained to develop and teach unique hands-on projects and provide multi-year mentorship to deepen conceptual knowledge\t\t\r\n• Technology Platform for Scale & Multi-year Engagement: Iridescent trains parents and educators to use its online curriculum and mentoring platform\r\nIridescent will support up to 300/school, and will:\r\nSupport 8 educators through in-person and online training, in using the Curiosity Machine curriculum in their classroom and in out-of-school programs to increase parental involvement and build a strong learning community. \r\nRecruit and train LA based STEM mentors (university students and/or industry professionals) to mentor students online, support educators using the curriculum in class, and lead the Curiosity Machine Course after school with students and their families. \r\nIridescent will support 40 parents, who will learn to facilitate hands-on STEM projects, foster a growth mindset and help children develop critical thinking skills. Parents will have access to all training modules to deepen their learning.\r\nSupport the implementation of 2 Curiosity Machine Courses at each school with the goals to inspire participants with cutting-edge innovations from industry and research, build a long-term relationship between engineers and families, model the engineering design process and effective strategies for working through failure, and introduce the Curiosity Machine platform as a resource for continued learning at home.\r\nIridescent was recently part of a five-year NSF longitudinal study that revealed that after its programs:\r\n90% of the students understood science and engineering better\r\n88% of students had a better understanding of what jobs are available in those fields.\r\n91% of parents said they would encourage their child to pursue a STEM education or career.\t\t\r\n94% of parents did more hands-on science projects with their children at home, demonstrating that involving parents is effective in extending learning beyond the program."
  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "One major barrier that we anticipate for Los Angeles communities will be parental engagement on the technology front. Many parents in these underserved communities are oftentimes uncomfortable with using technology for their children’s education and STEM subject areas, and Iridescent aims to bridge this gap and engage parents in learning alongside their children, and supporting them through this STEM education programming. Iridescent has developed extensive parent training modules, and  Iridescent’s training helps parents of first generation students engage more in their child’s education. Oftentimes parents do not know how to get involved in their child’s education, and our training helps them by making them a part of the program.\r\nThrough Iridescent’s online and in-person training, we will address this obstacle and change their mindset, demonstrating how technology can be used for educational purposes. "
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Iridescent will evaluate program data from each stakeholder group (engineers, parents, educators and students).\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nStudent learning gains: Based on prior results and external evaluations, we anticipate students will make gains across two main areas: interest in STEM careers and higher education, and increase in higher-order cognitive traits of persistence, creativity, curiosity and the engineering design process. Trained mentors will score projects according to evidence-based assessment rubric. A technology-based platform such as Curiosity Machine allows evidence-based assessment for each student – with efficiency and scale – instead of relying on pen and paper pre- and post- surveys.\t\r\nImpact on Parents & Teachers: We will use validated surveys to assess the impact of Iridescent’s training parents and teachers. All surveys will use validated questions and are based on research on self-efficacy, STEM project based learning, parental involvement, educator efficacy and mindsets."
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "Parent Institute of Quality Education, Portal to the Public, Parents as Teachers are examples of organizations doing some aspect of this work. \r\n\r\nThis project model is unique in that it combines STEM project based learning and mentoring (online and in-person) with deep parental involvement and training. It has been thoroughly field-tested and centers around engineers being trained to develop and teach open-ended engineering design challenges to underserved children and parents.  Prior research has shown that the model is effective in engaging \r\nstudents and parents in informal STEM education and positively changing their attitudes and behavior \r\naround science exploration and engineering design challenges.

  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "Iridescent’s tiered model of support gradually builds internal capacity at each school so that the program is sustainable (after the contract). \r\nHere are the five reasons why Iridescent’s model is sustainable:\r\nProviding a robust training to the mentors (scientists and engineers), parents and teachers increases their effectiveness with the students that results in positive reinforcement and sustained engagement for all participants.\r\nTraining the parents on the pedagogy in particular is key to sustainability. They understand the value of the program and become deeply invested in sustaining the program at the school. They co-invest their time and effort in organizing the Curiosity Machine Courses and building a community of learning that goes beyond the classroom and connects to the student’s home. \r\nIn addition to training teachers to use engineering curriculum in the classroom Iridescent trains parents on facilitating the use of the STEM curriculum with students. This amplifies the manpower available to the teachers to actually do open-ended, hands-on projects with 20-25 students, week-after-week. In addition to providing additional help to the teachers through the parent-aides, Iridescent also trains STEM mentors to provide appropriate, personalized feedback to each student. The model thus provides extra logistical help, increases overall parental engagement and access to STEM experts. These resources (in addition to the professional development) helps teachers perform better and engage their students more easily - resulting in them being intrinsically motivated to sustain the program at their school.\r\nThe scientists and engineers are trained to develop unique design challenges based on their work. Once the initial training is over, the engineers can continue to develop new design challenges and mentor students either in-person or online. This results in a sustainable and cost-effective model of curriculum development.\r\nFinally, the online Curiosity Machine platform serves as a permanent, virtual meeting room that will remain beyond the grant. Once all stakeholders are trained, they will be able to stay on the Curiosity Machine platform and continue to engage with one another without Iridescent’s support. Iridescent’s role will be primarily to maintain the platform, monitor quality and safety and analyze data.\r\n"

    answer: "Iridescent’s approach connects families in underserved communities with scientists and engineers from academia and industry and nurtures these relationships over time with the help of technology. Iridescent supports:\t\t\t\t\t\r\n• Strong Parental Training & Involvement: Parents learn alongside their children to acquire knowledge and skills to support their children’s development of critical thinking and problem- solving skills.\t\r\n• Multi-year access to STEM experts from Industry & Universities: STEM professionals are trained to develop and teach unique hands-on projects and provide multi-year mentorship to deepen conceptual knowledge\t\t\r\n• Technology Platform for Scale & Multi-year Engagement: Iridescent trains parents and educators to use its online curriculum and mentoring platform\r\nIridescent will support up to 300/school, and will:\r\nSupport 8 educators through in-person and online training, in using the Curiosity Machine curriculum in their classroom and in out-of-school programs to increase parental involvement and build a strong learning community. \r\nRecruit and train LA based STEM mentors (university students and/or industry professionals) to mentor students online, support educators using the curriculum in class, and lead the Curiosity Machine Course after school with students and their families. \r\nIridescent will support 40 parents, who will learn to facilitate hands-on STEM projects, foster a growth mindset and help children develop critical thinking skills. Parents will have access to all training modules to deepen their learning.\r\nSupport the implementation of 2 Curiosity Machine Courses at each school with the goals to inspire participants with cutting-edge innovations from industry and research, build a long-term relationship between engineers and families, model the engineering design process and effective strategies for working through failure, and introduce the Curiosity Machine platform as a resource for continued learning at home.\r\nIridescent was recently part of a five-year NSF longitudinal study that revealed that after its programs:\r\n90% of the students understood science and engineering better\r\n88% of students had a better understanding of what jobs are available in those fields.\r\n91% of parents said they would encourage their child to pursue a STEM education or career.\t\t\r\n94% of parents did more hands-on science projects with their children at home, demonstrating that involving parents is effective in extending learning beyond the program."

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "One major barrier that we anticipate for Los Angeles communities will be parental engagement on the technology front. Many parents in these underserved communities are oftentimes uncomfortable with using technology for their children’s education and STEM subject areas, and Iridescent aims to bridge this gap and engage parents in learning alongside their children, and supporting them through this STEM education programming. Iridescent has developed extensive parent training modules, and  Iridescent’s training helps parents of first generation students engage more in their child’s education. Oftentimes parents do not know how to get involved in their child’s education, and our training helps them by making them a part of the program.\r\nThrough Iridescent’s online and in-person training, we will address this obstacle and change their mindset, demonstrating how technology can be used for educational purposes. "
  - name: Please explain how you will evaluate your work.
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Iridescent will evaluate program data from each stakeholder group (engineers, parents, educators and students).\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nStudent learning gains: Based on prior results and external evaluations, we anticipate students will make gains across two main areas: interest in STEM careers and higher education, and increase in higher-order cognitive traits of persistence, creativity, curiosity and the engineering design process. Trained mentors will score projects according to evidence-based assessment rubric. A technology-based platform such as Curiosity Machine allows evidence-based assessment for each student – with efficiency and scale – instead of relying on pen and paper pre- and post- surveys.\t\r\nImpact on Parents & Teachers: We will use validated surveys to assess the impact of Iridescent’s training parents and teachers. All surveys will use validated questions and are based on research on self-efficacy, STEM project based learning, parental involvement, educator efficacy and mindsets."

    answer: "Iridescent’s tiered model of support gradually builds internal capacity at each school so that the program is sustainable (after the contract). \r\nHere are the five reasons why Iridescent’s model is sustainable:\r\nProviding a robust training to the mentors (scientists and engineers), parents and teachers increases their effectiveness with the students that results in positive reinforcement and sustained engagement for all participants.\r\nTraining the parents on the pedagogy in particular is key to sustainability. They understand the value of the program and become deeply invested in sustaining the program at the school. They co-invest their time and effort in organizing the Curiosity Machine Courses and building a community of learning that goes beyond the classroom and connects to the student’s home. \r\nIn addition to training teachers to use engineering curriculum in the classroom Iridescent trains parents on facilitating the use of the STEM curriculum with students. This amplifies the manpower available to the teachers to actually do open-ended, hands-on projects with 20-25 students, week-after-week. In addition to providing additional help to the teachers through the parent-aides, Iridescent also trains STEM mentors to provide appropriate, personalized feedback to each student. The model thus provides extra logistical help, increases overall parental engagement and access to STEM experts. These resources (in addition to the professional development) helps teachers perform better and engage their students more easily - resulting in them being intrinsically motivated to sustain the program at their school.\r\nThe scientists and engineers are trained to develop unique design challenges based on their work. Once the initial training is over, the engineers can continue to develop new design challenges and mentor students either in-person or online. This results in a sustainable and cost-effective model of curriculum development.\r\nFinally, the online Curiosity Machine platform serves as a permanent, virtual meeting room that will remain beyond the grant. Once all stakeholders are trained, they will be able to stay on the Curiosity Machine platform and continue to engage with one another without Iridescent’s support. Iridescent’s role will be primarily to maintain the platform, monitor quality and safety and analyze data.\r\n"
