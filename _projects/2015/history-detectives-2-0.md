  History Detectives 2.0 offers K-12 LA students a chance to discover history,
  art, architecture themselves. Our retro-fitted school bus/truck will simulate
  a working radio lab with both audio & video capabilities. Students will decide
  where to go and why. Teachers/adults/artists-in-residence will provide
  "prompts" that will then become projects.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  The "History Detectives" brigades will multiply as the idea of taking students
  outside of the traditional classroom explodes. The desire to experience
  learning; the esteem-building experience of creating and sharing what has been
  created can be addictive and form habits that result in self-actualization,
  even in children. 
   
   Our goal: to create a desire to express the need to learn. 
   
   We want each team to grow as a result of their journeys throughout LA as they discover events, people, ways of thinking that may never have made inclusion in any of their required texts/readings.
   
   Our pilot program will introduce Lesson Plans that are intended to allow students a chance to explore political heros, of all ethnic backgrounds that contribute to the city LA has become today. An array of options will be offered, each Team on the 10-week journeys will select the adventure they will go on.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  One obstacle may include overcoming a subtle belief that having fun while "in
  school" may be a little too submissive to the students' inclination toward
  disruption. By showing respect for curiosity and using the motivation of
  participating in a fascinating way to learn, our intention is to demonstrate
  that fun can be a motivator and can help with behavioral issues teachers must
  control.
   
   We will document cooperation, team-work, respect for others, and a dedication to each Team's project as a team to persuade teachers and administrators to give our approach to learning a chance to succeed.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We will carefully carve out agreed upon Objectives. They may vary with
  individual Teams and varying Projects but will certainly include variations
  of:
   
   #'s of students participating for each Project period
   #'s of Projects selected
   #'s of Projects completed
   #'s of LA sites visited & made a part of a developing partnership
   #'s of future sponsors attracted
   Amt of new funding acquired
   #'s of participating artists-in-residence
   
   For each Objective, we will chart how our actual #'s line up with the projected numbers at the start of each Project.
   
   The closer we come to our projections at the end of each Project, the closer we will be able to say we made our numbers.
   
   There will be a variety of intangible measures that we can tract through word-of-mouth with the Participants, through survey's, through observation, and through video/radio spots they create themselves--Like PSA's for those who will come later.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Journey's intent on offering cultural 1/2 day walks (The LA Conservancy; the
  Friends of the LA River; The Tree People are examples of exploratory learning
  adventures in the heart of LA. Many museums as well tell their version of the
  LA Story. The tours mentioned here and many museums are geared to an adult
  clientele. And most tours exist as revenue based endeavors. Most youth would
  probably not have an opportunity to enlist in such an adventure. Those who
  would--most likely would be a part of a family outing. Three or four tickets
  for a morning walk is a heavy financial sacrifice for the majority of LA
  families.
   
   Our participants will live in South Central. Parents work in South LA. Many have two jobs. Any time off is not going to include recreational learning as a priority. With our participants' parents permission, school/school-time can serve another role--a place to learn, a place to have fun, a place to see the City and begin to understand the cultural history, the stories of those who made the headlines, and many fascinating stories of those who didn't make the headlines but who make LA what it is.
   
   Our uniqueness is the ability to offer this type of experiential learning opportunity...for youth...during school in chaperoned and curriculum-based manners, free of charge.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  We did not list but will work with the roster of past Robey actors,
  playwrights, tech theatre artists, and designers. They number in the hundreds
  and will help participants annotate the stories they discover.
   
   Many of those actors, writers and theatre professionals have their own production companies. We will partner with those with skills/interests needed for particular projects.
   
   Over twenty years in LA, the Robey also has a host of colleagues operating a variety of other theatre companies, galleries, restaurants, and ethnically-specific cultural projects that will offer participation on an ad hoc basis as the projects unfold.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  The retro-fitting of the bus could cost the entire $100,000. We will strive to
  secure underwriting sponsors for the actual vehicle and for the
  equipment/furniture/carpentry/wiring we will require.
   
   There may have to be a smaller lab build as a proto-type. We will use the proto-type to secure interest and commitment for the larger full-scale rolling lab envisioned.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-

How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  One van/truck/bus will increase in size and its capacity to accommodate more
  student/participants on each Project.
   
   One vehicle will then grow to two and those two again increase until each of the school's wishing to participate can have that chance.
   
   LA is a city with actors in between professional work, ex-teachers waiting for the call to teach.
   
   Our infra-structure will accommodate and use all of those other-wise idle hours to grow our ability to deliver to more each year.

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "The \"History Detectives\" brigades will multiply as the idea of taking students outside of the traditional classroom explodes. The desire to experience learning; the esteem-building experience of creating and sharing what has been created can be addictive and form habits that result in self-actualization, even in children. \r\n\r\nOur goal: to create a desire to express the need to learn. \r\n\r\nWe want each team to grow as a result of their journeys throughout LA as they discover events, people, ways of thinking that may never have made inclusion in any of their required texts/readings.\r\n\r\nOur pilot program will introduce Lesson Plans that are intended to allow students a chance to explore political heros, of all ethnic backgrounds that contribute to the city LA has become today. An array of options will be offered, each Team on the 10-week journeys will select the adventure they will go on.\r\n\r\n"

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "One obstacle may include overcoming a subtle belief that having fun while \"in school\" may be a little too submissive to the students'  inclination toward disruption.  By showing respect for curiosity and using the motivation of participating in a fascinating way to learn, our intention is to demonstrate that fun can be a motivator and can help with behavioral issues teachers must control.\r\n\r\nWe will document cooperation, team-work, respect for others, and a dedication to each Team's project as a team to persuade teachers and administrators to give our approach to learning a chance to succeed.\r\n "
  - name: Please explain how you will evaluate your work.

    answer: "We will carefully carve out agreed upon Objectives. They may vary with individual Teams and varying Projects but will certainly include variations of:\r\n\r\n#'s of students participating for each Project period\r\n#'s of Projects selected\r\n#'s of Projects completed\r\n#'s of LA sites visited & made a part of a developing partnership\r\n#'s of future sponsors attracted\r\nAmt of new funding acquired\r\n#'s of participating artists-in-residence\r\n\r\nFor each Objective, we will chart how our actual #'s line up with the projected numbers at the start of each Project.\r\n\r\nThe closer we come to our projections at the end of each Project, the closer we will be able to say we made our numbers.\r\n\r\nThere will be a variety of intangible measures that we can tract through word-of-mouth with the Participants, through survey's, through observation, and through video/radio spots they create themselves--Like PSA's for those who will come later.\r\n\r\n"

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Journey's intent on offering cultural 1/2 day walks (The LA Conservancy; the Friends of the LA River; The Tree People are examples of exploratory learning adventures in the heart of LA. Many museums as well tell their version of the LA Story. The tours mentioned here and many museums are geared to an adult clientele. And most tours exist as revenue based endeavors. Most youth would probably not  have an opportunity to enlist in such an adventure. Those who would--most likely would be a part of a family outing. Three or four tickets for a morning walk is a heavy financial sacrifice for the majority of LA families.\r\n\r\nOur participants will live in South Central. Parents work in South LA. Many have two jobs. Any time off is not going to include recreational learning as a priority. With our participants' parents permission, school/school-time can serve another role--a place to learn, a place to have fun, a place to see the City and begin to understand the cultural history, the stories of those who made the headlines, and many fascinating stories of those who didn't make the headlines but who make LA what it is.\r\n\r\nOur uniqueness is the ability to offer this type of experiential learning opportunity...for youth...during school in chaperoned and curriculum-based manners, free of charge.

We will partner with those with skills/interests needed for particular projects.\r\n\r\nOver twenty years in LA, the Robey also has a host of colleagues operating a variety of other theatre companies, galleries, restaurants, and ethnically-specific cultural projects that will offer participation on an ad hoc basis as the projects unfold."
