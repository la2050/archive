  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "MDR will make LA the best place to learn by providing teens with role models to help them navigate the media they consume daily, while making healthy decisions for their lives and creating media that better reflects their humanity. Each lesson of our curriculum is Common Core aligned. We also have an online digital portal for facilitators and a social networking site for our participants to engage. Although we do have facilitators lead each lesson/workshop, we place a strong emphasis on youth ideas and dialogue.In each lesson, we have multiple opportunities for youth check-in, and fishbowls and Socratic Seminar are central to the final lesson of each unit.\r\n\r\nOur Media Done Responsibly campaign works to introduce youth to media that represents the full humanity of all cultures, and provides the tools to assess and vote on whether specific media content meets humanity-based standards to be labeled media done responsibly. This makes for a community-wide impact that can shape the direction of media content that is produced moving forward. Essentially, we use media literacy as a launching pad for both the development of youth as healthy, aware, and engaged citizens and as a tool to improve the media content and media career opportunities for upcoming generations.\r\n \r\nMEDIA LITERACY CURRICULUM\r\nThe Media Done Responsibly curriculum follows a three-pillar approach: (1) Media Literacy, (2) Media Production, and (3) Media Justice Advocacy. It includes nine thematic units, each packed with several robust lessons, access to socially responsible media, youth-led events, and other varied media. The program introduces participants to college mentors who facilitate 50 minute, interactive, media awareness workshops for students in the program. The workshops stimulate student dialogue and critical thinking about social issues in media and supports positive citizenship by providing healthy alternatives to destructive behavior. "
  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-

    mentor and student interviews.

    the onslaught of stereotypes through personal, interpersonal and
    institutional solutions. 
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-

    student interns. 
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-

    local concerts and event, and an annual event to help offset the cost. In
    addition, we'll continue to do outreach to grant partners, media sponsors,
    and our donors.
