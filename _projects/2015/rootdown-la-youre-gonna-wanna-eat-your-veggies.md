title: RootDown LA - Youre Gonna Wanna Eat Your Veggies!
project_summary: >-
  South LA youth, who now run RootDown LA, know how to build demand for, and
  create supplies of fresh produce, directly in their neighborhoods. Our goal
  this year is to support these young people to begin to develop their own
  for-profit healthy food ventures, incorporating the nutrition and culinary
  educational activities they already expertly facilitate, and the produce from
  the garden networks they installed and maintain, at our South Los Angeles
  Youth-driven Neighborhood Food System sites.

  'DESCRIBE IN GREATER DETAIL HOW YOU WILL MAKE LA THE HEALTHIEST PLACE TO LIVE: ': "RootDown LA puts youth at the forefront of local food systems change in South Los Angeles.   Our replicable model for building Youth-driven Neighborhood Food System Sites has youth building demand for, and creating supplies of, healthy food in their communities. Your vote helps our youth begin to develop their own for-profit healthy food ventures this year.\r\n\r\nPicture young people in your neighborhood – Mar Vista, Lennox, Hollywood? - running a local food business that could install your food garden, get your kids to eat their veggies, deliver produce to your door, and cater your next dinner party.  In South Los Angeles, where RootDown LA (RDLA) works, much of this has already started to happen.  South LA is notorious for its crime, poverty, and legendary food desert. The stories that get told less often are about our youth, and the tremendous asset they are to the community, when they are given opportunities to achieve.  \r\n\r\nImagine the end of a high school day.  A bell rings and hundreds of energetic students loudly disperse.  Nine student athletes, whose coach thinks healthy eating is a critical part of their training, head over to help in the school garden.  They assist RDLA’s paid garden interns (graduates from the school), who are now working with Cal Poly students to develop systems to increase food production in urban gardens.  Three other RDLA interns show up to harvest eggplants, and head to a nearby LAPD rec. center, where they run weekly cooking classes for younger kids.  Two more RDLA interns stroll down a residential street near the school, and into an old home that hosts RDLA’s headquarters.  They go out back and pull garden tools from a shed, then head to nearby homes, where in the past year, they have worked with these neighbors to design, build, and maintain their food gardens.  Today, they’ll fix the irrigation system, trouble shoot nematodes, and deliver surplus produce to those neighbors who collect food scraps for the neighborhood compost program.  Imagine a neighborhood food system that employed youth, brought neighbors together, increased the availability of local produce, and over time, helped improve neighbors’ health outcomes.  Imagine young people, having an opportunity to get to know more precisely, their peers’, parents’ and neighbors’ complex barriers to healthy eating, so they could better address and dismantle those barriers.\r\n"

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    The biggest challenge to improving diets, is getting people to want to eat
    their veggies. You can grow gardens, but if people aren’t in the daily habit
    of preparing/eating fresh produce, the gardens will go fallow.  RDLA spent 3
    years figuring out simple activities that youth could facilitate, to get
    people eating more fresh food.  It was our mission to engage teens, not to
    run fleeting nutrition ed. campaigns, but to build healthier communities. 
    To that end, along with building our healthy food educational programs, RDLA
    has spent considerable time refining its definition of “community.” Our
    model narrows in on building deeper relationships directly around, rather
    than in schools. Changing the entire South LA food system is unrealistic. 
    Changing the South LA food system, 3 neighborhoods at a time, is already
    happening. 
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    RDLA’s greatest success can be observed in the passion and commitment of our
    first program participants, who are advocates for, and now run the majority
    of our programs; five are paid employees, who train and manage the next
    generations of younger youth interns.  You can find them all online - their
    collective enthusiasm is reflected in our Facebook, Twitter and Instagram
    accounts, which they post in, regularly.  Since its inception, RDLA has used
    both formative and summative assessment methods, employing qualitative and
    quantitative tools.  We measure progress of the organization in terms of the
    depth of our partnerships in the community, and our relevance where we work,
    as is expressed by constant demand for us to increase our programming.  More
    specifically: intake/outtake surveys are used to measure our impact on
    program participants’ knowledge, behavioral change, and self-confidence
    relating to healthy food in our series classes. Focus groups capture long
    term change. 
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "RootDown LA’s model for building Youth-driven Neighborhood Food Systems (YDNFS) is unique because it: 1. Puts youth at the forefront of the healthy food movement in their neighborhoods. 2. Narrows its focus to work within set boundaries surrounding high schools, so we can better identify and impact the complex variables that impact both, supplies of and demand for, fresh food in that neighborhood. 3. Addresses a need for youth job-skills training and employment in South Los Angeles by taking a for-profit approach to food systems change – this year, we are supporting youth to develop for-profit enterprises that can divert the dollars that people are otherwise spending on less healthy foods.  \r\n\r\nNumerous South Los Angeles (SLA) organizations work hard to provide nutrition education and make healthy food more accessible in parts of SLA.  SEELA brought a farmer’s market to the Council District 9 (CD9) Constituent Center, Hunger Action LA works to increase dollars for fresh produce through food assistance programs, Community Services Unlimited has developed links with regional farmers to supply farm stands, and the LA Food Policy Council is working to increase the purchasing of healthy food at schools and corner stores.  \r\n\r\nWe have seen over time however, that until residents have a direct relationship with healthy food promoters/sellers, and have had opportunities to reconnect with the taste and prep methods for fresh foods, they are less inclined to purchase such food, let alone consume it.  Our YDNFS model is unique in that allows our youth to build these critical closer, and ongoing relationships with residents, which have been instrumental in drumming up interest in our produce and our programs.  We’re certain, our direct presence in the neighborhoods, and the youths’ relationship with the local schools, neighbors, and community organizations, will be key in forging a customer base for our their for-profit healthy food ventures.\r\n"
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "RootDown LA considers its partnerships in the community to be among the most important factors in its long-term sustainability.  Over the past seven years, we have carefully cultivated relationships with numerous South LA organizations who seek to engage youth to build healthier communities.  Partners include A Place Called Home, L.A.U.R.A, and All People’s Community Center. For the development of our youth-run for-profit ventures, the following two key partner organizations will be critical as they provide a secure base from which we can launch operations at two of our Youth-driven Neighborhood Food System sites.\r\n\r\nNuevo South (NS) – Founded by Jorge Nuño, owner of The Big House, where RDLA is now headquartered, offers after-school tech and multi-media training programs that engage local high school students in social justice-minded projects.  RDLA first partnered with NS four years ago at NS’s annual health fair/block party. Today, one of 3 RDLA Youth-driven Neighborhood Food Systems sites, encompasses The Big House, which is a hub, not just for healthy food activities. It also serves as a safe space for residents, business owners and civic leaders in the CD9 community to gather, celebrate, activate, and discuss current issues.  Aside from running NS, Jorge also runs his own highly successful creative arts and marketing business, the NTS Creative Group, employing the people he grew up with in South LA. Mr. Nuño models, what’s possible when a young person from South LA, refuses to be confined by debilitating constructs.\r\n$10,000 will go to Nuevo South to help with any required kitchen/storage upgrades so we can meet food-safety requirements. $5,000 will go to Nuevo South to train RDLA youth interns to develop promotional materials for their entrepreneurial projects.\r\n\r\nThe WECAN Foundation WE CAN Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation organized to provide access to educational and economic opportunities for individuals in technologically underserved communities. In 2009, WE CAN launched the Urban Farm Network (UFN) to promote sane and sustainable 21st century land use policies for inner-city communities. \r\n$15,000 will go to WECAN to build a greenhouse to support improve plant propagation systems, and to increase food storage capacity. \r\n"
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': "RootDown LA has been successful over the years, securing funding from a mix of federal, state, local and private foundation and individual donors.  As part of our sustainability plan, we have been engaging all staff, interns, and board members this year, to think of ways we can increase our earned-income opportunities to offset our reliance upon grant dollars.  In the past, we have been hired by LAUSD schools, USC, UCLA, the LAPD, and others, to bring our hands-on nutrition, cooking and horticultural programs to their populations. \r\n\r\nA very generous private family foundation has offered $50,000 in matching dollars to support our youth to trial their entrepreneurial projects this year.  Funding from the LA2050 grants challenge would help us secure those dollars, and make it possible for at least one of our youth entrepreneurial projects to become a more full-fledged business in the next 18 months.  Our youth have already developed their project ideas and have identified the following needs: \r\n1. We need to increase our plant propagation and food storage capacity. 2. We need to work on getting our food storage and prep spaces up to current food-safety standards.  3. We need support in developing more formal marketing materials to promote our services and products.\r\n"
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "$10,000 will go to community partner, Nuevo South to help with any required kitchen/storage upgrades so we can meet food-safety requirements.\r\n\r\n$5,000 will go to community partner, Nuevo South to help train new RDLA youth interns to develop promotional materials for their entrepreneurial projects.\r\n\r\n$15,000 will go to community partner, The WECAN Foundation to build a greenhouse to support improve plant propagation systems, and to increase food storage capacity. \r\n\r\n$32,000 will cover the costs for three of our staff members and to increase their hours during this period of business development.\r\n\r\n$8,000 will allow us to hire up to 5 more youth interns to support the development of the entrepreneurial projects.\r\n\r\n$15,000 will cover costs for our current design/marketing partners to train the youth to develop branding and marketing materials for their projects/products.\r\n\r\n$6,000 will cover materials/supply costs required to help launch the youth-led projects.\r\n\r\n$9,000 will cover administrative"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "From the get go, RootDown LA has developed its programming, taking a KEEP IT SIMPLE approach, so that it is easily replicable and can be quickly tailored to be relevant in any community.  Our various nutrition, culinary and horticultural trainings, lessons, classes, and cooking demos can be learned and replicated anywhere to help other communities build demand for, and create supplies of fresh food in their neighborhoods.\r\n\r\nTwo major multi-year federal grants provided us a window of opportunity where we were very generously funded in the past four years; we did not take that for granted.  We used that time to carefully develop our model for Youth-driven Neighborhood Food Systems (YDNFS) that could run, with or without very generous funding.  We wanted to develop a model neighborhood food system that could be initially launched in other neighborhoods for around $50,000, and maintained annually, for less than that.   \r\n\r\nIn the coming years, as we begin to have successes with our youth-led food businesses, we will have a new YDNFS model component, that could be replicated in other neighborhoods as well.  We imagine a day where a portion of proceeds from these youth-led enterprises could help launch new YDNFS sites in other South LA neighborhoods.\r\n\r\nWe are tracking our progress as we go, and creating “How-to” guides for each component of our programs.  We are also available to consult with other communities who may want help in replicating portions of our programs where they live.\r\n"
