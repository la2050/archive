project_summary: >-
  South LA youth, who now run RootDown LA, know how to build demand for, and
  create supplies of fresh produce, directly in their neighborhoods. Our goal
  this year is to support these young people to begin to develop their own
  for-profit healthy food ventures, incorporating the nutrition and culinary
  educational activities they already expertly facilitate, and the produce from
  the garden networks they installed and maintain, at our South Los Angeles
  Youth-driven Neighborhood Food System sites.
