title: RootDown LA - Youre Gonna Wanna Eat Your Veggies!
project_summary: >-
  South LA youth, who now run RootDown LA, know how to build demand for, and
  create supplies of fresh produce, directly in their neighborhoods. Our goal
  this year is to support these young people to begin to develop their own
  for-profit healthy food ventures, incorporating the nutrition and culinary
  educational activities they already expertly facilitate, and the produce from
  the garden networks they installed and maintain, at our South Los Angeles
  Youth-driven Neighborhood Food System sites.

    RDLA’s greatest success can be observed in the passion and commitment of our
    first program participants, who are advocates for, and now run the majority
    of our programs; five are paid employees, who train and manage the next
    generations of younger youth interns.  You can find them all online - their
    collective enthusiasm is reflected in our Facebook, Twitter and Instagram
    accounts, which they post in, regularly.  Since its inception, RDLA has used
    both formative and summative assessment methods, employing qualitative and
    quantitative tools.  We measure progress of the organization in terms of the
    depth of our partnerships in the community, and our relevance where we work,
    as is expressed by constant demand for us to increase our programming.  More
    specifically: intake/outtake surveys are used to measure our impact on
    program participants’ knowledge, behavioral change, and self-confidence
    relating to healthy food in our series classes. Focus groups capture long
    term change.
