  Second Chances Leadership Program builds and develops the self-confidence,
  life & leadership skills of youth through: Education, Financial Literacy,
  Leadership, Social Justice/Advocacy and Health. This is accomplished through
  interactive learning, in-class discussions, presentations/panels, workshops
  and exploratory field-trips (domestically & internationally). Our student
  ambassadors take what they’ve learned and teach our younger youth
  (middle/elementary students) about effective leadership.

  Foundation for Second Chances (FFSC) serves youth in grades K-12 in
  communities plagued with crime, gang violence, extreme poverty, and low
  academic performance. FFSC recruits and receives referrals for youth from
  schools, community based organizations, libraries, DCFS and neighborhoods
  located in Service Planning Area 6. Students from SPA 6 face a number of
  economic, environmental, and social challenges that have a direct impact on
  their wellbeing. Within SPA 6 there is a strong prevalence of foster care,
  gang-related activity, juvenile delinquency, and youth victimization. These
  issues create profound instability in our families and communities, fueling
  high school drop, unemployment, and immense incarceration rates. As a result,
  this continues to make it nearly impossible for our youth to meet their basic
  needs, reinforcing the vicious cycle of poverty and suffering in the way of
  their success. FFSC wants to break that cycle by empowering children labeled
  as “disadvantaged” or “at-risk” to become leaders for themselves, their peers
  and their community. SCLP believes in every student’s capability to succeed
  when given access to all the necessary tools. SCLP consists of 5 modules that
  are 8 weeks in length. The modules expands our youth knowledge base by
  providing significant exposure to real-life work experiences, hands-on
  activities that challenge their decision making process, intense
  cross-cultural and intergenerational volunteer projects both locally and
  abroad. The components of SCLP are: Education, Financial Literacy, Leadership
  (includes Civic and Service Learning), Social Justice/Advocacy and Health. The
  objectives for SCLP: Assist students in developing specific skills needed for
  effective leadership, high graduation school and career paths; Provide
  students with a process for examining pertinent issues facing their
  communities and knowledge of those issues how to make change; Increase
  students understanding of and appreciation for cultural diversity; Provide
  opportunities for students to apply the knowledge and skills learned through
  meaningful community service; Students become ambassadors of their own
  learning so they can better educate and teach their peers and community (train
  the trainer). This allows them to personally develop through SCLP and have
  access to tools and resources that not only helps students to apply to
  college, but also prepares them to succeed in life. Upon completion students
  receive a certificate and have a graduation.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  One major barrier/challenge that we anticipate in the program is an
  over-subscription of students in our program and not having the resources to
  service the additional students. To help with this foreseen program limitation
  we will create a waitlist to support our program and students and we will
  actively fundraise, recruit additional volunteers and engage our current and
  future partners to support us.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We use quantitative & qualitative evaluation strategies to evaluate our
  youth’s work in addition to conducting intake surveys & doing case management
  on each student that enters our program. Each youth receives SMART(specific,
  measurable, attainable, realistic, timely) goals to make sure that they are
  meeting their benchmarks for staying on task, being held accountable for their
  duties & are able to articulate what they are learning. Through our
  collaborative & strategic partnerships we are able to engage community
  leaders, stakeholders and clients to help us identify our success and any
  gaps. In order to evaluate SCLP we survey our students as well as their
  parents and teachers. A series of in depth surveys allow for us to evaluate
  the progress of our students in a holistic manner. Our Evaluation Strategies
  include several tools:
   Leadership Program Student Survey; Teacher/Staff Referral Form
   General School Functioning Assessments; Academic Achievement Assessments;Community Surveys
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Yes there are other organizations doing similar work in the South Los Angeles
  community but what makes us unique is that we follow our students every step
  of the way and we find additional resources that help to make our youth
  successful. We train our students to teach their peers, community and younger
  students. We think the added case management approach that we use make us
  different because we can see our youth’s growth, struggles, and
  accomplishments when they are happening.

How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  We plan to scale the success of our proposal by deliberate efforts to increase
  the impact of our Leadership Program. 
   
   We will use the data we've collected over the last eleven years to analyze trends in our student population, donor base and communities. For example, we have discovered over the years that our program has evolved to provide services to students with learning disabilities and students whose parents were born abroad. We will also use this information to understand what communication channels are most effective, how to better raise funds and how to increase recurring giving.
   
   We will build on our success by tapping into new technology and innovation for community-based organizations. We will use new technology such as mobile devices, tablets and applications on each to more efficiently deliver our services to our target population. Staff and volunteers will have the data that we've collected over the last eleven years on our core population, students and communities at their fingertips. 
   
   We will also build on our strong network. Having a strong professional support network is crucial for the success of our Leadership Program. We will develop our network of staff, volunteers and community partners to invest in our vision and program. We will then leverage that human capital to grow the Leadership Program from a local program to a regional and national program. That also includes developing our social networks (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) to provide us additional access to other networks of potential donors, volunteers, members, alumni, patrons and supporters.
   
   We will also pay close to our finances. Most, if not all, nonprofits operate on a shoestring budget and our program is no different. We are thankful for every dollar and cent that comes into the organization and we will work hard to ensure that none of its is wasted, especially during the times of growth. 
   
   In the end, these plans will benefit more of our students and community members.
