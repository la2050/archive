title: Effective Drought Solutions
project_summary: "Strategically reintroduce native beaver populations back into the dwindling watersheds around LA County, using modern techniques where beaver are \"trained\" to engineer dams where we want them to, yet leave our infrastructure intact. Beavers are proven to be highly effective at mitigating drought, flash floods, and erosion. As the first major metropolitan area to embrace this cost-effective solution, we would be ensuring a lasting, positive impact on the economy and ecology of our whole region.\r\n"

  - Acres and miles of polluted waterways
  - Percentage of LA communities that are resilient (Dream Metric)
  - Percentage of tree canopy cover (Dream Metric)
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Weekly, monthly and yearly data will be collected on water volume, soil health, and wildlife populations at each beaver site. As soon as one colony is established and proven effective, another one can be introduced, tracked, and monitored. This method will ensure that beaver are being kept in areas that will be most beneficial to humans.\r\n"
