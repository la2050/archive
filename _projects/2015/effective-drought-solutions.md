title: Effective Drought Solutions
project_summary: "Strategically reintroduce native beaver populations back into the dwindling watersheds around LA County, using modern techniques where beaver are \"trained\" to engineer dams where we want them to, yet leave our infrastructure intact. Beavers are proven to be highly effective at mitigating drought, flash floods, and erosion. As the first major metropolitan area to embrace this cost-effective solution, we would be ensuring a lasting, positive impact on the economy and ecology of our whole region.\r\n"

  “Any city smarter than a beaver can keep a beaver!”
   -martinezbeavers.org motto
   
   Drought. It’s punishing, relentless, and impacts our daily lives in countless ways. From raging wildfires, to soil erosion, and rapidly increasing temperatures, the drought has had a tremendous impact on California. To support tourism, agriculture, and an ever-growing population, the state that’s ranked as the world’s eighth-largest economy must begin to explore efficient and cost-effective solutions to this long-term problem. 
   
   Fortunately, there is a tried and true solution to persistent drought; reintroduction of native beaver species. Similar programs have been successfully implemented everywhere from arctic Canada to the deserts of Nevada, and even in parts of California, one of the states hit hardest by drought. However, being the first major metropolitan area to embrace beaver reintroduction only reinforces Los Angeles’ reputation as progressive and forward-thinking. It is a simple solution that is also cost-effective, has a quick implementation-to-results timetable, and has innumerable benefits to our environment as well as creating positive change in the lives of millions of Angelenos.
   
   I propose that we reintroduce the North American Beaver (Castor canadensis) to key areas where we need to control drought, flash floods, and further loss of fish and wildlife habitat. Modern techniques will guide these ultimate hydro-engineers to do the work for us. By reintroducing this keystone species on our terms, we can lock our aquatic ecosystem into a healthy equilibrium. From this foundation we have the ability to create community gardens, more urban natural space, food forests, and increase important wildlife habitat.
   
   Additional advantages of reintroducing beavers into their natural habitat include: intensive water filtration, drought “savings accounts” created by the deep, topographically varied ponds, and naturally rich soil that is dispersed throughout regions where beaver reside. Fish and wildlife populations flourish wherever there are beaver, not only because of the additional water they store in their environment, but because they share their dens with a host of other beneficial creatures.
   
   Beavers are capable of turning a tiny trickle into a massive pond. We need more clean surface water, they can provide it. They are malleable to our agenda if one applies the techniques that encourage them to build where you want them to.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Funding. Despite this being an incredibly cost-effective solution to our
  region's largest problem, there is always caution around changing the way we
  do things.
   
   To overcome this obstacle, I plan on working with the California Fish and Wildlife Department as well as those of other states that have experience with beaver reintroduction. 
   
   After the first beaver family is introduced, the recovery of the landscape is demonstrated, and the rapid retention of clean water occurs, the project will speak for itself. From that point on it will be much easier to tout the benefits of replenished beaver habitats, as well as confirm the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of this solution.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Weekly, monthly and yearly data will be collected on water volume, soil
  health, and wildlife populations at each beaver site. As soon as one colony is
  established and proven effective, another one can be introduced, tracked, and
  monitored. This method will ensure that beaver are being kept in areas that
  will be most beneficial to humans.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There are many, many organizations doing similar work across Canada and the
  US! What is unique about my proposal is that we would be the first major
  metropolitan area to use beaver behavior to our advantage.
   
   Short-Term Beaver Reintroduction Specific to LA County:
   -Reintroduce 1-2 beaver families on National Forest and/or privately owned land
   -Monitor and record the results for the first 12 months
   -Evaluate the data 12 months post-reintroduction and see if more beaver families can be added
   -Seek round two of funding
   -Move from pilot project to permanent commitment to reintegrating beaver county-wide
   
   Long-Term Beaver Reintroduction Specific to LA County:
   -Work with the Department of Fish and Wildlife and local landowners to implement a county-wide beaver reintroduction program specifically designed to improve surface water storage and soil quality
   -Beaver proof key drainages and culverts across the county
   -Place beavers in key areas of the San Gabriel Mountains to begin retaining water in the mountains as insurance against low snow years 
   -Place beavers in key areas around rural and suburban LA county, where flood control, fish & wildlife restoration, and water “savings accounts” are needed
   -Monitor beaver behavior on a weekly, monthly and yearly schedule, keeping close records of their activity and water metrics
   -Following a 2-year trial period, ascertain whether they would be beneficially introduced into more urban waterways such as the LA river
   -Use the newly created beaver habitats as educational tools for school kids and adults all across LA County
   -After 2-5 years, establish permanent food forests alongside established beaver habitats
   -Use the beavers as a means to upcycle unwanted tree debris. This technique helps them stay put where we want them and also prevents them from felling the trees we want to keep

'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  At this point in time, the proposal is a solo project of mine. Any
  collaborations other than the ones already mentioned are TBD. For the pilot
  project, it would be quite doable to start with 1 employee, a few volunteers
  and a willing landowner or government agency.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Success will be scaled one beaver family at a time. Each family creates its
  own micro-oasis. Careful planning for where we place our first beaver colony
  is important, but as we familiarize ourselves with their engineering
  abilities, their territory could be allowed to expand exponentially. As The
  Southland grows more comfortable with the idea of a symbiotic relationship
  with beaver, the positive ripple effects will be greater and greater.
