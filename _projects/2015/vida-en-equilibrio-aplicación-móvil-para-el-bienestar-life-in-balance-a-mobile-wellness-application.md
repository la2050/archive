  To design and implement a mobile chronic disease prevention experience. This
  app will present original, evidence-based content, and will also include live
  interaction with health educators and other participants throughout the
  duration of the experience. The experience will be available in English and
  also in Spanish.

  Obesity has become a major public health concern in the United States, and
  Type-II diabetes is on the rise. It’s a sad fact that nearly 1 in 10 Los
  Angeles County residents have diabetes, and the total direct cost of treating
  diabetes is more than $6 billion a year. Diabetes is a leading cause of heart
  disease, stroke, blindness, kidney disease and nerve disease. Preventing
  diabetes requires lifestyle modifications to change the most basic habits-how
  we eat and how active we are in our free time. Despite efforts of clinicians
  to educate patients with prediabetes, lifestyle interventions are intensive
  and community-based, rather than clinical. Our program is evidence-based, and
  will create a virtual community to overcome “obesogenic” factors that have
  become the norm in our communities. It’s time to translate the scientific
  evidence into a wellness movement. Our program will harness smartphone
  technology to successfully implement a large-scale intensive lifestyle
  intervention. This intervention translates a proven, community-based
  structured lifestyle program into an innovative, mobile format. We intend to
  recruit participants through community health clinics and screenings across
  the county. We would, however, like to target our efforts at regions of the
  county particularly impacted by type-II diabetes. This mHealth intervention is
  titled “Life in Balance: A Mobile Application for Wellness”; in Spanish, this
  translates into “Vida en Equilibrio: Una Aplicación Móvil Para el Bienestar”.
   
   This program will inform, educate and empower participants through a convenient smartphone app.
   
   The program is based on the CDC’s National Diabetes Prevention Program curriculum, and it will be tailored to adults living in Los Angeles. In order to maximize the potential of our mobile program, the intervention will be available in two formats: English and Spanish. This will enable us to reach a wider audience of adults who may benefit from the program. Los Angeles residents who complete this mobile intervention will experience a 12-month intensive lifestyle intervention. The main objectives are modest weight loss of 5-7% and increased physical activity. The app will include many features that connect participants to the world around them. Each participant will receive a Bluetooth scale that will link directly to the app to record weekly weight, and a smartphone pedometer will assist in recording physical activity.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  A major challenge to implementing this lifestyle intervention is participant
  dropout. Oftentimes, community health interventions experience high attrition
  rates. This may in part be due to constraints due to family obligations, lack
  of transportation or conflicting work schedules. By developing a mobile app
  that can deliver weekly content and link participants to live certified
  Lifestyle Coaches, participants will be able to experience the app at their
  own pace, wherever they are. This will also allow us to recruit participants
  from diverse areas of Los Angeles, and to allow participants to begin the
  intervention at different times.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  The primary evaluation will be conducted with the pilot program prediabetes
  participants. They will take a survey prior to program commencement to test
  their knowledge of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. This survey will be redone
  at the end of the one-year period again to see if there are any improvements
  in their knowledge. 
   
   A lifestyle survey developed by the Minneapolis American Indian Center (Minneapolis American Indian Center, 2004) will be administered at three, six, nine and twelve month intervals to check on the participants’ progress with the mobile DPP program. 
   
   In addition to the self-reported data, A1C testing will be conducted at baseline and at the same intervals as when the surveys are administered and will be done by staff working at the DPP partners. The A1C testing will determine if the program participants are successfully able to use the mobile DPP platform to reduce their risk.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There are currently organizations that offer chronic disease prevention
  programs, both in-person and through an online platform. To our knowledge, our
  proposed approach is the first mobile app to be offered to the citizens of Los
  Angeles, in English and Spanish, as a completely mobile evidence-based
  lifestyle intervention. Our approach is also unique in that the content will
  be tailored to residents of Los Angeles; content will be filmed at various
  sites throughout Los Angeles County, and will feature guest appearances by
  prominent residents of Los Angeles.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  In order to recruit potential participants, we will need to partner with
  community health organizations. We estimate that $1000 will go to each partner
  that is able to assist in recruiting potential participants. We will identify
  partner organizations based on a survey administered by Polar Tech Ed and
  Consulting, LLC.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  Ideally this app will be completed for around $100,000. We have 30 years of IT
  experience, and feel confident that the app can get up and running for around
  $100,000. There may be additional costs involved, and we would like to apply
  for other grants that focus on chronic disease prevention, such as the
  National Institute of Health. We will look at other funding sources in the
  private sector such as health startup incubators and venture capital in
  addition to traditional public health funding methods.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  Platform development costs: $60,433.00
   233 person days of development (7.4 months) at $200.00/day for developers and designers

   Salary: $20,000 for PI and CO-PI
   Fringe costs of 32% of salary: $6,400
   Video production costs: $10,000 to shoot all DPP curriculum
   Amazon Web Services backend: $6,000.00 12 months at $500.00 for servers and web hosting
   $5,000 for program evaluation development
   $5,000 for pilot participant sites to assist in recruiting program participants
   $11,000 for office equipment, supplies and software
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  After implementing the pilot program, we will make adjustments based on the
  program evaluation. Once this is completed, we will be offering the program to
  the entire US population that are diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes and expanding
  the scope to HIV/AID antiretroviral therapy (ART) compliance and
  cardiovascular disease management. If after a one year evaluation period is
  completed, and it is determined that the expanded mobile services are
  effective, we can expand this globally to anyone and offer the program in
  different languages.
   
   We can offer the program to insurance companies that are looking to add diabetes prevention efforts to their wellness program as well.
