    LA is a city of communities and with it are cultures that are all too often
    at odds. Since 1998, The Story Project has been bridging gaps through media
    education teaching storytelling through filmmaking, screenwriting,
    photography, poetry and many other devices that encourage self expression.
    Our intention is simple, create a citywide media program in video that
    shares challenges and desires from those whose daily struggle is a matter of
    life and death. Often this is found in the form of gang affiliations. What
    The Story Project proposes is to create a series of films from various
    communities that explore what it is like to live in their community. The
    idea is that through media storytelling the similarities will temper feuds
    and breed cooperation and peace. The project will have its own portal and
    support staff in addition to team members that will reach into the community
    to mentor and coach all involved.

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    Dealing with rival gangs is a very risky on a number of fronts. First, there
    needs to be a desire to want change, without it everything remains stagnant.
    This is going to have to be accomplished through powerful activism and
    education that will provide an education to those involved. There needs to
    be a tangible level of optimism that is felt by those involved. If our
    participants struggle to uncover a positive future than this will have no
    long term value. And lastly, the city needs to endorse this cooperation,
    possible giving us a physical venue giving passersby a destination of
    change. 
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    Evaluation will occur through accomplishment. We will have deadlines just
    like any other type of project with project managers and benchmarks. The
    Story Project was founded on the basis of incorporating the local media
    landscape into our classrooms and this program will be no different. We will
    reach out to the professional TV and film industry for mentors to work with
    participants in all enrolled communities. 
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    We have worked with groups such as 826LA and Young Storytellers in the past
    but The Story Project is unique in that we are all media based and have been
    since our inception in 1998. The idea has caught on, as it should, but The
    Story Project is proud to be one of the first on the scene. 
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    This box is very much TBD. However, we are very active with the Boys and
    Girls Clubs throughout Los Angeles and Central High School in the Mar Vista
    Gardens housing projects. They will absolutely be included in all aspects of
    this project. I did have a recent meeting with the director of media
    projects at Venice Arts and continue to have an open dialogue, including
    them would be a please. Other possible groups: RAA (Rhythm Arts Alliance,
    Street Poets, Father Greg Boyle's Homeboy Industries)
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    We are all film professionals and will budget this program to meet the
    $100,000 cap. 
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Teaching Personnel 10,000\r\nStaff 10,000\r\nTransportation 2,500\r\n\r\nProduction\r\nCameras 20,000\r\nLighting 5,000\r\nInstruction 2,000\r\n\r\nPost Production\r\nSoftware 15,000\r\nHardware 25,000\r\n\r\nWebsite Construction 4,500\r\nMarketing 2,500\r\nSocial Media Staff 1,500\r\n\r\nInsurance 2,000"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    As the executive director of The Story Project, I have been fortunate to
    have been through the Annenberg Foundation's Alchemy + governance training,
    and have worked all over the country with fine organizations such as
    Reader's Digest, Boys and Girls Clubs and local government agencies to
    further our reach. The success of this program in such a wide metropolitan
    city as Los Angeles will absolutely pave the way to further this type of
    outreach in other cities throughout the country. Based on this factor we
    would plan additional community outreach across the nation and create
    proposals for corporate involvement and sponsorship. We would like to see
    this grow into an ongoing project and library that would house video
    projects, testimonials and metrics that will document our successes through
    the years in curbing violence and adding value to the quality of life in
    these challenged communities.

      LA is a city of communities and with it are cultures that are all too
      often at odds. Since 1998, The Story Project has been bridging gaps
      through media education teaching storytelling through filmmaking,
      screenwriting, photography, poetry and many other devices that encourage
      self expression. Our intention is simple, create a citywide media program
      in video that shares challenges and desires from those whose daily
      struggle is a matter of life and death. Often this is found in the form of
      gang affiliations. What The Story Project proposes is to create a series
      of films from various communities that explore what it is like to live in
      their community. The idea is that through media storytelling the
      similarities will temper feuds and breed cooperation and peace. The
      project will have its own portal and support staff in addition to team
      members that will reach into the community to mentor and coach all
      involved.

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      Dealing with rival gangs is a very risky on a number of fronts. First,
      there needs to be a desire to want change, without it everything remains
      stagnant. This is going to have to be accomplished through powerful
      activism and education that will provide an education to those involved.
      There needs to be a tangible level of optimism that is felt by those
      involved. If our participants struggle to uncover a positive future than
      this will have no long term value. And lastly, the city needs to endorse
      this cooperation, possible giving us a physical venue giving passersby a
      destination of change. 
  - name: Please explain how you will evaluate your work.
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      Evaluation will occur through accomplishment. We will have deadlines just
      like any other type of project with project managers and benchmarks. The
      Story Project was founded on the basis of incorporating the local media
      landscape into our classrooms and this program will be no different. We
      will reach out to the professional TV and film industry for mentors to
      work with participants in all enrolled communities.

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      We have worked with groups such as 826LA and Young Storytellers in the
      past but The Story Project is unique in that we are all media based and
      have been since our inception in 1998. The idea has caught on, as it
      should, but The Story Project is proud to be one of the first on the
      scene.

      Vista Gardens housing projects. They will absolutely be included in all
      aspects of this project. I did have a recent meeting with the director of
      media projects at Venice Arts and continue to have an open dialogue,
      including them would be a please. Other possible groups: RAA (Rhythm Arts
      Alliance, Street Poets, Father Greg Boyle's Homeboy Industries)

    answer: >-
      As the executive director of The Story Project, I have been fortunate to
      have been through the Annenberg Foundation's Alchemy + governance
      training, and have worked all over the country with fine organizations
      such as Reader's Digest, Boys and Girls Clubs and local government
      agencies to further our reach. The success of this program in such a wide
      metropolitan city as Los Angeles will absolutely pave the way to further
      this type of outreach in other cities throughout the country. Based on
      this factor we would plan additional community outreach across the nation
      and create proposals for corporate involvement and sponsorship. We would
      like to see this grow into an ongoing project and library that would house
      video projects, testimonials and metrics that will document our successes
      through the years in curbing violence and adding value to the quality of
      life in these challenged communities.
