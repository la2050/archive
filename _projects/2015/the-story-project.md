Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: >-
  LA is a city of communities and with it are cultures that are all too often at
  odds. Since 1998, The Story Project has been bridging gaps through media
  education teaching storytelling through filmmaking, screenwriting,
  photography, poetry and many other devices that encourage self expression. Our
  intention is simple, create a citywide media program in video that shares
  challenges and desires from those whose daily struggle is a matter of life and
  death. Often this is found in the form of gang affiliations. What The Story
  Project proposes is to create a series of films from various communities that
  explore what it is like to live in their community. The idea is that through
  media storytelling the similarities will temper feuds and breed cooperation
  and peace. The project will have its own portal and support staff in addition
  to team members that will reach into the community to mentor and coach all
  involved. 
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Evaluation will occur through accomplishment. We will have deadlines just like
  any other type of project with project managers and benchmarks. The Story
  Project was founded on the basis of incorporating the local media landscape
  into our classrooms and this program will be no different. We will reach out
  to the professional TV and film industry for mentors to work with participants
  in all enrolled communities.
