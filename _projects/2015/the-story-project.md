    those stories. 
  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: >-
    LA is a city of communities and with it are cultures that are all too often
    at odds. Since 1998, The Story Project has been bridging gaps through media
    education teaching storytelling through filmmaking, screenwriting,
    photography, poetry and many other devices that encourage self expression.
    Our intention is simple, create a citywide media program in video that
    shares challenges and desires from those whose daily struggle is a matter of
    life and death. Often this is found in the form of gang affiliations. What
    The Story Project proposes is to create a series of films from various
    communities that explore what it is like to live in their community. The
    idea is that through media storytelling the similarities will temper feuds
    and breed cooperation and peace. The project will have its own portal and
    support staff in addition to team members that will reach into the community
    to mentor and coach all involved. 
  How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
    - Money (financial capital)
    - Volunteers/staff (human capital)
    - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
    - 'Infrastructure (building/space/vehicles, etc.)'
    - 'Technical infrastructure (computers, etc.)'
    - Community outreach
    - Network/relationship support
  How do you plan to use these resources to make change?:
    - Engage residents and stakeholders
    - Implement a pilot or new project
    - Expand a pilot or a program
  Where will you be working?: []
  How will your proposal improve the following “Create” metrics?:
    - Employment in the creative industries
    - Arts establishments per capita
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    Evaluation will occur through accomplishment. We will have deadlines just
    like any other type of project with project managers and benchmarks. The
    Story Project was founded on the basis of incorporating the local media
    landscape into our classrooms and this program will be no different. We will
    reach out to the professional TV and film industry for mentors to work with
    participants in all enrolled communities.

Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Dealing with rival gangs is a very risky on a number of fronts. First, there
  needs to be a desire to want change, without it everything remains stagnant.
  This is going to have to be accomplished through powerful activism and
  education that will provide an education to those involved. There needs to be
  a tangible level of optimism that is felt by those involved. If our
  participants struggle to uncover a positive future than this will have no long
  term value. And lastly, the city needs to endorse this cooperation, possible
  giving us a physical venue giving passersby a destination of change.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Evaluation will occur through accomplishment. We will have deadlines just like
  any other type of project with project managers and benchmarks. The Story
  Project was founded on the basis of incorporating the local media landscape
  into our classrooms and this program will be no different. We will reach out
  to the professional TV and film industry for mentors to work with participants
  in all enrolled communities.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  We have worked with groups such as 826LA and Young Storytellers in the past
  but The Story Project is unique in that we are all media based and have been
  since our inception in 1998. The idea has caught on, as it should, but The
  Story Project is proud to be one of the first on the scene.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  This box is very much TBD. However, we are very active with the Boys and Girls
  Clubs throughout Los Angeles and Central High School in the Mar Vista Gardens
  housing projects. They will absolutely be included in all aspects of this
  project. I did have a recent meeting with the director of media projects at
  Venice Arts and continue to have an open dialogue, including them would be a
  please. Other possible groups: RAA (Rhythm Arts Alliance, Street Poets, Father
  Greg Boyle's Homeboy Industries)
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  As the executive director of The Story Project, I have been fortunate to have
  been through the Annenberg Foundation's Alchemy + governance training, and
  have worked all over the country with fine organizations such as Reader's
  Digest, Boys and Girls Clubs and local government agencies to further our
  reach. The success of this program in such a wide metropolitan city as Los
  Angeles will absolutely pave the way to further this type of outreach in other
  cities throughout the country. Based on this factor we would plan additional
  community outreach across the nation and create proposals for corporate
  involvement and sponsorship. We would like to see this grow into an ongoing
  project and library that would house video projects, testimonials and metrics
  that will document our successes through the years in curbing violence and
  adding value to the quality of life in these challenged communities.
