project_summary: >-
  1 in 6 children are being born with developmental disabilities - such as
  Autism and Down syndrome - requiring lifelong support, adding to over 830,000
  California adults with developmental disabilities. Our cultural landscape will
  be stunted if we don’t help the artists among this population to express
  themselves. Tierra will identify people who are artistically gifted, and
  empower them to build careers, increasing employment in creative industries
  such as animation, ceramics, and commercial art.

  Tierra’s Fine Arts program combines individualized support with professional
  instruction to empower individuals, with significant disabilities, to build
  careers in the arts. The program integrates a variety of art forms to allow
  participants to identify and cultivate their passion, while speaking to
  different audiences. Almost 140 people each day explore their interest and
  talents in the arts, through painting, drawing, and ceramics, at Tierra’s
  First Street Gallery Art Center and Sunland Studio Arts. Tierra has enabled
  over 10% of the people we serve (70 of 660) to become professional artists.
   
   Artists with moderate to severe developmental disabilities develop their artistic skills, create art, and display and sell their work throughout Los Angeles County. Tierra Fine Arts is a year-round program that provides individualized instruction each weekday. The program is comprised of:
   
   (1) Professional Arts Career Training
   Tierra provides professional training, by instructors who support artists in building their arts résumé, and guide development of career skills such as writing artist statements, creating exhibition themes, and selecting and installing art for exhibitions. These skills prepare the artists to market their complete, fully-developed résumés.
   
   Each participant develops a personalized plan for career goals, independent transportation, and social skills. This plan might include developing their career skills by volunteering at non-profit organizations. Artists, in the Tierra Fine Arts program, teach arts and serve vulnerable populations at non-profits including: Joslyn Senior Center, daCenter for the Arts, and Emerson Village Assisted Living.
   
   (2) Art Creation
   Artists are invited to create and submit work for consideration in exhibitions. For a recent exhibition, called “The Open Road”, Tierra artist Joe Zaldivar created and submitted an illustration of Hamer Toyota’s lobby. This piece was featured in the announcement, at the artist reception held at Hamer, and has become a permanent piece of art in the dealer’s lobby since March.
   
   (3) Promotion and Exhibition
   Tierra staff members identify exhibitions that build artists résumés and share work. Tierra builds relationships with galleries and local businesses to increase the reach of the artwork at 6 or more exhibitions each year. As a result, people in Los Angeles have an example of how they, and their family or friends with disabilities, can overcome challenges to achieve their goals.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Only 4%, of the 838,842 California working-age adults with developmental
  disabilities, are employed in the community (Federal Register 2014, U.S.
  Census Bureau 2013). The other 96% face segregated employment options in
  “sheltered workshops” that often pay a piece rate resulting in less than
  minimum wage income or no option at all.
   
   Each day, Tierra serves 660 adults with developmental disabilities (740 each year), while creating scalable models that will allow our community to support these individuals as they pursue employment.
   
   Seventy Tierra artists currently sell and exhibit their work, but many more have the artistic skill to transition into careers. Limited communication skills and social networks prevent them from advocating for themselves and marketing their work. Tierra’s staff identify opportunities for artists, in our programs, to build their resumes by participating in juried competitions, and installations at local businesses, and exhibitions.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Tierra Fine Arts will engage new audiences in the painting, sculptures, and
  illustrations produced by artists with developmental disabilities. As a
  result, Tierra will achieve the following objectives:
   
   Objective 1 – Tierra will continue to maintain full capacity of quality art programs, helping 140 people each day (260 each week) improve their skills in the fine arts, work ethic, productivity, workplace conduct, safety skills, communication skills, mobility skills, and money skills.
   
   Objective 2 – Seventy (70) artists, with moderate to severe developmental disabilities, will build their professional arts resume by publicly exhibiting their work.
   
   Objective 3 –Tierra will increase exhibition attendance by 10-15%. The sales, exhibitions, and attendance will be monitored and compared to prior years’, to determine if changes made in that year positively or negatively impacted the community’s involvement.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  In Tierra Fine Arts, adults with even the most severe developmental
  disabilities explore their interest in the arts and pursue professional arts
  careers. Tierra supports them in lending their creative voices to the entire
  community by creating and displaying art, sharing their talents by
  volunteering at nonprofit organizations, and taking part in coalitions and
  collaborations that challenge the city’s current level of accessibility and
  recognition for adults with developmental disabilities.
   
   Every person, who takes part in Tierra’s Sunland campus-based programs, has the opportunity to take part in fine arts classes. No matter what level of interest an individual has, a professional arts instructor guides them in exploring fine arts, identifying their interests, and pursuing their career and life goals.
   
   Rather than isolating and segregating people, Tierra’s arts studios are a launching point for the person’s community involvement. Through partnerships with over 110 non-profit organizations, participants explore a wide variety of arts careers, while serving others by teaching art classes to seniors and children, and providing docent services at art galleries.
   
   Tierra’s Director of Fine Arts creates opportunities, for adult with developmental disabilities to expand their arts careers. By participating in arts coalitions, such as Arts for L.A., Art Beyond Sight, and Claremont Museum of Art, and sitting on the board of Los Angeles Art Association and The Pederson Museum, Tierra has a voice in the direction of the arts throughout Los Angeles County.
   
   These efforts have resulted in Tierra artists exhibiting and showing their work in 52 locations across the United States and five other countries. Tierra Fine Arts has presented at Los Angeles-based arts exhibitions that draw international audiences, including an exclusive art exhibition at the 2015 Special Olympics World Games. This exhibition was held over 10 days at USC and UCLA, creating opportunities for people from over 165 countries to experience the art and build inclusion and acceptance for artists with disabilities.
   
   These outcomes aren’t ancillary to our organization; Rather, they are the natural results of Tierra’s efforts to live out our vision to empower people with disabilities to fulfill their potential and desire to become productive citizens who are accepted and valued for the contributions they make to the economic, civic, and cultural vitality of our community.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Tierra’s staff and existing partners identify potential collaborators and make
  recommendations to the Director of Fine Arts and Exhibition Coordinator.
  Partnerships are formalized using a Memorandum of Understanding, and no
  financial commitment is incurred by either partner.
   
   Since the program’s inception in the late 1980s, Tierra has built partnerships with 52 galleries, collectors, companies, and universities that have resulted in Tierra artists’ work being exhibited in 257 shows at venues such as The Special Olympics World Games at USC and UCLA, The Good Luck Gallery Los Angeles, The Smithsonian Institution and Kennedy Center in Washington D.C., Valley Presbyterian Hospital, L.A. City Hall, and internationally in Belgium, Germany, Japan, and Canada.
   
   Once identified, Tierra Fine Arts leaders evaluate potential partners using the following criteria:
   
   1. Alignment with Tierra’s values
   2. Ability to enhance individuals’ professional arts careers
   3. Ability to expand the types, locations, and audiences of exhibitions in which Tierra participates
   
   Core partners include: Claremont Graduate University, which provides exhibition opportunities; J. Paul Getty Foundation, which has provided undergraduate interns to Tierra Fine Arts each year for the past 21 years; and Claremont Chamber of Commerce, which will provide advertising for exhibitions, and will connect Tierra’s Director of Fine Arts to opportunities to speak, about the program, to community organizations. This partnership will also provide marketing consultation with SCORE, a nonprofit association that uses a mentorship-based model to grow small businesses.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  The Tierra Fine Arts program operates on a $840,324 budget. This includes
  personnel costs for one Director of Arts, an Exhibition Coordinator, a Gallery
  Manager and a Ceramics Instructor, and one Direct Support Professional for
  every four artists. Operating expenses include program supplies, art supplies
  and framing, rent for Tierra’s First Street Gallery Art Center in Claremont,
  and management/overhead costs.
   
   The State of California contracts with Tierra del Sol Foundation to provide basic custodial care to adults with developmental disabilities. This contract totals $582,453 in the current fiscal year. However, none of these funds are available for the art program; Tierra relies on fundraising to sustain and grow this program. 
   
   Tierra must raise $257,871 to fill the gap, keep Tierra Fine Arts, and ensure ongoing professional instruction and exhibition opportunities for the adults we serve. This is 30% of Tierra’s fiscal year 2016 fundraising budget. Tierra designates this large percentage, of our fundraising, to this program because of the value it provides to the participants’ careers, and to the community’s appreciation of the art and the artists. Tierra’s Circle of Inspiration plays a key role in sustaining the organization’s annual source of funding income from individuals. The newly-launched campaign establishes a formal platform to cultivate, steward and recognize longtime and new contributors who have the ability to support Tierra via a minimum annual gift of $1,000. These individuals are also encouraged to serve as ambassadors, advocate Tierra’s mission and renew or increase their commitment on an annual basis. Circle of Inspiration members’ loyalty and commitment is celebrated with a special recognition event at yearend, as well as continued opportunities for members to engage in educational, fundraising, and advocacy events.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
  With $100,000 support from The Goldhirsh Foundation’s LA2050 Grants Challenge,
  Tierra will create opportunities for adults with developmental disabilities to
  build their careers in the arts, and share their artwork throughout Los
  Angeles County. This includes:
   
   o $20,750 for art supplies and framing (50% of $41,500 annual cost)
   o $1,673 for transportation and supplies for volunteer employment training (20% of $8,340 annual cost)
   o $4,440 for marketing the 8 exhibitions hosted on Tierra’s campuses (100% of annual printing, publishing, and mailing cost)
   o $21,759 for Tierra’s art studio and gallery space in Sunland and Claremont (25% of $87,036 annual cost)
   o $51,378 for salary and benefits for 4 full-time employees: Director of Arts, Exhibition Coordinator, Gallery Manager, and Ceramics Instructor (25% of $205,513 annual cost)
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Tierra’s programs are designed to allow for scalability of Tierra Fine Arts.
  Over 200 students, at Tierra’s 7-acre job training campus, pursue arts as a
  way of increasing their communication skills, building strength in their
  hands, exploring the arts as a potential career path, and enjoying a part of
  life that transportation and communication challenges often exclude them from.
  Each year, 16 people transition from site-based programming at Tierra’ Sunland
  job-training campus, to fully community-based life. As these individuals move
  into careers, college, and full-time volunteerism in the community, they take
  their new arts skills and appreciation with them, while allowing new students
  to begin their own arts experience.
   
   Tierra creates new opportunities for artists by leveraging the success of Tierra artists, and involving guest artists and curators, such as Gallerist Daniel Weinberg and David Pagel, art critic for the Los Angeles Times. As artists’ careers take off, their work becomes sought-after by collectors and galleries, which contact Tierra directly to request installations and exhibitions. Tierra’s Exhibition Coordinator expands the impact of these opportunities by enabling new artists to exhibit their work alongside the career artist, thereby building their resume and launching their own professional arts career.
   
   Helen Rae is one artist who has built a career through Tierra’s Fine Arts program. At the age of 70, and despite her inability to use verbal communication, Helen has inspired a dedicated following of art lovers who seek out and collect her work.
   
   At Tierra’s First Street Gallery Art Center, Helen creates paintings and drawings that are animated and full of character. Helen began creating art at Tierra in 1990, at the age of 52. Since then, her work has been shown at GoodLuck Gallery, ACME Gallery Los Angeles, and Claremont Graduate University. She earned an Award of Recognition from the Artists Beyond Disabilities Exhibition in Pasadena. Helen’s work has been featured across the country and internationally, including shows in New York City, Boston, Washington D.C., Belgium and Scotland, and a traveling exhibit viewed in Okinawa, Fukuka, and Miyazaki Japan.
   
   Helen’s career has resulted in hundreds of other artists’ success. As people discover her art, they realize that disability does not have to be a barrier to creativity, and open themselves up to appreciating art from other artists in Tierra’s program.
