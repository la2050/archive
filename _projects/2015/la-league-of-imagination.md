  We imagine a world where creativity and entrepreneurship are core social
  values nurtured in schools, homes and communities everywhere, where all
  children are taught to be creative thinkers and doers, and encouraged to make
  their very best ideas happen.
   
   In 2012, the short film ‘Caine’s Arcade’ charmed the world with its message of creativity, handwork, perseverance and community. Called a “great American story” by the Christian Science Monitor, the film sparked a global movement and launched the Imagination Foundation, a nonprofit organization to foster creativity and entrepreneurship in children. Our hallmark event is the Global Cardboard Challenge, which has already impacted nearly 350,000 children from 70 countries. This event is a month long campagin to celebrate child creativity and the simple things adults can do to foster it. See www.cardboardchallenge.com.
   
   Following from the inspiration of "Caine’s Arcade" and the success of the Global Cardboard Challenge, in 2014 we launched the Imagination Chapters program worldwide. Imagination Chapters are community-organized learning spaces that foster creativity and other 21st century skills through Creative Play. Chapters are volunteer-led and can start anywhere, including schools, homes, libraries and community spaces. Our educational model at the heart of the Chapters program recently won a global challenge sponsored by LEGO and Ashoka to “re-imagine learning.” What began as a 30-site pilot program in 2014 is now growing to serve new Chapters around the world, including 20 in Los Angeles to form the "LA League of Imagination."
   
   Imagination Chapters are popup learning spaces for Creative Play. They are community-organized and volunteer-led. They are designed to launch in a variety of locations, and can accommodate whatever resources are available (especially and including recyclables). Many Chapters launch in classrooms and operate as part of the regular school day. Others launch in homes, libraries, and community centers, and alongside of after school programs or other nonprofits. Professional educators and also other adults — from all walks of life — can start and lead an Imagination Chapter. The focal point of a Chapter is a Creative Play session. Creative Play is a process whereby children build whatever they can imagine using available tools and resources, and then share their creations in person and online. Sessions can be simple or complex depending on participant age and materials.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Our biggest challenge is adult perception, that fostering child creativity is
  a difficult, time-consuming task, requiring training and resources, and best
  suited to educators. But in truth, sometimes the best thing that an adult can
  do is simply give some room and get out of the way, a bit, of child
  imagination.
   
   Another challenge is to proliferate Chapter growth within school environments, where though Chapters have potential to impact high numbers of children and transform school culture, they confront barriers like rigid structures and high-stakes testing.
   
   We overcome both challenges the same way, by making the Chapters model a lean and simple program. It requires few resources, training or infrastructure, in part because Creative Play (at the heart of the Chapter model) taps into a child's natural creative talents.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Through Creative Play, children grow in "creative self-efficacy," which is
  comprised of numerous next generation skills, especially creativity and
  innovation, as well as social-emotional skills like collaboration, resilience
  and empathy. Children also learn skills that represent fundamental STEM
  literacy and engineering-thinking. Measurement is assessed using various
  surveys, and a randomized sample of child portfolios (through Consensual
  Assessment Technique). We will also compile data on child development from
  short monthly survey’s administered to Chapter Leaders.
   
   We will examine academic performance data (such as attendance and discipline data) to explore and demonstrate impact on traditional school-related outcomes. Surveys to examine parent/care-giver observations will be administered twice per year to document the transfer of key skills to home environments.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Programs that are similar to Imagination Chapters are maker spaces, creativity
  labs, DIY clubs and other organizations that encourage children to play with
  materials and build the things they imagine. Imagination Chapters are
  distinguished from these programs primarily because of their "low floor" and
  "high ceiling."
   
   This means that Chapters can engage children of all ages using very simple and familiar materials (such as cardboard and recyclables), but through Creative Play and with the introduction of new tools, Chapters can easily and quickly escalate to more advanced skills and content. Escalation works for many reasons, including the “just build it” mentality which is fundamental to the Chapter ethos, encouraging a fun and fearless approach to building whatever a child can dream up. 
   
   The “low floor” of a Chapter is important because it avoids the cost-prohibitions of similar programs (Chapters don't require expensive equipment). It also engages children who are historically underrepresented in these sorts of programs (girls, for example). By tapping into the natural creative talents that all children possess, and beginning with materials and topics that are of interest to kids, Chapters can introduce children to increasingly advanced experiences over time.
   
   Another important distinguishing factor of Imagination Chapters is the large and sociable network of Chapter Leaders. The "LA League" of Chapters will participate in a global network of Chapter Leaders from around the world (places like Bosnia, Pakistan, China and S. Africa). Chapter Leaders will share experiences and knowledge together, as well as reach out for help. This high degree of global connectivity rapidly accelerates learning for Chapter Leaders, and provides children a worldwide venue to share their experiences as well.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Collaborators on this project include the YMCA of Greater Los Angeles, LA
  Conservation Corps, LAUSD, Santa Monica School District, select charter
  schools and public libraries. Approximately $1,000 per each Chapter site would
  be allocated for the purpose of tools and materials for children to use during
  Chapter meetings. With a total of 20 anticipated Chapters, that amount is
  $20,000.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  This project will cost $150,923. Additional funds are being requested from
  other local grant making organizations and philanthropists.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  Direct Program Expenses include:
   Web Development: $5,400 
   Consulting: $2,000
   Video Production: $2,802
   Conferences & Trainings: $7,500
   Tools & Materials: $22,500
   Research & Evaluation: $8,000
   Travel & Observation: $2,400
   
   Salaries and Payroll include:
   Program Staff: $60,000
   Support Staff: $12,000
   Other: $18,000
   
   General & Administrative is: $10,322
   
   Total Expense is: $150,923
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  The Imagination Chapters program demonstrates simple, effective and highly
  scaleable practices for fostering next generation skills and attitudes in
  children through play. In large part, the sustainability of the program is due
  to the simplicity of its implementation; it trains leaders from all walks of
  life, and it can be implemented within formal and informal educational
  environments and with basic materials, therefore avoiding cost challenges of
  similar programs, like maker spaces, or other STEM/engineering programs.
   
   In addition to its simple implementation, the Chapters program is scalable and sustainable for two other reasons: 1) massive economies of scale and, 2) a strong network of engaged Chapter Leaders. Regarding economies of scale, because much of Chapter Leader training and support is conducted virtually in group formats, relative costs of management decrease with program growth. And regarding the network of Chapter Leaders, because they are part of such a strong and highly social international cohort, much of the support leaders receive is provided in peer-to-peer contexts, which is less costly to manage than direct trainings.
   
   The LA League of Imagination will be a highly visible entity, both locally and worldwide. Its activities will be well publicized, which will in turn create new interest and continued growth beyond the LA2050 grant.

    answer: "We imagine a world where creativity and entrepreneurship are core social values nurtured in schools, homes and communities everywhere, where all children are taught to be creative thinkers and doers, and encouraged to make their very best ideas happen.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the short film ‘Caine’s Arcade’ charmed the world with its message of creativity, handwork, perseverance and community. Called a “great American story” by the Christian Science Monitor, the film sparked a global movement and launched the Imagination Foundation, a nonprofit organization to foster creativity and entrepreneurship in children. Our hallmark event is the Global Cardboard Challenge, which has already impacted nearly 350,000 children from 70 countries. This event is a month long campagin to celebrate child creativity and the simple things adults can do to foster it. See www.cardboardchallenge.com.\r\n\r\nFollowing from the inspiration of \"Caine’s Arcade\" and the success of the Global Cardboard Challenge, in 2014 we launched the Imagination Chapters program worldwide. Imagination Chapters are community-organized learning spaces that foster creativity and other 21st century skills through Creative Play. Chapters are volunteer-led and can start anywhere, including schools, homes, libraries and community spaces. Our educational model at the heart of the Chapters program recently won a global challenge sponsored by LEGO and Ashoka to “re-imagine learning.” What began as a 30-site pilot program in 2014 is now growing to serve new Chapters around the world, including 20 in Los Angeles to form the \"LA League of Imagination.\"\r\n\r\nImagination Chapters are popup learning spaces for Creative Play. They are community-organized and volunteer-led. They are designed to launch in a variety of locations, and can accommodate whatever resources are available (especially and including recyclables). Many Chapters launch in classrooms and operate as part of the regular school day. Others launch in homes, libraries, and community centers, and alongside of after school programs or other nonprofits. Professional educators and also other adults — from all walks of life — can start and lead an Imagination Chapter. The focal point of a Chapter is a Creative Play session. Creative Play is a process whereby children build whatever they can imagine using available tools and resources, and then share their creations in person and online. Sessions can be simple or complex depending on participant age and materials."

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Our biggest challenge is adult perception, that fostering child creativity is a difficult, time-consuming task, requiring training and resources, and best suited to educators. But in truth, sometimes the best thing that an adult can do is simply give some room and get out of the way, a bit, of child imagination.\r\n\r\nAnother challenge is to proliferate Chapter growth within school environments, where though Chapters have potential to impact high numbers of children and transform school culture, they confront barriers like rigid structures and high-stakes testing.\r\n\r\nWe overcome both challenges the same way, by making the Chapters model a lean and simple program. It requires few resources, training or infrastructure, in part because Creative Play (at the heart of the Chapter model) taps into a child's natural creative talents."
  - name: Please explain how you will evaluate your work.
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Through Creative Play, children grow in \"creative self-efficacy,\" which is comprised of numerous next generation skills, especially creativity and innovation, as well as social-emotional skills like collaboration, resilience and empathy. Children also learn skills that represent fundamental STEM literacy and engineering-thinking. Measurement is assessed using various surveys, and a randomized sample of child portfolios (through Consensual Assessment Technique). We will also compile data on child development from short monthly survey’s administered to Chapter Leaders.\r\n\r\nWe will examine academic performance data (such as attendance and discipline data) to explore and demonstrate impact on traditional school-related outcomes. Surveys to examine parent/care-giver observations will be administered twice per year to document the transfer of key skills to home environments."

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Programs that are similar to Imagination Chapters are maker spaces, creativity labs, DIY clubs and other organizations that encourage children to play with materials and build the things they imagine. Imagination Chapters are distinguished from these programs primarily because of their \"low floor\" and \"high ceiling.\"\r\n\r\nThis means that Chapters can engage children of all ages using very simple and familiar materials (such as cardboard and recyclables), but through Creative Play and with the introduction of new tools, Chapters can easily and quickly escalate to more advanced skills and content. Escalation works for many reasons, including the “just build it” mentality which is fundamental to the Chapter ethos, encouraging a fun and fearless approach to building whatever a child can dream up. \r\n\r\nThe “low floor” of a Chapter is important because it avoids the cost-prohibitions of similar programs (Chapters don't require expensive equipment). It also engages children who are historically underrepresented in these sorts of programs (girls, for example). By tapping into the natural creative talents that all children possess, and beginning with materials and topics that are of interest to kids, Chapters can introduce children to increasingly advanced experiences over time.\r\n\r\nAnother important distinguishing factor of Imagination Chapters is the large and sociable network of Chapter Leaders. The \"LA League\" of Chapters will participate in a global network of Chapter Leaders from around the world (places like Bosnia, Pakistan, China and S. Africa). Chapter Leaders will share experiences and knowledge together, as well as reach out for help. This high degree of global connectivity rapidly accelerates learning for Chapter Leaders, and provides children a worldwide venue to share their experiences as well."

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "The Imagination Chapters program demonstrates simple, effective and highly scaleable practices for fostering next generation skills and attitudes in children through play.  In large part, the sustainability of the program is due to the simplicity of its implementation; it trains leaders from all walks of life, and it can be implemented within formal and informal educational environments and with basic materials, therefore avoiding cost challenges of similar programs, like maker spaces, or other STEM/engineering programs.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its simple implementation, the Chapters program is scalable and sustainable for two other reasons: 1) massive economies of scale and, 2) a strong network of engaged Chapter Leaders. Regarding economies of scale, because much of Chapter Leader training and support is conducted virtually in group formats, relative costs of management decrease with program growth. And regarding the network of Chapter Leaders, because they are part of such a  strong and highly social international cohort, much of the support leaders receive is provided in peer-to-peer contexts, which is less costly to manage than direct trainings.\r\n\r\nThe LA League of Imagination will be a highly visible entity, both locally and worldwide. Its activities will be well publicized, which will in turn create new interest and continued growth beyond the LA2050 grant.  "
