  To develop a curriculum of interactive activities and workshops prior to our
  Children’s Concert Series, in partnership with other local arts organizations.
  that ignite the imaginations of children and their families. The activities
  and workshops will be coordinated with the acts performing on stage,
  showcasing the multiculturalism of LA, and expanding the awareness of other
  world cultures.

  Levitt Pavilion Greater Los Angeles & Pasadena envisions an LA2050 in which
  the community as a whole—parents, children, young adults, seniors—comes
  together to play in welcoming outdoor settings to experience the joy of arts
  experiences open to all. We believe that access to high quality arts
  experiences shouldn’t be reserved for those who can afford to buy tickets, but
  should be made available to everyone. Each summer over 100,000 Angelenos of
  all ages and backgrounds enjoy 100+ free concerts at Levitt Los Angeles in
  MacArthur Park, and Levitt Pasadena in Memorial Park, adding vitality to
  public spaces that were once neglected and nurturing an appreciation for the
  arts in this great city we call home. 
   
   However, in the wake of drastic funding cuts to arts education in Los Angeles-area public schools, Levitt believes we could – and must – do more. Tens of thousands of youth are missing out on opportunities to engage more deeply with the arts, compromising an invaluable part of their overall growth as individuals and members of society. Levitt proposes to help fill this void by enhancing Levitt LA and Levitt Pasadena’s popular free children’s concerts with a series of free, hands-on interactive workshops before each children’s show, designed to ignite imaginations and expand the awareness of the multiculturalism of LA and other world cultures. 
   
   The My LA 2050 grant will give Levitt the opportunity to extend and deepen children’s art experiences through weekly pre-concert workshops from late June through August 2016. These hour-long interactive workshops will be taught by highly skilled teaching artists in a welcoming and supportive environment, and coordinated with a community partner and the acts onstage to highlight the cultural significance of the days performance. Through making an instrument, trying out cultural dances, creating murals, learning a new song of another culture and singing along with others, we envision each workshop will engage the imagination and offer a fun and hands-on way for children to experience the joy of creating and experiencing music of various cultures in a communal setting. 
   
   Both Levitt L.A. and Levitt Pasadena have had incredible success with the children’s series presented as part of the overall Levitt concert seasons. Based upon the attendance at the children’s programs in previous years, we anticipate that approximately 20,000 Los Angeles children will benefit from this program in 2016.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  While our Children’s Concerts are well attended, one of our major challenges
  will be getting the word out to the community that the new workshops and
  activities being presented are a new addition to the existing program. Because
  our concerts are during the summer, we have the challenge of engaging families
  before the end of the school year. As part of our overall marketing strategy,
  we plan to disseminate information to the local schools prior to the end of
  the school year.
   
   Local residents currently frequent the parks on a regular basis, however, our other major challenge will be to bring people from beyond the local community to our shows. With a particular history of neglect, this is especially true at our MacArthur Park venue. 
   
   We will overcome these challenges by developing a comprehensive marketing strategy that begins early. In addition, our extensive network of local media partners will be instrumental in our marketing efforts to reach a broad demographic.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: |-
  We will evaluate the success of the program in the following key ways:
   First, we will measure the number of participants attending each of the 20 children’s concerts and the number of children attending the pre-concert workshops. 
   
   Additionally, following each children’s workshop, Levitt professional staff, workshop artists, and participating partners, will debrief and determine how to enhance participation, refine logistics and evaluate responses.
   
   Finally, to measure success in participation, we will collect the qualitative data from the surveys of participants. Levitt routinely collects random samples of audience surveys in both English and Spanish. This summer’s surveys will include questions about the new interactive activities and workshops for children and families, in order to receive reactions to the project and to measure its success. The surveys will be tallied and the results will be incorporated into a final report to be shared with the funder.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Levitt Pavilion is in a unique position in that we are the only organization
  to offer 100+ free concerts to the citizens of Los Angeles each year. While
  there are other organizations that present open-air performances as part of a
  summer series, such as the Hollywood Bowl, the Greek Theatre, and the John
  Anson Ford Amphitheater, what makes the Levitt program special is that all of
  our concerts and programs are always presented free of charge. Grand
  Performances may be considered our closest competitor, but what differentiates
  us from Grand Performances is our children’s programming. Levitt presents the
  largest free outdoor concert series in Los Angeles, with a regular and
  consistent (twice a week during the summer) children’s concert component.
    
   Levitt Pavilions has good working relationships with our sister presenting organizations, especially in the area of scheduling and booking. We work in a collaborative and complementary way with these organizations, including Grand Performances, Grand Park, Skirball, the Twilight Concert Series in Santa Monica, etc. Our success and the success of our “competitors” only help to build the awareness of and appreciation for the performing arts in Los Angeles.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  We have established relationships with a number of arts organizations who are
  eager to work with us on this endeavor including LACMA, Zimmer Children’s
  Museum, KidSpace Museum, Armory Center for the Arts, LA Phil, PBS, iMusic
  Academy, Central American Resource Center (CARECEN), Pasadena Museum of
  Contemporary Art, Mus/ique, Korean Cultural Center - Los Angeles, Hearts of
  Los Angeles (HOLA), and Las Fotos Project. 
   
   We also have an extensive roster of contemporary and traditional artists, many of whom have performed at our stages in the past, that will be selected for this series. Artists chosen for this program range from acclaimed, emerging talent to seasoned, award-winning artists that represent the diversity of cultures that comprise Los Angeles. Examples include Oscar Award-winning Bob Baker Marionettes, Latin Grammy Award Winners Lucky Diaz & the Family Jam Band, Mariachi Los Castorcitos, Canada's only known children's Mariachi group, Tierra Blanca, Silk Road Dance Company, to name a few. 
   
   We are looking at Viver Brasil Dance Company, Blue13 Dance Company (Bollywood/Indian dance), Antics (multimedia hip-hop dance theater), Capoeira Batuque, CONTRA-TIEMPO (Urban Latin Dance Theater), KimBámbula Productions (Afro-Cuban dance/music), Khmer Arts Academy (Cambodian Classical Dance), Garifuna American Heritage Foundation United as possible collaborators as well. 
   
   Each professional Teaching Artist will receive $500 per workshop, and each Partner will receive $500 for their administrative part in the collaboration.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  Artist Fees – Artists chosen for this program represent a wide variety of
  genres & cultures, ranging from acclaimed, emerging talent to seasoned,
  award-winning artists. = $1800 per concert.
   
   Teaching Artists and Partner Costs– The teaching artists will lead the interactive workshops developed specifically for the day, and Community Partners will present activities prior to the scheduled performance. Incorporating and highlighting the cultural significance of the music into the workshop and activities will be emphasized. Teaching artists =$500 per concert. Community Partner = $500 per concert.
   
   Sound & Lights: Sound and lights production of each concert will come to $750 per concert. This number is determined by Levitt’s experience of what the actual cost is for sound production in doing these shows. 
   Marketing and Promotion – The Levitt children’s programs are established and well attended. However, marketing and promotion will be paramount to make clear that the experiential workshops are a new addition to the existing program. We will create promotional materials in Spanish and English, and use street teams to distribute flyers and brochures. Radio advertisements will be made through KPCC, KCRW, and KPFK to promote this program to a wide audience. Flyers will be given to local community centers and schools. The program will be publicized on each local Levitt website, as well as email marketed . Marketing = $500 per show. 
   
   Supplies and Materials – Based upon attendance counts, supplies will be purchased for approximately 1,000 children at each concert to use in creating their arts experience. This may include purchasing instruments to distribute, such as recorders, flutaphones or portable drums, or purchasing materials to create shakers or puppets, etc. = $500 per show
   
   Administrative Oversight and Coordination – Staff at Levitt Pavilion Greater Los Angeles & Pasadena will ensure that the program meets the program objectives. We will be responsible for devising the program, hiring the teaching artists, engaging the Community Partners in creating activities, obtaining the materials required, and ensuring that the participating children’s experiences are fun, interesting and educational.
   
   The project will cost approximately $101,000. The additional costs have been committed to be covered by our Board of Directors.

How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  For us, “Play” is a serious endeavor. Play is more than an opportunity to let
  loose, it is essential to childhood development and provides an open and free
  environment for children and adults alike to make mistakes, and to explore and
  engage with others.
    
   Our venues are not only directly accessible by train, but as parks, they are situated right in the middle of diverse communities. We hope to engage the people of these neighborhoods to help us activate our parks through play. 
    
   Initially, our attendance numbers and the data we collect from our surveys will measure our success. Access in itself is a major goal for this project, and providing the opportunity for a wide range of people, from our local communities to play through the arts is a feat on its own. However, the lasting success of our programs will be seen in the future, when the children that we engage in our parks become adults.
    
   Our hope is that through our efforts today, the next generation will appreciate the value of community spaces activated through shared arts experiences. The seeds planted today will hopefully grow into future investment in the arts. In 2050, all Angelenos will have ample opportunities to participate in high quality performing arts experiences. The citizens of Greater Los Angeles will be inspired by and appreciate how music and arts participation makes us all; more tolerant, innovative and engaged. This appreciation and understanding will play a prominent role in furthering Los Angeles as a center for diversity, culture and public engagement in the arts.
