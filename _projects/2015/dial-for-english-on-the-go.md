   Low literacy skills are directly linked to higher unemployment rates, lower incomes, and poor health that impact the entire household. In fact, a child who does not read proficiently by the 3rd grade is four times more likely to leave high school without a diploma.

Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Cell-Ed anticipates two challenges: reaching hard to reach households and
  offsetting costs for learners. 
   
   To address the first, we rely on a cascading network of service organizations that serve families with low levels of literacy. For LA, this includes WIC LA, LAPL, SEIU and NDWA and our content partners, Centro for Latino Literacy, Building Skills Partnership and UCLA.
   
   Our second challenge is to underwrite the costs of Cell-Ed. Currently we provide Cell-Ed as a service for a $50 per user license fee. Clients include the states of New York and Texas who buy licenses for low literate and immigrant learners. The LA 2050 Learn grant would underwrite delivery of Cell-Ed to 1000 households. Cell-Ed is always free to learners with unlimited talk and text plans, but for those without (<5%), we will work with telecom partners to offset costs (e.g. MetroPCS).
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Cell-Ed has a two-part monitoring and evaluation approach. For all of our
  partners, we:
   
   1) Evaluate Learning Outcomes: We expect that learners will demonstrate increased literacy after completing the Cell-ED program and provide pre- and post-test assessments.
   
   2) Monitor Learners’ Experiences with Cell-ED: It is important to monitor learners’ experiences with Cell-Ed and be responsive to their needs. Fortunately, the platform includes a learner management system that automatically captures important data points. Key Performance Indicators include: 
   
   • Average error per module
   • Time to completion
   • Number of coach interventions per learner
   • Logging when learners access Cell-ED 
   
   3) In addition, each learner is tracked by a Cell-Ed live learning coach who gets feedback via live calls and two way texting and who tracks progress for each learner, including attainment and well being assessments.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Cell-Ed is the only education technology provider to deliver literacy and
  English language instruction for Spanish-speaking populations with low
  literacy levels, over any type of mobile phone. 
   
   Other education technology providers, both private and public, deliver Internet or data dependent programs over computers or mobile apps, which limits access. For example, USALearns delivers basic ESL training for immigrant populations, but is English only and web-based. DuoLingo, another popular provider of language learning, offers Spanish speakers English lessons for free but is only available via app or web and for learners who have higher levels of education. 
   
   For those that are not technology dependent, literacy and English language learning options span library systems, private and public schools, non-profit organization and employers. The single largest provider - Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) operates more than a dozen literacy related programs servicing over 400,000. What these programs have in common are low completion rates (~20-50%), due to students missing classes due to work and childcare demands, lack of time, sleep, confidence, and transportation
   
   Cell-Ed is unique for a number of reasons, including that it’s:
   
   Proven effective for low-literacy learners- In our LA County pilot, learners leaped two years – in about four months – when they completed our adult literacy course. They also showed high adherence (75%) to the course, a startling jump from classroom settings
   (20- 50%) and gained the confidence to learn more.
   
   Easy to use - A learner 1) calls a Cell-Ed number 2) listens to a teacher’s voice lesson with corresponding text and 3) texts back responses, receives additional help from a live coach or continues with the next lesson. 
   
   Accessible – Learners are far more likely to own a basic cell phone than a computer. Internet access is not required for Cell-Ed’s programs. And being forced to commute to a classroom or community center to use a computer can cause the same transportation and time obstacles that so often stymie classroom-based learning.
   
   Empowering –Cell-Ed provides private learning system paced to you. Graduates state that they have a sense of personal achievement and pride as well as feeling better educated and more confident when filling out job applications, tax forms and other documents.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  An LA2050 grant would allow Cell-Ed to offer and distribute English on the Go
  to 1000 households with low literacy levels in Los Angeles County through
  ready partners, free of cost:
   
   ● Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) Los Angeles: Cell-Ed would expand reach and access to literacy programs to support 500 families affiliated with WIC LA, a federally-funded health and nutrition program serving over 300,000 per month across 60 centers in LA County. WIC LA reaches two-thirds of LA County children ages 0-5, 82% Latino. 
   
   PHFE WIC Program
   12781 Schabarum Avenue
   Irwindale, CA 91706
   www.phfewic.org
   
   ● Los Angeles Public Library: Cell-Ed would provide access and support to 200 families associated with its Adult literacy programs. 
   
   Los Angeles Public Libraries
   Adult Literacy & Volunteer Services
   630 West Fifth Street • Los Angeles • CA • 90071
   http://www.lapl.org/adult-literacy
   
   ● Service Employees International Union (SEIU) - Cell-Ed would provide access and support to 200 members of the SEIU United Service Workers West LA branch.
   
   SEIU USW West
   828 West Washington Boulevard
   Los Angeles, CA 90015
   http://www.seiu-usww.org/about
   
   ● National Domestic Workers Alliance (NDWA)– Cell-Ed would provide access and support to 100 members of its LA affiliate –IDEPSA – of the largest network of nannies, households and caregivers.
   
   IDEPSCA Instituto de Educacion Popular del Sur de California serving Household workers, Day labor program
   http://www.idepsca.org
   
   Under the LA2050 grant, Cell-Ed would provide families associated with these partners access to Cell-Ed’s complete literacy and language courses for Spanish speakers, live learning support, and personalized completion certificates for any and all learners. For partner centers, Cell-Ed provides outreach materials, training for staff, support with recruitment, and additional bilingual tech and education support in the event they pursue a blended learning model.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  We have a four-pronged strategy for scaling once we reach 1000 households.
  First, we will work to expand our partnerships to reach even more households
  through our four partners (WIC LA, LAPL, SEIU, NDWA). 
   
   Second, we will work to expand partnership with additional organizations that directly serve households with low-literacy in LA County, including: 
   
   1) Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) Adult Education Office
   2) Head Start-State Preschool division of the Los Angeles County Office of Education 
   3) Southern California Library Literacy Network (SCLLN) 
   4) 2-1-1- United Way-funded helpline that connects people in need with essential health and human services
   
   Third, we will seek to become an approved provider recommended by the Outreach and Technical Assistance Network for Adult Educators (OTAN) for California. Currently, we have this state level status with the State of New York that licenses Cell-Ed for immigrants associated with their 27 Office for New American Opportunity Centers. In addition, Cell-Ed is an approved distance learner for the State of Texas, which provides Cell-Ed access to adult schools and community based organizations serving Spanish- speaking populations. 
   
   Fourth and lastly, to promote adult literacy and the need for more focus on this high need area in the United States, Cell-Ed is submitting an application to the adult literacy XPRIZE. Cell-Ed had the great fortune of being on the visioneering committee for the prize and continues to believe we need more players in the space to provide mobile learning pathways for all.
   
   To conclude, LA is our home and we can think of no better way to serve our region than by bridging access divides to education and wellbeing. In LA County, over one-third of adults still lack “prose literacy” and cannot read a newspaper. Over 54% speak English less than well and only 5% have access to classes. Compounding the problem, adult school funding has been slashed by more than half in our county. Cell-Ed is one way to reach households with the critical language and life skills they demand. LA2050, we urge you to help us reach these households on their terms.
