title: T4T.org’s Mobile Makers Space with ReImagined Resources

project_summary: >-
  T4T.org’s Pop-Up Makers’ Spaces using ReImagined Resources will arrive in some
  of LA’s most underserved communities. On a Saturday or Sunday morning a truck
  will pull up, drop down the sides, set up the tables and future inventors,
  scientists and researchers, from the local community go to work. These
  children are welcome to create, build and experiment. We will bring Laser
  cutters, 3D Printers and more, all the tools these young inventors need to
  realize what their imagination can inspire.
Please specify below: 'Parks, community centers and Title 1 Schools in LA County.'

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Our T4T.org traveling Makers Space will be filled with ReImagined Resources!
  The items we carry are being discarded by local manufacturers and would be
  headed for Landfill if we didn’t exist. Having a traveling Makers Space allows
  us to bring Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Math (STEAM) Education
  to communities were this has only been a dream. We will have pop-up Makers
  Space in Parks and School-yards around Los Angeles focusing our efforts in
  neighborhoods with Title 1 Schools with more than 90% free and reduces lunch
  programs. We wont necessarily be doing this on the school yard exclusively it
  will simply be the way we identify the communities on our calendar. We will
  have Saturday and Sunday pop-up Makers Spaces in some of the most unlikely
  spots around town!
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Our obstacle will be obtaining permits and we have already begun a
  relationship with the Public Works Department of LA City. We will reach out to
  them to make sure we are in compliance with the City before we set out. We
  also will need at least two staff at each pop-up event and will need to bring
  on extra staff. We will also be looking for volunteer groups to help with
  these events so there will be plenty of helping hands at each open Makers
  experience around town.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We will conduct pre-then-post surveys with everyone who participates. Parents,
  young inventors, anyone who takes place will be asked to answer a few basic
  questions when they arrive about their level of interest in STEAM activities
  and then they will answer the same questions as they complete their invention.
  These findings will be compared to similar surveys we do in schools that have
  T4T.org inspired project based learning and the combined data will be
  available to schools, press and the educational community at large through
  open access data banks and research servers.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  We have not been able to find anyone doing this in Los Angeles. Our unique
  approach is based on the fact that we use material that would have been headed
  to Landfill! In doing this we inspire environmental stewardship in our next
  generation of inventors and scientists.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  We would be doing this with our current list of manufacturers who supply us
  with material. None of the budget will go to that. The $100,000, should we be
  lucky enough to be awarded the grant, would go toward the vehicle, staff and
  outreach to communities. The material we use will be donated from
  manufacturers who receive a tax receipt as our thank you for their donations.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  At T4T.org we are use to working within a budget. We will buy the truck and
  hire the staff we need to get started. We will rely on volunteers and
  manufacturers donations to make up the difference. We don’t go over budget
  because we don’t have anywhere to draw the money from if we did go over
  budget. We have learned to work within our means.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  PLAY Budget $100,000.00 
   
   Vehicle 
   14-passenger van  35,000.00
   Signage  2,500.00
   Internal Build-Out (shelving, etc.)  2,500.00
   Salaries

   Inventory Manager (part-time)  10, 000.00
   3D Printer/Laser cutter/Tools 10,000.00
   Visitations 
   $500 per set up x 30 - 
   Facilitation/Replenishment  15,000.00
   Gas/Mileage  5,000.00
   
   TOTAL  $100,000.00
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  We see this as a pilot project and with the data collected and successes
  measured we will approach a car company to support more vehicles as well as
  approach foundations to help us staff future vehicles. We will also write a
  guidebook for any other community that is interested in starting a T4T.org
  style traveling Makers Space using ReImagined Resources from their community.
