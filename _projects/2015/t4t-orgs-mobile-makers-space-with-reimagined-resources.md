title: T4T.org’s Mobile Makers Space with ReImagined Resources
project_summary: >-
  T4T.org’s Pop-Up Makers’ Spaces using ReImagined Resources will arrive in some
  of LA’s most underserved communities. On a Saturday or Sunday morning a truck
  will pull up, drop down the sides, set up the tables and future inventors,
  scientists and researchers, from the local community go to work. These
  children are welcome to create, build and experiment. We will bring Laser
  cutters, 3D Printers and more, all the tools these young inventors need to
  realize what their imagination can inspire.

    Our T4T.org traveling Makers Space will be filled with ReImagined Resources!
    The items we carry are being discarded by local manufacturers and would be
    headed for Landfill if we didn’t exist. Having a traveling Makers Space
    allows us to bring Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Math (STEAM)
    Education to communities were this has only been a dream. We will have
    pop-up Makers Space in Parks and School-yards around Los Angeles focusing
    our efforts in neighborhoods with Title 1 Schools with more than 90% free
    and reduces lunch programs. We wont necessarily be doing this on the school
    yard exclusively it will simply be the way we identify the communities on
    our calendar. We will have Saturday and Sunday pop-up Makers Spaces in some
    of the most unlikely spots around town!
  How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
    - Money (financial capital)
    - Volunteers/staff (human capital)
    - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
    - 'Infrastructure (building/space/vehicles, etc.)'
    - Education/training

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    Our obstacle will be obtaining permits and we have already begun a
    relationship with the Public Works Department of LA City. We will reach out
    to them to make sure we are in compliance with the City before we set out.
    We also will need at least two staff at each pop-up event and will need to
    bring on extra staff. We will also be looking for volunteer groups to help
    with these events so there will be plenty of helping hands at each open
    Makers experience around town.
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    We will conduct pre-then-post surveys with everyone who participates.
    Parents, young inventors, anyone who takes place will be asked to answer a
    few basic questions when they arrive about their level of interest in STEAM
    activities and then they will answer the same questions as they complete
    their invention. These findings will be compared to similar surveys we do in
    schools that have T4T.org inspired project based learning and the combined
    data will be available to schools, press and the educational community at
    large through open access data banks and research servers.
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    We have not been able to find anyone doing this in Los Angeles.  Our unique
    approach is based on the fact that we use material that would have been
    headed to Landfill! In doing this we inspire environmental stewardship in
    our next generation of inventors and scientists.
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    We would be doing this with our current list of manufacturers who supply us
    with material. None of the budget will go to that. The $100,000, should we
    be lucky enough to be awarded the grant, would go toward the vehicle, staff
    and outreach to communities. The material we use will be donated from
    manufacturers who receive a tax receipt as our thank you for their
    donations.
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    At T4T.org we are use to working within a budget. We will buy the truck and
    hire the staff we need to get started. We will rely on volunteers and
    manufacturers donations to make up the difference. We don’t go over budget
    because we don’t have anywhere to draw the money from if we did go over
    budget. We have learned to work within our means. 
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "PLAY Budget                                             $100,000.00\t\r\n\r\nVehicle\t\r\n14-passenger van\t                                       35,000.00\r\nSignage\t                                                         2,500.00\r\nInternal Build-Out (shelving, etc.)\t         2,500.00\r\nSalaries\t\r\nOutreach Coordinator (part-time)\t       20,000.00\r\nInventory Manager (part-time)\t               10, 000.00\r\n3D Printer/Laser cutter/Tools                      10,000.00\r\nVisitations\t\r\n$500 per set up x 30 - \r\nFacilitation/Replenishment\t                       15,000.00\r\nGas/Mileage\t                                                 5,000.00\r\n\r\nTOTAL\t                                                    $100,000.00"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    We see this as a pilot project and with the data collected and successes
    measured we will approach a car company to support more vehicles as well as
    approach foundations to help us staff future vehicles. We will also write a
    guidebook for any other community that is interested in starting a T4T.org
    style traveling Makers Space using ReImagined Resources from their
    community.
