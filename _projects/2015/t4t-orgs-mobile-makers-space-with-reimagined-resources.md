title: T4T.org’s Mobile Makers Space with ReImagined Resources
project_summary: >-
  T4T.org’s Pop-Up Makers’ Spaces using ReImagined Resources will arrive in some
  of LA’s most underserved communities. On a Saturday or Sunday morning a truck
  will pull up, drop down the sides, set up the tables and future inventors,
  scientists and researchers, from the local community go to work. These
  children are welcome to create, build and experiment. We will bring Laser
  cutters, 3D Printers and more, all the tools these young inventors need to
  realize what their imagination can inspire.

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to play.: >-
    Our T4T.org traveling Makers Space will be filled with ReImagined Resources!
    The items we carry are being discarded by local manufacturers and would be
    headed for Landfill if we didn’t exist. Having a traveling Makers Space
    allows us to bring Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Math (STEAM)
    Education to communities were this has only been a dream. We will have
    pop-up Makers Space in Parks and School-yards around Los Angeles focusing
    our efforts in neighborhoods with Title 1 Schools with more than 90% free
    and reduces lunch programs. We wont necessarily be doing this on the school
    yard exclusively it will simply be the way we identify the communities on
    our calendar. We will have Saturday and Sunday pop-up Makers Spaces in some
    of the most unlikely spots around town!
  How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
    - Money (financial capital)
    - Volunteers/staff (human capital)
    - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
    - 'Infrastructure (building/space/vehicles, etc.)'
    - Education/training
    - 'Technical infrastructure (computers, etc.)'
    - Community outreach
    - Network/relationship support
    - Quality improvement research
  How do you plan to use these resources to make change?:
    - Conduct research
    - Engage residents and stakeholders
    - Expand a pilot or a program
    - Mobilize for systems change
  Where will you be working?:
    - County of Los Angeles
    - 'Parks, community centers and Title 1 Schools in LA County.'
  How will your proposal improve the following “Play” metrics?:
    - Access to open space and park facilities
    - Residents within 1⁄4 mile of a park (Dream Metric)
    - Number of parks with intergenerational play opportunities (Dream Metric)
    - Number (and quality) of informal spaces for play (Dream Metric)
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    We will conduct pre-then-post surveys with everyone who participates.
    Parents, young inventors, anyone who takes place will be asked to answer a
    few basic questions when they arrive about their level of interest in STEAM
    activities and then they will answer the same questions as they complete
    their invention. These findings will be compared to similar surveys we do in
    schools that have T4T.org inspired project based learning and the combined
    data will be available to schools, press and the educational community at
    large through open access data banks and research servers.
