title: ReveaLALA
project_summary: "ReveaLALA is a series of interventions that highlight and reframe important visual depictions of Latino culture in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nFrom public sculptures and iconic buildings to road signs and street vendors, each element will literally be‘reframed’ with a simple color panel placed behind it – momentarily taking the piece out of its surroundings and allowing the viewer see it afresh and to rethink its meaning."

  'In one to three sentences, please describe your proposal.': "ReveaLALA is a series of interventions that highlight and reframe important visual depictions of Latino culture in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nFrom public sculptures and iconic buildings to road signs and street vendors, each element will literally be‘reframed’ with a simple color panel placed behind it – momentarily taking the piece out of its surroundings and allowing the viewer see it afresh and to rethink its meaning."
  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "'ReveaLALA' is a series of interventions that highlight and reframe important visual depictions of Latino culture in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nFrom public sculptures and iconic buildings to road signs and street vendors, each element will literally be‘reframed’ with a simple color panel placed behind it – momentarily taking the piece out of its surroundings and allowing the viewer see it afresh and to rethink its meaning.\r\n\r\nOn the reverse of each panel will be a formal description of it’s history and also less formal statements from the local community - that speak to what these icons mean on a more individual, contemporary, and personal level to those who live with them everyday. A website will be produced to announce each intervention and direct the public to their whereabouts in the city.\r\n\r\nWe will also create a poster that doubles as a kit for people to create their own 'frames. They will be able to cut use panels of the projects themed color and start 're-framing' places and things that are significant in their own lives. They are encouraged to photograph and post images to our Tumblr account where they will be displayed. This poster will be sent out to schools and distributed throughout the community.\r\n\r\nThere will be a series of educational events and happenings based around the project, including:\r\n\r\n1. Poetry readings and community gatherings at the ReveaLALA interventions to celebrate their\r\nimportance in the city\r\n\r\n2. Phone App with discovery map allowing the user to go on a self-guided tour and learn more about each ReveaLALA intervention\r\n\r\n3. DIY kit for schools and institutions which allows the user to identify their own Latino place of\r\nimportance and add to the series of ReveaLALA interventions\r\n\r\n4. Instagram social media page for users around the city to add documentation of their experiences\r\nat the ReveaLALA interventions.\r\n\r\nUltimately we hope to work with the community and LA City to create several permanent plaques to celebrate specifics and significant places of Latino culture or heritage."
