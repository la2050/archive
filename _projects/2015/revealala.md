  ReveaLALA is a series of interventions that highlight and reframe important
  visual depictions of Latino culture in Los Angeles.
   
   From public sculptures and iconic buildings to road signs and street vendors, each element will literally be‘reframed’ with a simple color panel placed behind it – momentarily taking the piece out of its surroundings and allowing the viewer see it afresh and to rethink its meaning.
