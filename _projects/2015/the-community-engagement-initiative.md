Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "The Community Engagement Initiative is a comprehensive Community Engagement Program with the vision that local government is responsive to the needs of the residents and Angelenos are contributing members to their community.\r\n\r\nTo make our vision of LA in 2050 a reality, the Operations-South Bureau Community Stakeholder Collaboration will host a series of 20 community Town Hall Meetings, Public Gathering Cultural Events and Community Resource Fairs which will provide opportunity and tools for Angelenos to engage and interact with other Angelenos.\r\n\r\nTown Hall Meetings featuring a panel of local government decision makers will open the lines of communication facilitating the easy flow of people and ideas and give Angelenos a platform to express their needs and critique government’s responsiveness to their needs.  \r\n\r\nAs a result, there is expected to be an increased interest in volunteerism, a peeked interest in Neighborhood Councils, a positive change in our region’s voting rate, and the government’s responsiveness to the needs of residents.  \r\n\r\nPublic Gatherings/Street Fairs/Cultural Events by providing an opportunity for Angelenos to engage we are instilling a sense of community and providing a place for members to belong.  \r\n\r\nAs a result, there is expected to be an increase in social media friends, and increased use of transit and an increase in adult social and emotional support.\r\n\r\nCommunity Resource Fairs bringing government to the community places the community on a fair playing ground.  By making quality of life and community resources available the community is being empowered to contribute meaningfully to the civic life process.\r\n\r\nAs a result, there is expected to be an increase in volunteerism, the use of transit and the tools to build a better future.  \r\n\r\nThis is an \"evidence based practice\" that examines existing evidence based community engagement strategies and assesses how existing community resources, services and programs are being utilized to coordinate these services in an effective and efficient manner.\r\n"
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "A summative evaluation will be conducted to document the results of the program.  Specific goals of the program will be identified and the degree of accomplishment of those goals documented.  \r\n\r\nThe results will point to changes that should be made in the program in order to improve it in subsequent implementations.  \r\n\r\nThe results will specify program status and conditions for accountability purposes.  \r\n\r\nThe results will also be used as a needs assessment for the subsequent planning of changes in a program to the introduction of new programs and interventions.\r\n"

  - Money (financial capital)
