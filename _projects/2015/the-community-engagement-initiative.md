  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "The Community Engagement Initiative is a comprehensive Community Engagement Program with the vision that local government is responsive to the needs of the residents and Angelenos are contributing members to their community.\r\n\r\nTo make our vision of LA in 2050 a reality, the Operations-South Bureau Community Stakeholder Collaboration will host a series of 20 community Town Hall Meetings, Public Gathering Cultural Events and Community Resource Fairs which will provide opportunity and tools for Angelenos to engage and interact with other Angelenos.\r\n\r\nTown Hall Meetings featuring a panel of local government decision makers will open the lines of communication facilitating the easy flow of people and ideas and give Angelenos a platform to express their needs and critique government’s responsiveness to their needs.  \r\n\r\nAs a result, there is expected to be an increased interest in volunteerism, a peeked interest in Neighborhood Councils, a positive change in our region’s voting rate, and the government’s responsiveness to the needs of residents.  \r\n\r\nPublic Gatherings/Street Fairs/Cultural Events by providing an opportunity for Angelenos to engage we are instilling a sense of community and providing a place for members to belong.  \r\n\r\nAs a result, there is expected to be an increase in social media friends, and increased use of transit and an increase in adult social and emotional support.\r\n\r\nCommunity Resource Fairs bringing government to the community places the community on a fair playing ground.  By making quality of life and community resources available the community is being empowered to contribute meaningfully to the civic life process.\r\n\r\nAs a result, there is expected to be an increase in volunteerism, the use of transit and the tools to build a better future.  \r\n\r\nThis is an \"evidence based practice\" that examines existing evidence based community engagement strategies and assesses how existing community resources, services and programs are being utilized to coordinate these services in an effective and efficient manner.\r\n"

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "Lack of participation by certain community groups.\r\n\r\nRecognize individual contributions to the success of every project, achieve small wins that promote consistent progress and build commitment, and enlist other in a common vision by appealing to their values, interests, hopes and dreams.\r\n"
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "A summative evaluation will be conducted to document the results of the program.  Specific goals of the program will be identified and the degree of accomplishment of those goals documented.  \r\n\r\nThe results will point to changes that should be made in the program in order to improve it in subsequent implementations.  \r\n\r\nThe results will specify program status and conditions for accountability purposes.  \r\n\r\nThe results will also be used as a needs assessment for the subsequent planning of changes in a program to the introduction of new programs and interventions.\r\n"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    There may be other organizations doing similar work, but in the
    implementation of our approach, we are not afraid to experiment, take risks
    and learn from the accompanying mistakes.

How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "This collaboration is made up of local city government, clergy, community stakeholders, grassroots and non-profit organizations.\r\n\r\nThe funds will be managed by one entity and there will not be a payment to collaborative partners except for reimbursement on behalf of the collaborative for pre-approved collaboration events.\r\n"
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    The Community Engagement Plan will be run with the $100,000 awarded and any
    additional expenses over the allotment will be absorbed by the
    collaboration.
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Projected Budget \r\n\r\nFacilities Rental / Insurance  $10,000\r\n\r\nRefreshments\t$25,000\r\n\r\nPermits\t\t$5,000\r\n\r\nAdvertisement\t$10,000\r\n\r\nPhotocopying / Printing \t$20,000\t\t\r\n\r\nEquipment Rental (Tables/Chairs/Sound System)\t$15,000\r\n\r\nPromotional Items (T-shirts/Banners, etc)\t $15,000\r\n\r\nNote: A Budget of $5,000 per event \r\n\r\nThere are no personnel costs associated with this proposal and 100% of the funds will be used for community engagement"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "We will scale the success of our proposal by the defining objectives, the collection of data and the evaluation of the data collected.\r\n\r\nAnalyzing our goals and objectives will help ensure that when setting up our reports the right questions are being asked.  The mission of the program will be clearly defined and for each program we will know how to measure its success.\r\n\r\nOutcome management systems will be evaluated regularly to ensure they are meeting the needs of the organization and the funder."
