  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: "Working families in Los Angeles face the challenges of managing insufficient money, finding affordable housing, raising healthy families, and preparing for the future.  The region lacks adequate well-paying jobs in growth sectors; this lack of opportunity is compounded for low-income and minority households by the poor education system.  For many households, entrepreneurship is a primary route to financial stability.  \r\n\r\nSmall business ownership creates opportunities for families living in poverty to pursue stability and economic mobility, while creating jobs in their communities.  If one in three microenterprises hired an additional person, the U.S. would return to full employment; if every microbusiness generated $5,000 more annually, this would add $20B to the economy.  Yet, every day, 8,000 small businesses in the U.S. are turned down for a loan; 50% of small businesses fail, often due to an inability to access the capital they need to grow because of language and cultural barriers, limited assets, low capital needs, and credit issues. \r\n\r\nThe mainstream financial industry offers little to help small businesses access the capital they need to grow and thrive, especially in places like East LA, Boyle Heights, and Downtown.  The fast-growing alternative financing industry offers access to fast cash, but often at a high cost that can strangle a small business’ cash flow.  Opportunity Fund is filling this financing gap by pioneering a new approach that combines technology, efficiency, market knowledge, and impact measurement to help entrepreneurs build sustainable enterprises and a better life for themselves and their families.  By deploying affordable, responsible microloans to underserved entrepreneurs, our microlending program helps drive small business growth and job creation in the communities that need it most.  \r\n\r\nWe target entrepreneurs who operate their businesses (and, in many cases, live their lives) outside the financial mainstream.  In LA, our borrowers are 98% minority, with an average median household income of less than $25,000.  These clients have a 90% business survival rate; each loan we originate creates or sustains 2.5 jobs on average.      \r\n\r\nThrough the LA2050 Challenge, we seek to scale our microlending in LA’s underserved communities to serve 700 small business owners in 2016—creating and retaining 1,800 jobs and generating more than $25 million in annual economic activity through new spending, wages, and tax revenues.  \r\n"

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "The credit crunch, combined with advances in financial technology and “Big Data,” has created an alternative financing industry that offers entrepreneurs access to fast cash but often at a very high cost.  Merchant cash advances, in particular, offer quick money, but ensure repayment by taking a fixed portion of up to 50% of every credit/debit card sale—with annualized interest rates reaching 170%.  \r\n\r\nOpportunity Fund is finding an increasing number of small business owners who come to us with multiple “stacked” cash advances that are squeezing daily cash flow to such an extent that the business may not survive.  Unfortunately, many of these stacked businesses have such constricted cash flow that they cannot qualify for an Opportunity Fund loan.  To address this challenge, we seek to prevent entrepreneurs from taking on a cash advance in the first place by getting to them before the merchant cash advance providers do—through outreach, partnerships, and borrower education."
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Opportunity Fund uses a variety of performance indicators to measure the success of our small business clients. In the short term, we track the number of applicants and number, dollar volume, and type of loans originated, as well as client characteristics such as income, ethnicity, gender, credit score, household size, type of business, sales, and number of employees.  \r\n\r\nOver time, we measure the impact of our loans by tracking changes in borrower household income; growth of business sales and income; job creation; and business survival rates.  We also gather data related to client satisfaction and confidence in running their business.  \r\n\r\nWe recently launched a multi-year effort to evaluate the longer-term impact of microloans on businesses, households, and the community at large.  This study will gather and analyze data from thousands of microlending clients to deepen our understanding of the impact of a microloan on key economic and household measures.\r\n"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "LA is home to a number of Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) that offer a range of economic development services, including access to capital.  Local microlenders exist on a continuum that runs from the smallest microloans (offered by Grameen America for household and business purposes) to the financial mainstream, represented by local banks.  Among the region’s CDFIs, Opportunity Fund is one of the only microlenders focused on scale with the ability to originate 700 loans in LA (and 2,000 state-wide) in a year.  Our loans range from $2,500 to $100,000, with an average loan size of $18,000.  Some of our peer CDFIs focus on business development services, and originate loans on a smaller scale as part of these programs.  Valley Economic Development Center (VEDC) operates at a comparable size to Opportunity Fund in LA but focuses on larger loans of $100,000 to $700,000 to much larger enterprises.  \r\n\r\nBy providing microloans to smaller businesses, Opportunity Fund is able to ensure the full range of entrepreneurs in LA has access to affordable financing. In addition, we offer our unique EasyPay loan--an innovative automated loan repayment system that allows borrowers to repay loans through a small, fixed percentage of daily credit/debit card sales.  \r\n\r\nAs noted above, Opportunity Fund also competes against high-cost alternative financing products.  For small business owners who cannot qualify for a traditional bank loan, there are few good alternatives.  Credit cards provide access to financing to invest in a growing business, but can leave entrepreneurs with high balances and poor credit scores.  Payday lenders offer fast cash, but at a perilously high interest rate.  Opportunity Fund’s most significant competition is from merchant cash advances (MCAs) and other unregulated small business financing products. The merchant cash advance industry consists of non-bank companies whose products are unregulated, and who do not report to credit bureaus. Despite charging exorbitant rates, MCA providers hold $1 to $2 billion in outstanding financing to small businesses.  Through EasyPay, Opportunity Fund is the only nonprofit lender in the country that is able to provide an affordable alternative to merchant cash advances that incorporates their convenience and flexibility, but with far greater benefit to small business owners."
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "Opportunity Fund works with a range of partners to reach and serve LA’s entrepreneurs.\r\n•\tBanks:  We have built a network of bank representatives to facilitate referrals of clients who have been declined for a loan.  \r\n•\tVendors:  We leverage relationships with business services providers to raise awareness and generate referrals, including commercial vehicle dealers, tax advisors, CPAs, and equipment vendors (manufacturers of food trucks, dry cleaning equipment, etc.).  \r\n•\tCommunity partners:  We have referral relationships with organizations that serve local low-income and disadvantaged communities, such as Vermont Slauson Economic Development Corporation and City of LA Business Source Offices.\r\n\r\nFunds from the LA2050 Challenge would support Opportunity Fund staff in building and nurturing these critical partnerships, but funding would not go directly to partners.\r\n"
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': "It will cost approximately $2.5 million to deploy $10 million into LA's underserved small business community.  A $100,000 grant through LA2050 will provide critical funding to support the outreach, underwriting, advising, and loan servicing activities needed to help LA’s entrepreneurs grow their business and create and retain jobs in their communities.  Earned income from loan interest and fees will provide an additional $1,500,000 towards this project, and Opportunity Fund plans to secure the remaining $900,000 from local institutional and individual funders (including the Parsons Foundation, Weingart Foundation, California Community Foundation, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and others). \r\n\r\nOverall, Opportunity Fund is a financially sound organization with strong cash reserves.  Given our strong track record of social impact—and the growing recognition of the importance of access to capital in helping underserved small business owners create jobs and spur economic growth—we remain confident of our ability to secure the funds we need to scale microlending, expand our impact in LA, and fulfill our mission.  To meet the funding challenges ahead, we will rely on our growing base of supporters, board members who help expand our network, and our reputation as a microfinance leader and innovator.\r\n"
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
    Opportunity Fund will use a portion of LA2050 grant funds ($75,000) to cover
    the “people” costs of deploying capital to underserved entrepreneurs. 
    Specifically, these funds will help pay salaries for Opportunity Fund’s
    microlending team to conduct the marketing, outreach, underwriting,
    advising, and loan servicing activities necessary to provide LA’s small
    business owners with access to financing and business support.  We will use
    additional LA2050 grant funds ($25,000) to invest in marketing strategies to
    reach our target population of low-income entrepreneurs.  Our marketing plan
    will include a multi-channel campaign integrating direct mail and mobile
    marketing with web-based strategies to educate small businesses about the
    true costs of merchant cash advances and offer Opportunity Fund as a better
    alternative.
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "Opportunity Fund has a vision that every small business in Los Angeles can access the financing and support needed to realize its full potential to create wealth and jobs.  While we have no illusions that our microloans can eradicate income inequality, we believe that strong investment in the region’s small business community can drive economic growth and create jobs that offer a living wage.  Many of LA’s most economically distressed neighborhoods are also hotbeds of entrepreneurial activity.  By providing access to capital and support for these small businesses, Opportunity Fund can help them grow and thrive—offering a path to financial stability and economic mobility.  \r\n\r\nOver the past five years, we have gone from originating 70 loans a year in LA to 70loans a month in the county.  We have achieved this growth by investing in the people and technology to reach and serve LA’s entrepreneurs.  We know that every loan we make creates and sustains more than two jobs, and that every $1 we invest results in a ripple effect that generates almost $2 in new economic activity.  By investing to scale in Los Angeles, Opportunity Fund is positioned to help thousands of small business owners access hundreds of millions of dollars in microloans by 2050—supporting job creation at significant scale while spurring economic growth in communities that need it most.   \r\n"

    answer: "Working families in Los Angeles face the challenges of managing insufficient money, finding affordable housing, raising healthy families, and preparing for the future.  The region lacks adequate well-paying jobs in growth sectors; this lack of opportunity is compounded for low-income and minority households by the poor education system.  For many households, entrepreneurship is a primary route to financial stability.  \r\n\r\nSmall business ownership creates opportunities for families living in poverty to pursue stability and economic mobility, while creating jobs in their communities.  If one in three microenterprises hired an additional person, the U.S. would return to full employment; if every microbusiness generated $5,000 more annually, this would add $20B to the economy.  Yet, every day, 8,000 small businesses in the U.S. are turned down for a loan; 50% of small businesses fail, often due to an inability to access the capital they need to grow because of language and cultural barriers, limited assets, low capital needs, and credit issues. \r\n\r\nThe mainstream financial industry offers little to help small businesses access the capital they need to grow and thrive, especially in places like East LA, Boyle Heights, and Downtown.  The fast-growing alternative financing industry offers access to fast cash, but often at a high cost that can strangle a small business’ cash flow.  Opportunity Fund is filling this financing gap by pioneering a new approach that combines technology, efficiency, market knowledge, and impact measurement to help entrepreneurs build sustainable enterprises and a better life for themselves and their families.  By deploying affordable, responsible microloans to underserved entrepreneurs, our microlending program helps drive small business growth and job creation in the communities that need it most.  \r\n\r\nWe target entrepreneurs who operate their businesses (and, in many cases, live their lives) outside the financial mainstream.  In LA, our borrowers are 98% minority, with an average median household income of less than $25,000.  These clients have a 90% business survival rate; each loan we originate creates or sustains 2.5 jobs on average.      \r\n\r\nThrough the LA2050 Challenge, we seek to scale our microlending in LA’s underserved communities to serve 700 small business owners in 2016—creating and retaining 1,800 jobs and generating more than $25 million in annual economic activity through new spending, wages, and tax revenues.  \r\n"
  - name: >-
      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "The credit crunch, combined with advances in financial technology and “Big Data,” has created an alternative financing industry that offers entrepreneurs access to fast cash but often at a very high cost.  Merchant cash advances, in particular, offer quick money, but ensure repayment by taking a fixed portion of up to 50% of every credit/debit card sale—with annualized interest rates reaching 170%.  \r\n\r\nOpportunity Fund is finding an increasing number of small business owners who come to us with multiple “stacked” cash advances that are squeezing daily cash flow to such an extent that the business may not survive.  Unfortunately, many of these stacked businesses have such constricted cash flow that they cannot qualify for an Opportunity Fund loan.  To address this challenge, we seek to prevent entrepreneurs from taking on a cash advance in the first place by getting to them before the merchant cash advance providers do—through outreach, partnerships, and borrower education."
  - name: Please explain how you will evaluate your work.
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Opportunity Fund uses a variety of performance indicators to measure the success of our small business clients. In the short term, we track the number of applicants and number, dollar volume, and type of loans originated, as well as client characteristics such as income, ethnicity, gender, credit score, household size, type of business, sales, and number of employees.  \r\n\r\nOver time, we measure the impact of our loans by tracking changes in borrower household income; growth of business sales and income; job creation; and business survival rates.  We also gather data related to client satisfaction and confidence in running their business.  \r\n\r\nWe recently launched a multi-year effort to evaluate the longer-term impact of microloans on businesses, households, and the community at large.  This study will gather and analyze data from thousands of microlending clients to deepen our understanding of the impact of a microloan on key economic and household measures.\r\n"

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "LA is home to a number of Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) that offer a range of economic development services, including access to capital.  Local microlenders exist on a continuum that runs from the smallest microloans (offered by Grameen America for household and business purposes) to the financial mainstream, represented by local banks.  Among the region’s CDFIs, Opportunity Fund is one of the only microlenders focused on scale with the ability to originate 700 loans in LA (and 2,000 state-wide) in a year.  Our loans range from $2,500 to $100,000, with an average loan size of $18,000.  Some of our peer CDFIs focus on business development services, and originate loans on a smaller scale as part of these programs.  Valley Economic Development Center (VEDC) operates at a comparable size to Opportunity Fund in LA but focuses on larger loans of $100,000 to $700,000 to much larger enterprises.  \r\n\r\nBy providing microloans to smaller businesses, Opportunity Fund is able to ensure the full range of entrepreneurs in LA has access to affordable financing. In addition, we offer our unique EasyPay loan--an innovative automated loan repayment system that allows borrowers to repay loans through a small, fixed percentage of daily credit/debit card sales.  \r\n\r\nAs noted above, Opportunity Fund also competes against high-cost alternative financing products.  For small business owners who cannot qualify for a traditional bank loan, there are few good alternatives.  Credit cards provide access to financing to invest in a growing business, but can leave entrepreneurs with high balances and poor credit scores.  Payday lenders offer fast cash, but at a perilously high interest rate.  Opportunity Fund’s most significant competition is from merchant cash advances (MCAs) and other unregulated small business financing products. The merchant cash advance industry consists of non-bank companies whose products are unregulated, and who do not report to credit bureaus. Despite charging exorbitant rates, MCA providers hold $1 to $2 billion in outstanding financing to small businesses.  Through EasyPay, Opportunity Fund is the only nonprofit lender in the country that is able to provide an affordable alternative to merchant cash advances that incorporates their convenience and flexibility, but with far greater benefit to small business owners."

    answer: "Opportunity Fund works with a range of partners to reach and serve LA’s entrepreneurs.\r\n•\tBanks:  We have built a network of bank representatives to facilitate referrals of clients who have been declined for a loan.  \r\n•\tVendors:  We leverage relationships with business services providers to raise awareness and generate referrals, including commercial vehicle dealers, tax advisors, CPAs, and equipment vendors (manufacturers of food trucks, dry cleaning equipment, etc.).  \r\n•\tCommunity partners:  We have referral relationships with organizations that serve local low-income and disadvantaged communities, such as Vermont Slauson Economic Development Corporation and City of LA Business Source Offices.\r\n\r\nFunds from the LA2050 Challenge would support Opportunity Fund staff in building and nurturing these critical partnerships, but funding would not go directly to partners.\r\n"

      How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "It will cost approximately $2.5 million to deploy $10 million into LA's underserved small business community.  A $100,000 grant through LA2050 will provide critical funding to support the outreach, underwriting, advising, and loan servicing activities needed to help LA’s entrepreneurs grow their business and create and retain jobs in their communities.  Earned income from loan interest and fees will provide an additional $1,500,000 towards this project, and Opportunity Fund plans to secure the remaining $900,000 from local institutional and individual funders (including the Parsons Foundation, Weingart Foundation, California Community Foundation, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and others). \r\n\r\nOverall, Opportunity Fund is a financially sound organization with strong cash reserves.  Given our strong track record of social impact—and the growing recognition of the importance of access to capital in helping underserved small business owners create jobs and spur economic growth—we remain confident of our ability to secure the funds we need to scale microlending, expand our impact in LA, and fulfill our mission.  To meet the funding challenges ahead, we will rely on our growing base of supporters, board members who help expand our network, and our reputation as a microfinance leader and innovator.\r\n"

      Opportunity Fund will use a portion of LA2050 grant funds ($75,000) to
      cover the “people” costs of deploying capital to underserved
      entrepreneurs.  Specifically, these funds will help pay salaries for
      Opportunity Fund’s microlending team to conduct the marketing, outreach,
      underwriting, advising, and loan servicing activities necessary to provide
      LA’s small business owners with access to financing and business support. 
      We will use additional LA2050 grant funds ($25,000) to invest in marketing
      strategies to reach our target population of low-income entrepreneurs. 
      Our marketing plan will include a multi-channel campaign integrating
      direct mail and mobile marketing with web-based strategies to educate
      small businesses about the true costs of merchant cash advances and offer
      Opportunity Fund as a better alternative.

    answer: "Opportunity Fund has a vision that every small business in Los Angeles can access the financing and support needed to realize its full potential to create wealth and jobs.  While we have no illusions that our microloans can eradicate income inequality, we believe that strong investment in the region’s small business community can drive economic growth and create jobs that offer a living wage.  Many of LA’s most economically distressed neighborhoods are also hotbeds of entrepreneurial activity.  By providing access to capital and support for these small businesses, Opportunity Fund can help them grow and thrive—offering a path to financial stability and economic mobility.  \r\n\r\nOver the past five years, we have gone from originating 70 loans a year in LA to 70loans a month in the county.  We have achieved this growth by investing in the people and technology to reach and serve LA’s entrepreneurs.  We know that every loan we make creates and sustains more than two jobs, and that every $1 we invest results in a ripple effect that generates almost $2 in new economic activity.  By investing to scale in Los Angeles, Opportunity Fund is positioned to help thousands of small business owners access hundreds of millions of dollars in microloans by 2050—supporting job creation at significant scale while spurring economic growth in communities that need it most.   \r\n"
