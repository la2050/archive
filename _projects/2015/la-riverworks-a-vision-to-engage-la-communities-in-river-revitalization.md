Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "In 2050, a revitalized LA River will serve as a main artery through the city, connecting many diverse and dynamic neighborhoods across the region. A greener and cleaner LA River will also strengthen a collective connection to our environment, providing all Angelenos with access to a precious source of recreation. To achieve this vision, jobs will be created and River-adjacent communities will see new investment. Our project is focused on helping existing residents connect with this process so they too can access the health and economic opportunities that the River promises.\r\n\r\nBy engaging low-income residents, families, and entrepreneurs in existing River-adjacent communities to voice their concerns and advocate for policies that support local needs as well as regional goals, SEACA and Public Counsel will ensure that the communities that live along the River today can continue to thrive alongside a revitalized River in 2050. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, our project will help make LA the best place to connect by:\r\n\r\n•\tEngaging a broad range of stakeholders—such as local residents, youth, seniors, and small business owners in multiple languages—around LA River revitalization proposals;\r\n•\tConnecting local government policies to the needs and priorities of River-adjacent communities;\r\n•\tPromoting transparency and meaningful community engagement in public planning and investment decisions;\r\n•\tLinking local residents and other stakeholders to the political process;\r\n•\tConnecting with a network of housing and economic development experts to evaluate and cultivate strategies to address the needs of local neighborhoods;\r\n•\tLeveraging the River restoration and related developments to expand access to opportunity for local residents and other stakeholders;\r\n•\tPromoting the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by decreasing the median travel time to work through local employment opportunities and increasing the amount of affordable housing in this transit-rich area; and\r\n•\tAddressing concerns about gentrification and displacement of residents and small businesses.\r\n\r\nA barricaded concrete River bisecting underserved neighborhoods has been an unfortunate image of disconnect and spatial inequity in the geography of our city. With this unprecedented investment, all that can change. But connection is key. Connecting local residents to opportunities starts with a connection to each other and to the investment process. "
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Outreach logs and sign-in sheets will track attendance and outreach to community members. We will also engage in an evaluation process with community members utilizing self-reported data collected at key intervals. This process will include individual surveys, group evaluations, and tracking progress towards meeting campaign goals.\r\n\r\n Outcomes will include:\r\n•\t150-300 residents, small business owners, and other stakeholders engaged\r\n•\t20-30 youth trained in advocacy and civic engagement\r\n•\tDevelopment of education and social media tools highlighting various issues related to the LA River restoration \r\n•\tDevelopment of a community-informed policy platform \r\n•\tCommunity members will report greater knowledge of LA River investment strategies and impacts\r\n•\tCommunity members will report greater knowledge of tools to advocate for policies that support accountable River investment\r\n•\tResidents will report greater connection to others across various River-adjacent communities"
