  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "In 2050, a revitalized LA River will serve as a main artery through the city, connecting many diverse and dynamic neighborhoods across the region. A greener and cleaner LA River will also strengthen a collective connection to our environment, providing all Angelenos with access to a precious source of recreation. To achieve this vision, jobs will be created and River-adjacent communities will see new investment. Our project is focused on helping existing residents connect with this process so they too can access the health and economic opportunities that the River promises.\r\n\r\nBy engaging low-income residents, families, and entrepreneurs in existing River-adjacent communities to voice their concerns and advocate for policies that support local needs as well as regional goals, SEACA and Public Counsel will ensure that the communities that live along the River today can continue to thrive alongside a revitalized River in 2050. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, our project will help make LA the best place to connect by:\r\n\r\n•\tEngaging a broad range of stakeholders—such as local residents, youth, seniors, and small business owners in multiple languages—around LA River revitalization proposals;\r\n•\tConnecting local government policies to the needs and priorities of River-adjacent communities;\r\n•\tPromoting transparency and meaningful community engagement in public planning and investment decisions;\r\n•\tLinking local residents and other stakeholders to the political process;\r\n•\tConnecting with a network of housing and economic development experts to evaluate and cultivate strategies to address the needs of local neighborhoods;\r\n•\tLeveraging the River restoration and related developments to expand access to opportunity for local residents and other stakeholders;\r\n•\tPromoting the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by decreasing the median travel time to work through local employment opportunities and increasing the amount of affordable housing in this transit-rich area; and\r\n•\tAddressing concerns about gentrification and displacement of residents and small businesses.\r\n\r\nA barricaded concrete River bisecting underserved neighborhoods has been an unfortunate image of disconnect and spatial inequity in the geography of our city. With this unprecedented investment, all that can change. But connection is key. Connecting local residents to opportunities starts with a connection to each other and to the investment process. "

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "Key decisions about the LA River are being made now. Federal funding may be allocated as early as next year; the city is considering the creation of a new financing district; the state recently announced a $25 million contribution to purchase a large undeveloped parcel; and Frank Gehry is now involved in a proposal to supplement existing revitalization plans. If communities don’t get engaged now, they likely will lose the opportunity to have input in the process. With our proven engagement strategies and understanding of land use and equitable development policies, we are confident that we can overcome this challenge.\r\n\r\nLocal investments are complex and involve many public sector decision makers. We may encounter jurisdictional overlap, as a number of agencies—local, state, and federal—have varying degrees of oversight and interest in the LA River. Our existing relationships with officials and our capacity for complex legal analysis will help us navigate these considerations. "
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Outreach logs and sign-in sheets will track attendance and outreach to community members. We will also engage in an evaluation process with community members utilizing self-reported data collected at key intervals. This process will include individual surveys, group evaluations, and tracking progress towards meeting campaign goals.\r\n\r\n Outcomes will include:\r\n•\t150-300 residents, small business owners, and other stakeholders engaged\r\n•\t20-30 youth trained in advocacy and civic engagement\r\n•\tDevelopment of education and social media tools highlighting various issues related to the LA River restoration \r\n•\tDevelopment of a community-informed policy platform \r\n•\tCommunity members will report greater knowledge of LA River investment strategies and impacts\r\n•\tCommunity members will report greater knowledge of tools to advocate for policies that support accountable River investment\r\n•\tResidents will report greater connection to others across various River-adjacent communities"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "While many public, private, and nonprofit stakeholders from different sectors have shared their input related to the LA River plans, few have engaged with or focused on the needs of existing River-adjacent communities. Lower-income residents of River-adjacent communities especially have struggled to actively impact the planning process due to a lack of capacity and expertise. \r\n\r\nSEACA has over a decade of experience engaging low-income youth in Chinatown, Solano Canyon, and Lincoln Heights around issues of economic justice, and we have begun expanding our work to include residents from Atwater Village and Elysian Valley. Public Counsel has longstanding and widely respected legal and policy expertise in issues of community development, land use, and urban planning.  \r\n\r\nTogether, we have the ability to meaningfully engage local residents on issues of equitable development across multiple languages and at a level that no other organization engaged in LA River work has been able to do."
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "SEACA and Public Counsel have agreed to collaborate on this project and have worked together to connect and mobilize diverse communities and create a more sustainable LA for the last five years. Through our partnership, communities have been able to come together to identify solutions to key needs such as jobs and affordable housing. SEACA trains hundreds of youth to become leaders in their communities in order to educate and mobilize seniors, working adults, and youth in five different languages. SEACA’s members include individuals residing in several River-adjacent neighborhoods. Public Counsel provides the land use expertise needed to turn community priorities and goals into policy proposals that can be eventually adopted into law.  \r\n\r\nIn 2013, SEACA and Public Counsel successfully worked together to engage residents and develop a groundbreaking new land use plan for the Cornfields Arroyo area north of downtown Los Angeles. The campaign empowered and educated youth leaders to advocate for more affordable housing, environmental justice, and good jobs. As a result of our joint efforts in mobilizing the community and providing policy and legal support, the plan is expected to be an effective tool for producing affordable housing in the area and for preventing displacement of existing residents. The LA Times twice called the plan “A Model for LA,” and it garnered the support of environmentalists, for-profit developers, labor unions, affordable housing advocates, transportation experts, AND the local community. \r\n\r\nIf awarded an LA2050 grant, each partner will receive $50,000. In addition, Public Counsel regularly works with other legal and policy experts, and we expect to engage these partners as our platform is developed.  "
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    We estimate that total cost of the project will be $114,464, including
    $52,250 in expenses from SEACA and $62,214 in expenses from Public Counsel.
    Costs exceeding $100,000 will be covered by general operating expenses or
    additional grant funding raised for the project.

  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "Too often, community voices are left out of major decisions affecting the build out of our neighborhoods. Unless local residents are equipped with the tools to shape investments and large scale development projects, resulting benefits and opportunities may not reach current residents. \r\n\r\nWe are proposing to engage residents, city officials, and other stakeholders in LA River communities to ensure that the return on our investment is shared by the low-income residents and families that called this area home long before it caught the eye of politicians and real estate developers. Through community engagement, legal research, and advocacy, we aim to maximize the positive impacts of a revitalized River, such as local job opportunities, affordable housing and expanded park space. And we aim to minimize negative impacts like the involuntary displacement of local residents and community-serving small businesses. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, we will achieve the following:\r\n\r\n1. Conduct a community assessment. \r\nSEACA and Public Counsel will analyze data and speak with local community members, community-based organizations, and economic development experts/researchers to gain a deeper understanding of River-adjacent communities, map community assets, and assess the risk of gentrification and displacement.\r\n\r\n2. Launch a community-informed policy and organizing strategy.\r\nWe will use information gleaned from the community assessment to develop policy and organizing strategies that address LA River-area residents’ needs and priorities. We will collaborate with stakeholder groups to educate and mobilize residents on the River investment and its impacts on the community through the development of education workshops, infographics, a comic book, and multi-media tools. In partnership with residents and other stakeholders, we will identify and develop legal and policy tools to help ensure the River build out is transparent and benefits ALL Angelenos, including local communities. We will then work with city officials to include these policies in River investment plans.\r\n\r\n3. Monitor development to ensure community priorities are implemented. \r\nMany residents aren't aware of the magnitude of the potential investment or the potential opportunity the River brings if the investment is shaped with local communities in mind. As River development begins, we will monitor activities and share information with residents to help develop tools for meaningfully shaping River community benefits."

   • Promoting the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by decreasing the median travel time to work through local employment opportunities and increasing the amount of affordable housing in this transit-rich area; and
