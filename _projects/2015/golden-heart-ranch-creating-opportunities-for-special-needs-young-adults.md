project_summary: >-
  We propose to build the best place to live for young adults with special
  needs. Golden Heart Ranch will have on and off site jobs, residential housing,
  opportunities for social events and community friendships. We are building an
  intentional community of the future that will give our special needs kids,
  teens and young adults the arena to reach their fullest potential.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Our project will make LA the healthiest place to live for special needs young
  adults. Currently 90 percent of our kids never leave home when they age out of
  the school system at 22 years of age, they have limited opportunities for
  employment and only 1% make a life-long friend. Our proposal for expansion of
  Golden Heart Ranch will give employment opportunities, vocational training
  programs, social skills and life skills programs, opportunities to create long
  term friendships within our community and with mentoring and encouragement the
  broader community. We will make LA the healthiest, best place for this segment
  of the community to live. It's a growing community... we expect 500,000 kids
  nationally to age out to the school system in the next 4 years.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  The only challenge we face is finances. There is such an incredible need for
  what our organization does and it's expansion is critical to our special needs
  community. We have the directors, staff, the property and most certainly the
  clients... our biggest obstacle is getting the dollars to enhance our current
  programs and create more.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Our work is measured by the success of our clients through vocational training
  programs which lead to employment in our communities. We measure success in
  our Sports programs by constantly raising the bar and keeping data on each
  individual and they reach new milestones. Our success is easily measured
  through our constant improvement and expectations in our top notch programs.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There are very few programs like ours in California. However, outside of
  California there are many programs/ projects such as Golden Heart Ranch. We
  are able to learn from them and they help us grow to be the best we can be. We
  collaborate with them on a constant basis to make sure we are on the path to
  success.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  We will not have any partners on this project. Only collaborators who wish to
  see our success and they will not gain financially from us.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  We will cover extra costs by our extensive grant writing, support from family
  foundations, support from corporations, private donors and fundraising. We are
  already extensively involved in all of the above.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  I. Organic gardens and vegetable tower installation………….$25,000
   
   II. Admin for implementing program..……………………………..$7,000
   
   We will also use resources such as interns from the local Pierce College agricultural program.
   
   III. Indoor vocational cooking center…………………………….$40,000
   
   We will be able to utilize the donation of an entire Thermador kitchen we have already received and are holding storage.
   
   IV. Art Therapy Vocational Program………………………......…$25,000
   
   We will be able to implement the Art Therapy vocational program which will allow us to create and market the handmade goods that we can provide in the art center.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  We have already impacted the larger community by bringing the Nationally
  acclaimed Fred Conference to professionals, caregivers, families and self
  advocates that serve the special needs community. Our last conference had over
  350 guests from every state of the union learning best practices in housing,
  employment and socialization for our special needs community.
