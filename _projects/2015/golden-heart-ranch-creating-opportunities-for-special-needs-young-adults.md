  'DESCRIBE IN GREATER DETAIL HOW YOU WILL MAKE LA THE HEALTHIEST PLACE TO LIVE: ': >-
    Our project will make LA the healthiest place to live for special needs
    young adults. Currently 90 percent of our kids never leave home when they
    age out of the school system at 22 years of age, they have limited
    opportunities for employment and only 1% make a life-long friend.  Our
    proposal for expansion of Golden Heart Ranch will give employment
    opportunities, vocational training programs, social skills and life skills
    programs, opportunities to create long term friendships within our community
    and with mentoring and encouragement the broader community. We will make LA
    the healthiest, best place for this segment of the community to live. It's a
    growing community... we expect 500,000 kids nationally to age out to the
    school system in the next 4 years.

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    The only challenge we face is finances. There is such an incredible need for
    what our organization does and it's expansion is critical to our special
    needs community. We have the directors, staff, the property and most
    certainly the clients... our biggest obstacle is getting the dollars to
    enhance our current programs and create more.
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    Our work is measured by the success of our clients through vocational
    training programs which lead to employment in our communities. We measure
    success in our Sports programs by constantly raising the bar and keeping
    data on each individual and they reach new milestones. Our success is easily
    measured through our constant improvement and expectations in our top notch
    programs.
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    There are very few programs like ours in California. However, outside of
    California there are many programs/ projects such as Golden Heart Ranch. We
    are able to learn from them and they help us grow to be the best we can be.
    We collaborate with them on a constant basis to make sure we are on the path
    to success.
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    We will not have any partners on this project. Only collaborators who wish
    to see our success and they will not gain financially from us.
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    We will cover extra costs by our extensive grant writing, support from
    family foundations, support from corporations, private donors and
    fundraising. We are already extensively involved in all of the above.
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "I.\tOrganic gardens and vegetable tower installation………….$25,000\r\n\r\nII.\tAdmin for implementing program..……………………………..$7,000\r\n\r\nWe will also use resources such as interns from the local Pierce College agricultural program.\r\n\r\nIII.\tIndoor vocational cooking center…………………………….$40,000\r\n\r\nWe will be able to utilize the donation of an entire Thermador kitchen we have already received and are holding storage.\r\n\r\nIV.\tArt Therapy Vocational Program………………………......…$25,000\r\n\r\nWe will be able to implement the Art Therapy vocational program which will allow us to create and market the handmade goods that we can provide in the art center.\r\n"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    We have already impacted the larger community by bringing the Nationally
    acclaimed Fred Conference to professionals, caregivers, families and self
    advocates that serve the special needs community. Our last conference had
    over 350 guests from every state of the union learning best practices in
    housing, employment and socialization for our special needs community.
