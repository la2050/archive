  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    Our work is measured by the success of our clients through vocational
    training programs which lead to employment in our communities. We measure
    success in our Sports programs by constantly raising the bar and keeping
    data on each individual and they reach new milestones. Our success is easily
    measured through our constant improvement and expectations in our top notch
    programs.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Our project will make LA the healthiest place to live for special needs young
  adults. Currently 90 percent of our kids never leave home when they age out of
  the school system at 22 years of age, they have limited opportunities for
  employment and only 1% make a life-long friend. Our proposal for expansion of
  Golden Heart Ranch will give employment opportunities, vocational training
  programs, social skills and life skills programs, opportunities to create long
  term friendships within our community and with mentoring and encouragement the
  broader community. We will make LA the healthiest, best place for this segment
  of the community to live. It's a growing community... we expect 500,000 kids
  nationally to age out to the school system in the next 4 years.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  The only challenge we face is finances. There is such an incredible need for
  what our organization does and it's expansion is critical to our special needs
  community. We have the directors, staff, the property and most certainly the
  clients... our biggest obstacle is getting the dollars to enhance our current
  programs and create more.

Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There are very few programs like ours in California. However, outside of
  California there are many programs/ projects such as Golden Heart Ranch. We
  are able to learn from them and they help us grow to be the best we can be. We
  collaborate with them on a constant basis to make sure we are on the path to
  success.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  We will not have any partners on this project. Only collaborators who wish to
  see our success and they will not gain financially from us.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  We have already impacted the larger community by bringing the Nationally
  acclaimed Fred Conference to professionals, caregivers, families and self
  advocates that serve the special needs community. Our last conference had over
  350 guests from every state of the union learning best practices in housing,
  employment and socialization for our special needs community.
