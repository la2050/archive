title: the EcoBoard Project
project_summary: >-
  Our goal is to create the first ever Workshop Showcase for a new paradigm in
  surfboard + watercraft design & production - The EcoBoard Project.
  Appropriately, SoCal was the birthplace for surfboard manufacturing and
  innovation. Sustainablesurf.org is currently working with leaders in the surf
  world towards better, safer, healthier practices - from shaping + design to
  glassing + storytelling.  Working with Marko Foam, E-tech, and Entropy Resin,
  we will show how this transformative process works.

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: "E3 Surf Craft's E-tech Glassing + surfboards (http://www.etechsurf.com) featuring co-founder Ryan Harris, is the first African American led, LA based eco minded surfboard making shop of its kind. As our prototype and \"innovation lab\"  EcoBoard partner,  we will work closely to create a workshop where individuals, companies, students, amateurs and pros, in and around the surfing community can see how innovation in materials and mindset, as related to surfboard building, can help transform an entire surf industry + culture. The EcoBoard Project promotes the adoption of non-toxic and low-carbon materials that leverage plant-based chemistry and recycled components, to produce a superior sustainably minded product resulting ultimately in a healthier workplace and ocean playground. \r\n\r\nHaving this popup Lab in LA, one of the most creative hubs in the world, enables us access to many of the thought leaders, industry veterans, educators, artists and media professionals for a robust collaboration and meeting of the minds.  As the Pacific is at our front door,  we will have multiple opportunities for EcoBoard demo's, education on plastic pollution, ocean acidification, storm runoff, and the overall need to keep our oceans healthy.  We would do this in collaboration with local experts and organizations like Heal the Bay, Surfrider, the 5 Gyres, WaterKeeper and the Plastic Pollution Coalition. \r\n\r\nWe have several other programs and initiatives which tie-in nicely to the EcoBoard Project. \"Waste to Waves\" (http://wastetowaves.org), our styrofoam collection which turns discarded foam into board blanks with Marko Foam.  \"What's in your Board\" (http://wiyb.sustainablesurf.org), shows the evolution of the surfboard and how it went from a green to a very toxic product through its manufacturing + design evolution.  And \"Deep Blue Surfing\" Events (http://sustainablesurf.org/contests/), where we work closely with surf contest and event companies like Volcom, Vans and the World Surfing League reducing environmental impacts of a professional surfing contest. \r\n\r\nSurfing begins with a surfboard, and it is our mission to transform the industry into better practices without sacrificing performance nor the bottom line.  As the Surfers Poll recent \"Agents of Change\", we can already see a movement starting towards cleaner, more planet friendly materials. Our hope is this trend continues into all aspects of ocean related activities - where toxic materials and waste have been the norm. "

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    One barrier we can foresee is finding a location partner to house our pop up
    workshop with an eventual longer term arrangement.  The other challenge may
    be manpower, but we are hoping to cover that through internships and an
    eventual affiliation with schools like Otis or USC. We are also not opposed
    to having our workshop on a college campus for part of the year and
    integrating surfboard design and production into their curriculum.   Our
    strategy is through like minded partnerships and those who see a positive
    impact through our work as something they can support.  We have discussed
    the opportunity to set up shop within the already existing E-tech surfboard
    warehouse to show proof of concept if need be.  
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    The EcoBoard Project includes an evaluation component that tracks the
    evolution of the market and the effectiveness of the program.  Our work is
    also quantitatively evaluated through extensive list management of workshop
    attendees, consultations with manufacturers and shapers, surf professionals,
    along with classes and events.  Boards purchased through the workshop and
    the yearly output of E-tech will be catalogued. Sustainablesurf.org is
    aligned with industry leaders, professionals and amateurs purchasing
    EcoBoards through affiliates like Lost Surfboards, Channel Islands, Firewire
    and others whose data can be anonymously included in aggregate in our yearly
    summary.
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "There are several other surf related, eco centric, organizations around the world like Surfrider, Waves for Water, Surfers for Change, Save the Waves, WILDCOAST, and 1% for the Planet.   Most of these however are dedicated to protecting and preserving the coastal environment in a general sense.   For example, Surfing for Change’s goal is to spread awareness, motivation, and promote action from surfers and non-surfers alike. 1% For the Planet aims to build and support an alliance of businesses financially committed to creating a healthy planet, (sustainablesurf.org is a recipient of monies from 1% for the Ecoboard Project via E-tech). They offer simple, tangible and proactive ways for the business community to be a part of the solution.  \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Sustainablesurf.org through the EcoBoard Program explores the new emerging world of eco friendly board production, featuring a real world product with a very tangible solution for better practices in surfboard manufacturing through tactile examples you can actually hold in your hand and ride.   Through our efforts, we can accelerate awareness and ultimately demand and production of sustainable surfboards, spurring additional innovation in new technology and design.  Tactically, we achieve this by creating science-based measurable quantitative standards for sustainable surfboard materials, a bio-content labeling campaign based on industry best practices, and an EcoBoard education campaign for both surfers and industry. \r\n\r\nFor society, the sustainable surfboard revolution represents a high-profile media friendly and engaging story of sustainable design innovation.  This workshop + lab becomes a “story-telling platform” that can galvanize all members of the general population: male, female, kids, young adults, middle-aged and even more mature adults. Research shows that surfing is the number one aspirational sport in America that youth (aged 14-25) most want to learn (Label Networks 2012). Simply put, surfing is a lifestyle that is highly attractive and often emulated. It is the perfect vehicle to promote a sustainable lifestyle that is “cool” and desirable; the EcoBoard becomes the catalyst and starting point for that conversation."
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    E-tech Surfboards for design, shaping, glassing and training.   They will
    essentially lead the workshops along with the guidance of
    sustainablesurf.org.   Marko Foam will provide the recycled blanks for
    surfboard design and shaping.   Bio Epoxy Resin innovators, Entropy Resin
    will provide the "super sap" for the green glassing portion of the
    workshops.  Sustainable surf.org will provide a more fully detailed
    breakdown on the proposed budget, however please note there will be an
    offset due to a balance between materials purchased and used at a wholesale
    cost that can be repaid through sales of workshop made boards and demo's. 
    We are looking at a more sustainable model so the 100k is used more as a
    launch pad for the workshop and not for operating costs.  Sustainable Surf
    will oversee the social media, calendar of events and management of the
    space.   
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    This is an ongoing and discoverable part of the process.  The plan is
    centered around foremost being the catalyst and agents for others to follow
    our programs locally and globally.  Setting an example for better practices,
    systems change, oversight, management and delivery allows us to lead others
    down this innovative path.   We will scale with more resources, publicizing
    and perpetual awareness through surf channels, and ocean Ambassadors in each
    country where surf culture is tantamount to ocean related activities and the
    need for conservation.  Enabling the EcoBoard project to be modular helps
    and the project itself is scalable in nature by its original design and
    resources.
