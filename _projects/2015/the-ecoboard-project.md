  Our goal is to create the first ever Workshop Showcase for a new paradigm in
  surfboard + watercraft design & production - The EcoBoard Project.
  Appropriately, SoCal was the birthplace for surfboard manufacturing and
  innovation. Sustainablesurf.org is currently working with leaders in the surf
  world towards better, safer, healthier practices - from shaping + design to
  glassing + storytelling. Working with Marko Foam, E-tech, and Entropy Resin,
  we will show how this transformative process works.

  E3 Surf Craft's E-tech Glassing + surfboards (http://www.etechsurf.com)
  featuring co-founder Ryan Harris, is the first African American led, LA based
  eco minded surfboard making shop of its kind. As our prototype and "innovation
  lab" EcoBoard partner, we will work closely to create a workshop where
  individuals, companies, students, amateurs and pros, in and around the surfing
  community can see how innovation in materials and mindset, as related to
  surfboard building, can help transform an entire surf industry + culture. The
  EcoBoard Project promotes the adoption of non-toxic and low-carbon materials
  that leverage plant-based chemistry and recycled components, to produce a
  superior sustainably minded product resulting ultimately in a healthier
  workplace and ocean playground. 
   
   Having this popup Lab in LA, one of the most creative hubs in the world, enables us access to many of the thought leaders, industry veterans, educators, artists and media professionals for a robust collaboration and meeting of the minds. As the Pacific is at our front door, we will have multiple opportunities for EcoBoard demo's, education on plastic pollution, ocean acidification, storm runoff, and the overall need to keep our oceans healthy. We would do this in collaboration with local experts and organizations like Heal the Bay, Surfrider, the 5 Gyres, WaterKeeper and the Plastic Pollution Coalition. 
   
   We have several other programs and initiatives which tie-in nicely to the EcoBoard Project. "Waste to Waves" (http://wastetowaves.org), our styrofoam collection which turns discarded foam into board blanks with Marko Foam. "What's in your Board" (http://wiyb.sustainablesurf.org), shows the evolution of the surfboard and how it went from a green to a very toxic product through its manufacturing + design evolution. And "Deep Blue Surfing" Events (http://sustainablesurf.org/contests/), where we work closely with surf contest and event companies like Volcom, Vans and the World Surfing League reducing environmental impacts of a professional surfing contest. 
   
   Surfing begins with a surfboard, and it is our mission to transform the industry into better practices without sacrificing performance nor the bottom line. As the Surfers Poll recent "Agents of Change", we can already see a movement starting towards cleaner, more planet friendly materials. Our hope is this trend continues into all aspects of ocean related activities - where toxic materials and waste have been the norm.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  One barrier we can foresee is finding a location partner to house our pop up
  workshop with an eventual longer term arrangement. The other challenge may be
  manpower, but we are hoping to cover that through internships and an eventual
  affiliation with schools like Otis or USC. We are also not opposed to having
  our workshop on a college campus for part of the year and integrating
  surfboard design and production into their curriculum. Our strategy is through
  like minded partnerships and those who see a positive impact through our work
  as something they can support. We have discussed the opportunity to set up
  shop within the already existing E-tech surfboard warehouse to show proof of
  concept if need be.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  The EcoBoard Project includes an evaluation component that tracks the
  evolution of the market and the effectiveness of the program. Our work is also
  quantitatively evaluated through extensive list management of workshop
  attendees, consultations with manufacturers and shapers, surf professionals,
  along with classes and events. Boards purchased through the workshop and the
  yearly output of E-tech will be catalogued. Sustainablesurf.org is aligned
  with industry leaders, professionals and amateurs purchasing EcoBoards through
  affiliates like Lost Surfboards, Channel Islands, Firewire and others whose
  data can be anonymously included in aggregate in our yearly summary.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There are several other surf related, eco centric, organizations around the
  world like Surfrider, Waves for Water, Surfers for Change, Save the Waves,
  WILDCOAST, and 1% for the Planet. Most of these however are dedicated to
  protecting and preserving the coastal environment in a general sense. For
  example, Surfing for Change’s goal is to spread awareness, motivation, and
  promote action from surfers and non-surfers alike. 1% For the Planet aims to
  build and support an alliance of businesses financially committed to creating
  a healthy planet, (sustainablesurf.org is a recipient of monies from 1% for
  the Ecoboard Project via E-tech). They offer simple, tangible and proactive
  ways for the business community to be a part of the solution. 
   
   On the other hand, Sustainablesurf.org through the EcoBoard Program explores the new emerging world of eco friendly board production, featuring a real world product with a very tangible solution for better practices in surfboard manufacturing through tactile examples you can actually hold in your hand and ride. Through our efforts, we can accelerate awareness and ultimately demand and production of sustainable surfboards, spurring additional innovation in new technology and design. Tactically, we achieve this by creating science-based measurable quantitative standards for sustainable surfboard materials, a bio-content labeling campaign based on industry best practices, and an EcoBoard education campaign for both surfers and industry. 
   
   For society, the sustainable surfboard revolution represents a high-profile media friendly and engaging story of sustainable design innovation. This workshop + lab becomes a “story-telling platform” that can galvanize all members of the general population: male, female, kids, young adults, middle-aged and even more mature adults. Research shows that surfing is the number one aspirational sport in America that youth (aged 14-25) most want to learn (Label Networks 2012). Simply put, surfing is a lifestyle that is highly attractive and often emulated. It is the perfect vehicle to promote a sustainable lifestyle that is “cool” and desirable; the EcoBoard becomes the catalyst and starting point for that conversation.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  E-tech Surfboards for design, shaping, glassing and training. They will
  essentially lead the workshops along with the guidance of sustainablesurf.org.
  Marko Foam will provide the recycled blanks for surfboard design and shaping.
  Bio Epoxy Resin innovators, Entropy Resin will provide the "super sap" for the
  green glassing portion of the workshops. Sustainable surf.org will provide a
  more fully detailed breakdown on the proposed budget, however please note
  there will be an offset due to a balance between materials purchased and used
  at a wholesale cost that can be repaid through sales of workshop made boards
  and demo's. We are looking at a more sustainable model so the 100k is used
  more as a launch pad for the workshop and not for operating costs. Sustainable
  Surf will oversee the social media, calendar of events and management of the
  space.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  We believe the $100K award will allow us to build a modular pop up workshop,
  lab, exhibition space that best represents the overall workings of the
  EcoBoard Project as outlined in this proposal. Being modular in nature, this
  will allow for greater flexibility for setting up and taking down at intended
  partner locations when determined. Since the EcoBoard Project is already in
  production, this adjunct location, exhibition space and workshop will act as a
  showroom site to better promote the ongoing program - additional costs will be
  covered by continuing sales, workshop fees, corporate underwriting and
  merchandise sales.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  Ecoboard Pop-Up Workshop + Education Lab
   
   Construction of a pop-up Lab which can be a 20’ trailer with an awning that creates a shaded space on the side. There will be a utility prefab side trailer (attached) modified only for storing materials and glassing equipment inside then moved outside for the demos under the awning. The lab can be either an indoor or outdoor installation. There is a small shaping / sanding booth inside so a complete board can be made in situ. There is a window into the shaping bay so people can watch a board being shaped, or be watched by others while participating. Signage and video screens go on the walls of the trailer and are placed outside around the location as well. Walls inside and out will be used for exhibition space and curated for the display of the “What’s in my Board” information panels and artworks. 
   
   - Pop-up 20’ trailer purchase and modification to build shaping/sanding room and racks for boards and materials - $20,000
   - Production equipment (board stands, power tools, lighting, air compressor, ventilation and filtration system) - $10,000
   - Electric solar photovoltaic system with batteries and inverter - $15,000
   - Generator backup system (bio-diesel powered) - $3,000 (if electricity is not provided by location). 
   - Signage and educational display structures - $5,000
   - Audio-visual display screens, speakers, and gear - $5,000
   - Materials to make 10+ eco-surfboards (foam, resin, fiberglass) - $2,000*
   - recycling and waste management included TBD
   - Electricity + Utilities - $2,500
   
   Education Content Development + Presentation 
   - Workshop information guides
   - Environmental and sustainability educational content
   - Website Revisions and updates with Social Media
   - Merchandise + other promotional materials
   - Video Production
   - Interns and attending staff
   - Total cost for educational content production and printing - $37,500*
   
   * Some of this material has already been produced and is being stored for our continued use at conferences and shows. 
   **Once boards are completed they can be sold. The money then goes back into the Project to offset operation costs, maintenance + staff. 
   
   We are currently working on finalizing the vision and budget to work within the parameters outlined in this proposal.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  This is an ongoing and discoverable part of the process. The plan is centered
  around foremost being the catalyst and agents for others to follow our
  programs locally and globally. Setting an example for better practices,
  systems change, oversight, management and delivery allows us to lead others
  down this innovative path. We will scale with more resources, publicizing and
  perpetual awareness through surf channels, and ocean Ambassadors in each
  country where surf culture is tantamount to ocean related activities and the
  need for conservation. Enabling the EcoBoard project to be modular helps and
  the project itself is scalable in nature by its original design and resources.
