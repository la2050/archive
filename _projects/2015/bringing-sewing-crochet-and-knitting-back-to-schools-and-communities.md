title: Bringing sewing crochet and knitting back to schools and communities

project_summary: >-
  The program gives basic art instruction with the intention of attracting
  students who love art but also drawing students who discover their creativity
  for the first time. Students gain confidence while participating in these
  classes, which produces well-rounded, positive students. We see students teach
  other students, which promotes the idea of helping others and sharing our
  gifts and talents.
Please specify below: 'Start with schools in Torrance, then branch out neighboring cities in LA'

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Yes4arts is helping Los Angeles become the best place to learn by going to
  schools and setting up after school programs for children and youth to provide
  positive learning experiences. This builds upon
   youth interests and supports active engagement in enrichment activities. Then, Yes4arts is targeting women's shelters to promote psychological and emotional safety and provide job opportunities for the women with their creative products from instruction. Another goal of Yes4arts is teaching at community centers to involve the community as partners in the program and encourages children and
   parents to work together. In all these programs, the goal and focus is to provide opportunity and improvement in the lives of those students through learning of basic art instruction as well as more intermediate instruction.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Currently, a major obstacle is financial resources. We do not at this moment
  have the financial resources to get us where we want to be to meet our goals.
  Yes4arts needs funds for a better venue, 
   materials, and tools. Some strategies for overcoming these obstacles include having events, fundraisers, donations from arts & crafts stores, and sponsorships (i.e. Joann's, individuals). A big part of overcoming our financial obstacle would be receiving grants. Grants will take Yes4arts where it belongs- in schools and community centers- where it can really begin to make the most difference in LA.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We will evaluate our work by keeping track of the number of students we teach
  at schools and centers each year. Evaluation will be determined by three
  factors: 1) number of students taking the classes, 2) number of volunteers who
  help with teaching (these are prior students), and 3) number of volunteers
  that hear about our work through events or marketing. Furthermore, Yes4arts
  will return to schools & centers for feedback. We will provide surveys of how
  benefited from the classes as well as questions on areas of improvement in the
  programs offered. Finally, we will have a graduation for the students in the
  final class (show & tell of crafts created) for families and friends to
  attend. This will foster environment of encouragement and families can see the
  changes in the students' lives.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Yes there are other organizations doing similar work; however what makes
  Yes4arts unique is that it offers free art instruction (3 in 1- sewing,
  crochet, knitting) and main vision is to bring this back to schools'
  curriculum and community centers. Additionally Yes4arts offers beginner
  classes, as well as intermediate for students interested for more unique or
  complex stich patterns. Yes4arts meets the student where he/she is at- and
  builds their skill & confidence from there.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': Not applicable
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 â€“ how will you cover the additional costs?': |-
  Annual expenses:
   2 Vans $60,000
   Car Insurance $3,000
   Start up costs (sewing machines etc.) $1,800
   Materials (yarns, hooks) $12,000
   Gas $2,400
   Vehicle Maintenance $2,000
   Rent $14,400
   President pay $20/hr - 20hr/wk= $1600/mo= $19,200/yr
   Secretary pay $10/hr - 20hr/wk = $800/mo = $9600/yr
   Events $4,000
   Additional costs $2,400
   TOTAL $130,800
   
   *To cover the overage in cost, we plan to have fundraisers (i.e. fashion shows) and marketing events to raise funds and more awareness of Yes4arts in the community and schools. Also, buying a second van is commensurate to number of volunteers and visits to school and centers. With regards to the rent, Yes4arts will have a center where students in the schools/centers can attend further art classes. Thus if the schools allow for a limited timeframe of art classes, then there is a central location for art classes.

How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  We plan to scale the success of our proposal a number of ways. First, the
  scale involves measuring the number of students who have attended classes and
  learned how to sew, crochet and knit. Second,
   success is measured when students decide to become vendors at Yes4arts events and showcase their art designs. Finally, success is measured when students return to our classes with positive updates of their lives, have made education a priority, and have become positive role models in the community for other new students. This is when Yes4arts can be proud of making a difference, one student at a time.
