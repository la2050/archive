Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "Yes4arts is helping Los Angeles become the best place to learn by going to schools and setting up after school programs for children and youth to provide positive learning experiences. This builds upon\r\nyouth interests and supports active engagement in enrichment activities. Then, Yes4arts is targeting women's shelters to promote psychological and emotional safety and provide job opportunities for the women with their creative products from instruction.  Another goal of Yes4arts is teaching at community centers to involve the community as partners in the program and encourages children and\r\nparents to work together. In all these programs, the goal and focus is to provide opportunity and improvement in the lives of those students through learning of basic art instruction as well as more intermediate instruction. "
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We will evaluate our work by keeping track of the number of students we teach
  at schools and centers each year. Evaluation will be determined by three
  factors: 1) number of students taking the classes, 2) number of volunteers who
  help with teaching (these are prior students),  and 3) number of volunteers
  that hear about our work through events or marketing. Furthermore, Yes4arts
  will return to schools & centers for feedback. We will provide surveys of how
  benefited from the classes as well as questions on areas of improvement in the
  programs offered. Finally, we will have a graduation for the students in the
  final class (show & tell of crafts created) for families and friends to
  attend. This will foster environment of encouragement and families can see the
  changes in the students' lives.

  - Money (financial capital)
  - Volunteers/staff (human capital)
