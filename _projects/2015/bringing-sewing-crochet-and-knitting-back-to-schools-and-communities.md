  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "Yes4arts is helping Los Angeles become the best place to learn by going to schools and setting up after school programs for children and youth to provide positive learning experiences. This builds upon\r\nyouth interests and supports active engagement in enrichment activities. Then, Yes4arts is targeting women's shelters to promote psychological and emotional safety and provide job opportunities for the women with their creative products from instruction.  Another goal of Yes4arts is teaching at community centers to involve the community as partners in the program and encourages children and\r\nparents to work together. In all these programs, the goal and focus is to provide opportunity and improvement in the lives of those students through learning of basic art instruction as well as more intermediate instruction.

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "Currently, a major obstacle is financial resources. We do not at this moment have the financial resources to get us where we want to be to meet our goals. Yes4arts needs funds for a better venue, \r\nmaterials, and tools. Some strategies for overcoming these obstacles include having events, fundraisers, donations from arts & crafts stores, and sponsorships (i.e. Joann's, individuals). A big part of overcoming our financial obstacle would be receiving grants. Grants will take Yes4arts where it belongs- in schools and community centers- where it can really begin to make the most difference in LA."
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    We will evaluate our work by keeping track of the number of students we
    teach at schools and centers each year. Evaluation will be determined by
    three factors: 1) number of students taking the classes, 2) number of
    volunteers who help with teaching (these are prior students),  and 3) number
    of volunteers that hear about our work through events or marketing.
    Furthermore, Yes4arts will return to schools & centers for feedback. We will
    provide surveys of how benefited from the classes as well as questions on
    areas of improvement in the programs offered. Finally, we will have a
    graduation for the students in the final class (show & tell of crafts
    created) for families and friends to attend. This will foster environment of
    encouragement and families can see the changes in the students' lives. 
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    Yes there are other organizations doing similar work; however what makes
    Yes4arts unique is that it offers free art instruction (3 in 1- sewing,
    crochet, knitting) and main vision is to bring this back to schools'
    curriculum and community centers. Additionally Yes4arts offers beginner
    classes, as well as intermediate for students interested for more unique or
    complex stich patterns. Yes4arts meets the student where he/she is at- and
    builds their skill & confidence from there. 
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': Not applicable
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "We plan to scale the success of our proposal a number of ways. First, the scale involves measuring the number of students who have attended classes and learned how to sew, crochet and knit. Second,\r\nsuccess is measured when students decide to become vendors at Yes4arts events and showcase their art designs.  Finally, success is measured when students return to our classes with positive updates of their lives, have made education a priority, and have become positive role models in the community for other new students. This is when Yes4arts can be proud of making a difference, one student at a time.    "
