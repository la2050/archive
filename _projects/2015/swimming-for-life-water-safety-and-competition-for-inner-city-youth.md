  The Trojan Swim Club Outreach Program is a free, school-based, high-quality
  swim program that began at a single South Los Angeles site in 2014 with 90
  students and has served a total 260 to date. The success of the program has
  led us to plan an expansion of our capacity and partnership with LAUSD in
  2016. By increasing capacity at our existing site and expanding to two new
  schools, we will reach 830 students annually with our rigorous water safety,
  swimming instruction and competitive program.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  The Trojan Swim Club (TSC) Outreach Program was created as a direct response
  to the racial and socioeconomic barriers that contribute to the disparate rate
  of drowning amongst children of color - three times that of white children -
  and to this same group’s under-representation in recreational and competitive
  swimming. By empowering disadvantaged youth with the skills, confidence and
  desire to reach their fullest potential in life, these programs promise to be
  training grounds for success in and out of the water, and to change forever
  the lives of the youth they touch.
   
    In the 2014-15 school year, TSC served 200 youth of which 66% were female, 34% male, 85% Latino and 15% Black. A team of 50 was launched to introduce the most passionate participants to the components of competitive swimming with the goal of preparing them to advance to a competitive program and compete in meets sanctioned by USA Swimming. Twenty-five will join a competitive program scheduled to start at Fremont High School in January of 2016.
   
   Our curriculum is based on best practices in the field and is designed to help students acquire basic water safety skills, develop proper stroke techniques and also prepare advanced students for competitive swimming. The majority of the staff is made up of seasoned instructors with a passion for teaching disadvantaged youth to swim. 
   
   Our planned program expansion will allow us to implement high-quality swim programs at three schools in Los Angeles in 2016, providing 830 underserved youth with the instruction and mentorship necessary to develop basic water safety skills, learn how to swim, and for those that discover a love for swimming, to advance to TSC’s competitive swimming program with the potential to participate in college-level athletics.
   
   We envision a 2050 in which all Los Angeles youth have equitable access to recreational spaces and programs. Access to high-quality swim programs is a single piece of this puzzle, but, we believe, an important one in promoting positive youth development. Beyond the more easily measured health benefits, programs like ours have been shown to reduce neighborhood crime and improve the academic performance and general well-being of the youth that participate. We want to bring Los Angeles one step closer to a 2050 in which every child has the same opportunity to learn to swim and be healthy physically, socially and emotionally, irrespective of their parents’ paychecks or the color of their skin.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Transportation to programs sites and to competitions is likely to be a
  challenge after our expansion to two new sites. Participants in the age group
  program at John C. Fremont High School will likely be students at Bethune
  Middle School and 75th St. Elementary which means they will have to travel 8
  and 14 blocks respectively to get to our program site. At Miguel Contreras
  Learning Center, we hope to attract students from the surrounding elementary
  and middle schools which may be beyond walking distance is some cases.
  Students who are at the age group level will be required to travel in some
  instances long distances to competitions on weekends. We plan to consult with
  parents to decide on the most practical solutions, which could be the use of
  public transportation, carpooling, the purchase of vans, or some combination
  of these options.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  In order to maintain individual student and overall program progress,
  instructors conduct assessments periodically to evaluate student’s proficiency
  in mastering water safety and stroke development skills as well as program
  implementation. We pay close attention to attendance records to evaluate
  student engagement. Additionally, school administrators, teachers, and parents
  have opportunities to provide feedback on their satisfaction with the program
  and to influence program implementation strategies, administrative processes
  and related activities.
   
   We also will have the opportunity in 2016 to collaborate with Los Angeles Education Partnership, a nonprofit organization that is building Bethune into a full service community school. This will grant us access to data they gather using an independent evaluator, allowing us to monitor the academic achievement and the health of our students in a more scientific manner and to better meet the needs of the whole child.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  An organization doing work similar to ours is the USA Swimming Foundation’s
  Make a Splash initiative - a national campaign that aims for every child in
  America to have the opportunity to learn how to swim. It has developed a Make
  a Splash Local Partner network comprised of nearly 700 qualified lesson
  providers across the nation to end drowning. Local Partners are mostly USA
  Swimming Clubs, YMCA’s or swim schools that for the most part offer a limited
  outreach program in addition to their regular activities or provide a small
  number of scholarships for youth who can not afford to participate in
  regularly-priced swim programs.
   
   The Trojan Swim Club Outreach Program is unique in that it is the only program and USA Swimming member club in Los Angeles that provides year-round, youth swim instruction and training for age-group competition in partnership with schools in low-income communities of color. Were it not for this model of a private and public entity coming together to share the use and costs of school grounds, it would be financially impractical to provide a free, swim program informed by a culture of high expectations to large numbers of disadvantaged youth that are now within our reach. It is this combination of scale and quality that currently sets us apart from others.
   
   By forming partnerships with LAUSD schools and leveraging shared resources, we have made high-quality swim instruction easily accessible to large numbers of children and youth because our pools are located at their schools - safe and familiar spaces that require no additional travel - and instruction occurs after school or during school breaks, when parents with full-time work or multiple jobs could not otherwise afford childcare. 
   
   In addition to swim instruction, our program provides the opportunity for students to connect with athletes and coaches from the USC Swim Team and Trojan Swim Club senior group who volunteer as instructors and support staff. These relationships and mentorships are important to the youth we serve, who may who may never have dreamed of attending a university like USC. Our partnership with USC also allows us to organize trips to the campus for time trials and clinics with some of the finest athletes in the world. These experiences expose our swimmers to the high quality of instruction and competition at the college level and make the possibility of swimming for a university like USC within reach.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  -Bethune Middle School, 75th Elementary School, Fremont High School, Miguel
  Contreras Learning Complex provide the resources we need - safe pools fit for
  instruction and competition - to operate our program and achieve our goals
   
   -USC Athletics, Community Outreach Department has implemented an initiative called the Servicing Community through Outreach, Recreation and Education initiative to encourage the involvement of USC athletes in community programs like ours. This partnership has helped to connect youth in our program with athletes from the USC Swim Team and Trojan Swim Club who volunteer as coaches. It has also made it possible for students and their parents to take field trips to USC to participate in time trials and swim clinics conducted by Head Coach Dave Salo, his staff and athletes on the USC team. Experiences like these support our goal to provide youth with mentoring relationships and the confidence that college is within their reach. 
   
   -Los Angeles Educational Partnership (LAEP) is a nonprofit organization that creates and expands full-service community schools. They provide services at Bethune Middle School, 75th Elementary, and Fremont High in remedial education, academic support and enrichment, family engagement, primary health and dental, and mental health that will have a direct impact on our effort to address the needs of the whole child in our programs. By coordinating activities between the three schools, LAEP will enhance our goal of engaging youth at an early age and providing them with the opportunity to swim competitively through high school.
   Beyond the Bell Branch, LAUSD supports our program at Bethune by providing staff to supervise the pool facility.
   
   -Up2Us Sports leads a coach mentorship initiative - Coach Across America - that trains coaches in the principles of sports-based youth development . TSC will pay a participation fee of $2,200 for Up2US to train and compensate an apprentice coach for 450 hours of service at Bethune Middle School in 2016.
   
   -USA Swimming Foundation provides marketing support through its Make a Splash initiative to help educate children and their families on the importance of learning how to swim, professional development to learn best practices, and scholarships for children to participate in swim lessons.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  Our projected program budget is $430,372.00. We are optimistic about covering
  the additional cost of $330,372 to expand our program in 2016 due to the
  success of our program at Bethune Middle School and the impact it has had on
  the health and well-being of the 200 youth we have served. We believe our
  accomplishment at Bethune will inspire those who have supported us in the past
  to continue their support in 2016. At the same time we are taking bold steps
  to generate new sources of revenue.
   
   We project revenue of $393,350 in the form of cash and in-kind donations, an innovative fundraising event and hybrid program structure:
   
   -$11,350 from in-kind donations from Goggles for Guppies, Speedo, and LAUSD that can reduce our expenditures on swimming equipment and pool maintenance and operating costs
    
   -$60,000 in grants and donations from LA84, LA TriClub, and USA Swimming Foundation
   
   -$150,000 in donations resulting from the introduction of the Speedo Fall Challenge, a benefit to be held on November 21, 2015 at the Uytengsu Aquatic Center at USC. The event will highlight some of the finest talent in the U.S. in a made-for-broadcast swim-off fundraiser for our program 
   
   -$72,000 to help sustain and grow our age-group program, a limited number of youth who attend schools in LAUSD and who can afford to pay a membership fee typical for a USA Swimming sanctioned age group club team, will be invited to participate in the program at MCLC which can generate revenue that will help to reduce the   costs of operating a predominantly fee-free program.
   
   -$100,000 with a grant from the LA2050 Grant Challenge, our projected revenue is $393,350, leaving a budget shortfall of $37,022. We plan to make up this deficit through individual and corporate contributions.

How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Following the success of our proposed expansion in 2016, we plan to continue
  growing our program and maximizing our outreach, accompanied by the
  development of organizational capacity and partnerships necessary to support
  this growth.
   
   Only after maximizing capacity at our existing program sites - by increasing enrollment and instructional hours - will we continue our expansion to include new sites at partner schools. At present, there are an additional eight new LAUSD high schools with pools, many currently under-utilized, that are ideal sites for program expansion, allowing us to reach an even larger low-income population. 
   
   In order to scale our project’s success, we must ensure we have the resources necessary to sustain the proposed program expansion for years to come. This includes continuing to build relationships and cultivate partnerships with organizations that share and our goals and complement our work such as the Los Angeles Education Partnership, Youth Policy Institute, Board of Education, Los Angeles Unified School District, Joint Use Moving People to Play task force at the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, Division of Chronic Disease and Injury Prevention, while simultaneously developing our organizational capacity and infrastructure.
