project_summary: >-
  In a world that is becoming increasingly automated & online, one of the most
  radical & innovative things you can do is to return to the basics to unleash
  the potential in real human to human interaction. Most people can identify an
  adult from their childhood who served as their guide and "showed us the ropes"
  - a mentor. BBBSLA wants to connect our city's vulnerable youth to qualified
  mentors through our programs, which have been proven to measurably improve
  learning and academic outcomes.
