  It takes a village to nurture a child’s success. A thriving student is the
  result of more than a good school. It is also a thriving community with jobs,
  affordable housing, wellness access, & strong social networks. That is why, we
  are united around a vision where: 1) every child has an opportunity to learn,
  grow & succeed from cradle through college and career; 2) families can live a
  stable, healthy and fulfilling life; and 3) every individual is empowered to
  act & create a more just community.
Please specify below: >-
  While the Promesa vision is specific to Boyle Heights, our systems change work
  and contributions to communities of practice will impact Los Angeles as a
  whole.
category: all
'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Our work began in 2010, when Boyle Heights became one of 21 communities
  nationally to receive a Promise Neighborhood planning grant from the US DOE.
  We galvanized a planning process in which 4000+ youth, adult residents,
  educators, and community partners came together to share lived experiences,
  reflect on community data, and develop a common vision and action plan.
   
   We transitioned into the first phase of implementation of our plan in 2011. With no dedicated funding, we embarked on the plan’s first strategy: establishment of a community-school model at Mendez HS with the goal of increasing graduation rates and building a college going culture. Together, we: 1) formalized results-oriented partnerships between school staff, families & organizations; 2) launched targeted interventions for the most at-risk students, and 3) hired an Achievement Counselor to coordinate college readiness efforts. 
   
   In the end, we raised the graduation rate by nearly 30% from 2010 and 2015. Recently, Mendez HS became the most improved traditional HS in California with a 76-point API gain and the highest cohort of students accepted to college since the school’s opening. We began scaling up and building similar efforts at Hollenbeck MS and Roosevelt HS. Next, we will:
   
   1. Begin construction of the early education and elementary school strategies in our cradle-to-career Road to Success. We will sustain our current efforts and launch a campaign to increase awareness and connect families of children 0-8 to child development, wellness, support groups & other community resources. In collaboration with early education providers, schools & families, we will develop a shared plan of action to expand access and quality to early education opportunies & transitional supports from Pre-K to 3rd grade.
   
   2. Engage and empower 2000+ new residents. We will support existing resident leaders in disseminating academic and wellness information, linking families to the existing Promesa Wellness Series, and galvanizing more community participation in community campaigns that expand access to school-based wellness centers, affordable housing, early education opportunities, and foster funding equity and transparency in the schools. 
   
   3. We will continue to be a thought leader and an action leader in the placed-based, community-school, and collective impact communities of practice, helping integrate cross-sector approaches that expand the boundaries of education and community transformation.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  The Promesa BH model is a major paradigm shift for community transformation,
  and we fully realize that it will take time and effort to help others
  understand the value of a collective impact models that bridges across issues
  (e.g. education & affordable housing) and approaches (e.g. direct services &
  organizing) that are typically viewed and funded in isolation. We need to get
  better at explaining the multiplying impact of linking and aligning our
  community efforts and how building resident leadership is key to
  sustainability.
   
   How much ground must we still cover? In an immediate sense, the 4,000+ residents who participated in the planning process are but a small fraction of BH’ 95,000+ residents. For the purposes of this project, we will need to align & build partnerships for our early education goals in the context of a fractured early education system composed of formal & informal providers whose requirements, funding sources, & assessments are guided by multiple sources.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Evaluation of our existing Community-School (C-S) model in the schools draws
  from student-level quantitative & qualitative data. Our C-S model at Mendez HS
  is part of a comparison group evaluation by AT&T Aspire to empirically assess
  the impact of our efforts. We have a PN evaluation plan that is the foundation
  for development/implementation of our evaluation/data systems. We will
  evaluate projected impact through ongoing data analysis and are committed to
  using data/evaluation to better understand the impact of our work & share
  findings with others.
   
   Our early education strategies will be added to our logic model & evaluation plans. We plan to track the number of providers, schools, organizations, & parents engaged over time as well as the intensity and type of collaboration fostered. We will track resident growth & leadership over time using our existing civic engagement tools that track self-identified leadership goals & participation in leadership academies, actions, etc.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Promesa Boyle Heights is strengthening education and wellness opportunities in
  our corner of Los Angeles while generating best practices that will inspire
  and help other communities in LA. 
   
   Although there are other Promise Neighborhoods throughout the country – both those that received planning grants from the DOE and still others that also received DOE implementation funds – Promesa Boyle Heights is unique because of its collective impact model and resident-led governance structure. 
   
   While within so many other initiatives one organization oversees the distribution of resources and the implementation of strategies, we view residents as capable and essential leaders who must take ownership of the work. We have also brought cross-sector partners together to strategize and work towards shared goals – non-profits, schools, and institutional partners alike. 
   
   The sheer range of our strategies is also unique, encompassing direct services, the building of local capacity, shifting of local cultures, and impacting broader systemic change.

  In January of 2014, the PBH collaborative announced a visionary “Catalyst for
  Change” campaign to recognize its second grant from AT&T Aspire and to raise
  commitments from local public and private partners to raise $2.5 million in
  funding to support deepening and expansion of PBH strategies through 2017. 
   
   Participants in the press conference included Honorable Mayor Eric Garcetti, County of Los Angeles Board Supervisor Hilda Solis, and Council Member Jose Huizar for District 14. The City of Los Angeles pledged its commitment to partner with Promesa Boyle Heights and similar placed-based efforts that bring together the local community to advance a shared vision and innovative strategies and partnerships that improve outcomes for children and families. 
   
   The total 3-year cost for our Project is $2,500,000. We have raised $1,200,000 in foundation grants, in-kind commitments from residents and our partner organizations, and non-cash contributions from the national Promise Neighborhood Institute to support our Efforts to Outcomes database. 
   
   The LA 2050 grant will allow us to cover staffing for the early education strategies and coordination of the outreach and leadership development efforts. In partnership with InnerCity Struggle, East LA Community Corporation, and Proyecto Pastoral, we will launch an outreach campaign, update our leadership academy curriculum, and engage and train more residents to be part of our movement for change.

How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Sustainability and scale of impact have been two prominent conversations in
  our Promesa BH Steering Committee. In 2011, we faced our first major hurdle
  when despite being among the top scorers for a highly competitive Department
  of Education Promise Neighborhood competition, we did not receive the $30
  million grant that would have allowed us to fully implement our plan. Yet,
  every single individual and organization involved was inspired and determined
  to press on and work together towards achieving our shared vision because they
  felt connected and a deep sense of ownership towards the vision we developed. 
   
   Proyecto Pastoral as the backbone organization has been committed to the Promesa BH vision from the beginning. As a core member of the fundraising and sustainability committee, Proyecto is working with other partners to build momentum and support for the unique collective impact model we've built.
   
   We believe that resident leadership and the spirit of collaboration have been - and will continue to be - a driving force as we work to fully implement the strategies in our original plan. This plan includes working towards the day when we have a strong Community-School and resident leadership infrastructure at each school, when we a strong and coordinated Early Learning Network, and a Transition to College Network in Boyle Heights. 
   
   As part of our involvement in the national Promise Neighborhood Institute, we are also beginning to share best practices and tools with other communities and organizations in Los Angeles and throughout the nation. We see this as an important part of our contribution towards the field of education and community transformation.

    answer: "Our work began in 2010, when Boyle Heights became one of 21 communities nationally to receive a Promise Neighborhood planning grant from the US DOE.  We galvanized a planning process in which 4000+ youth, adult residents, educators, and community partners came together to share lived experiences, reflect on community data, and develop a common vision and action plan.\r\n\r\nWe transitioned into the first phase of implementation of our plan in 2011. With no dedicated funding, we embarked on the plan’s first strategy:  establishment of a community-school model at Mendez HS with the goal of increasing graduation rates and building a college going culture. Together, we:  1) formalized results-oriented partnerships between school staff, families & organizations;  2) launched targeted interventions for the most at-risk students, and 3) hired an Achievement Counselor to coordinate college readiness efforts. \r\n\r\nIn the end, we raised the graduation rate by nearly 30% from 2010 and 2015. Recently, Mendez HS became the most improved traditional HS in California with a 76-point API gain and the highest cohort of students accepted to college since the school’s opening. We began scaling up and building similar efforts at Hollenbeck MS and Roosevelt HS.  Next, we will:\r\n\r\n1. Begin construction of the early education and elementary school strategies in our cradle-to-career Road to Success.  We will sustain our current efforts and launch a campaign to increase awareness and connect families of children 0-8 to child development, wellness, support groups & other community resources. In collaboration with early education providers, schools & families, we will develop a shared plan of action to expand access and quality to early education opportunies & transitional supports from Pre-K to 3rd grade.\r\n\r\n2. Engage and empower 2000+ new residents. We will support existing resident leaders in disseminating academic and wellness information, linking families to the existing Promesa Wellness Series, and galvanizing more community participation in community campaigns that expand access to school-based wellness centers, affordable housing, early education opportunities, and foster funding equity and transparency in the schools. \r\n\r\n3. We will continue to be a thought leader and an action leader in the placed-based, community-school, and collective impact communities of practice, helping integrate cross-sector approaches that expand the boundaries of education and community transformation."

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "The Promesa BH model is a major paradigm shift for community transformation, and we fully realize that it will take time and effort to help others understand the value of a collective impact models that bridges across issues (e.g. education & affordable housing) and approaches (e.g. direct services & organizing) that are typically viewed and funded in isolation. We need to get better at explaining the multiplying impact of linking and aligning our community efforts and how building resident leadership is key to sustainability.\r\n\r\nHow much ground must we still cover? In an immediate sense, the 4,000+ residents who participated in the planning process are but a small fraction of BH’ 95,000+ residents. For the purposes of this project, we will need to align & build partnerships for our early education goals in the context of a fractured early education system composed of formal & informal providers whose requirements, funding sources, & assessments are guided by multiple sources."

    answer: "Evaluation of our existing Community-School (C-S) model in the schools draws from student-level quantitative & qualitative data. Our C-S model at Mendez HS is part of a comparison group evaluation by AT&T Aspire to empirically assess the impact of our efforts. We have a PN evaluation plan that is the foundation for development/implementation of our evaluation/data systems. We will evaluate projected impact through ongoing data analysis and are committed to using data/evaluation to better understand the impact of our work & share findings with others.\r\n\r\nOur early education strategies will be added to our logic model & evaluation plans. We plan to track the number of providers, schools, organizations, & parents engaged over time as well as the intensity and type of collaboration fostered. We will track resident growth & leadership over time using our existing civic engagement tools that track self-identified leadership goals & participation in leadership academies, actions, etc."

We have also brought cross-sector partners together to strategize and work towards shared goals – non-profits, schools, and institutional partners alike.  \r\n\r\nThe sheer range of our strategies is also unique, encompassing direct services, the building of local capacity, shifting of local cultures, and impacting broader systemic change."

    answer: "In January of 2014, the PBH collaborative announced a visionary “Catalyst for Change” campaign to recognize its second grant from AT&T Aspire and to raise commitments from local public and private partners to raise $2.5 million in funding to support deepening and expansion of PBH strategies through 2017.  \r\n\r\nParticipants in the press conference included Honorable Mayor Eric Garcetti, County of Los Angeles Board Supervisor Hilda Solis, and Council Member Jose Huizar for District 14.  The City of Los Angeles pledged its commitment to partner with Promesa Boyle Heights and similar placed-based efforts that bring together the local community to advance a shared vision and innovative strategies and partnerships that improve outcomes for children and families.  \r\n\r\nThe total 3-year cost for our Project is $2,500,000. We have raised $1,200,000 in foundation grants, in-kind commitments from residents and our partner organizations, and non-cash contributions from the national Promise Neighborhood Institute to support our Efforts to Outcomes database. \r\n\r\nThe LA 2050 grant will allow us to cover staffing for the early education strategies and coordination of the outreach and leadership development efforts. In partnership with InnerCity Struggle, East LA Community Corporation, and Proyecto Pastoral, we will launch an outreach campaign, update our leadership academy curriculum, and engage and train more residents to be part of our movement for change."

    explanation: ''
    answer: "Sustainability and scale of impact have been two prominent conversations in our Promesa BH Steering Committee. In 2011, we faced our first major hurdle when despite being among the top scorers for a highly competitive Department of Education Promise Neighborhood competition, we did not receive the $30 million grant that would have allowed us to fully implement our plan. Yet, every single individual and organization involved was inspired and determined to press on and work together towards achieving our shared vision because they felt connected and a deep sense of ownership towards the vision we developed. \r\n\r\nProyecto Pastoral as the backbone organization has been committed to the Promesa BH vision from the beginning. As a core member of the fundraising and sustainability committee, Proyecto is working with other partners to build momentum and support for the unique collective impact model we've built.\r\n\r\nWe believe that resident leadership and the spirit of collaboration have been - and will continue to be - a driving force as we work to fully implement the strategies in our original plan. This plan includes working towards the day when we have a strong Community-School and resident leadership infrastructure at each school, when we a strong and coordinated Early Learning Network, and a Transition to College Network in Boyle Heights. \r\n\r\nAs part of our involvement in the national Promise Neighborhood Institute, we are also beginning to share best practices and tools with other communities and organizations in Los Angeles and throughout the nation. We see this as an important part of our contribution towards the field of education and community transformation."
