  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "Our work began in 2010, when Boyle Heights became one of 21 communities nationally to receive a Promise Neighborhood planning grant from the US DOE.  We galvanized a planning process in which 4000+ youth, adult residents, educators, and community partners came together to share lived experiences, reflect on community data, and develop a common vision and action plan.\r\n\r\nWe transitioned into the first phase of implementation of our plan in 2011. With no dedicated funding, we embarked on the plan’s first strategy:  establishment of a community-school model at Mendez HS with the goal of increasing graduation rates and building a college going culture. Together, we:  1) formalized results-oriented partnerships between school staff, families & organizations;  2) launched targeted interventions for the most at-risk students, and 3) hired an Achievement Counselor to coordinate college readiness efforts. \r\n\r\nIn the end, we raised the graduation rate by nearly 30% from 2010 and 2015. Recently, Mendez HS became the most improved traditional HS in California with a 76-point API gain and the highest cohort of students accepted to college since the school’s opening. We began scaling up and building similar efforts at Hollenbeck MS and Roosevelt HS.  Next, we will:\r\n\r\n1. Begin construction of the early education and elementary school strategies in our cradle-to-career Road to Success.  We will sustain our current efforts and launch a campaign to increase awareness and connect families of children 0-8 to child development, wellness, support groups & other community resources. In collaboration with early education providers, schools & families, we will develop a shared plan of action to expand access and quality to early education opportunies & transitional supports from Pre-K to 3rd grade.\r\n\r\n2. Engage and empower 2000+ new residents. We will support existing resident leaders in disseminating academic and wellness information, linking families to the existing Promesa Wellness Series, and galvanizing more community participation in community campaigns that expand access to school-based wellness centers, affordable housing, early education opportunities, and foster funding equity and transparency in the schools. \r\n\r\n3. We will continue to be a thought leader and an action leader in the placed-based, community-school, and collective impact communities of practice, helping integrate cross-sector approaches that expand the boundaries of education and community transformation."

  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Evaluation of our existing Community-School (C-S) model in the schools draws from student-level quantitative & qualitative data. Our C-S model at Mendez HS is part of a comparison group evaluation by AT&T Aspire to empirically assess the impact of our efforts. We have a PN evaluation plan that is the foundation for development/implementation of our evaluation/data systems. We will evaluate projected impact through ongoing data analysis and are committed to using data/evaluation to better understand the impact of our work & share findings with others.\r\n\r\nOur early education strategies will be added to our logic model & evaluation plans. We plan to track the number of providers, schools, organizations, & parents engaged over time as well as the intensity and type of collaboration fostered. We will track resident growth & leadership over time using our existing civic engagement tools that track self-identified leadership goals & participation in leadership academies, actions, etc."
