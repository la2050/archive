  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: "Forty years ago, it was unthinkable to live a life with an artificial heart, with somebody else’s heart, or with an assist heart pump. The unfathomable experiences of a person in interaction with the scientific and technological advances as experienced in advanced heart failure are novel to patients and their families, and unknown to health care professionals (e.g. http://ampersand.gseis.ucla.edu/federica-raia-book-on-relational-medicine-reveals-doctor-patient-collaboration-2/; http://newsroom.ucla.edu/stories/q-a:-federica-raia-and-life-with-a-new-heart ). For the last five years, Dr. Federica Raia conducted an ethnographic and participatory research study on the practice of high-tech modern medicine in collaboration with the advanced heart failure cardiologist Dr. Mario Deng, director of the UCLA Integrated Advanced Heart Failure-Mechanical Support-Heart Transplant Program. Based on ethnographic work and the analysis of recorded medical encounters following patients with their doctor encounters for two years, the authors provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the practice of high-tech modern medicine (PS More information about this book can be found in http://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/9065). What Dr. Raia discovered in her research revealed that the marvels of technology mandate the practice of Relational Medicine, i.e. the integration of body, science technology and personhood into one singular framework of practice and that this integration can mean the difference between life and death. For the thousands of heart failure patients that receive treatment at UCLA Reagan Medical Center, their often prolonged recovery can critically diminish their physical, mental and spiritual health.\r\n\r\nThe Relational Medicine Foundation aims to launch an art intervention program that allows patients – through art and creative pursuits – to keep them optimistic through their recovery. Patients spend such long periods of time in the hospital due to their Heart Disease, and providing them with an opportunity to express their emotions creatively would be invaluable to their mental and physical health to ultimately decrease the Heart Failure burden. We hope that our project will serve as a model to other medical centers. It is in our vision to support future research that will advance Heart Failure knowledge and care."

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    A broad range of communities have a stake in the effectiveness of our
    healthcare system in the patient healing process. A barrier we expect to
    overcome lies in the involvement of the community in the development of a
    research team that engages the patients, family members, or the caregivers
    to feel as partners in the expansion of this project, including
    representatives of the population of interest. This refers to the meaningful
    involvement of patients, caregivers, clinicians, and other healthcare
    stakeholders throughout the research process—from topic selection through
    design and conduct of research to dissemination of research results. The
    research team will participate in the development of behavioral incentives
    for patients, studying the effects on Patients’ access to care, coordination
    of care across healthcare settings, and in the development of an effective
    qualitative method of measuring the Health Care Outcomes of our project to
    establish further mechanisms of grant funding.  
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Dr. Federica Raia, a complexity scientist and assistant professor in the UCLA Graduate School of Education and Information Studies and the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine, has extensive experience evaluating the impact of ethnographic work and the analysis of recorded medical encounters following patients with their doctor encounters for two years, and she has provided a comprehensive framework for understanding the practice of the patient-doctor collaboration in high-tech modern medicine. With Dr. Mario Deng, Professor Raia has established the Relational Medicine Foundation.\r\nTo measure community level impact of using the arts to aid patients in their journey of healing and to educate patients about preventative measures, we will work with the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health to develop questionnaires further distributed to the community electronically.  The questionnaires could be distributed to community members through an app developed to display the patients’ work."
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "Organizations conducting similar research of humanism in medicine, such as the Arnold P. Gold Foundation, also focus on the patient perspective and the patient-practitioner relationship. The Myocarditis Foundation, established by a previous patient of Dr. Deng’s, is dedicated to providing accurate and up-to-date information to medical professionals, patients and their families, and to the scientific advancement of both the diagnosis and treatment of the disease.  The uniqueness of the Relational Medicine Foundation and its approach of the Relational Medicine Theory lies in the way of practicing medicine that maintains the basic human right of personhood, not only for the patients, but – in order to really help their patients- for health care professionals as well. It doesn’t divide the person from the body. It integrates personhood, body, science, and technology. In this framework, doctors interact with patients in a different way. They don’t separate medical talk and [personal] talk. Everything is intertwined because the doctors grow particularly attuned to the need of this integration and understand that a patient has to own the situation – it is their heart, their life. If they do not have a sense of ownership, they do not survive. \r\nRelational Medicine also focuses on the relational web that binds physical things, the machines and persons together into a meaningful whole, and reconstituting the patient’s identity. The theory is that viewing the patient from the biomedical perspective is not sufficient. Dr. Raia and Dr. Deng have analyzed the recorded patient-doctor discourse in their consecutive encounters over a period of up to two years, an expert advanced heart failure cardiologist creates a meaningful path together with the patient to operate what we call a transformation. In the medical encounter, transformation manifests, for example, in emergence of the patient-doctor dyad becoming of fundamental importance to both patient and doctor and continually protected by the doctor. Together, patient and doctor create a safe space where in all that has broken down in this specific patient’s life, the role of the health care professional is to help this person start making sense of her/his life, and start coping with things in the world in her/his own way as the world starts becoming familiar again. In this process, a transforming identity becomes recognizable to the patient. Integrating this new way of being is very important in relational medicine. \r\n"
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "The Relational Medicine Foundation evolved as a multistakeholder project in New York City (since 2009) and Los Angeles (since 2011).  It is this opportunity that our foundation is addressing and for which we request funding to: 1) support the Foundation, 2) endow a UCLA-Fellowship “Humanism in Advanced Heart Failure”, 3) endow a Chair in “Humanism in High-Tech Modern Medicine”, and 4) endow the RelationalAct Research and Education (RARE) Program/Center/Institute at UCLA.

In Dr. Raia’s research, she has uncovered that you do not just repeat what you have heard or what has been taught to you, you make it your own. And as you own it, it changes, it is yours.  Our goal is to support the Relational Medicine Theory concept of owning the experience through this vehicle of the patient art therapy project that we have been propelling forward. It has been thus far a collaboration between UCLA student volunteers, Marymount High School, the Santa Monica Dept. of Art, UCLA students, UCLA professors, and UCLA physician-scientists.  Since our program relies on student-based volunteer work, a total of $10,000 will be necessary for our collaborations per institution with various institutions.  Funding will also be used in order to develop predominantly qualitative metrics to measure our program success on both a patient and community level using Dr. Raia’s research methods.  Additionally, funding could be used for collaborations with the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health.\r\n\r\n"
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': "a.\t$100.000 will most likely be close to sufficient to cover the costs of the goals we have established for the next 12 months.  In order to raise awareness in the media and in the community about the arts therapy project and the Foundation, we may require additional funding (please see the example article: http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303795304576452140505285416.) Many additional costs would be covered by future UCLA Spark Crowdsourcing campaigns. Through a previous UCLA Spark Crowdsourcing campaign, we were able to gain support from our immediate community and raise $10,000 (please see: https://spark.ucla.edu/project/534704cb0920657409de158d.) Additional costs may also be covered through private donations. If the relationship and communication between healthcare providers and patients could be improved by the use of the principles of Relational Medicine Theory, 1) patient preferences would be taken more seriously and satisfaction with health care providers could be greatly enhanced 2) higher quality care with improved outcomes would be delivered to the entire patient population 3) the reduction in medical errors and the subsequent human and monetary benefits could be staggering and, thus, 4) cost-effectiveness in the entire health system would be enhanced. Current strategies are falling short of reaching these goals and it is this opportunity that our foundation, as a catalyst, is addressing and for which we request support.\r\n"
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "a.\tThe first step we would like to take in the Relational Medicine Foundation project in incorporating use of the arts as a healing tool in medicine is in the development of the arts therapy program. Because the program will rely on a primarily volunteer basis, as already discussed with UCLA Volunteer Services, consisting of patient volunteers, students, and a few paid licensed art therapists, we request an additional $50,000 to kickstart the program.  $8,000 of this amount will cover the art supplies necessary (sketchbooks, canvases, paints, easels etc.).  $12,000 will be allotted to compensating the art therapists.  $5,000 will be necessary to compensate the administrative assistants we have been in contact with at the UCLA Heart & Lung Transplant Center.  $5,000 will be necessary for the development of behavioral incentives for patients, with the help of the UCLA East-West Centers and the Mindful Awareness Center, also in close collaboration with the Hammer museum. In order to begin to transform the relationship between a healthcare professional and patient into a patient-doctor collaboration, using art as a tool of patient empowerment and mindfulness, we aim to raise awareness in the media about our project through a 3 to 4 minute documentary, utilizing $10,000 in expenses.  $5,000 will be used to fund a Social Media expert to further expedite the success of the project and discover further mechanisms for funding. Additionally, $10,000 will be used to set up a performance at UCLA raising awareness for the project’s cause (please see: http://dailybruin.com/2012/05/03/patientphysician_dynamic_get_dramatic_treatment_in_emotion_theater_project_performances/ .)  Relational Medicine Consortiums around the City of Los Angeles can integrate these performances, as well as research, into community outreach about utilizing a new approach in high tech modern medicine. $30,000 total would be allotted to three consortiums in the upcoming year.  An additional $10,000 will be necessary to develop a mechanism for stimulating discussion about the project on the Relational Medicine website and to outreach to perspectives of patients and medical leaders worldwide.  "
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    Findings from a study released in 2010 by the Society of Actuaries indicate
    that measurable medical errors cost the US economy $19.5 billion in 2008,
    such that of the approximately $80 billion in cost related to medical
    injuries, 25% were the result of preventable medical errors. However,
    current strategies, while improving the situation, are conceptually falling
    short of reaching the goal of strengthening the doctor-patient relationship.
    The systematic patient information delivery and patient empowerment requires
    a more radical conceptual approach of changing the role distribution between
    healthcare provider and patient to consultant (healthcare provider) and
    empowered decision-maker (Patient).  The success of the project proposed
    will be determined through Dr. Raia’s encounter research and through
    questionnaires provided to patients pre- and post- the art therapy program
    experiences.  Additionally, as the project aims to provide communities with
    cutting edge research results and preventative measures to decrease
    knowledge gaps in disparities in the healthcare system, differences in
    disease instance and patient knowledge measured by hired implementation
    staff using public health research methods can aid in determining the
    success of the project of establishing an arts therapy program. Relational
    practices are therefore of fundamental importance, not only for future
    health care professionals but also to the students in UCLA’s Department of
    Education. Based on this, Dr. Raia designed a course based on this research,
    in which their book will be the required text. This coming fall, Dr. Raia
    and Dr. Deng will be teaching the UCLA course “Educational Perspectives of
    Relational Practices in Modern Medicine,” and thus, involvement in of the
    future generation of students in this project across the City of Los Angeles
    additionally determine the success of this project.  This would only be
    possible with your support.  Your donation will forward our goals by
    supporting our movement to identify a better process that will include
    patients’ perspective more fully into clinical practice, support the
    dissemination of research results to reduce disparities that create
    knowledge gaps in medical encounters, and create a humanistically more
    powerful framework for high-tech modern medicine.

  campaigns. Through a previous UCLA Spark Crowdsourcing campaign, we were able
  to gain support from our immediate community and raise $10,000 (please see:
  https://spark.ucla.edu/project/534704cb0920657409de158d.) Additional costs may
  also be covered through private donations. If the relationship and
  communication between healthcare providers and patients could be improved by
  the use of the principles of Relational Medicine Theory, 1) patient
  preferences would be taken more seriously and satisfaction with health care
  providers could be greatly enhanced 2) higher quality care with improved
  outcomes would be delivered to the entire patient population 3) the reduction
  in medical errors and the subsequent human and monetary benefits could be
  staggering and, thus, 4) cost-effectiveness in the entire health system would
  be enhanced. Current strategies are falling short of reaching these goals and
  it is this opportunity that our foundation, as a catalyst, is addressing and
  for which we request support.

  a. The first step we would like to take in the Relational Medicine Foundation
  project in incorporating use of the arts as a healing tool in medicine is in
  the development of the arts therapy program. Because the program will rely on
  a primarily volunteer basis, as already discussed with UCLA Volunteer
  Services, consisting of patient volunteers, students, and a few paid licensed
  art therapists, we request an additional $50,000 to kickstart the program.
  $8,000 of this amount will cover the art supplies necessary (sketchbooks,
  canvases, paints, easels etc.). $12,000 will be allotted to compensating the
  art therapists. $5,000 will be necessary to compensate the administrative
  assistants we have been in contact with at the UCLA Heart & Lung Transplant
  Center. $5,000 will be necessary for the development of behavioral incentives
  for patients, with the help of the UCLA East-West Centers and the Mindful
  Awareness Center, also in close collaboration with the Hammer museum. In order
  to begin to transform the relationship between a healthcare professional and
  patient into a patient-doctor collaboration, using art as a tool of patient
  empowerment and mindfulness, we aim to raise awareness in the media about our
  project through a 3 to 4 minute documentary, utilizing $10,000 in expenses.
  $5,000 will be used to fund a Social Media expert to further expedite the
  success of the project and discover further mechanisms for funding.
  Additionally, $10,000 will be used to set up a performance at UCLA raising
  awareness for the project’s cause (please see:
  http://dailybruin.com/2012/05/03/patientphysician_dynamic_get_dramatic_treatment_in_emotion_theater_project_performances/
  .) Relational Medicine Consortiums around the City of Los Angeles can
  integrate these performances, as well as research, into community outreach
  about utilizing a new approach in high tech modern medicine. $30,000 total
  would be allotted to three consortiums in the upcoming year. An additional
  $10,000 will be necessary to develop a mechanism for stimulating discussion
  about the project on the Relational Medicine website and to outreach to
  perspectives of patients and medical leaders worldwide.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Findings from a study released in 2010 by the Society of Actuaries indicate
  that measurable medical errors cost the US economy $19.5 billion in 2008, such
  that of the approximately $80 billion in cost related to medical injuries, 25%
  were the result of preventable medical errors. However, current strategies,
  while improving the situation, are conceptually falling short of reaching the
  goal of strengthening the doctor-patient relationship. The systematic patient
  information delivery and patient empowerment requires a more radical
  conceptual approach of changing the role distribution between healthcare
  provider and patient to consultant (healthcare provider) and empowered
  decision-maker (Patient). The success of the project proposed will be
  determined through Dr. Raia’s encounter research and through questionnaires
  provided to patients pre- and post- the art therapy program experiences.
  Additionally, as the project aims to provide communities with cutting edge
  research results and preventative measures to decrease knowledge gaps in
  disparities in the healthcare system, differences in disease instance and
  patient knowledge measured by hired implementation staff using public health
  research methods can aid in determining the success of the project of
  establishing an arts therapy program. Relational practices are therefore of
  fundamental importance, not only for future health care professionals but also
  to the students in UCLA’s Department of Education. Based on this, Dr. Raia
  designed a course based on this research, in which their book will be the
  required text. This coming fall, Dr. Raia and Dr. Deng will be teaching the
  UCLA course “Educational Perspectives of Relational Practices in Modern
  Medicine,” and thus, involvement in of the future generation of students in
  this project across the City of Los Angeles additionally determine the success
  of this project. This would only be possible with your support. Your donation
  will forward our goals by supporting our movement to identify a better process
  that will include patients’ perspective more fully into clinical practice,
  support the dissemination of research results to reduce disparities that
  create knowledge gaps in medical encounters, and create a humanistically more
  powerful framework for high-tech modern medicine.
