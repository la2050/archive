  Re:Ciclos is a Los Angeles-based project that recycles landfill-bound steel
  bicycles and redirects them into the hands of youth who redesign, re-fabricate
  and assemble them into cargo bicycles that are then distributed to
  communities, individuals, organizations/businesses that will use them in their
  everyday endeavors.  Re:Ciclos seeks to empower students by offering an
  educational platform that puts their creations to work in their own
  communities and makes L.A. the best place to live.

  resources and its excessive pollution impact. Re:Ciclos empowers both its
  students and cargo bike recipients to directly address these negative
  consequences in our city through direct action. The positive effects of the
  Re:Ciclos project: 
   
   >Youth education and empowerment
   >Replaces car trips with more bicycle trips
   >General improvement of the physical environment by mitigating pollution
   >Assists in traffic congestion reduction 
   >Greatly improves the health of those utilizing cargo bicycles through regular exercise
   >Creation of more hospitable social environment for citizens by providing safer streets
   >Redirects bicycles bound for a landfill by upcycling them in creating affordable human powered vehicles
   >Engages a new narrative for the future of mobility in Los Angeles that is low-cost, green and accessible to its diverse communities
   >Creates a learning environment that is collaborative, honors and celebrates individual contribution while upholding community interest.
   
   By educating its youth to take control of its transportation modes, Re:Ciclos tools the future with mobility alternatives that are healthy, viable and that mitigate global pollution and replaces negative and damaging consumer cycles with ones that reduce, re-use and recycle. The Los Angeles that Re:Ciclos envisions is filled with bicycle trips and infrastructure, healthy citizens, safe streets for all and a physical environment that reinvigorates the process of renewal rather than continuing to feed the deleterious effects of car culture.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  There is one major challenge that Re:Ciclos considers: follow-through for
  students.
   
   Fabricating bicycles takes dedication and concentration. Students will have personalities, life circumstances and timing that will be factors in a their ability to engage fully. Re:Ciclos takes a collaborative, creative and hands-on approach to teaching, always engaging the student with challenges and perspectives which will solicit participation, self-sufficiency and collective problem solving. Further, working hand-in-hand with educational institutions to credit their students toward academic goals will incentivize students in completion of work. Moreover, having the students working directly with clients, seeing their work first-hand in action in communities of need further empowers their contributions and informs their ability to enact change in issues that affect them, their city and the world at large.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Fabricating cargo bicycles is a self-evaluating process. Each bicycle will be
  unique in design as students work with clients collaboratively to meet
  specific needs and application. At the realization of each of project
  Re:Ciclos will engage the recipients and students in evaluating the work and
  function of each bicycle to improve upon process and product. Further,
  students are invited to return to the program as mentors to assist new
  participants in tackling all aspects of design, community/client engagement
  and fabrication. Re:Ciclos is a three-way street: teachers, students and
  clients will work together in stages to ultimately arrive at a program that
  delivers its message and goal. Students, instructors and clients alike will
  conduct group evaluation at the end of each session with the aim of
  incorporating the aggregate wisdom into the future curriculum.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There are currently no organizations doing the specific work we propose doing
  in Los Angeles. While community bicycle repair spaces exists, none of the
  current projects have the capacity or programming to fabricate, educate and
  engage with their communities to the degree and in the hands-on manner that
  Re:Ciclos proposes. Further, our city is in dire need of more alternative
  transportation both with regard to selection and accessibility. Cargo bicycles
  enable a diverse group of citizens to choose healthier and more affordable
  modes of mobility. Re:Ciclos is a project that bridges youth empowerment,
  education, environmental responsibility and transportation in an immediately
  demonstrable and effective action: bicycling.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  The Bicycle Kitchen is the fiscal sponsor of Re:Ciclos. Re:Ciclos will be
  incurring space, insurance, material and administrative costs associated with
  utilizing the Bicycle Kitchen facility as its home and promoting its project.
  Our budget details these costs incurred.
   Re:Ciclos has further entered into contract with RMH Media, a public-relations and marketing firm working with non-profits, to assist in promotions, grant and media management. For their work, RMH Media will receive 10% of monies raised through this effort.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  Projected budget for Re:Ciclos is $150,000. The project is currently
  establishing a crowd-sourced fundraising campaign along with several
  fundraising events. Additionally, Re:Ciclos programming incorporates sale of
  cargo bicycles at a sliding scale to individuals, organizations and or
  businesses to offset the cost of materials and consumables used in the
  fabrication process.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
  Re:Ciclos takes a multi-disciplinary approach to achieving its mission -- the
  budget is broken up into the base essentials necessary to achieve its
  program. 
   
   EQUIPMENT ($15,100) -- Used in the fabrication process are several machines and specialty tools specific to frame building cargo bikes.
   OFFICE/UTILITIES/RENT ($13,015) -- Re:Ciclos will need to run a small office in keeping track of allocated funds and its general programming. Insurance is included in this line item.
   
   POSITIONS/SALARIES ($54, 500) -- Re:Ciclos seeks to employ key individuals to deliver its services and mission. Current part-time positions break down:
   Executive Dir. $15,000
   Technical Dir. $15,000
   Project Mngr. $20,000
   Assoc. Fringe Benefits $4,500
   (note: figures = $54,500)
   
   MATERIALS ($5,100) --metal tubing, metallurgical & welding supplies. 
   PROGRAM MANUAL ($1,000)--guiding document in its pedagogy, fabrication approach & student interface.
   WEB MNGT ($1,285)
   PR/MEDIA/GRANT MNGT ($10,000)
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Increasing capacity is crucial in all aspects of the operation of Re:Ciclos.
  The number of cargo bicycles produced, students accredited, clients and
  community engaged, car trips reduced and a future of human-powered mobility in
  Los Angeles re-envisioned will serve as a scaling platform for the success of
  the project. Beyond that, the by-product of community collaborative design and
  initiative will produce an environment that can be replicated in different
  neighborhoods of the city with the purpose of gradually shifting from a
  car-centric dependency to a thriving, human-powered transportation model for
  Los Angeles that it increasingly needs. Re:Ciclos is not simply offering more
  bicycles--it is creating a venue and providing the tools to transform how its
  future imagines where to go and how to get there.
   
   Initially, the project will be broken up into six-week sessions, producing six cargo bicycles at a time. A total of three sessions will be held throughout the year. As capacity increases, Re:Ciclos aspires to run full-time, thereby increasing production and additionally engaging with more clientele to provide increased transportation alternatives to families, individuals, businesses and/or partners and organizations seeking to make a positive impact for the City of Los Angeles everyday and into the future. Long term, Re:Ciclos aspires to establish workshops, either as extensions of itself or as stand-alone cooperatives in East and South Los Angeles to impact those communities positively.
   
   Lastly, Re:Ciclos will be providing certificates of completion for participants fabricating cargo bicycles. Moreover, the project invites participants to continue involvement with the institution as mentors and to increase the scope of what the project delivers.
   
   Los Angeles is an amplifier of content. What succeeds in L.A. has the potential to influence what succeeds in other parts of the world. Re:Ciclos delivering alternative, affordable, functional, clean and accessible new modes of transport in this great city has the potential to foment this on a global scale, such as was seen with private, motorized automobiles a century ago. Increasing cargo bicycle presence in Los Angeles establishes a new scale: one that looks at the problem of mobility today and begins the healing process for a future that can no longer support its current transportation paradigm.

    answer: "Los Angeles is choked by the private automobile's endless usurping of resources and its excessive pollution impact.  Re:Ciclos empowers both its students and cargo bike recipients to directly address these negative consequences in our city through direct action.  The positive effects of the Re:Ciclos project:  \r\n\r\n>Youth education and empowerment\r\n>Replaces car trips with more bicycle trips\r\n>General improvement of the physical environment by mitigating pollution\r\n>Assists in traffic congestion reduction \r\n>Greatly improves the health of those utilizing cargo bicycles through regular exercise\r\n>Creation of more hospitable social environment for citizens by providing safer streets\r\n>Redirects bicycles bound for a landfill by upcycling them in creating affordable human powered vehicles\r\n>Engages a new narrative for the future of mobility in Los Angeles that is low-cost, green and accessible to its diverse communities\r\n>Creates a learning environment that is collaborative, honors and celebrates individual contribution while upholding community interest.\r\n\r\nBy educating its youth to take control of its transportation modes, Re:Ciclos tools the future with mobility alternatives that are healthy, viable and that mitigate global pollution and replaces negative and damaging consumer cycles with ones that reduce, re-use and recycle.  The Los Angeles that Re:Ciclos envisions is filled with bicycle trips and infrastructure, healthy citizens, safe streets for all and a physical environment that reinvigorates the process of renewal rather than continuing to feed the deleterious effects of car culture. \r\n"

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "There is one major challenge that Re:Ciclos considers:  follow-through for students.\r\n\r\nFabricating bicycles takes dedication and concentration.  Students will have personalities, life circumstances and timing that will be factors in a their ability to engage fully.  Re:Ciclos takes a collaborative, creative and hands-on approach to teaching, always engaging the student with challenges and perspectives which will solicit participation, self-sufficiency and collective problem solving.  Further, working hand-in-hand with educational institutions to credit their students toward academic goals will incentivize students in completion of work.  Moreover, having the students working directly with clients, seeing their work first-hand in action in communities of need further empowers their contributions and informs their ability to enact change in issues that affect them, their city and the world at large."
  - name: Please explain how you will evaluate your work.
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      Fabricating cargo bicycles is a self-evaluating process.  Each bicycle
      will be unique in design as students work with clients collaboratively to
      meet specific needs and application.  At the realization of each of
      project Re:Ciclos will engage the recipients and students in evaluating
      the work and function of each bicycle to improve upon process and
      product.  Further, students are invited to return to the program as
      mentors to assist new participants in tackling all aspects of design,
      community/client engagement and fabrication. Re:Ciclos is a three-way
      street: teachers, students and clients will work together in stages to
      ultimately arrive at a program that delivers its message and goal. 
      Students, instructors and clients alike will conduct group evaluation at
      the end of each session with the aim of incorporating the aggregate wisdom
      into the future curriculum.

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      There are currently no organizations doing the specific work we propose
      doing in Los Angeles.  While community bicycle repair spaces exists, none
      of the current projects have the capacity or programming to fabricate,
      educate and engage with their communities to the degree and in the
      hands-on manner that Re:Ciclos proposes.  Further, our city is in dire
      need of more alternative transportation both with regard to selection and
      accessibility.  Cargo bicycles enable a diverse group of citizens to
      choose healthier and more affordable modes of mobility.  Re:Ciclos is a
      project that bridges youth empowerment, education, environmental
      responsibility and transportation in an immediately demonstrable and

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Increasing capacity is crucial in all aspects of the operation of Re:Ciclos.  The number of cargo bicycles produced, students accredited, clients and community engaged, car trips reduced and a future of human-powered mobility in Los Angeles re-envisioned will serve as a scaling platform for the success of the project.  Beyond that, the by-product of community collaborative design and initiative will produce an environment that can be replicated in different neighborhoods of the city with the purpose of gradually shifting from a car-centric dependency to a thriving, human-powered transportation model for Los Angeles that it increasingly needs.  Re:Ciclos is not simply offering more bicycles--it is creating a venue and providing the tools to transform how its future imagines where to go and how to get there.\r\n\r\nInitially, the project will be broken up into six-week sessions, producing six cargo bicycles at a time.  A total of three sessions will be held throughout the year.  As capacity increases, Re:Ciclos aspires to run full-time, thereby increasing production and additionally engaging with more clientele to provide increased transportation alternatives to families, individuals, businesses and/or partners and organizations seeking to make a positive impact for the City of Los Angeles everyday and into the future.  Long term, Re:Ciclos aspires to establish workshops, either as extensions of itself or as stand-alone cooperatives in East and South Los Angeles to impact those communities positively.\r\n\r\nLastly, Re:Ciclos will be providing certificates of completion for participants fabricating cargo bicycles.  Moreover, the project invites participants to continue involvement with the institution as mentors and to increase the scope of what the project delivers.\r\n\r\nLos Angeles is an amplifier of content.  What succeeds in L.A. has the potential to influence what succeeds in other parts of the world.  Re:Ciclos delivering alternative, affordable, functional, clean and accessible new modes of transport in this great city has the potential to foment this on a global scale, such as was seen with private, motorized automobiles a century ago.  Increasing cargo bicycle presence in Los Angeles establishes a new scale:  one that looks at the problem of mobility today and begins the healing process for a future that can no longer support its current transportation paradigm.\r\n"
