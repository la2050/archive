title: 'Re:Ciclos a movement by bicycle. A new project of the Bicycle Kitchen'
project_summary: >-
  Re:Ciclos is a Los Angeles-based project that recycles landfill-bound steel
  bicycles and redirects them into the hands of youth who redesign, re-fabricate
  and assemble them into cargo bicycles that are then distributed to
  communities, individuals, organizations/businesses that will use them in their
  everyday endeavors.  Re:Ciclos seeks to empower students by offering an
  educational platform that puts their creations to work in their own
  communities and makes L.A. the best place to live.

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "There is one major challenge that Re:Ciclos considers:  follow-through for students.\r\n\r\nFabricating bicycles takes dedication and concentration.  Students will have personalities, life circumstances and timing that will be factors in a their ability to engage fully.  Re:Ciclos takes a collaborative, creative and hands-on approach to teaching, always engaging the student with challenges and perspectives which will solicit participation, self-sufficiency and collective problem solving.  Further, working hand-in-hand with educational institutions to credit their students toward academic goals will incentivize students in completion of work.  Moreover, having the students working directly with clients, seeing their work first-hand in action in communities of need further empowers their contributions and informs their ability to enact change in issues that affect them, their city and the world at large."
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    Fabricating cargo bicycles is a self-evaluating process.  Each bicycle will
    be unique in design as students work with clients collaboratively to meet
    specific needs and application.  At the realization of each of project
    Re:Ciclos will engage the recipients and students in evaluating the work and
    function of each bicycle to improve upon process and product.  Further,
    students are invited to return to the program as mentors to assist new
    participants in tackling all aspects of design, community/client engagement
    and fabrication. Re:Ciclos is a three-way street: teachers, students and
    clients will work together in stages to ultimately arrive at a program that
    delivers its message and goal.  Students, instructors and clients alike will
    conduct group evaluation at the end of each session with the aim of
    incorporating the aggregate wisdom into the future curriculum.
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    There are currently no organizations doing the specific work we propose
    doing in Los Angeles.  While community bicycle repair spaces exists, none of
    the current projects have the capacity or programming to fabricate, educate
    and engage with their communities to the degree and in the hands-on manner
    that Re:Ciclos proposes.  Further, our city is in dire need of more
    alternative transportation both with regard to selection and accessibility. 
    Cargo bicycles enable a diverse group of citizens to choose healthier and
    more affordable modes of mobility.  Re:Ciclos is a project that bridges
    youth empowerment, education, environmental responsibility and
    transportation in an immediately demonstrable and effective action: 
    bicycling. 
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "The Bicycle Kitchen is the fiscal sponsor of Re:Ciclos.  Re:Ciclos will be incurring space, insurance, material and administrative costs associated with utilizing the Bicycle Kitchen facility as its home and promoting its project.  Our budget details these costs incurred.\r\nRe:Ciclos has further entered into contract with RMH Media, a public-relations and marketing firm working with non-profits, to assist in promotions, grant and media management.  For their work, RMH Media will receive 10% of monies raised through this effort.\r\n"
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    Projected budget for Re:Ciclos is $150,000.  The project is currently
    establishing a crowd-sourced fundraising campaign along with several
    fundraising events.  Additionally, Re:Ciclos programming incorporates sale
    of cargo bicycles at a sliding scale to individuals, organizations and or
    businesses to offset the cost of materials and consumables used in the
    fabrication process.
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Re:Ciclos takes a multi-disciplinary approach to achieving its mission -- the budget is broken up into the base essentials necessary to achieve its program. \r\n\r\nEQUIPMENT ($15,100) -- Used in the fabrication process are several machines and specialty tools specific to frame building cargo bikes.\r\nOFFICE/UTILITIES/RENT ($13,015) -- Re:Ciclos will need to run a small office in keeping track of allocated funds and its general programming.  Insurance is included in this line item.\r\n\r\nPOSITIONS/SALARIES ($54, 500) -- Re:Ciclos seeks to employ key individuals to deliver its services and mission. Current part-time positions break down:\r\nExecutive Dir. $15,000\r\nTechnical Dir. $15,000\r\nProject Mngr. $20,000\r\nAssoc. Fringe Benefits $4,500\r\n(note: figures = $54,500)\r\n\r\nMATERIALS ($5,100) --metal tubing, metallurgical & welding supplies.   \r\nPROGRAM MANUAL ($1,000)--guiding document in its pedagogy, fabrication approach & student interface.\r\nWEB MNGT ($1,285)\r\nPR/MEDIA/GRANT MNGT ($10,000)"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "Increasing capacity is crucial in all aspects of the operation of Re:Ciclos.  The number of cargo bicycles produced, students accredited, clients and community engaged, car trips reduced and a future of human-powered mobility in Los Angeles re-envisioned will serve as a scaling platform for the success of the project.  Beyond that, the by-product of community collaborative design and initiative will produce an environment that can be replicated in different neighborhoods of the city with the purpose of gradually shifting from a car-centric dependency to a thriving, human-powered transportation model for Los Angeles that it increasingly needs.  Re:Ciclos is not simply offering more bicycles--it is creating a venue and providing the tools to transform how its future imagines where to go and how to get there.\r\n\r\nInitially, the project will be broken up into six-week sessions, producing six cargo bicycles at a time.  A total of three sessions will be held throughout the year.  As capacity increases, Re:Ciclos aspires to run full-time, thereby increasing production and additionally engaging with more clientele to provide increased transportation alternatives to families, individuals, businesses and/or partners and organizations seeking to make a positive impact for the City of Los Angeles everyday and into the future.  Long term, Re:Ciclos aspires to establish workshops, either as extensions of itself or as stand-alone cooperatives in East and South Los Angeles to impact those communities positively.\r\n\r\nLastly, Re:Ciclos will be providing certificates of completion for participants fabricating cargo bicycles.  Moreover, the project invites participants to continue involvement with the institution as mentors and to increase the scope of what the project delivers.\r\n\r\nLos Angeles is an amplifier of content.  What succeeds in L.A. has the potential to influence what succeeds in other parts of the world.  Re:Ciclos delivering alternative, affordable, functional, clean and accessible new modes of transport in this great city has the potential to foment this on a global scale, such as was seen with private, motorized automobiles a century ago.  Increasing cargo bicycle presence in Los Angeles establishes a new scale:  one that looks at the problem of mobility today and begins the healing process for a future that can no longer support its current transportation paradigm.\r\n"

  The number of cargo bicycles produced, students accredited, clients and
