title: 'Re:Ciclos a movement by bicycle. A new project of the Bicycle Kitchen'
project_summary: >-
  Re:Ciclos is a Los Angeles-based project that recycles landfill-bound steel
  bicycles and redirects them into the hands of youth who redesign, re-fabricate
  and assemble them into cargo bicycles that are then distributed to
  communities, individuals, organizations/businesses that will use them in their
  everyday endeavors.  Re:Ciclos seeks to empower students by offering an
  educational platform that puts their creations to work in their own
  communities and makes L.A. the best place to live.

  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    Fabricating cargo bicycles is a self-evaluating process.  Each bicycle will
    be unique in design as students work with clients collaboratively to meet
    specific needs and application.  At the realization of each of project
    Re:Ciclos will engage the recipients and students in evaluating the work and
    function of each bicycle to improve upon process and product.  Further,
    students are invited to return to the program as mentors to assist new
    participants in tackling all aspects of design, community/client engagement
    and fabrication. Re:Ciclos is a three-way street: teachers, students and
    clients will work together in stages to ultimately arrive at a program that
    delivers its message and goal.  Students, instructors and clients alike will
    conduct group evaluation at the end of each session with the aim of
    incorporating the aggregate wisdom into the future curriculum.
