  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to play.: "Basketball is the most popular recreational sport in the United States across all ages and genders.  The balance of individual contribution and potential for group excellence makes basketball a game that is easily shared with friends, family, neighbors and strangers. \r\n\r\nProject Backboard believes that improving basketball court facilities and installing artwork in public parks  encourages greater park usage by all ages and genders.  Increased park usage generated by facility renovation has the potential to impact park safety and build stronger communities through increasing social interaction between different groups. \r\n\r\nProject Backboard's prior initiative in Memphis resulted in 18 renovated basketball courts and 37 individual works of art, created by community members and working artists, including graphic backboards,  on court murals, tile mosaics and kinetic sculptures.  \r\n\r\nInstalling artwork on and around basketball courts brings creative thinking into the heart of communities and inspires people to imagine a future outside of their current circumstances.  Individually designed courts in each neighborhood also creates a sense of ownership and community pride which helps ensure that courts won’t be further marred with graffiti or trash and makes parks safer.  \r\n\r\nLos Angeles has a rich history of outdoor basketball and a number of successful college and professional athletes have developed their game on LA's public outdoor courts.  While Los Angeles has some great outdoor courts, it also has a number of courts which could be improved through community engagement and art enhancements.  Working with a variety of partners and stakeholders our goal is to pilot a park enhancement in the next year with the goal of ultimately completing at least 15 park projects and setting up a trustees organization for public basketball courts.  \r\n\r\nOnce courts are completed and public artwork is installed, parks will be activated with a free Full-Court 21 basketball tournament, including live music and a community block party.  Full-Court 21 allows all ages and genders to participate without requiring teammates.  \r\n\r\nLos Angeles can be a better place to play and the success of Project Backboard's efforts in Memphis will easily to a city that loves basketball and has weather suitable to outdoor basketball all year long.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"
  How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
    - Money (financial capital)
    - Volunteers/staff (human capital)
    - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
    - Community outreach
    - Network/relationship support
  How do you plan to use these resources to make change?:
    - Conduct research
    - Engage residents and stakeholders
    - Implement a pilot or new project
    - Expand a pilot or a program
  Where will you be working?:
    - City of Los Angeles
  How will your proposal improve the following “Play” metrics?:
    - Access to open space and park facilities
    - Percentage of residents that feel safe in their neighborhoods
    - Number of residents with easy access to a “vibrant” park (Dream Metric)
    - Number of parks with intergenerational play opportunities (Dream Metric)
    - Number (and quality) of informal spaces for play (Dream Metric)
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    The first step in this process is visiting and photographing all the public
    outdoor basketball courts in the city and assigning a numeric value to the
    condition of each court, including grading the surroundings, rims,
    backboards, lines, etc.  From their courts will be selected based on
    proximity to local partners, strength of stakeholders groups and the needs
    of the court.  Completed courts will be evaluated by tracking usage over
    time, depth of local engagement, number of volunteers and participants in

Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Given the public nature of the places where I plan to work, partnerships with
  the city government and parks and recreation department will be essential to
  the Project Backboard initiative. Working on public property requires
  additional considerations no present when working on private property. Given
  the public nature of the places where I plan to work, partnerships with the
  city government and parks and recreation department will be essential to the
  Project Backboard initiative. Having worked closely with the Parks and
  Neighborhoods Division in Memphis I not only understand the considerations at
  play but also have been connected with the relevant government departments in
  Los Angeles and I am confident, especially given the number of park
  improvement projects the City of Los Angeles has championed in recent years,
  that the necessity of working through red tape and city officials will make
  Project Backboard more accountable to the public and more sustainable long
  term.

  Completed courts will be evaluated by tracking usage over time, depth of local
  engagement, number of volunteers and participants in basketball tournaments.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Though basketball is the most popular recreational sport in America and many
  youth development organizations exists to teach “life skills” through the use
  of basketball and other sports, there are no other organizations which use
  basketball courts as a canvas to introduce art into communities and individual
  who might not otherwise access works of art as part of their daily lives.
  Bringing two creative endeavors, pick-up basketball and public art, together
  has a powerful impact on athletes and observers and encourage people to
  imagine a future beyond their current circumstances.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Individual local partners have not been selected yet, but typically partners
  are engaged on a volunteer basis and costs are limited to items like water and
  snacks for volunteers and other minor expenses.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Scale-ability is at the heart of Project Backboard and having complete 18
  courts in Memphis, I know that the momentum and excitement generated in one
  location builds on the next. The benefit of working on highly visible projects
  in multiple locations is that the community, especially the basketball and art
  communities, begin to become aware of the project and will often reach out
  with support and ideas. Our experience working closely with the Memphis
  Grizzlies will also help build relationships with local professional sports
  organizations, involving them in future court projects.
