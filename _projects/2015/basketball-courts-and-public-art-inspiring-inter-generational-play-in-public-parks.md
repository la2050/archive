  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to play.: "Basketball is the most popular recreational sport in the United States across all ages and genders.  The balance of individual contribution and potential for group excellence makes basketball a game that is easily shared with friends, family, neighbors and strangers. \r\n\r\nProject Backboard believes that improving basketball court facilities and installing artwork in public parks  encourages greater park usage by all ages and genders.  Increased park usage generated by facility renovation has the potential to impact park safety and build stronger communities through increasing social interaction between different groups. \r\n\r\nProject Backboard's prior initiative in Memphis resulted in 18 renovated basketball courts and 37 individual works of art, created by community members and working artists, including graphic backboards,  on court murals, tile mosaics and kinetic sculptures.  \r\n\r\nInstalling artwork on and around basketball courts brings creative thinking into the heart of communities and inspires people to imagine a future outside of their current circumstances.  Individually designed courts in each neighborhood also creates a sense of ownership and community pride which helps ensure that courts won’t be further marred with graffiti or trash and makes parks safer.  \r\n\r\nLos Angeles has a rich history of outdoor basketball and a number of successful college and professional athletes have developed their game on LA's public outdoor courts.  While Los Angeles has some great outdoor courts, it also has a number of courts which could be improved through community engagement and art enhancements.  Working with a variety of partners and stakeholders our goal is to pilot a park enhancement in the next year with the goal of ultimately completing at least 15 park projects and setting up a trustees organization for public basketball courts.  \r\n\r\nOnce courts are completed and public artwork is installed, parks will be activated with a free Full-Court 21 basketball tournament, including live music and a community block party.  Full-Court 21 allows all ages and genders to participate without requiring teammates.  \r\n\r\nLos Angeles can be a better place to play and the success of Project Backboard's efforts in Memphis will easily to a city that loves basketball and has weather suitable to outdoor basketball all year long.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

  How will your proposal improve the following “Play” metrics?:
    - Access to open space and park facilities
    - Percentage of residents that feel safe in their neighborhoods
    - Number of residents with easy access to a “vibrant” park (Dream Metric)
    - Number of parks with intergenerational play opportunities (Dream Metric)
    - Number (and quality) of informal spaces for play (Dream Metric)
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    The first step in this process is visiting and photographing all the public
    outdoor basketball courts in the city and assigning a numeric value to the
    condition of each court, including grading the surroundings, rims,
    backboards, lines, etc.  From their courts will be selected based on
    proximity to local partners, strength of stakeholders groups and the needs
    of the court.  Completed courts will be evaluated by tracking usage over
    time, depth of local engagement, number of volunteers and participants in
    basketball tournaments.
