  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to play.: "Basketball is the most popular recreational sport in the United States across all ages and genders.  The balance of individual contribution and potential for group excellence makes basketball a game that is easily shared with friends, family, neighbors and strangers. \r\n\r\nProject Backboard believes that improving basketball court facilities and installing artwork in public parks  encourages greater park usage by all ages and genders.  Increased park usage generated by facility renovation has the potential to impact park safety and build stronger communities through increasing social interaction between different groups. \r\n\r\nProject Backboard's prior initiative in Memphis resulted in 18 renovated basketball courts and 37 individual works of art, created by community members and working artists, including graphic backboards,  on court murals, tile mosaics and kinetic sculptures.  \r\n\r\nInstalling artwork on and around basketball courts brings creative thinking into the heart of communities and inspires people to imagine a future outside of their current circumstances.  Individually designed courts in each neighborhood also creates a sense of ownership and community pride which helps ensure that courts won’t be further marred with graffiti or trash and makes parks safer.  \r\n\r\nLos Angeles has a rich history of outdoor basketball and a number of successful college and professional athletes have developed their game on LA's public outdoor courts.  While Los Angeles has some great outdoor courts, it also has a number of courts which could be improved through community engagement and art enhancements.  Working with a variety of partners and stakeholders our goal is to pilot a park enhancement in the next year with the goal of ultimately completing at least 15 park projects and setting up a trustees organization for public basketball courts.  \r\n\r\nOnce courts are completed and public artwork is installed, parks will be activated with a free Full-Court 21 basketball tournament, including live music and a community block party.  Full-Court 21 allows all ages and genders to participate without requiring teammates.  \r\n\r\nLos Angeles can be a better place to play and the success of Project Backboard's efforts in Memphis will easily to a city that loves basketball and has weather suitable to outdoor basketball all year long.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    Given the public nature of the places where I plan to work, partnerships
    with the city government and parks and recreation department will be
    essential to the Project Backboard initiative.  Working on public property
    requires additional considerations no present when working on private
    property.  Given the public nature of the places where I plan to work,
    partnerships with the city government and parks and recreation department
    will be essential to the Project Backboard initiative.  Having worked
    closely with the Parks and Neighborhoods Division in Memphis I not only
    understand the considerations at play but also have been connected with the
    relevant government departments in Los Angeles and I am confident,
    especially given the number of park improvement projects the City of Los
    Angeles has championed in recent years, that the necessity of working
    through red tape and city officials will make Project Backboard more
    accountable to the public and more sustainable long term.  
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    The first step in this process is visiting and photographing all the public
    outdoor basketball courts in the city and assigning a numeric value to the
    condition of each court, including grading the surroundings, rims,
    backboards, lines, etc.  From their courts will be selected based on
    proximity to local partners, strength of stakeholders groups and the needs
    of the court.  Completed courts will be evaluated by tracking usage over
    time, depth of local engagement, number of volunteers and participants in
    basketball tournaments.  
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    Though basketball is the most popular recreational sport in America and many
    youth development organizations exists to teach “life skills” through the
    use of basketball and other sports, there are no other organizations which
    use basketball courts as a canvas to introduce art into communities and
    individual who might not otherwise access works of art as part of their
    daily lives.  Bringing two creative endeavors, pick-up basketball and public
    art, together has a powerful impact on athletes and observers and encourage
    people to imagine a future beyond their current circumstances. 
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    Individual local partners have not been selected yet, but typically partners
    are engaged on a volunteer basis and costs are limited to items like water
    and snacks for volunteers and other minor expenses.  
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    As Project Backboard's involvement in Los Angeles expands beyond the 15
    initial courts additional funding will come from private donors and
    corporate sponsors.  
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
    Depending on the condition of each court renovations can cost between $500
    and $4,000.  Similarly, past art projects have ranged from $200 to $7,500. 
    Each of the 15 courts, once selected, will dictate the level of investment
    and costs involved.  Activating each park with a basketball tournament will
    costs a additional $500-$1000 per tournament.  
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    Scale-ability is at the heart of Project Backboard and having complete 18
    courts in Memphis, I know that the momentum and excitement generated in one
    location builds on the next.  The benefit of working on highly visible
    projects in multiple locations is that the community, especially the
    basketball and art communities, begin to become aware of the project and
    will often reach out with support and ideas.  Our experience working closely
    with the Memphis Grizzlies will also help build relationships with local
    professional sports organizations, involving them in future court
    projects.
