project_summary: >-
  For low income families, transportation can be the single highest household
  expense, as each car costs $9,000/yr. Bikesharing and carsharing options can
  improve access to jobs, education, medical care, and healthy food for South &
  Southeast LA residents, if these services are designed by and for these
  neighborhoods. Through a community engagement process, we will empower
  residents to design their own plan to create affordable and appropriate shared
  mobility choices for their communities
