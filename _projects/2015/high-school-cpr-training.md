    During each academic year hands-only CPR (cardio-pulmonary resuscitation)
    will be taught in high school health classes throughout LAUSD. Each year
    50,000 students will be prepared to save lives with CPR.
  How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
    - Money (financial capital)
    - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
    - 'Infrastructure (building/space/vehicles, etc.)'
    - Community outreach
    - Network/relationship support
  How do you plan to use these resources to make change?:
    - Engage residents and stakeholders
    - Implement a pilot or new project
    - Advocate with policymakers and leaders
  Where will you be working?:
    - City of Los Angeles
    - LAUSD
  How will your proposal improve the following “Live” metrics?:
    - Healthcare access
    - Percentage of LA communities that are resilient (Dream Metric)
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    One aspect of evaluations is based purely on numbers. How many students were
    trained? Tracking each student after they complete the course or after they
    graduate high school will be nearly impossible. Thus, we need to develop
    creative methods to stay in touch with trained students or we may never know
    whether or not they responded to a heart attach emergency and how many lives
    were saved. Arriving LAFD medical technicians and paramedics will know if a
    civilian administered CPR before their arrival. This can give us an indirect
    approximation of the benefit of the program. Moreover, through social media,
    we will develop reminders for this generation of connected youth to check in
    if they helped with a heart attack victim.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Heart disease is the #1 killer of Americans. 375,000 cardiac arrests occur
  each year throughout the nation, 88% of them at home. Coronary heart disease
  is the leading cause of death and premature death in Los Angeles. Preventing
  people from dying of heart attacks, drowning, and choking will increase the
  life span of Angelenos. Imagine a high school student being able to save the
  life of a parent, a grandparent, sibling, friend, neighbor, or even a
  stranger. High school students live throughout the city. In addition to their
  presence at school and at home with their families, they may also work in
  businesses, participate in sports and recreation programs, attend religious
  institutions, go to entertainment and cultural event, and drive on surface
  street and freeways where there may be accidents. The6y are positioned to
  respond in many locations throughout the city. If CPR is administered in the
  first minute, there is an 87% chance of the patient surviving.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  The major challenge we anticipate is coordination between LAUSD entities and
  the LAFD. Communication between the district and individual schools is
  essential so that scheduling at each school goes smoothly. Our strategy is to
  work regionally within the school district so that training is scheduled
  systematically in school health classes.

Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Although the American Red Cross provides similar CPR training, they are not
  targeting high school students. The National HART Foundation is offering CPR
  training at LA County high schools, but this does not include the 178,500
  students currently attending high schools in the City of Los Angels.
  Twenty-seven states in the United States require CPR training in public
  schools. Annually 1.6 million students will be trained in those states.
   
   In addition to focusing on LAUSD, the use of firefighters and paramedics as trainers is unique. Strengthening the relationship of first responders and teens can be a benefit in enhancing community public safety and preparing for disaster response.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Our major partner is the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), and they
  are also the beneficiary of the program. The LAFD Foundation will receive the
  funding, and LAUSD high school health classes will receive the services.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  With the success of this program, we envision working with other regional and
  city fire departments and non-profit organizations such as the Red Cross and
  National HART Foundation to expand the program into additional municipalities
  in the L.A. region. Moreover, the program could be replicated anywhere in the
  State of California or the United States, using our curriculum and materials.
  It is worth noting that the California legislature is reintroducing a bill
  that was defeated last session requiring CPR training in all high schools
  throughout the state. We are certain that every community would want this
  level of training, and we know that every firefighter and paramedic has the
  skills to do the training. Joining with fire departments and other public
  health organizations in California, we support legislation to mandate training
  throughout California and hope the High School CPR Training Program will serve
  as a cost-effective, efficient model for this anticipated new law.
   
   Saving lives is important. Giving teenagers the tools to save lives is empowering for them and good for the health of the community.
