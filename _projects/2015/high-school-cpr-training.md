    Heart disease is the #1 killer of Americans. 375,000 cardiac arrests occur
    each year throughout the nation, 88% of them at home. Coronary heart disease
    is the leading cause of death and premature death in Los Angeles. Preventing
    people from dying of heart attacks, drowning, and choking will increase the
    life span of Angelenos. Imagine a high school student being able to save the
    life of a parent, a grandparent, sibling, friend, neighbor, or even a
    stranger. High school students live throughout the city. In addition to
    their presence at school and at home with their families, they may also work
    in businesses, participate in sports and recreation programs, attend
    religious institutions, go to entertainment and cultural event, and drive on
    surface street and freeways where there may be accidents. The6y are
    positioned to respond in many locations throughout the city. If CPR is
    administered in the first minute, there is an 87% chance of the patient
    surviving.

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    The major challenge we anticipate is coordination between LAUSD entities and
    the LAFD. Communication between the district and individual schools is
    essential so that scheduling at each school goes smoothly. Our strategy is
    to work regionally within the school district so that training is scheduled
    systematically in school health classes.
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    One aspect of evaluations is based purely on numbers. How many students were
    trained? Tracking each student after they complete the course or after they
    graduate high school will be nearly impossible. Thus, we need to develop
    creative methods to stay in touch with trained students or we may never know
    whether or not they responded to a heart attach emergency and how many lives
    were saved. Arriving LAFD medical technicians and paramedics will know if a
    civilian administered CPR before their arrival. This can give us an indirect
    approximation of the benefit of the program. Moreover, through social media,
    we will develop reminders for this generation of connected youth to check in
    if they helped with a heart attack victim.
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "Although the American Red Cross provides similar CPR training, they are not targeting high school students. The National HART Foundation is offering CPR training at LA County high schools, but this does not include the 178,500 students currently attending high schools in the City of Los Angels. Twenty-seven states in the United States require CPR training in public schools. Annually 1.6 million students will be trained in those states.\r\n\r\nIn addition to focusing on LAUSD, the use of firefighters and paramedics as trainers is unique. Strengthening the relationship of first responders and teens can be a benefit in enhancing community public safety and preparing for disaster response."
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    Our major partner is the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), and
    they are also the beneficiary of the program. The LAFD Foundation will
    receive the funding, and LAUSD high school health classes will receive the
    services.
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': "Costs are projected just under $100,000 for the first year.\r\nMany of the costs in the budget are start-up costs for the first year of the project. Expenses will go down in the second year.\r\n\r\nAdditional costs are being covered by the Los Angeles Fire Department. They are paying salaries and benefits of the coordinator and trainers. They are providing two vans, fuel, and maintenance to transport the trainers and equipment.\r\n\r\nBecause the department is short on vehicles, we will be looking for a donation of two new or late-model vans, but will be supported by LAFD in the interim."
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Laptop computers (2)             $6079\r\nWireless mouse (2)                     134\r\niPads (2)                                     1399\r\nApple TVs (2)                               140\r\nProjectors (2)                             1099\r\nPortable PA system (2)             1099\r\nManequins (500)                     42,500\r\nCPR training mats (500)           2496\r\nPortable screens                       6239\r\nTotal materials                         61,190\r\nsales tax                                     5813\r\nCPR promotional video           15,000\r\npromotional/educational\r\n      materials                             10,000\r\nTOTAL budget                          92,000"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "With the success of this program, we envision working with other regional and city fire departments and non-profit organizations such as the Red Cross and National HART Foundation to expand the program into additional municipalities in the L.A. region. Moreover, the program could be replicated anywhere in the State of California or the United States, using our curriculum and materials. It is worth noting that the California legislature is reintroducing a bill that was defeated last session requiring CPR training in all high schools throughout the state. We are certain that every community would want this level of training, and we know that every firefighter and paramedic has the skills to do the training. Joining with fire departments and other public health organizations in California, we support legislation to mandate training throughout California and hope the High School CPR Training Program will serve as a cost-effective, efficient model for this anticipated new law.\r\n\r\nSaving lives is important. Giving teenagers the tools to save lives is empowering for them and good for the health of the community."
