project_summary: >-
  During each academic year hands-only CPR (cardio-pulmonary resuscitation) will
  be taught in high school health classes throughout LAUSD. Each year 50,000
  students will be prepared to save lives with CPR.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Heart disease is the #1 killer of Americans. 375,000 cardiac arrests occur
  each year throughout the nation, 88% of them at home. Coronary heart disease
  is the leading cause of death and premature death in Los Angeles. Preventing
  people from dying of heart attacks, drowning, and choking will increase the
  life span of Angelenos. Imagine a high school student being able to save the
  life of a parent, a grandparent, sibling, friend, neighbor, or even a
  stranger. High school students live throughout the city. In addition to their
  presence at school and at home with their families, they may also work in
  businesses, participate in sports and recreation programs, attend religious
  institutions, go to entertainment and cultural event, and drive on surface
  street and freeways where there may be accidents. The6y are positioned to
  respond in many locations throughout the city. If CPR is administered in the
  first minute, there is an 87% chance of the patient surviving.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  The major challenge we anticipate is coordination between LAUSD entities and
  the LAFD. Communication between the district and individual schools is
  essential so that scheduling at each school goes smoothly. Our strategy is to
  work regionally within the school district so that training is scheduled
  systematically in school health classes.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  One aspect of evaluations is based purely on numbers. How many students were
  trained? Tracking each student after they complete the course or after they
  graduate high school will be nearly impossible. Thus, we need to develop
  creative methods to stay in touch with trained students or we may never know
  whether or not they responded to a heart attach emergency and how many lives
  were saved. Arriving LAFD medical technicians and paramedics will know if a
  civilian administered CPR before their arrival. This can give us an indirect
  approximation of the benefit of the program. Moreover, through social media,
  we will develop reminders for this generation of connected youth to check in
  if they helped with a heart attack victim.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Although the American Red Cross provides similar CPR training, they are not
  targeting high school students. The National HART Foundation is offering CPR
  training at LA County high schools, but this does not include the 178,500
  students currently attending high schools in the City of Los Angels.
  Twenty-seven states in the United States require CPR training in public
  schools. Annually 1.6 million students will be trained in those states.
   
   In addition to focusing on LAUSD, the use of firefighters and paramedics as trainers is unique. Strengthening the relationship of first responders and teens can be a benefit in enhancing community public safety and preparing for disaster response.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Our major partner is the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), and they
  are also the beneficiary of the program. The LAFD Foundation will receive the
  funding, and LAUSD high school health classes will receive the services.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 â€“ how will you cover the additional costs?': |-
  Costs are projected just under $100,000 for the first year.
   Many of the costs in the budget are start-up costs for the first year of the project. Expenses will go down in the second year.
   
   Additional costs are being covered by the Los Angeles Fire Department. They are paying salaries and benefits of the coordinator and trainers. They are providing two vans, fuel, and maintenance to transport the trainers and equipment.
   
   Because the department is short on vehicles, we will be looking for a donation of two new or late-model vans, but will be supported by LAFD in the interim.

    materials 10,000
   TOTAL budget 92,000
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  With the success of this program, we envision working with other regional and
  city fire departments and non-profit organizations such as the Red Cross and
  National HART Foundation to expand the program into additional municipalities
  in the L.A. region. Moreover, the program could be replicated anywhere in the
  State of California or the United States, using our curriculum and materials.
  It is worth noting that the California legislature is reintroducing a bill
  that was defeated last session requiring CPR training in all high schools
  throughout the state. We are certain that every community would want this
  level of training, and we know that every firefighter and paramedic has the
  skills to do the training. Joining with fire departments and other public
  health organizations in California, we support legislation to mandate training
  throughout California and hope the High School CPR Training Program will serve
  as a cost-effective, efficient model for this anticipated new law.
   
   Saving lives is important. Giving teenagers the tools to save lives is empowering for them and good for the health of the community.
