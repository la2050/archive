'In one to three sentences, please describe your proposal.': >-
  During each academic year hands-only CPR (cardio-pulmonary resuscitation) will
  be taught in high school health classes throughout LAUSD. Each year 50,000
  students will be prepared to save lives with CPR.
Where will you be working?:
  - City of Los Angeles
  - LAUSD
How do you plan to use these resources to make change?:
  - Engage residents and stakeholders
  - Implement a pilot or new project
  - Advocate with policymakers and leaders
How will your proposal improve the following “Live” metrics?:
  - Healthcare access
  - Percentage of LA communities that are resilient (Dream Metric)
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  One aspect of evaluations is based purely on numbers. How many students were
  trained? Tracking each student after they complete the course or after they
  graduate high school will be nearly impossible. Thus, we need to develop
  creative methods to stay in touch with trained students or we may never know
  whether or not they responded to a heart attach emergency and how many lives
  were saved. Arriving LAFD medical technicians and paramedics will know if a
  civilian administered CPR before their arrival. This can give us an indirect
  approximation of the benefit of the program. Moreover, through social media,
  we will develop reminders for this generation of connected youth to check in
  if they helped with a heart attack victim.
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
  - Money (financial capital)
  - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
  - 'Infrastructure (building/space/vehicles, etc.)'
  - Community outreach
  - Network/relationship support
