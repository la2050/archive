Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: >-
  I'll begin with a Yelp review from last year's play: "I wish that this was an
  event that ran year round. It's not just a Halloween spectacle. Delusion is a
  thought-out, engaging, creative, well written play that for Los Angeles where
  ,we are all use to the special effects and tricks, is incredibly impressive."
  We have the best of the best here. And our theatre event utilizes all aspects
  of the talent pool, from professional stuntmen and women and actors, to
  storytellers and original composers. Delusion's fan base is growing rapidly.
  They desperately want to revert to a more tangible life, free of the confines
  of technology. With Delusion, you enter a real world chilling tale with only
  your wits about you. For us at Delusion, nothing with ever beat the intimacy
  and lasting psychological effects of a moving play where every guest plays a
  part in the story.
