    For the last 4 years, Delusion has been the premiere live theatre event in
    the nation. We create eerie "moving plays" in existing structures (such as
    old mansions) where the audience plays parts in a living, breathing, and
    tangible story.

    I'll begin with a Yelp review from last year's play: "I wish that this was
    an event that ran year round. It's not just a Halloween spectacle. Delusion
    is a thought-out, engaging, creative, well written play that for Los Angeles
    where ,we are all use to the special effects and tricks, is incredibly
    impressive." We have the best of the best here. And our theatre event
    utilizes all aspects of the talent pool, from professional stuntmen and
    women and actors, to storytellers and original composers. Delusion's fan
    base is growing rapidly. They desperately want to revert to a more tangible
    life, free of the confines of technology. With Delusion, you enter a real
    world chilling tale with only your wits about you. For us at Delusion,
    nothing with ever beat the intimacy and lasting psychological effects of a
    moving play where every guest plays a part in the story.

      Metric)
  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    The city has made it difficult for us to create these plays in existing,
    residentially zoned properties. We need an advocate on our side to help
    facilitate this artistic endeavor. If we have someone higher up in the city
    who can help us get around the limiting 5 week special event permit process,
    then we can continue what 1000's her in LA have wanted to have happen. More
    Delusion experiences in existing structures.
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    My creative and production team keep things moving efficiently. This is our
    greatest passion so we will constantly monitor our progress.
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: 'There is nothing like Delusion, except Sleep No More in NYC. '
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    We have no partners. This money will go directly toward building out our
    next production.
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    We have additional investors willing to fund this if we can get some other
    help....such as MYLA2050 Grant money!
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
    The money will go to our production design team to hire contractors,
    painters, sculptors and other artists to create the sets.
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    Through myself (owner/director) and my two producers, we will build a strong
    creative team that focuses on the vision at all times. My line producer will
    keep her eye on the budget always and make sure we outsource when needed. My
    gut in leading this ship for 4 years have done well for us so far....so I'll
    be keeping that up as well!

      Through myself (owner/director) and my two producers, we will build a
      strong creative team that focuses on the vision at all times. My line
      producer will keep her eye on the budget always and make sure we outsource
      when needed. My gut in leading this ship for 4 years have done well for us
      so far....so I'll be keeping that up as well!
