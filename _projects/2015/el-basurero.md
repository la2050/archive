title: El Basurero
project_summary: >-
  MyLA311 (http://lacity.org/myla-311/myla-311-service-request) is an excellent
  service that allows city residents who know about it get bulky items and
  illegally dumped furniture picked up for free. The problem is, not enough
  people know about it or take the few seconds involved to logon and enter a
  request for service. Basurero would be a sustained door to door and social
  media campaign to publicize MyLA311 and get neighborhoods like Koreatown, Mid
  City, South LA and East LA swept clean.
