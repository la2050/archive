  MyLA311 (http://lacity.org/myla-311/myla-311-service-request) is an excellent
  service that allows city residents who know about it get bulky items and
  illegally dumped furniture picked up for free. The problem is, not enough
  people know about it or take the few seconds involved to logon and enter a
  request for service. Basurero would be a sustained door to door and social
  media campaign to publicize MyLA311 and get neighborhoods like Koreatown, Mid
  City, South LA and East LA swept clean.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  No one need live in a city littered with discarded TVs and electronics, white
  goods, couches, mattresses, cars and car parts. The piles of trash and
  illegally or improperly dumped items that are allowed to accumulate on the
  streets and in empty lots in Koreatown, Mid City, South LA and East LA are
  perpetuating the inequity that has too long characterized life in the
  balkanized city of LA. Recent research and investigative reporting has
  confirmed what everyone who lives in these neighborhoods knows. The collection
  of trash is highly uneven. Poorer parts of LA are disproportionately dumped on
  and trash, including hazardous materials, is routinely left to leak on the
  street for days, weeks, months and sometimes years, ultimately leaking into
  the soil and groundwater. Discarded paint, products containing lead, mercury,
  motor oil and other hazardous materials are left in the open on our streets
  where young, unsuspecting children play. No one should be exposed to these
  hazards, let alone the youngest and most vulnerable. The City of LA has a
  program for collecting bulky items, hazardous materials and illegally dumped
  items, but not enough residents are aware of the program or have access to the
  smartphone app or internet to request a pickup. Landlords routinely ignore the
  state of the sidewalks outside their property or on empty lots. The reliance
  on vigilant, informed residents to report all of the dumping that takes place
  is foolhardy. 
   
   This program would make MyLA 311 a household name in all Spanish, Korean, English and the other languages spoken in the target area. It would achieve widespread action on the part of the city that periodic coverage of the inequity in trash collection has failed to achieve. 
   
   The program would also develop policies to ensure that it is easy for landlords to do their job as well, in ensuring safe living conditions on their properties as well as on the sidewalk out front and in the empty lot next door.
   
   The result will be a cleaner, safer LA where children and adults are not exposed to the hazards created by the current reality.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Someone on the City Council or at Sanitation/Street Services will surely cry
  foul. They will argue that they are already working overtime to keep up with
  the demand. They will bemoan the added cost to the City (taxpayer) of picking
  up all this trash and hazardous material that most other cities are be
  committed to clearing off the streets as soon as possible.
   
   Basurero's strategy will be to kill the opposition with kindness. The Basurero corps will document the program's efforts with before and after photos, with praise for those who embrace the effort. Landlord of the Week, Sanitation Worker of the Week, Councilmember of the Week, Koreatown Basurero of the Week... There will be contests to see who calls in/logs on with the most requests. We will show that an informed public makes the most engaged citizenry and will will show results that residents can see and experience. We will sweep clean LA's most densely settled neighborhoods and ensure that they stay clean through vigilance.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Basurero Corps will document the program's efficacy with before and after
  photos, counts of requests filed with MyLA 311. The City is already capturing
  this data so we will work with the Council Districts and with MyLA 311 to
  analyse the data and assess the impact of the program.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  As noted above, the City's MyLA 311 program is available to those with the
  knowhow to access the system and request an illegal dumping pickup. The
  problem is with the multilingual/multicultural outreach. The end of the month,
  when tenants move, is the worst, but it never gets any better in Koreatown,
  Mid City and South LA. 
   
   What is unique about Basurero is we are improving in a grassroots way an existing city service and technology. Equally importantly, we are empowering residents to put their citizenry and government to work. They learn how to request a pickup, that pickup gets scheduled, and within a week, the illegally dumped refrigerator or television has been removed. The hazard to their child is gone. The sidewalk is clear again. 
   
   Basurero is community engagement and empowerment at its most basic level, with the added, measurable impact of creating a cleaner streets.
   
   While there are no other organizations involved in this effort in the targeted communities, Basurero envisions considerable collaboration with groups like LACC, Koreatown Youth & Community Center (KYCC), TRUST South LA and other community initiatives. Ultimately, Basurero anticipates integrating the program with street tree planting by KYCC, with whom we have worked in the past, and other community beautification efforts. 
   
   The Councilmembers are also other natural partners. They get our calls and emails about the illegal dumping. They will be enlisted as critical allies in the program.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Basurero envisions working closely with LACC or a similar partner. To keep
  costs down, the hope is to secure alternative funding for the time commitment
  of the partners. High school and college students who earn credit for
  canvassing their neighborhoods are another approach that might be employed.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 â€“ how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  Initiatially, Basurero does not anticipate the pilot costing in excess of
  $100,000. This will cover administration, partnership development, technology
  including smart phones for the canvassers conducting outreach in a
  neighborhood.
   
   Given the growing disgust among the public, in the business community and in the philanthropic community over the appearance of our streets and neighborhoods, Basurero anticipates that the piot will appeal to donors impressed with the vision, the quantifiable results and the way the program empowers and engages LA residents. This is a modest but overdue program that does sets forth fairly simple objectives: 1) Clean up the streets, sidewalks and empty lots of Central, South and East LA; 2) enlist and engage residents as citizen activists advocating for their own communities and families; 3) Improve the delivery of an existing city service; and 4) Improve public health outcomes for children and others by removing from the environment, mercury, lead and other hazardous materials illegally dumped in our communities.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  Project Director: $65,000/year
   Technology - smartphones, tablets, ISPs: $8,000
   Social Media - technologists: $12,000
   Partners - outreach stipends: $15,000
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Angelenos, especially those who live in Koreatown, Mid-City, South LA and East
  LA are tired of being dumped on. Residents of these areas are ready to see
  their city provide the sanitation (and other) services it promised them.
  Landlords and business owners, electeds and the philanthropic community is
  also tired of hearing the excuses about the shabby state of our streets and
  sidewalks. When Basurero launches and shows success, there will be calls for
  its expansion. Success will begat success, as residents of other underserved
  parts of the city see the results being achieved by citizen activists in
  Mid-City and elsewhere. They will call for their own illegal dumping to be
  picked up.
   
   Basurero is already talking to potential funders, anticipating interest in scaling the program. Good models may be largely volunteer efforts including Big Sunday and CicLAvia, which grew from more modest initiatives to what they are today. Basurero plans to engage with Big Sunday, CicLAvia and others about the lessons they learned in scaling their vision and programs. We are realistic about our scalability.
