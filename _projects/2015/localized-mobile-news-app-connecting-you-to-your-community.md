project_summary: >-
  We are the Waze for neighborhood news and events! Using geo-location data from
  local news sources (of your choosing), our app will plot the stories that
  matter to you, in real-time, on an interactive map that both engages and
  informs. Gone are the days of information overload and irrelevant articles...
  it's time to view the news like never before!

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Our app will increase civic engagement by making local information more
  accessible, relevant and helpful than ever before.
   
   Our location-centric based approach ensures the users only receive information that’s relevant to them. This is our competitive advantage. Our app will build upon previous innovations throughout our city to make LA the best place to connect!
   
   The app leverages the latest technology and advances, including:
   - Open data sourcing
   - GIS (Geographic Information Systems)
   - Mobile technology
   
   Users will have the power of their city’s data in the palm of their hand... through a simple, clean, fresh interface. Even more importantly, it will provide a comprehensible, yet digestible way to take in locally based information in a way that leads to community action and involvement.
   
   With primary goals of
   - increasing voter turnout
   - increasing volunteerism
   - increasing attendance at cultural events
   - increasing participation in neighborhood councils
   
   The technology used by this app, gives the city access to new levels of granularity, unlike ever before. 
   
   Location technology give us the competitive advanced to bring the information age into our communities, to engage our city councils to address issues that matter to our communities.
   
   Our App will pull data from several key sources, plot them on an interactive map based on location, and color code them by category. The following data streams have been identified for possible consideration.
   
   + Voting Policies/Information
   -- issues on the ballot
   -- neighborhoods impacted
   -- where to vote
   + Location/Times of City Council Meetings
   + 411 Safety Alerts
   + Volunteer Opportunities
   + Cultural Events
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  One challenge we expect to encounter is data with vague location connection.
  Some of the data we wish to display on a map will not have a specific address
  to reference. We plan to overcome this by developing a method to indicate to a
  user our “spatial confidence” of a point on a map. For example, if we have
  high confidence the point will be shaded a darker color, if we have low
  confidence the point will be shaded with a lighter color. 
   
   A second challenge we expect to encounter is data that is not inherently spatial. When non-spatial data exists, we will need to make it spatial. We plan to overcome this by dedicating some of the resources to developing an algorithm to automatically map events based on the text of the story. Secondly we will create a mechanism for a person to assign a location - this is known as a mechanical turk. While we expect to encounter this challenge, much of the data used by the app will have locat
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: |-
  Our work will be evaluated based on four criteria:
   1. Overall simplicity and efficiency of design
   2. Performance and mobilization of our app
   3. Measurement of utilization by users (through monitoring of servers & data)
   4. Practical user turnout and involvement in local events
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Our approach is unique because we will be leveraging mobile technology, GIS
  technology and open source data to empower citizens like never before. There
  are several organizations that use similar technology in individual ways, but
  no one has pulled all three of these aspects together for a common cause and
  applied the technologies in this way.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  The data and technology used to for the project will primarily be open,
  therefore there are no partners for this project. Where other technology is
  required, GIS technology may be purchased at a price.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  We believe we can develop and release this application for a projected cost
  between 85-100k within 7 months.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  $3,000 - customer research & data aggregation
   $5,000 - surveying and defining requirements
   $8,000 - software design & implementation
   $18,000 - physical technology system & database maintenance
   $3,000 - copyrights & legal advice
   $36,000 - coding & system/app development
   $6,000 - internal & system testing / refinement
   $8,000 - personnel & staffing
   $6,000 - piloting - soft release & user feedback
   $6,000 - incremental product scaling
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  The project will be scaled by gradually integrating relevant data sources,
  city by city. Through a data verification and authentication process,
  additional cities will be enabled to use the app. At each incremental stage of
  scaling, 100 “early adopter” users will be target for beta implementation. A
  targeting social media campaign will be created to attain early users. In
  addition to social media staff will engage and promote the app at Farmers
  Markets, Cultural Centers and Co-working spaces.
