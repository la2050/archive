Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "Our app will increase civic engagement by making local information more accessible, relevant and helpful than ever before.\r\n\r\nOur location-centric based approach ensures the users only receive information that’s relevant to them. This is our competitive advantage. Our app will build upon previous innovations throughout our city to make LA the best place to connect!\r\n\r\nThe app leverages the latest technology and advances, including:\r\n- Open data sourcing\r\n- GIS (Geographic Information Systems)\r\n- Mobile technology\r\n\r\nUsers will have the power of their city’s data in the palm of their hand... through a simple, clean, fresh interface.  Even more importantly, it will provide a comprehensible, yet digestible way to take in locally based information in a way that leads to community action and involvement.\r\n\r\nWith primary goals of\r\n- increasing voter turnout\r\n- increasing volunteerism\r\n- increasing attendance at cultural events\r\n- increasing participation in neighborhood councils\r\n\r\nThe technology used by this app, gives the city access to new levels of granularity, unlike ever before. \r\n\r\nLocation technology give us the competitive advanced to bring the information age into our communities, to engage our city councils to address issues that matter to our communities.\r\n\r\nOur App will pull data from several key sources, plot them on an interactive map based on location, and color code them by category. The following data streams have been identified for possible consideration.\r\n\r\n+ Voting Policies/Information\r\n-- issues on the ballot\r\n-- neighborhoods impacted\r\n-- where to vote\r\n+ Location/Times of City Council Meetings\r\n+ 411 Safety Alerts\r\n+ Volunteer Opportunities\r\n+ Cultural Events"
