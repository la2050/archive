    The Center for Connecting the Community (C3) is an arts-based community
    center providing accessible multi-generational programming for LA residents.
    Through a variety of disciplines in the performing, visual, and culinary
    arts, C3 will encourage health and wellness through diverse programs that
    spark engagement and creativity. The Center is designed to be a safe space
    where community members and leaders can connect and exchange ideas on how to
    create a vibrant Los Angeles. 
  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "Dedicated to education, enrichment, and entertainment, Culture Shock LA plans to open an arts-based Center for Connecting the Community (C3) providing accessible multi-generational programming for LA residents. Through a variety of disciplines in the performing, visual, and culinary arts, C3 will encourage health and wellness through diverse programs that spark engagement and creativity. \r\n\r\nEDUCATION\r\nC3 will feature programs designed for different age groups under each of the subject areas. Examples of these are music (Mommy & Me, music production), dance (stretching, yoga, and a variety of dance disciplines), visual arts (drawing, graphic design, ceramics), and culinary arts (nutrition, healthy cooking). \r\n\r\nAdditional classes and groups will also be offered based on the interests of volunteers and the identified needs of the community. For example, if parents are interested in forming support groups or play groups, the Center can provide a space for them. If qualified volunteers wish to provide classes in subjects they care about such as financial literacy, computer basics, or resume building, the Center can afford them the opportunity to do so.\r\n\r\nENRICHMENT\r\nIn addition, the Center will include a cafe and common area where people can congregate and connect. It will be a place where students can complete school work while waiting for classes to begin, parents can meet up to exchange advice and experiences, seniors can gather to socialize, and the community at large is welcome to come together. The cafe will also provide job opportunities and give students in the culinary arts classes the opportunity to gain valuable hands on experience in food service and preparation.\r\n\r\nTrue to Culture Shock LA's passion for community service, the Center will also promote projects to support the local community. Planning service opportunities appropriate for all ages, C3 will bring together volunteers and engage them in activities that improve their neighborhoods. \r\n\r\nENTERTAIN\r\nC3 would be the community hub providing meeting space for community discussions, performances, and gatherings. Our goal is for the Center to be a safe space where, through the creative, connecting, and learning process, community members and leaders can improve their well-being and exchange ideas on how to create a vibrant Los Angeles.
