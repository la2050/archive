  Dedicated to education, enrichment, and entertainment, Culture Shock LA plans
  to open an arts-based Center for Connecting the Community (C3) providing
  accessible multi-generational programming for LA residents. Through a variety
  of disciplines in the performing, visual, and culinary arts, C3 will encourage
  health and wellness through diverse programs that spark engagement and
  creativity. 
   
   EDUCATION
   C3 will feature programs designed for different age groups under each of the subject areas. Examples of these are music (Mommy & Me, music production), dance (stretching, yoga, and a variety of dance disciplines), visual arts (drawing, graphic design, ceramics), and culinary arts (nutrition, healthy cooking). 
   
   Additional classes and groups will also be offered based on the interests of volunteers and the identified needs of the community. For example, if parents are interested in forming support groups or play groups, the Center can provide a space for them. If qualified volunteers wish to provide classes in subjects they care about such as financial literacy, computer basics, or resume building, the Center can afford them the opportunity to do so.
   
   ENRICHMENT
   In addition, the Center will include a cafe and common area where people can congregate and connect. It will be a place where students can complete school work while waiting for classes to begin, parents can meet up to exchange advice and experiences, seniors can gather to socialize, and the community at large is welcome to come together. The cafe will also provide job opportunities and give students in the culinary arts classes the opportunity to gain valuable hands on experience in food service and preparation.
   
   True to Culture Shock LA's passion for community service, the Center will also promote projects to support the local community. Planning service opportunities appropriate for all ages, C3 will bring together volunteers and engage them in activities that improve their neighborhoods. 
   
   ENTERTAIN
   C3 would be the community hub providing meeting space for community discussions, performances, and gatherings. Our goal is for the Center to be a safe space where, through the creative, connecting, and learning process, community members and leaders can improve their well-being and exchange ideas on how to create a vibrant Los Angeles.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Acquiring funds to sustain operations is our greatest anticipated challenge.
  We are creating strategies to address this issue that involve:
   
   - Utilizing skilled volunteers to provide some program instruction and professional services, as well as a work study volunteers to help with general day-to-day tasks.
   
   - Fundraising through events, grants, and solicitation of donations from corporations and individuals.
   
   - Creating earned income streams (cafe, venue rentals, contracts through community partnerships)
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Programs and services will be evaluated through qualitative and quantitative
  data collected using thoughtfully designed participant surveys, attendance
  counts (daily visits, class enrollments, special events, service activities),
  and social media analytics.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  While there are other community centers, dance/art studios, and organizations
  that offer public classes or meeting space for rent, there are none that offer
  the comprehensive array of multi-generational programs or the environment that
  we are proposing. Our project is unique in that we are striving to create a
  community/family environment in which people are encouraged to hang out,
  exchange ideas, and connect with one another. We want to truly be a part of
  the community; a center that engages with the neighborhoods around us and
  promotes dialogue and involvement. We want to make services accessible,
  creating a space where those with special needs or individuals experiencing
  economic hardships are also given the opportunity to participate. So many of
  the existing studios or centers currently offering similar programs do not
  have an inclusive approach. They focus primarily on maximizing fees for
  services and have created environments that move people in and out of the
  facility without allowing them time to connect with one another or develop a
  sense of community or togetherness.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Culture Shock LA will serve as project lead. Collaborators will be brought in
  to support specialized instruction and broaden our service base. Potential
  partners may include Scratch DJ Academy, Richstone Family Center, Pediatric
  Therapy Network, and Growing Great. Collaborating partners providing
  specialized services will serve as subcontractors and be paid fees that are
  negotiated on a class by class basis.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 â€“ how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  We anticipate first year costs to approximate $182,793. Additional income will
  be generated through the following:
   - space rental (primarily independent contractors renting space to provide their own classes)
   
   - foundation grants, fundraisers, and individual and corporate donations
   
   - earned income from classes, special performances and events
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  $ 47,460 Staffing & Instruction
   $ 2,514 Supplies & Equipment
   $ 5,756 Marketing & Advertising
   $ 754 Licenses & Fees
   $ 3,496 Fundraising Expense
   $120,000 Facility Rent
   $ 2,813 Insurance
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Success of the program will lead to replication of the project in other high
  need communities. Using the project model incorporating arts-based,
  multi-generational programs that entertain, enrich, and educate, the
  individual classes and services can be tailored to meet the specific needs of
  the communities in which new centers may open.
