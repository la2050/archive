  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "Acquiring funds to sustain operations is our greatest anticipated challenge. We are creating strategies to address this issue that involve:\r\n\r\n- Utilizing skilled volunteers to provide some program instruction and professional services, as well as a work study volunteers to help with general day-to-day tasks.\r\n\r\n- Fundraising through events, grants, and solicitation of donations from corporations and individuals.\r\n\r\n- Creating earned income streams (cafe, venue rentals, contracts through community partnerships)"
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    Programs and services will be evaluated through qualitative and quantitative
    data collected using thoughtfully designed participant surveys, attendance
    counts (daily visits, class enrollments, special events, service
    activities), and social media analytics.
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    While there are other community centers, dance/art studios, and
    organizations that offer public classes or meeting space for rent, there are
    none that offer the comprehensive array of multi-generational programs or
    the environment that we are proposing. Our project is unique in that we are
    striving to create a community/family environment in which people are
    encouraged to hang out, exchange ideas, and connect with one another. We
    want to truly be a part of the community; a center that engages with the
    neighborhoods around us and promotes dialogue and involvement. We want to
    make services accessible, creating a space where those with special needs or
    individuals experiencing economic hardships are also given the opportunity
    to participate. So many of the existing studios or centers currently
    offering similar programs do not have an inclusive approach. They focus
    primarily on maximizing fees for services and have created environments that
    move people in and out of the facility without allowing them time to connect
    with one another or develop a sense of community or togetherness.
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    Culture Shock LA will serve as project lead. Collaborators will be brought

    Potential partners may include Scratch DJ Academy, Richstone Family Center,
    Pediatric Therapy Network, and Growing Great. Collaborating partners
    providing specialized services will serve as subcontractors and be paid fees
    that are negotiated on a class by class basis. 
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': "We anticipate first year costs to approximate $182,793. Additional income will be generated through the following:\r\n- space rental (primarily independent contractors renting space to provide their own classes)\r\n\r\n- foundation grants, fundraisers, and individual and corporate donations\r\n\r\n- earned income from classes, special performances and events"

  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    Success of the program will lead to replication of the project in other high
    need communities. Using the project model incorporating arts-based,
    multi-generational programs that entertain, enrich, and educate, the
    individual classes and services can be tailored to meet the specific needs
    of the communities in which new centers may open.

  Dedicated to education, enrichment, and entertainment, Culture Shock LA plans
  to open an arts-based Center for Connecting the Community (C3) providing
  accessible multi-generational programming for LA residents. Through a variety
  of disciplines in the performing, visual, and culinary arts, C3 will encourage
  health and wellness through diverse programs that spark engagement and
  creativity. 
   
   EDUCATION
   C3 will feature programs designed for different age groups under each of the subject areas. Examples of these are music (Mommy & Me, music production), dance (stretching, yoga, and a variety of dance disciplines), visual arts (drawing, graphic design, ceramics), and culinary arts (nutrition, healthy cooking). 
   
   Additional classes and groups will also be offered based on the interests of volunteers and the identified needs of the community.

If qualified volunteers wish to provide classes in subjects they care about such as financial literacy, computer basics, or resume building, the Center can afford them the opportunity to do so.
   
   ENRICHMENT
   In addition, the Center will include a cafe and common area where people can congregate and connect. It will be a place where students can complete school work while waiting for classes to begin, parents can meet up to exchange advice and experiences, seniors can gather to socialize, and the community at large is welcome to come together. The cafe will also provide job opportunities and give students in the culinary arts classes the opportunity to gain valuable hands on experience in food service and preparation.
   
   True to Culture Shock LA's passion for community service, the Center will also promote projects to support the local community. Planning service opportunities appropriate for all ages, C3 will bring together volunteers and engage them in activities that improve their neighborhoods. 
   
   ENTERTAIN
   C3 would be the community hub providing meeting space for community discussions, performances, and gatherings. Our goal is for the Center to be a safe space where, through the creative, connecting, and learning process, community members and leaders can improve their well-being and exchange ideas on how to create a vibrant Los Angeles.
