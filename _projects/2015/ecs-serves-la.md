  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "To Change The Way Students Learn, ECS Will:    \r\n\r\nCreate the “ECS Serves LA” program, which will: \r\n\r\n*Place every ECS high school senior - 120 teens – in semester-long internships across LA. Inspired by the Phillip Brooks House at Harvard College, this service referral system will formally connect five-person peer groups of ECS students with local, hands-on opportunities to make a positive impact.    \r\nConducted in subject areas related to their senior thesis, these internships will give youth the chance to contribute to LA’s civic infrastructure while deepening their understanding of social issues.  \r\n\r\n*Be comprised of 15-20 not-for-profit and community agencies. To form the network, ECS will   formalize agreements with its existing partners such as Heal the Bay, the Surfrider Foundation, and various LA River organizations. ECS will also reach out to new groups.  \r\n\r\n*Serve as a reference model within the LA region: ECS Serves LA will help change the way other LA high schools approach service learning. By assembling a vast network of the “who’s who” of the LA social service sector, ECS will make the model replicable across disciplines, will be available to show other LA educators and activists how to implement this program at their schools. \r\n\r\nTo Change The Way Teachers Learn, ECS Will:  \r\n\r\n*Expand its Green Ambassadors Institute (GAI), a learning lab offering professional development for both teachers and organizations looking to implement hands-on sustainable education. By expanding, GAI, ECS will: \r\n\r\n* Share its five (5) Best Practices with twice as many teachers throughout the LA region. ECHS employs the following instructional strategies and best practices, which we believe are unique and successfully develop changemakers in both students and educators: Small Learning Communities, Interdisciplinary Curriculum & Authentic Assessment, Relevant and Engaging Instruction, Environmental & Experiential Learning and Collaboration with Partners.    \r\n\r\n*Expand the Number of Educators GAI Works With Through Increased Outreach and Marketing:\r\nECS will reach out to new networks of teachers, will also create one (1) new GAI marketing video, and will create take-home impact tools to support teachers post-workshop (such as PDFs, resources, and guides) \r\n"

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "ECS anticipates that network response might pose a challenge. Both programs are predicated on target audience response. Accordingly, these external relationships with potential host organizations and local teachers are absolutely essential.  \r\n\r\nTo overcome this challenge, ECS will bring on staff specifically designated to seek and out and target new networks beyond ECS’ current reach. We will reach out to colleagues in different areas and disciplines beyond the environmental movement, and welcome the Goldhirsch Foundation’s recommendations towards that end. \r\n"
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "ECS will evaluate its work according to the following metrics:\r\n\r\n*How many students were placed in the 2016-2017 ECS Serves LA internship program (goal = 120 students)\r\n*How many organizations participated in the 2016-2017 ECS Serves LA internship program (goal = 15-20)\r\n*How many more teachers attended the 2016-2017 GAI professional development program (goal = 70 from at least 30 schools) \r\n*How many GAI workshops we were able to offer (goal = 4) \r\n\r\nThe evaluation will be overseen by ECS’ Director of Curriculum & Instruction Amy Frame and Service Learning Coordinator Sammy Lyon. Frame and Lyon will be supported by a new Outreach Associate that ECS will hire for this LA2050 project. This Associate will help expand ECS’ reach by connecting it to more organizations and educators in the LA area. At the end of the academic year, the Associate will follow-up and gather impact data for Frame and Lyon’s tracking purposes. \r\n"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "While there are many organizations in LA doing activist work and education, ECS occupies a unique space at the intersection of those two sectors. Its unique model produces stellar educational outcomes – with 98% of its graduates qualifying for and 96% admitted to a four-year university – and also earns awards.  Environmental Charter High School was chosen as one of three national finalists in President Obama’s Race to the Top Commencement Challenge, and ECS was ranked in the top 3% of U.S. public high schools by U.S. News & World Report. We also received an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) award for working to protect public health and the environment, and ECHS was in the first round of schools to be given the Department of Education’s inaugural Green Ribbon Award in environmental and sustainability education. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe ECS network approach is also unique because of who its programs serve. ECS students are the demographic future of Los Angeles: more than 90% of its students are Latino, Asian, or African-American, and most are the first in their families to go to college. Research shows that California schools that serve more than 90% Latino, African American, and American Indian students are almost 10 times more likely than majority white and Asian schools to experience severe shortages of qualified teachers (California Educational Opportunity Report, 2011). \r\n\r\nThrough GAI, teachers will be equipped with the knowledge and tools to allow them to become effective classroom facilitators as their students become empowered to be sustainable community leaders. And through ECS Serves LA, students gain valuable work experience as businesses gain the input of diverse young voices from across LA.  \r\n"
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "ECS has worked with dozens of partners, from community-based nonprofits to local businesses to schools and municipal entities.

Choice of organizations will depend on the strength of the relationship, the size of the organization and their capacity to manage five interns on a part-time basis for an entire semester, among other factors. \r\n\r\nSelect partners will receive 5K (see budget below)."

  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "ECS intends to make ECS Serves LA a permanent program offered within its charter school network, and scale the success of it on a yearly basis. Its central administrative leadership – ECS’ executive director and development staff - will take on fundraising for this effort. We have a strong track record with LA funders such as the Weingart Foundation, the Annenberg Foundation, the Ralph M. Parsons Foundation, the Ahmanson Foundation, the Riordan Foundation and the Green Foundation, so we estimate that we’ll be successful on that front. \r\n\r\nShould ECS receive the LA2050 LEARN competition, ECS will also leverage the prestige of a Goldhirsch Foundation grant to engage other new, potential funders in the LA region. \r\n"
