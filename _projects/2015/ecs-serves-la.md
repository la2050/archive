  For LA2050, ECS proposes change the way both students and teachers learn in LA
  by leveraging the reach of its award-winning service learning model in the
  2016-2017 school year. By connecting its diverse, altruistic young students
  with LA’s rich and dynamic community of nonprofit organizations, ECS will
  help: 1) its students scale their learning and become more college-ready and
  workforce-ready, and 2)  local LA organizational partners scale their impact
  with volunteer contributions.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': |-
  To Change The Way Students Learn, ECS Will: 
   
   Create the “ECS Serves LA” program, which will: 
   
   *Place every ECS high school senior - 120 teens – in semester-long internships across LA. Inspired by the Phillip Brooks House at Harvard College, this service referral system will formally connect five-person peer groups of ECS students with local, hands-on opportunities to make a positive impact. 
   Conducted in subject areas related to their senior thesis, these internships will give youth the chance to contribute to LA’s civic infrastructure while deepening their understanding of social issues. 
   
   *Be comprised of 15-20 not-for-profit and community agencies. To form the network, ECS will formalize agreements with its existing partners such as Heal the Bay, the Surfrider Foundation, and various LA River organizations. ECS will also reach out to new groups. 
   
   *Serve as a reference model within the LA region: ECS Serves LA will help change the way other LA high schools approach service learning. By assembling a vast network of the “who’s who” of the LA social service sector, ECS will make the model replicable across disciplines, will be available to show other LA educators and activists how to implement this program at their schools. 
   
   To Change The Way Teachers Learn, ECS Will: 
   
   *Expand its Green Ambassadors Institute (GAI), a learning lab offering professional development for both teachers and organizations looking to implement hands-on sustainable education. By expanding, GAI, ECS will: 
   
   * Share its five (5) Best Practices with twice as many teachers throughout the LA region. ECHS employs the following instructional strategies and best practices, which we believe are unique and successfully develop changemakers in both students and educators: Small Learning Communities, Interdisciplinary Curriculum & Authentic Assessment, Relevant and Engaging Instruction, Environmental & Experiential Learning and Collaboration with Partners. 
   
   *Expand the Number of Educators GAI Works With Through Increased Outreach and Marketing:
   ECS will reach out to new networks of teachers, will also create one (1) new GAI marketing video, and will create take-home impact tools to support teachers post-workshop (such as PDFs, resources, and guides)
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  ECS anticipates that network response might pose a challenge. Both programs
  are predicated on target audience response. Accordingly, these external
  relationships with potential host organizations and local teachers are
  absolutely essential. 
   
   To overcome this challenge, ECS will bring on staff specifically designated to seek and out and target new networks beyond ECS’ current reach. We will reach out to colleagues in different areas and disciplines beyond the environmental movement, and welcome the Goldhirsch Foundation’s recommendations towards that end.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: |-
  ECS will evaluate its work according to the following metrics:
   
   *How many students were placed in the 2016-2017 ECS Serves LA internship program (goal = 120 students)
   *How many organizations participated in the 2016-2017 ECS Serves LA internship program (goal = 15-20)
   *How many more teachers attended the 2016-2017 GAI professional development program (goal = 70 from at least 30 schools) 
   *How many GAI workshops we were able to offer (goal = 4) 
   
   The evaluation will be overseen by ECS’ Director of Curriculum & Instruction Amy Frame and Service Learning Coordinator Sammy Lyon. Frame and Lyon will be supported by a new Outreach Associate that ECS will hire for this LA2050 project. This Associate will help expand ECS’ reach by connecting it to more organizations and educators in the LA area. At the end of the academic year, the Associate will follow-up and gather impact data for Frame and Lyon’s tracking purposes.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  While there are many organizations in LA doing activist work and education,
  ECS occupies a unique space at the intersection of those two sectors. Its
  unique model produces stellar educational outcomes – with 98% of its graduates
  qualifying for and 96% admitted to a four-year university – and also earns
  awards. Environmental Charter High School was chosen as one of three national
  finalists in President Obama’s Race to the Top Commencement Challenge, and ECS
  was ranked in the top 3% of U.S. public high schools by U.S. News & World
  Report. We also received an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) award for
  working to protect public health and the environment, and ECHS was in the
  first round of schools to be given the Department of Education’s inaugural
  Green Ribbon Award in environmental and sustainability education. 
   
   
   The ECS network approach is also unique because of who its programs serve. ECS students are the demographic future of Los Angeles: more than 90% of its students are Latino, Asian, or African-American, and most are the first in their families to go to college. Research shows that California schools that serve more than 90% Latino, African American, and American Indian students are almost 10 times more likely than majority white and Asian schools to experience severe shortages of qualified teachers (California Educational Opportunity Report, 2011). 
   
   Through GAI, teachers will be equipped with the knowledge and tools to allow them to become effective classroom facilitators as their students become empowered to be sustainable community leaders. And through ECS Serves LA, students gain valuable work experience as businesses gain the input of diverse young voices from across LA.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  ECS has worked with dozens of partners, from community-based nonprofits to
  local businesses to schools and municipal entities. A partial list includes
  the LA Food Policy Council, The Nature Conservancy, LA RiverWorks, Heal the
  Bay, LA Commons, Surfrider Foundation, TreePeople, LA River Revitalization
  Corp, South Coast Air Quality Management District, Hyperion Water Treatment
  Plant & Environmental Learning Center, SpaceX, From Lot to Spot, Dogeared
  Jewelry, AAA Flag & Banner, South Bay Cities Council of Governments, Energy
  Upgrade California, TreePeople, Communities for a Better Environment, Algalita
  Marine Research and Education, 5 Gyres, Mountains Recreation and Conservation
  Authority, National Park Service, National Forest Foundation, Lawndale
  Community Garden, Trash for Teaching, Madrona Marsh, Gardena Willows,
  CalRecycle, State Farm Youth Advisory Board, OTIS College, Disney Studios, and
  Google Venice. 
   
   For the ECS Serves LA project, ECS will formalize relationships with 15-20 of these organizations and mutually co-design internship roles that are age and skill-appropriate for high school seniors. Choice of organizations will depend on the strength of the relationship, the size of the organization and their capacity to manage five interns on a part-time basis for an entire semester, among other factors. 
   
   Select partners will receive 5K (see budget below).
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  ECS has built a $100,000 budget for this project. Its exact numbers are shown
  in the answer below.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-

How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  ECS intends to make ECS Serves LA a permanent program offered within its
  charter school network, and scale the success of it on a yearly basis. Its
  central administrative leadership – ECS’ executive director and development
  staff - will take on fundraising for this effort. We have a strong track
  record with LA funders such as the Weingart Foundation, the Annenberg
  Foundation, the Ralph M. Parsons Foundation, the Ahmanson Foundation, the
  Riordan Foundation and the Green Foundation, so we estimate that we’ll be
  successful on that front. 
   
   Should ECS receive the LA2050 LEARN competition, ECS will also leverage the prestige of a Goldhirsch Foundation grant to engage other new, potential funders in the LA region.

    explanation: ''
    answer: "To Change The Way Students Learn, ECS Will:    \r\n\r\nCreate the “ECS Serves LA” program, which will: \r\n\r\n*Place every ECS high school senior - 120 teens – in semester-long internships across LA. Inspired by the Phillip Brooks House at Harvard College, this service referral system will formally connect five-person peer groups of ECS students with local, hands-on opportunities to make a positive impact.    \r\nConducted in subject areas related to their senior thesis, these internships will give youth the chance to contribute to LA’s civic infrastructure while deepening their understanding of social issues.  \r\n\r\n*Be comprised of 15-20 not-for-profit and community agencies. To form the network, ECS will   formalize agreements with its existing partners such as Heal the Bay, the Surfrider Foundation, and various LA River organizations. ECS will also reach out to new groups.  \r\n\r\n*Serve as a reference model within the LA region: ECS Serves LA will help change the way other LA high schools approach service learning. By assembling a vast network of the “who’s who” of the LA social service sector, ECS will make the model replicable across disciplines, will be available to show other LA educators and activists how to implement this program at their schools. \r\n\r\nTo Change The Way Teachers Learn, ECS Will:  \r\n\r\n*Expand its Green Ambassadors Institute (GAI), a learning lab offering professional development for both teachers and organizations looking to implement hands-on sustainable education. By expanding, GAI, ECS will: \r\n\r\n* Share its five (5) Best Practices with twice as many teachers throughout the LA region. ECHS employs the following instructional strategies and best practices, which we believe are unique and successfully develop changemakers in both students and educators: Small Learning Communities, Interdisciplinary Curriculum & Authentic Assessment, Relevant and Engaging Instruction, Environmental & Experiential Learning and Collaboration with Partners.    \r\n\r\n*Expand the Number of Educators GAI Works With Through Increased Outreach and Marketing:\r\nECS will reach out to new networks of teachers, will also create one (1) new GAI marketing video, and will create take-home impact tools to support teachers post-workshop (such as PDFs, resources, and guides) \r\n"
  - name: >-
      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "ECS anticipates that network response might pose a challenge. Both programs are predicated on target audience response. Accordingly, these external relationships with potential host organizations and local teachers are absolutely essential.  \r\n\r\nTo overcome this challenge, ECS will bring on staff specifically designated to seek and out and target new networks beyond ECS’ current reach. We will reach out to colleagues in different areas and disciplines beyond the environmental movement, and welcome the Goldhirsch Foundation’s recommendations towards that end. \r\n"
  - name: Please explain how you will evaluate your work.
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "ECS will evaluate its work according to the following metrics:\r\n\r\n*How many students were placed in the 2016-2017 ECS Serves LA internship program (goal = 120 students)\r\n*How many organizations participated in the 2016-2017 ECS Serves LA internship program (goal = 15-20)\r\n*How many more teachers attended the 2016-2017 GAI professional development program (goal = 70 from at least 30 schools) \r\n*How many GAI workshops we were able to offer (goal = 4) \r\n\r\nThe evaluation will be overseen by ECS’ Director of Curriculum & Instruction Amy Frame and Service Learning Coordinator Sammy Lyon. Frame and Lyon will be supported by a new Outreach Associate that ECS will hire for this LA2050 project. This Associate will help expand ECS’ reach by connecting it to more organizations and educators in the LA area. At the end of the academic year, the Associate will follow-up and gather impact data for Frame and Lyon’s tracking purposes. \r\n"

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "While there are many organizations in LA doing activist work and education, ECS occupies a unique space at the intersection of those two sectors. Its unique model produces stellar educational outcomes – with 98% of its graduates qualifying for and 96% admitted to a four-year university – and also earns awards.  Environmental Charter High School was chosen as one of three national finalists in President Obama’s Race to the Top Commencement Challenge, and ECS was ranked in the top 3% of U.S. public high schools by U.S. News & World Report. We also received an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) award for working to protect public health and the environment, and ECHS was in the first round of schools to be given the Department of Education’s inaugural Green Ribbon Award in environmental and sustainability education. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe ECS network approach is also unique because of who its programs serve. ECS students are the demographic future of Los Angeles: more than 90% of its students are Latino, Asian, or African-American, and most are the first in their families to go to college. Research shows that California schools that serve more than 90% Latino, African American, and American Indian students are almost 10 times more likely than majority white and Asian schools to experience severe shortages of qualified teachers (California Educational Opportunity Report, 2011). \r\n\r\nThrough GAI, teachers will be equipped with the knowledge and tools to allow them to become effective classroom facilitators as their students become empowered to be sustainable community leaders. And through ECS Serves LA, students gain valuable work experience as businesses gain the input of diverse young voices from across LA.  \r\n"

      this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner
      receive?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "ECS has worked with dozens of partners, from community-based nonprofits to local businesses to schools and municipal entities. A partial list includes the LA Food Policy Council, The Nature Conservancy, LA RiverWorks, Heal the Bay, LA Commons, Surfrider Foundation, TreePeople, LA River Revitalization Corp, South Coast Air Quality Management District, Hyperion Water Treatment Plant & Environmental Learning Center, SpaceX, From Lot to Spot, Dogeared Jewelry, AAA Flag & Banner, South Bay Cities Council of Governments, Energy Upgrade California, TreePeople, Communities for a Better Environment, Algalita Marine Research and Education, 5 Gyres, Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority, National Park Service, National Forest Foundation, Lawndale Community Garden, Trash for Teaching, Madrona Marsh, Gardena Willows, CalRecycle, State Farm Youth Advisory Board, OTIS College, Disney Studios, and Google Venice.  \r\n\r\nFor the ECS Serves LA project, ECS will formalize relationships with 15-20 of these organizations and mutually co-design internship roles that are age and skill-appropriate for high school seniors. Choice of organizations will depend on the strength of the relationship, the size of the organization and their capacity to manage five interns on a part-time basis for an entire semester, among other factors. \r\n\r\nSelect partners will receive 5K (see budget below)."

We have a strong track record with LA funders such as the Weingart Foundation, the Annenberg Foundation, the Ralph M.
