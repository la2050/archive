  results for the low-income families struggling with diabetes and obesity. Now,
  with a recently opened community center, Groceryships wants to dramatically
  expand the number of programs we can offer to families. The $100,000 grant

Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "For evaluating program effectiveness, Groceryships makes extensive use of surveys and physical health measurements. Data is reviewed at the conclusion of each program and is used for refining and improving the program model. Surveys and measurements are focused on three primary evaluation factors:\r\n\r\n• Fruit & Vegetable Consumption - this determines the level of habit change for eating healthy foods and increased access to healthy foods.\r\n\r\n• Body Mass Index - BMI is measured to determine if participants have decreased their weight during programs. The goal is gradual, long-term weight loss to support a healthy life.\r\n\r\n• Emotional Wellbeing - the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale questionnaire is used to determine how well emotional wellbeing improves during programs.\r\n\r\nThis data is collected and evaluated by Groceryships staff, Board, and advisors to determine which aspects of the program are working well and what can be improved as new programs are launched."
