  Groceryships pilot programs achieved profound physical and emotional health
  results for the low-income families struggling with diabetes and obesity. Now,
  with a recently opened community center, Groceryships wants to dramatically
  expand the number of programs we can offer to families. The $100,000 grant
  would provide six months of weekly nutrition education classes and free access
  to healthy produce for 300 families living in South LA.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Obesity is a contributing factor in five of the top seven causes of death
  (heart disease, cancer, respiratory disease, stroke, diabetes). In South LA,
  childhood obesity is 30% and life expectancy is 10 years less than other parts
  of LA. The poverty rate in LA County (15%) is among the highest in the country
  and the rate of depression exceeds 30% for those in poverty. This combination
  of health, financial, and psychological pressures makes it extremely difficult
  to live a healthy life in low-income food deserts.
   
   Groceryships has created a scalable, cost-effective program model that counteracts obesity and diabetes for low-income families in food deserts. Our educational support groups take 10 parents through weekly, two-hour meetings over a 6-month period. 40% of each class is spent on nutrition education and healthy cooking. 60% is spent on emotional and social support. Sitting in a circle, participants share about their lives and challenges with food and health. This group structure creates the emotionally supportive bonds where education and motivation take root.
   
   Groceryships also provides free access to healthy food each week for the duration of the 6-month program through delivery of fresh produce. This provides much needed economic benefit for families facing extreme budget pressures and also helps with developing preferences for new kinds of fresh vegetables and fruits. Class cooking workshops are also integrated with the fresh produce families receive, making is easy for preparing new types of meals at home.
   
   Learning these critical life skills for navigating the challenging health environment found in food deserts has direct impact on preventing or reversing Type 2 diabetes and obesity. We imagine LA in 2050 to be a city where families don't struggle with health and have the knowledge and resources to live happy, healthy, productive lives. With this in mind, Groceryships has had group results such as: 
   
   • All participants reported eating significantly more fruits & vegetables
   • All families reported they had children lose weight
   • All families reported additional family members lost weight
   • Participants reversed diabetes risk factors and lowered cholesterol levels
   
   With these promising results, Groceryships is on a mission to offer this life-changing experience to more families. Groceryships will make LA the healthiest place to live through this comprehensive model that supports families with better health for a lifetime.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  One major challenge Groceryships and families have during programs is the
  external financial pressures and personal stressors participants face in their
  daily lives. Health and emotional wellbeing are highly impacted by life
  circumstance, and for the population Groceryships serves, the pressures are
  substantial. If participants experience extra financial difficulty during the
  program such as job loss or family crisis, results and health improvement
  could suffer. This could lead to decreased healthy food budgets and could
  lessen motivation for making positive lifestyle changes.
   
   To ameliorate the potential impact of external pressures, Groceryships prioritizes group peer support for dealing with personal life difficulties and also refers participants to therapists as needed. For financial constraints for healthy food, Groceryships is constantly developing new partners and resources for providing healthy food for families and helping them shop healthier at a lower cost.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  For evaluating program effectiveness, Groceryships makes extensive use of
  surveys and physical health measurements. Data is reviewed at the conclusion
  of each program and is used for refining and improving the program model.
  Surveys and measurements are focused on three primary evaluation factors:
   
   • Fruit & Vegetable Consumption - this determines the level of habit change for eating healthy foods and increased access to healthy foods.
   
   • Body Mass Index - BMI is measured to determine if participants have decreased their weight during programs. The goal is gradual, long-term weight loss to support a healthy life.
   
   • Emotional Wellbeing - the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale questionnaire is used to determine how well emotional wellbeing improves during programs.
   
   This data is collected and evaluated by Groceryships staff, Board, and advisors to determine which aspects of the program are working well and what can be improved as new programs are launched.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  In Los Angeles, several other nonprofit organizations and hospitals have
  nutrition education components as part of their community focus. For example,
  Esperanza Community Housing has a program to train community health workers to
  work in low-income areas and Root Down LA has a nutrition & culinary program
  for high school students.
   
   While there are organizations that have great programs for improving health, Groceryships is unique from other educational initiatives in the following ways:
   
   • Duration - Groceryships programs are 6-months in length. This is longer than many nutrition classes or programs and allows ample time for families to make lasting habit changes, learn new cooking skills, and develop healthy shopping strategies. Long-term health is not a quick fix and gradual, deep changes are necessary over time.
   
   • Depth - Groceryships has a 24-week specialized curriculum with presentations and printouts for each weekly class. This provides comprehensive knowledge of nutrition and the food system, and goes into much greater depth compared to many other nutrition education programs.
   
   • Food Scholarship - the free healthy produce we provide families every week makes it much easier to experiment with healthy food and change meal habits over time. This economic benefit also helps families lower their food budgets after the program concludes because they learn which healthy foods fit with their budget.
   
   • Group Connection - adopting a new healthy lifestyle is dramatically easier with the support of friends and community connections. By creating tight-knit program groups, participants have the emotional support and motivation to improve their lives together as a community. With half of class time dedicated to peer support and sharing, very strong social connections are developed that last well after programs conclude.
   
   All of these elements combine to offer a comprehensive and unique approach to health that enables families to chart a new course for the rest of their lives. We imagine the ripple effects of current Groceryships groups to last to 2050 and beyond, as healthy habits are passed from generation to generation and spread throughout communities where families support each other on this long-term journey.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Groceryships recognizes that partnerships play a critical role for providing
  an impactful experience for the families we support. Groceryships has worked
  with a variety of partners to magnify results, decrease program costs, and
  recruit participating families. These partnerships include organizations such
  as:
   
   • LA's Promise - assists Groceryships with recruiting parents from schools in South LA and enrolling them into Groceryships programs. Past Groceryships programs have been run at LA Promise schools as well as workshops and program graduations.
   
   • Esperanza Community Housing – with Esperanza’s network of community health workers, Groceryships has trained Spanish-speaking promotoras to lead Groceryships program groups. This partnership enables Groceryships to dramatically increase the amount of offered programs and gives opportunity for the promatoras to directly serve families in their community.
   
   • Food Forward – provides donated farmers market produce as part of the healthy food scholarship Groceryships distributes to families. This gives families access to additional sources of fresh produce and simultaneously lowers Groceryships’s program operational costs for the food scholarship component.
   
   • LA Job Corps – has provided culinary and logistics support for Groceryships programs including food storage and food preparation. Groceryships also ran a program for LA Job Corps students, advised with revamping the cafeteria food options, and held an on-campus event & health documentary series for 300-400 students.
   
   • LIFT – refers families in South LA to join Groceryships programs and Groceryships is also able to refer participants and alumni to LIFT's financial literacy and job assistance programs. This combination of mutually supportive services is an important relationship for helping families increase their physical and financial health simultaneously, as these two areas are tightly connected and vital for every family Groceryships works with.
   
   • Vitamix – currently donates refurbished high-end blenders to Groceryships families. This ties directly to Groceryships cooking classes where vegetable and fruit smoothie recipes are taught as smoothies are a quick and easy way to increasing fresh produce consumption.
   
   These are all partnership collaborations where budget is not necessary for facilitating the partnership. If awarded the $100,000 grant, all funding would be used by Groceryships to grow the number of family nutrition programs.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  With this $100,000 grant, Groceryships could offer the program to 300 families
  in South LA through 30 new programs. The current direct cost per Groceryships
  group is $3,630 for the complete the 6-month program ($363 per participating
  family for 10 families per group).
   
   At this current cost, 30 program groups would cost $108,900 ($3,630 x 30) and would be held at the new Groceryhships community center near USC. The remaining balance of $8,900 could be covered through private donations from fundraising events Groceryships organizes several times a year, or from foundation grants that Groceryships applies for. Below is the total cost breakdown:
   
   Per program costs = $3,630
    • Cost per family, 10 families per group = $363
   
   Cost for 30 programs = $108,900
    • Number of families reached = 300
   
   Funding for 30 programs:
    • LA 2050 grant - $100,000
    • Private donations or foundation support - $8,900
   
   Groceryships is constantly working to lower the cost per program so it's possible that all 30 programs could be run for $100,000 with no extra private donation or foundation support needed. The first pilot program cost $2,500 per participating family and the current cost is $363 per family, a decrease of 85%. This has been accomplished through recruiting volunteer vs. paid health coaches and creating partnerships with donated fresh produce suppliers like Food Forward vs. buying produce at cost and providing produce gift certificates.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-

How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Groceryships has created a scalable model that can expand to reach hundreds
  and thousands of families over the coming years. This scalability is the
  result of strong partnerships and a training model that allows high-volume
  program growth.
   
   One primary partnership component involves the healthy food scholarship, as this is a crucial aspect of the program. Previously this was a limiting factor due to the financial cost involved with providing fresh food each week. Through establishing partnerships with Food Forward and Christian Food Center to secure produce at drastically lower cost, Groceryships has decreased the fresh produce scholarship budget per program from over $2,000 to under $200 per participating family. This allows for a much more scalable model and Groceryships can offer the program experience to nearly ten times as many families for the same financial cost.
   
   The other primary partnership component Groceryships has focused on is training new health coaches. Groceryships recently created a partnership with Esperanza Community Housing to train their community health workers to teach Groceryships programs. Groceryships's program director runs workshops for training Esperanza's community health leaders with the Groceryships curriculum, resulting in a much larger group of potential health coaches for future programs.
   
   In addition to health coaches, each group is supported by a participant who previously graduated from a Groceryships group. These graduates serve as Program Ambassadors, and help ensure that health coaches lead groups in accordance with Groceryships’s principles and procedures. Additionally, the Program Ambassador leads the cooking class each week, giving participants hands-on experience preparing and tasting healthy meals.
   
   By greatly lowering the cost per program and growing the roster of health coaches and Program Ambassadors, Groceryships is now in a prime position to quickly scale. In 2015 Groceryships will run 10 programs for 100 families and has the capacity to run 30 or more programs in 2016 if the necessary funding is secured. Running 30 programs in 2016 would allow Groceryhips to scale even more rapidly with the number of additional trained health coaches and graduates for becoming Program Ambassadors. Having 300 additional alumni families from 30 new programs would also drive increased referrals for more Groceryships programs and intensify the priority for health in the South LA community.

  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "Groceryships has created a scalable model that can expand to reach hundreds and thousands of families over the coming years. This scalability is the result of strong partnerships and a training model that allows high-volume program growth.\r\n\r\nOne primary partnership component involves the healthy food scholarship, as this is a crucial aspect of the program. Previously this was a limiting factor due to the financial cost involved with providing fresh food each week. Through establishing partnerships with Food Forward and Christian Food Center to secure produce at drastically lower cost, Groceryships has decreased the fresh produce scholarship budget per program from over $2,000 to under $200 per participating family. This allows for a much more scalable model and Groceryships can offer the program experience to nearly ten times as many families for the same financial cost.\r\n\r\nThe other primary partnership component Groceryships has focused on is training new health coaches. Groceryships recently created a partnership with Esperanza Community Housing to train their community health workers to teach Groceryships programs. Groceryships's program director runs workshops for training Esperanza's community health leaders with the Groceryships curriculum, resulting in a much larger group of potential health coaches for future programs.\r\n\r\nIn addition to health coaches, each group is supported by a participant who previously graduated from a Groceryships group. These graduates serve as Program Ambassadors, and help ensure that health coaches lead groups in accordance with Groceryships’s principles and procedures. Additionally, the Program Ambassador leads the cooking class each week, giving participants hands-on experience preparing and tasting healthy meals.\r\n\r\nBy greatly lowering the cost per program and growing the roster of health coaches and Program Ambassadors, Groceryships is now in a prime position to quickly scale. In 2015 Groceryships will run 10 programs for 100 families and has the capacity to run 30 or more programs in 2016 if the necessary funding is secured. Running 30 programs in 2016 would allow Groceryhips to scale even more rapidly with the number of additional trained health coaches and graduates for becoming Program Ambassadors. Having 300 additional alumni families from 30 new programs would also drive increased referrals for more Groceryships programs and intensify the priority for health in the South LA community."

      DESCRIBE IN GREATER DETAIL HOW YOU WILL MAKE LA THE HEALTHIEST PLACE TO
      LIVE: 
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Obesity is a contributing factor in five of the top seven causes of death (heart disease, cancer, respiratory disease, stroke, diabetes). In South LA, childhood obesity is 30% and life expectancy is 10 years less than other parts of LA. The poverty rate in LA County (15%) is among the highest in the country and the rate of depression exceeds 30% for those in poverty. This combination of health, financial, and psychological pressures makes it extremely difficult to live a healthy life in low-income food deserts.\r\n\r\nGroceryships has created a scalable, cost-effective program model that counteracts obesity and diabetes for low-income families in food deserts. Our educational support groups take 10 parents through weekly, two-hour meetings over a 6-month period. 40% of each class is spent on nutrition education and healthy cooking. 60% is spent on emotional and social support. Sitting in a circle, participants share about their lives and challenges with food and health. This group structure creates the emotionally supportive bonds where education and motivation take root.\r\n\r\nGroceryships also provides free access to healthy food each week for the duration of the 6-month program through delivery of fresh produce. This provides much needed economic benefit for families facing extreme budget pressures and also helps with developing preferences for new kinds of fresh vegetables and fruits. Class cooking workshops are also integrated with the fresh produce families receive, making is easy for preparing new types of meals at home.\r\n\r\nLearning these critical life skills for navigating the challenging health environment found in food deserts has direct impact on preventing or reversing Type 2 diabetes and obesity. We imagine LA in 2050 to be a city where families don't struggle with health and have the knowledge and resources to live happy, healthy, productive lives. With this in mind, Groceryships has had group results such as: \r\n\r\n• All participants reported eating significantly more fruits & vegetables\r\n• All families reported they had children lose weight\r\n• All families reported additional family members lost weight\r\n• Participants reversed diabetes risk factors and lowered cholesterol levels\r\n\r\nWith these promising results, Groceryships is on a mission to offer this life-changing experience to more families. Groceryships will make LA the healthiest place to live through this comprehensive model that supports families with better health for a lifetime."

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "One major challenge Groceryships and families have during programs is the external financial pressures and personal stressors participants face in their daily lives. Health and emotional wellbeing are highly impacted by life circumstance, and for the population Groceryships serves, the pressures are substantial. If participants experience extra financial difficulty during the program such as job loss or family crisis, results and health improvement could suffer. This could lead to decreased healthy food budgets and could lessen motivation for making positive lifestyle changes.\r\n\r\nTo ameliorate the potential impact of external pressures, Groceryships prioritizes group peer support for dealing with personal life difficulties and also refers participants to therapists as needed. For financial constraints for healthy food, Groceryships is constantly developing new partners and resources for providing healthy food for families and helping them shop healthier at a lower cost."
  - name: Please explain how you will evaluate your work.
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "For evaluating program effectiveness, Groceryships makes extensive use of surveys and physical health measurements. Data is reviewed at the conclusion of each program and is used for refining and improving the program model. Surveys and measurements are focused on three primary evaluation factors:\r\n\r\n• Fruit & Vegetable Consumption - this determines the level of habit change for eating healthy foods and increased access to healthy foods.\r\n\r\n• Body Mass Index - BMI is measured to determine if participants have decreased their weight during programs. The goal is gradual, long-term weight loss to support a healthy life.\r\n\r\n• Emotional Wellbeing - the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale questionnaire is used to determine how well emotional wellbeing improves during programs.\r\n\r\nThis data is collected and evaluated by Groceryships staff, Board, and advisors to determine which aspects of the program are working well and what can be improved as new programs are launched."

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "In Los Angeles, several other nonprofit organizations and hospitals have nutrition education components as part of their community focus. For example, Esperanza Community Housing has a program to train community health workers to work in low-income areas and Root Down LA has a nutrition & culinary program for high school students.\r\n\r\nWhile there are organizations that have great programs for improving health, Groceryships is unique from other educational initiatives in the following ways:\r\n\r\n• Duration - Groceryships programs are 6-months in length. This is longer than many nutrition classes or programs and allows ample time for families to make lasting habit changes, learn new cooking skills, and develop healthy shopping strategies. Long-term health is not a quick fix and gradual, deep changes are necessary over time.\r\n\r\n• Depth - Groceryships has a 24-week specialized curriculum with presentations and printouts for each weekly class. This provides comprehensive knowledge of nutrition and the food system, and goes into much greater depth compared to many other nutrition education programs.\r\n\r\n• Food Scholarship - the free healthy produce we provide families every week makes it much easier to experiment with healthy food and change meal habits over time. This economic benefit also helps families lower their food budgets after the program concludes because they learn which healthy foods fit with their budget.\r\n\r\n• Group Connection - adopting a new healthy lifestyle is dramatically easier with the support of friends and community connections. By creating tight-knit program groups, participants have the emotional support and motivation to improve their lives together as a community. With half of class time dedicated to peer support and sharing, very strong social connections are developed that last well after programs conclude.\r\n\r\nAll of these elements combine to offer a comprehensive and unique approach to health that enables families to chart a new course for the rest of their lives. We imagine the ripple effects of current Groceryships groups to last to 2050 and beyond, as healthy habits are passed from generation to generation and spread throughout communities where families support each other on this long-term journey."

      this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner
      receive?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Groceryships recognizes that partnerships play a critical role for providing an impactful experience for the families we support. Groceryships has worked with a variety of partners to magnify results, decrease program costs, and recruit participating families. These partnerships include organizations such as:\r\n\r\n• LA's Promise - assists Groceryships with recruiting parents from schools in South LA and enrolling them into Groceryships programs. Past Groceryships programs have been run at LA Promise schools as well as workshops and program graduations.\r\n\r\n• Esperanza Community Housing – with Esperanza’s network of community health workers, Groceryships has trained Spanish-speaking promotoras to lead Groceryships program groups. This partnership enables Groceryships to dramatically increase the amount of offered programs and gives opportunity for the promatoras to directly serve families in their community.\r\n\r\n• Food Forward – provides donated farmers market produce as part of the healthy food scholarship Groceryships distributes to families. This gives families access to additional sources of fresh produce and simultaneously lowers Groceryships’s program operational costs for the food scholarship component.\r\n\r\n• LA Job Corps – has provided culinary and logistics support for Groceryships programs including food storage and food preparation. Groceryships also ran a program for LA Job Corps students, advised with revamping the cafeteria food options, and held an on-campus event & health documentary series for 300-400 students.\r\n\r\n• LIFT – refers families in South LA to join Groceryships programs and Groceryships is also able to refer participants and alumni to LIFT's financial literacy and job assistance programs. This combination of mutually supportive services is an important relationship for helping families increase their physical and financial health simultaneously, as these two areas are tightly connected and vital for every family Groceryships works with.\r\n\r\n• Vitamix – currently donates refurbished high-end blenders to Groceryships families. This ties directly to Groceryships cooking classes where vegetable and fruit smoothie recipes are taught as smoothies are a quick and easy way to increasing fresh produce consumption.\r\n\r\nThese are all partnership collaborations where budget is not necessary for facilitating the partnership. If awarded the $100,000 grant, all funding would be used by Groceryships to grow the number of family nutrition programs."

      How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you
      cover the additional costs?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "With this $100,000 grant, Groceryships could offer the program to 300 families in South LA through 30 new programs. The current direct cost per Groceryships group is $3,630 for the complete the 6-month program ($363 per participating family for 10 families per group).\r\n\r\nAt this current cost, 30 program groups would cost $108,900 ($3,630 x 30) and would be held at the new Groceryhships community center near USC. The remaining balance of $8,900 could be covered through private donations from fundraising events Groceryships organizes several times a year, or from foundation grants that Groceryships applies for. Below is the total cost breakdown:\r\n\r\nPer program costs = $3,630\r\n    • Cost per family, 10 families per group = $363\r\n\r\nCost for 30 programs = $108,900\r\n    • Number of families reached = 300\r\n\r\nFunding for 30 programs:\r\n    • LA 2050 grant - $100,000\r\n    • Private donations or foundation support - $8,900\r\n\r\nGroceryships is constantly working to lower the cost per program so it's possible that all 30 programs could be run for $100,000 with no extra private donation or foundation support needed. The first pilot program cost $2,500 per participating family and the current cost is $363 per family, a decrease of 85%. This has been accomplished through recruiting volunteer vs. paid health coaches and creating partnerships with donated fresh produce suppliers like Food Forward vs. buying produce at cost and providing produce gift certificates.

  - name: How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Groceryships has created a scalable model that can expand to reach hundreds and thousands of families over the coming years. This scalability is the result of strong partnerships and a training model that allows high-volume program growth.\r\n\r\nOne primary partnership component involves the healthy food scholarship, as this is a crucial aspect of the program. Previously this was a limiting factor due to the financial cost involved with providing fresh food each week. Through establishing partnerships with Food Forward and Christian Food Center to secure produce at drastically lower cost, Groceryships has decreased the fresh produce scholarship budget per program from over $2,000 to under $200 per participating family. This allows for a much more scalable model and Groceryships can offer the program experience to nearly ten times as many families for the same financial cost.\r\n\r\nThe other primary partnership component Groceryships has focused on is training new health coaches. Groceryships recently created a partnership with Esperanza Community Housing to train their community health workers to teach Groceryships programs. Groceryships's program director runs workshops for training Esperanza's community health leaders with the Groceryships curriculum, resulting in a much larger group of potential health coaches for future programs.\r\n\r\nIn addition to health coaches, each group is supported by a participant who previously graduated from a Groceryships group. These graduates serve as Program Ambassadors, and help ensure that health coaches lead groups in accordance with Groceryships’s principles and procedures. Additionally, the Program Ambassador leads the cooking class each week, giving participants hands-on experience preparing and tasting healthy meals.\r\n\r\nBy greatly lowering the cost per program and growing the roster of health coaches and Program Ambassadors, Groceryships is now in a prime position to quickly scale. In 2015 Groceryships will run 10 programs for 100 families and has the capacity to run 30 or more programs in 2016 if the necessary funding is secured. Running 30 programs in 2016 would allow Groceryhips to scale even more rapidly with the number of additional trained health coaches and graduates for becoming Program Ambassadors. Having 300 additional alumni families from 30 new programs would also drive increased referrals for more Groceryships programs and intensify the priority for health in the South LA community."
