  Establish a City Bank based on the North Dakota model which was established in
  1919. It does not compete with commercial banks as it takes no deposits from
  the public and loans to community projects the banks do not loan to. It has
  had an annual profit since its existence. It joins the money creation process
  of the commercial banking systems. It makes low interest, long term loans to
  various projects such as solar, drip irrigation, museums. It is also run by
  bankers.
