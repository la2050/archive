  We are proposing SoundWorks L.A., a workforce development program that will
  train youth for positions in sound and lighting. In addition to helping youth
  land positions throughout the city, the program will have a social enterprise
  component in which youth will play a role in building the plan and launching
  the business. Students will earn certifications and have the opportunity to
  further their studies through our strategic partners in higher learning.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Although gleaming with celebrities and wealth, Los Angeles has also gained
  fame for its high level of poverty. Along with poverty comes an increase in
  homelessness, dropout rates, unemployment, drugs, gang activity, crime and
  overall feeling of hopelessness. Where there is education, these factors are
  greatly lessened.
   
   In working closely with youth through arts, we receive many inquiries about careers in sound and lighting for events. This is where the SoundWorks L.A. will step in. 
   
   SoundWorks L.A. is geared to provide thorough training, workforce development and job placement for young people who traditionally have not had access to opportunity. Our goal is to provide pathways to jobs, increase the graduation rate among youth and encourage higher learning. In doing so, we will play a role in: 1) minimizing unemployment among young people; 2) encouraging youth to stay in high school and pursue higher education; 3) providing mentors and guidance to support student success; and 4) create a social enterprise model in an effort to bolster the local economy and access to viable and sustainable jobs and careers. Students will work on the latest equipment, gain a full overview of the industry, participate in workshops with industry professionals and build their personal career plan, taking ownership in their future. Upon completion of their coursework, students will receive a certificate. In aligning with the curricular objectives of college level institutions, our students will be ready to pursue higher learning and an increased variety of professional options. Along the way, students will participate in hands-on experiential learning. We will additionally create strategic partnerships, scholarships and academic counseling services to provide further guidance to our students. Our objective through this project is to encourage equity, instill pride and improve quality for life for all Angelenos.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  One major barrier is the emotional preparedness of our students. Youth coming
  from disenfranchised communities and backgrounds have often received the
  message that they are ‘not good enough.’ This message may be compounded if
  there has been a debilitating experience. A key component of our programming
  will be to address ‘Internal & External Equity.’ It is critical that we
  provide our students with the tools to enhance their emotional intelligence
  and preparedness in order to navigate through a variety of diverse
  professional and social settings. We will provide resources through which they
  will be able to aim towards confidence and success.
   
   We are anticipating another barrier in employing graduates. We are tackling this obstacle by creating relationships with venues, industry and union leaders. We have initiated conversations with stakeholders to create a policy that will support the employment of youth, especially in communities demonstrating the most need.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  In order to evaluate our work, we will first conduct an intake survey of our
  students. We will create SMART goals to support this effort (specific,
  measurable, attainable, realistic, timely). While we are in process, we will
  create indicator markers for our students in being able to take on assigned
  tasks, create checklists and be able to articulate their knowledge. 
   
   We will evaluate our work on a community level by providing services for local festivals and events and conducting debriefs to identify what worked, what didn’t work and any room for improvement. We will also engage community leaders, stakeholders and clients to help us identify our success and any gaps. 
   
   We will look at agencies conducting similar work as well as businesses that offer similar services. We will also look for methods in which we could increase efficiency both in our programming and business model. We will conduct many of these evaluations every 6-12 months.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Locally, Hollywood CPR is a highly respected organization that has a similar
  purpose but slightly different focus. The Hollywood CPR program focuses on
  training and placing youth in the television and film industries. What makes
  our approach unique is that not only are we planning to train students, we are
  planning to help the students in creating a business model. Through this
  “Learn & Earn” approach we are helping to empower our students and provide a
  social enterprise component. We are looking at additional opportunities to
  further expand upon this concept. We feel that this further supports the
  development of culture, community and a creative presence in Los Angeles and
  supports the local economy.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  We plan to collaborate with the Coalition for Responsible Community
  Development, CRCD on this project. CRCD has long been a staple in South LA
  providing workforce development opportunities through neighborhood
  beautification, the rehabilitation of historic buildings and myriad of other
  services that engage youth. We project that CRCD will receive $10,000 of this
  grant to offset anticipated expenses in realizing this project.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  We anticipate that this program will cost $186,000 for its initial year. We
  are anticipating shifts for the subsequent years as the program and its needs
  increase. In an effort cover additional costs, CRCD and Project MuszEd will
  pursue a program specific appeal, matching funds and grant opportunities. We
  will also explore opportunities for in-kind donations and discounted purchases
  to support reducing costs while ensuring the program implementation. Both
  agencies are excited about this partnership and the potential and pride it
  will bring to the youth and to Los Angeles. We have a steadfast commitment to
  not only see it through but also looking at unique opportunities, partnerships
  and collaborations that will ensure its long-term success.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-

How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  We plan on taking a wrap-around approach to scale the success of this
  proposal. Through this approach we will 1) work on building our network and
  strengthening our infrastructure; 2) remain realistic about our objectives and
  our capacity; 3) take a practical approach in considering what we can provide
  and what we will need to outsource; 4) follow a structure of pre-planning for
  our budget so that we are clear on our most critical expenditures, avoiding
  overspending and are able to make sure we maintain long-term fiscal health; 5)
  value professional development opportunities and will participate in those
  that will support our staff and the sustainability of the program; and 6)
  Maintain alignment with curricular guidelines of institutions in which our
  students may be matriculate in to.
   
   We also anticipate being able to engage our students on the processes of building and running a business, associated ethics and any fiscal training available. With the support of our Board of Directors and through building an Advisory Committee for this project, we will have the expertise and guidance needed to ensure we are exploring every possible angle and making practical and effective decisions in scaling our success.
