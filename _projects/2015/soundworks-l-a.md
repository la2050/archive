  We are proposing SoundWorks L.A., a workforce development program that will
  train youth for positions in sound and lighting.  In addition to helping youth
  land positions throughout the city, the program will have a social enterprise
  component in which youth will play a role in building the plan and launching

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "Although gleaming with celebrities and wealth, Los Angeles has also gained fame for its high level of poverty.  Along with poverty comes an increase in homelessness, dropout rates, unemployment, drugs, gang activity, crime and overall feeling of hopelessness. Where there is education, these factors are greatly lessened.\r\n\r\nIn working closely with  youth through arts, we receive many inquiries about careers in sound and lighting for events. This is where the SoundWorks L.A. will step in.  \r\n\r\nSoundWorks L.A. is geared to provide thorough training, workforce development and job placement for young people who traditionally have not had access to opportunity. Our goal is to provide pathways to jobs, increase the graduation rate among youth and encourage higher learning.  In doing so, we will play a role in: 1) minimizing unemployment among young people; 2) encouraging youth to stay in high school and pursue higher education; 3) providing mentors and guidance to support student success; and  4) create a social enterprise model in an effort to bolster the local economy and access to viable and sustainable jobs and careers.  Students will work on the latest equipment, gain a full overview of the industry, participate in workshops with industry professionals and build their personal career plan, taking ownership in their future.  Upon completion of their coursework, students will receive a certificate. In aligning with the curricular objectives of college level institutions, our students will be ready to pursue higher learning and an increased variety of professional options. Along the way, students will participate in hands-on experiential learning.  We will additionally create strategic partnerships, scholarships and academic counseling services to provide further guidance to our students. Our objective through this project is to encourage equity, instill pride and improve quality for life for all Angelenos. "

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "One major barrier is the emotional preparedness of our students.  Youth coming from disenfranchised communities and backgrounds have often received the message that they are ‘not good enough.’  This message may be compounded if there has been a debilitating experience. A key component of our programming will be to address ‘Internal  & External Equity.’  It is critical that we provide our students with the tools to enhance their emotional intelligence and preparedness in order to navigate through a variety of diverse professional  and social settings. We will provide resources through which they will be able to aim towards confidence and success.\r\n\r\nWe are anticipating another barrier in employing graduates.  We are tackling this obstacle by creating relationships with venues, industry and union leaders. We have initiated conversations with stakeholders to  create a policy that will support the employment of youth, especially in communities demonstrating the most need."
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "In order to evaluate our work, we will first conduct an intake survey of our students.  We will create SMART goals to support this effort (specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, timely).   While we are in process, we will create indicator markers for our students in being able to take on assigned tasks, create checklists and be able to articulate their knowledge. \r\n\r\nWe will evaluate our work on a community level by providing services for local festivals and events and conducting debriefs to identify what worked, what didn’t work and any room for improvement. We will also engage community leaders, stakeholders and clients to help us identify our success and any gaps. \r\n\r\nWe will look at agencies conducting similar work as well as businesses that offer similar services.  We will also look for methods in which we could increase efficiency both in our programming and business model. We will conduct many of these evaluations every 6-12 months. \r\n"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    Locally, Hollywood CPR is a highly respected organization that has a similar
    purpose but slightly different focus. The Hollywood CPR program focuses on
    training and placing youth in the television and film industries.  What
    makes our approach unique is that not only are we planning to train
    students, we are planning to help the students in creating a business
    model.  Through this “Learn & Earn” approach we are helping to empower our
    students and provide a social enterprise component. We are looking at
    additional opportunities to further expand upon this concept. We feel that
    this further supports the development of culture, community and a creative
    presence in Los Angeles and supports the local economy. 
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "We plan to collaborate with the Coalition for Responsible Community Development, CRCD on this project.  CRCD has long been a staple in South LA providing workforce development opportunities through neighborhood beautification, the rehabilitation of historic buildings and myriad of other services that engage youth.  We project that CRCD will receive $10,000 of this grant to offset anticipated expenses in realizing this project. \r\n"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "We plan on taking a wrap-around approach to scale the success of this proposal.  Through this approach we will 1) work on building our network and strengthening our infrastructure; 2) remain realistic about our objectives and our capacity; 3) take a practical approach in considering what we can provide and what we will need to outsource; 4) follow a structure of pre-planning for our budget so that we are clear on our most critical expenditures, avoiding overspending and are able to make sure we maintain long-term fiscal health; 5) value professional development opportunities and will participate in those that will support our staff and the sustainability of the program; and 6) Maintain alignment with curricular guidelines of institutions in which our students may be matriculate in to.\r\n\r\nWe also anticipate being able to engage our students on the processes of building and running a business, associated ethics and any fiscal training available.  With the support of our Board of Directors and through building an Advisory Committee for this project, we will have the expertise and guidance needed to ensure we are exploring every possible angle and making practical and effective decisions in scaling our success."
