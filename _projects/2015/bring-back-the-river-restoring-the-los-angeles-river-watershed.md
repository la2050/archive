  The Arroyo River Parks Program (ARPP) will build community support for
  re-imagining our watershed from a sterile concrete channel to a vibrant river
  ecosystem.
   
   The ARPP program will educate citizens about the river revitalization planned by the Army Core of Engineers on the Arroyo Seco Stream in Los Angeles County.
   
   To reach out to the community we want to establish a native plant nursery that will be the central location of our effort to reconnect the community to the LA River Watershed.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  The Arroyo Seco Stream that begins in the San Gabriel Mountains is a major
  tributary of the Los Angeles River with its confluence at the 110 FWY and the
  5 FWY. During the 1930’s the stream was lined with concrete to accelerate the
  rate of water to protect against flooding. In this action the Arroyo lost its
  ability to provide habitat for aquatic species and tremendous opportunities
  for people to appreciate the Arroyo. Our mission in making Los Angeles a
  better place to connect is to restore the connection between people and water.
  The Arroyo River Parks Program (ARPP) was started in 2008 and provides a plan
  to connect 30 open spaces parks around the Arroyo Seco. The connectivity will
  provide trails and recreation from Downtown Los Angeles to the Foothills of
  the San Gabriel Mountains. This plan also calls for the removal of concrete
  and re-implementation of native vegetation in an effort to #BringBackTheRiver.
   
   Fortunately our vision to restore the stream has been shared by the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USCAE) and the County of Los Angeles Public Works. In 2011 the Arroyo Seco Watershed Ecosystem Restoration Study outlined several options for restoring the Arroyo Seco Stream. This upcoming spring 2016 the USACE will present several alternatives for the project. Our mission in applying for this grant funding is to garnish public input that will be presented to the USACE. We believe community input on this process will ultimately propel the project and will be a model for future river restoration throughout Southern California. To bolster support we would like to hold monthly workshops throughout the communities on this issue, in an effort to spur public dialogue and provide insight to the USACE. Furthermore making Los Angeles a better place to connect requires the support and contribution of all individuals, especially in restoring river vitality in light of an historic drought in Southern California. Therefore the need to bring about community awareness on water issues is not only imperative but urgent for our water sustainable vision of Los Angeles in 2050.
   
   In our involvement with the community on this issue we have started a native plant nursery at the head waters of the Arroyo Seco Stream. The Hahamongna Cooperative Nursery seeks to bring in volunteers and community officials to re-connect with native plants. We want the nursery to be a central part of our efforts, and need this grant to purchase a permanent lease.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  A major obstacle is the lack of public awareness of the importance of our
  rivers and natural resources in urban Southern California. Our goal is to
  create water-sensitive citizens and communities. The current drought has
  awakened many Southern Californians to the scarcity of water in our region and
  the importance of efforts to take decisive steps to protect and enhance local
  resources. We need to do more to protect our streams and rivers. We need to
  capture stormwater and save it for dry periods and recycle the water we import
  from afar. All of this starts with an awareness of our local environment and
  the rich resources it provides. The Arroyo River Parks Program will address
  this obstacle by working with the communities along the Arroyo Seco Stream to
  participate in the process. The public workshops we will conduct will be
  carefully planned to be visionary and participatory.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  The real test of the effectiveness of this campaign will be the extent to
  which we have influenced public support for the restoration of a living stream
  in the Arroyo Seco. We will evaluate our project by the amount of public
  support we can turn out for the USACE’s unveiling of project alternatives and
  amount of public comments provided. 
   
   In building public support we want to work with as many schools, government agencies, and other non-profit organizations as we can to educate them on the Arroyo Seco Stream restoration plan and our wider effort in the ARPP. We also want to ensure the future of our plant nursery, so that future restoration projects have locally climate adapted plants at the ready. 
   
   How many people attend the workshops? 
   How many people provide comments on the USACE alternatives? 
   How many governmental agencies and stakeholder organizations co-sponsor the workshops?
   How many volunteer hours at the nursery and in action projects?
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Yes there are several others, what makes us unique is the scale of the Arroyo
  Seco Stream. The Arroyo is only a portion of the Los Angeles River Watershed,
  and is very feasible for restoration. By restoring this smaller portion first,
  it can provide a model for future large scale restoration on the Los Angeles,
  San Gabriel, and Santa Ana Rivers. No major river restoration has been
  conducted as of yet, by doing so would begin a new chapter in re-mediating
  water resources in So Cal.
   
   Secondly, we have started a native plant nursery at the Hahamongna Watershed Park. Here we took an abandon Forest Service Nursery that was intended to cultivate vegetation for restoration, and made it into a public open space for people to participate in restoration. With this grant we can up scale our operation and provide native plants to Los Angeles County and all future restoration projects, especially our Arroyo River Parks Program.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Many Arroyo Seco organizations have been working together for many years to
  improve our communities and the Arroyo Seco Watershed. With the leadership of
  the Arroyo Seco Foundation, we have formed CASO – the Council of Arroyo Seco
  Organizations a dynamic forum for organizations working to make a difference
  in the quality of life in our region through issues such as transportation,
  environment, outdoor recreation, historic preservation, education, and many
  more.
   
   At the head of this organization we hope to bring in support for river restoration from the following groups: Cities of Pasadena, South Pasadena, Los Angeles, and La Canada Flintridge and the County Department of Public Works and the United States Army Core of Engineers. We would also like to reach out to all schools, churches, and other non-profits to participate in this council.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  We estimate our project will cost around 129,000,000. We will gladly absorb
  the 29,000 with our operating budget.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  Staff Expenses  $45,000
   Meeting Expenses $11,750
   Educational Materials $ 9,250
   Speaker Fees $ 3,000
   Advertising $20,000
   Nursery Expenses $30,000
   Administration $10,000
   SUBTOTAL $129,000
   Aroyo Seco Foundation Match $ 29,000
   REQUESTED TOTAL $100,000
   
   Staff expenses will allow us to commit two full time employees to this project. One will work at the nursery fulltime and the other working at the office conducting outreach for workshops. Meeting expenses will cover the rental of venues for speaking and community events. Educational materials will provide us a budget to provide information regarding our effort to citizens. Speaker fees will be used to bring in top scientist and experts on stream restoration to speak at community events. Advertising will help us get the word out about the Corps of Engineers plan to restore the Arroyo Seco. Nursery budget will allow for the purchase of a permanent lease to keep nursery open.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  We plant to scale our success by the amount of people we reach. We would like
  to see a huge public participation in the public comment period for the
  USCAE's plan. We also want build enough capacity at our nursery to provide
  regionally adapted native plants for restoration.
