  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "The San Fernando Valley Arts & Cultural Center (SFVACC) along with The Valley Economic Alliance (TVEA) plan to develop the first comprehensive database for Los Angeles arts, culture and entertainment.  A pilot program concentrating on businesses, venues, organizations and individuals connected to the arts in each of the 7 council districts in the San Fernando Valley will be developed first.  This will allow us to concentrate on one area of Los Angeles, where we can map out a specific region and build an overall template which can then be applied to each individual council district or independent city within Los Angeles County.  By using the council districts of each area, we can involve each council member with the mapping and gathering of information for their own particular district.\r\n\r\nThe research portion of this program will start with the Director of Information pulling together a volunteer committee to research and collect extensive data within selected categories.   Categories could include:\r\n•\tTheaters \r\n•\tGalleries Museums- Special exhibits\r\n•\tPerformance Centers\r\n•\tAmusement Parks\r\n•\tArts Organizations\r\n•\tLectures & Poetry Readings\r\n•\tArt, Music & Dance Festivals\r\n•\tMurals\r\n•\tWorkshops & Classes\r\n•\tVisual Artists\r\n•\tMusicians\r\n•\tPerformance Artists\r\n\r\nWe will hire a website designer and a data technician to create an expandable, user-friendly and informative “location” where the viewer can access current or future arts information and destinations.\r\n\r\nFor the first year, the listing will be free.  The coding within the website will be able to count how many hits each listing receives which will allow us to categorize each listing to determine the 2nd year fee.  This will be a minimal yearly amount which will help us maintain and sustain the website.  Online advertising will be the 3rd phase of the program as we continue to populate our database with ways to customize each listing’s advertising capabilities.\r\n\r\nWe will be working with LA Metro to create a discount card for those going to a play, a concert or to see an art exhibit on a Metro bus.  The Metro LAACE Art Discount Card will help move and connect people to arts destinations.\r\n\r\nBusinesses will be able to access detailed and customized information for each business, venue, organization or individual connected to the arts.\r\n\r\nOur interactive website and database will connect Valley residents to arts, culture and entertainment and eventually expand into the greater Los Angeles area.\r\n"

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  The San Fernando Valley Arts & Cultural Center (SFVACC) along with The Valley
  Economic Alliance (TVEA) plan to develop the first comprehensive database for
  Los Angeles arts, culture and entertainment. A pilot program concentrating on
  businesses, venues, organizations and individuals connected to the arts in
  each of the 7 council districts in the San Fernando Valley will be developed
  first. This will allow us to concentrate on one area of Los Angeles, where we
  can map out a specific region and build an overall template which can then be
  applied to each individual council district or independent city within Los
  Angeles County. By using the council districts of each area, we can involve
  each council member with the mapping and gathering of information for their
  own particular district.
   
   The research portion of this program will start with the Director of Information pulling together a volunteer committee to research and collect extensive data within selected categories. Categories could include:
   • Theaters 
   • Galleries 
   • Museums
   • Performance Centers
   • Amusement Parks
   • Arts Organizations
   • Lectures & Poetry Readings
   • Art, Music & Dance Festivals
   • Murals
   • Workshops & Classes
   • Visual Artists
   • Musicians
   • Performance Artists
   
   We will hire a website designer and a data technician to create an expandable, user-friendly and informative “location” where the viewer can access current or future arts information and destinations.
   
   For the first year, the listing will be free. The coding within the website will be able to count how many hits each listing receives which will allow us to categorize each listing to determine the 2nd year fee. This will be a minimal yearly amount which will help us maintain and sustain the website. Online advertising will be the 3rd phase of the program as we continue to populate our database with ways to customize each listing’s advertising capabilities.
   
   We will be working with LA Metro to create a discount card for those going to a play, a concert or to see an art exhibit on a Metro bus. The Metro LAACE Art Discount Card will help move and connect people to arts destinations.
   
   Businesses will be able to access detailed and customized information for each business, venue, organization or individual connected to the arts.
   
   Our interactive website and database will connect Valley residents to arts, culture and entertainment and eventually expand into the greater Los Angeles area.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Collecting information and categorizing it for input into the database is only
  a part of the initial program. Follow through to make sure that the data is
  kept up to date is just as important. Everyone has experienced the frustration
  of accessing outdated information on the internet. Today information from the
  internet that is passed on through search engines may or may not be up to
  date, misinforming and misleading the user. We will implement a quality
  control feature which automatically e-mails a user-friendly survey every three
  months to make sure that the data imparted by the LAACE website is the newest
  and most recent there is. E-mail address kick-backs will be followed up with a
  phone call to determine if the listing is out of business or obsolete. This
  fundamental component will eliminate passing on misinformation and the risk of
  creating a dissatisfied user.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: |-
  The evaluation will be a multi-step process to include:
   - Verification of information accuracy by the individual businesses/Individuals on the database through a feedback form.
   - Verification of full functionality of the website by independent check tests (by people other than those designing and setting up the website).
   - Feedback from selected businesses/Individuals on the utility of the website.
   - How many of the businesses/Individuals include us as a link on their websites.
   - How prominent we become on major search engines, so people can locate our website.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  One could say that there are many businesses that are presenting the same
  information that we are, but most of them are limited in their scope or range
  as far as dissemination of detailed information for both the consumer and the
  business-to-business markets. Limitations or constraints could be
  geographical, lack of financial support for expanding and updating, or only
  related to one specific category (i.e. galleries only). There’s no doubt that
  our research team will be able to glean information from what’s already on the
  internet, but the success of the LAACE program will depend on the detailed
  information we can attach to each listing in the database.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  The San Fernando Valley Arts & Cultural Center (SFVACC) will partner with The
  Valley Economic Alliance (TVEA) on the pilot program for this proposal. 
   
   The Valley Economic Alliance:
   
   The mission of The Valley Economic Alliance is to elevate the economic vitality and stability of our five-city region by assisting San Fernando Valley Business, Education, and Government Communities. 
   
   TVEA will be instrumental in helping us put together the database and technical structure of the website. We will be working closely with Kenn Phillips, President & CEO of TVEA, Michael Hadley, Economic Research Specialist and Keith McPherson, Director of Innovation & Digital Strategy. We estimate that $6,000 will be paid to TVEA for their help, use of their conference room for meetings, accessing Valley businesses related to the arts, introductions to the Valley’s 7 councilmembers and securing meetings with representatives from LA Metro, LA Tourism and the LA Department of Cultural Affairs.
   
   A Director of Information will be hired to organize volunteers who will handle the majority of the research for our database. Our plan is to organize a for-credit program to involve students from California State University, Northridge. This program can be applied to other universities which are connected to their respective council districts when we expand LAACE outside of the Valley.
   
   By combining our knowledge of graphics, marketing and branding with the TVEA’s connections to Valley businesses as well as Los Angeles leaders, the LAACE program will start making an impact as soon as we launch the program.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  We will set up our software to identify all types of hits to the website,
  including all the hits on the links to the businesses/Individuals within our
  database. This will become the basis for showing these entities why working
  with us is valuable to them, and in turn lead to getting them to sign up on a
  for-fee-basis for the 2nd and successive years of service.
   
   By tracking how many Metro LAACE Art Discount Cards have been purchased, we will be able to assess the popularity of the card itself and also how it is being used.
