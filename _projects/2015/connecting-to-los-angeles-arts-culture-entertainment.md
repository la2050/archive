title: Connecting to Los Angeles Arts Culture & Entertainment
project_summary: >-
  Incorporating the arts into our lives has become a panacea to the stresses of
  every-day life and LAACE will give Angelenos an easier and more comprehensive
  way to access the arts in LA.  By identifying businesses, venues,
  organizations and individuals connected to the arts, we can offer residents of
  LA, as well as tourists a web portal which targets arts, culture &
  entertainment. Our website will also become a resource point for
  business-to-business data and offer a new Metro LAACE Art discount

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "The San Fernando Valley Arts & Cultural Center (SFVACC) along with The Valley Economic Alliance (TVEA) plan to develop the first comprehensive database for Los Angeles arts, culture and entertainment.  A pilot program concentrating on businesses, venues, organizations and individuals connected to the arts in each of the 7 council districts in the San Fernando Valley will be developed first.  This will allow us to concentrate on one area of Los Angeles, where we can map out a specific region and build an overall template which can then be applied to each individual council district or independent city within Los Angeles County.  By using the council districts of each area, we can involve each council member with the mapping and gathering of information for their own particular district.\r\n\r\nThe research portion of this program will start with the Director of Information pulling together a volunteer committee to research and collect extensive data within selected categories.   Categories could include:\r\n•\tTheaters \r\n•\tGalleries Museums- Special exhibits\r\n•\tPerformance Centers\r\n•\tAmusement Parks\r\n•\tArts Organizations\r\n•\tLectures & Poetry Readings\r\n•\tArt, Music & Dance Festivals\r\n•\tMurals\r\n•\tWorkshops & Classes\r\n•\tVisual Artists\r\n•\tMusicians\r\n•\tPerformance Artists\r\n\r\nWe will hire a website designer and a data technician to create an expandable, user-friendly and informative “location” where the viewer can access current or future arts information and destinations.\r\n\r\nFor the first year, the listing will be free.  The coding within the website will be able to count how many hits each listing receives which will allow us to categorize each listing to determine the 2nd year fee.  This will be a minimal yearly amount which will help us maintain and sustain the website.  Online advertising will be the 3rd phase of the program as we continue to populate our database with ways to customize each listing’s advertising capabilities.\r\n\r\nWe will be working with LA Metro to create a discount card for those going to a play, a concert or to see an art exhibit on a Metro bus.  The Metro LAACE Art Discount Card will help move and connect people to arts destinations.\r\n\r\nBusinesses will be able to access detailed and customized information for each business, venue, organization or individual connected to the arts.\r\n\r\nOur interactive website and database will connect Valley residents to arts, culture and entertainment and eventually expand into the greater Los Angeles area.\r\n"

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    Collecting information and categorizing it for input into the database is
    only a part of the initial program.  Follow through to make sure that the
    data is kept up to date is just as important.  Everyone has experienced the
    frustration of accessing outdated information on the internet. Today
    information from the internet that is passed on through search engines may
    or may not be up to date, misinforming and misleading the user.  We will
    implement a quality control feature which automatically e-mails a
    user-friendly survey every three months to make sure that the data imparted
    by the LAACE website is the newest and most recent there is.   E-mail
    address kick-backs will be followed up with a phone call to determine if the
    listing is out of business or obsolete.  This fundamental component will
    eliminate passing on misinformation and the risk of creating a dissatisfied
    user.
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "The evaluation will be a multi-step process to include:\r\n-\tVerification of information accuracy by the individual businesses/Individuals on the database through a feedback form.\r\n-\tVerification of full functionality of the website by independent check tests (by people other than those designing and setting up the website).\r\n-\tFeedback from selected businesses/Individuals on the utility of the website.\r\n-\tHow many of the businesses/Individuals include us as a link on their websites.\r\n-\tHow prominent we become on major search engines, so people can locate our website.\r\n"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "One could say that there are many businesses that are presenting the same information that we are, but most of them are limited in their scope or range as far as dissemination of detailed information for both the consumer and the business-to-business markets.  Limitations or constraints could be geographical, lack of financial support for expanding and updating, or only related to one specific category (i.e. galleries only).  There’s no doubt that our research team will be able to glean information from what’s already on the internet, but the success of the LAACE program will depend on the detailed information we can attach to each listing in the database.\r\n\r\n"
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "The San Fernando Valley Arts & Cultural Center (SFVACC) will partner with The Valley Economic Alliance (TVEA) on the pilot program for this proposal.  \r\n\r\nThe Valley Economic Alliance:\r\n\r\nThe mission of The Valley Economic Alliance is to elevate the economic vitality and stability of our five-city region by assisting San Fernando Valley Business, Education, and Government Communities. \r\n\r\nTVEA will be instrumental in helping us put together the database and technical structure of the website.  We will be working closely with Kenn Phillips, President & CEO of TVEA, Michael Hadley, Economic Research Specialist and Keith McPherson, Director of Innovation & Digital Strategy.  We estimate that $6,000 will be paid to TVEA for their help, use of their conference room for meetings, accessing Valley businesses related to the arts, introductions to the Valley’s 7 councilmembers and securing meetings with representatives from LA Metro, LA Tourism and the LA Department of Cultural Affairs.\r\n\r\nA Director of Information will be hired to organize volunteers who will handle the majority of the research for our database.  Our plan is to organize a for-credit program to involve students from California State University, Northridge.  This program can be applied to other universities which are connected to their respective council districts when we expand LAACE outside of the Valley.\r\n\r\nBy combining our knowledge of graphics, marketing and branding with the TVEA’s connections to Valley businesses as well as Los Angeles leaders, the LAACE program will start making an impact as soon as we launch the program.\r\n"

If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': "After consulting with some of our collaborators, we are estimating a cost of $70,000 for the pilot program.

   The research portion of this program will start with the Director of Information pulling together a volunteer committee to research and collect extensive data within selected categories. Categories could include:
   • Theaters 
   • Galleries 
   • Museums
   • Performance Centers

   • Art, Music & Dance Festivals
   • Murals

   We will be working with LA Metro to create a discount card for those going to a play, a concert or to see an art exhibit on a Metro bus. The Metro LAACE Art Discount Card will help move and connect people to arts destinations.
   
   Businesses will be able to access detailed and customized information for each business, venue, organization or individual connected to the arts.
