  Incorporating the arts into our lives has become a panacea to the stresses of
  every-day life and LAACE will give Angelenos an easier and more comprehensive
  way to access the arts in LA. By identifying businesses, venues, organizations
  and individuals connected to the arts, we can offer residents of LA, as well
  as tourists a web portal which targets arts, culture & entertainment. Our
  website will also become a resource point for business-to-business data and
  offer a new Metro LAACE Art discount
