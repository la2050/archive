Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "The San Fernando Valley Arts & Cultural Center (SFVACC) along with The Valley Economic Alliance (TVEA) plan to develop the first comprehensive database for Los Angeles arts, culture and entertainment.  A pilot program concentrating on businesses, venues, organizations and individuals connected to the arts in each of the 7 council districts in the San Fernando Valley will be developed first.  This will allow us to concentrate on one area of Los Angeles, where we can map out a specific region and build an overall template which can then be applied to each individual council district or independent city within Los Angeles County.  By using the council districts of each area, we can involve each council member with the mapping and gathering of information for their own particular district.\r\n\r\nThe research portion of this program will start with the Director of Information pulling together a volunteer committee to research and collect extensive data within selected categories.   Categories could include:\r\n•\tTheaters \r\n•\tGalleries Museums- Special exhibits\r\n•\tPerformance Centers\r\n•\tAmusement Parks\r\n•\tArts Organizations\r\n•\tLectures & Poetry Readings\r\n•\tArt, Music & Dance Festivals\r\n•\tMurals\r\n•\tWorkshops & Classes\r\n•\tVisual Artists\r\n•\tMusicians\r\n•\tPerformance Artists\r\n\r\nWe will hire a website designer and a data technician to create an expandable, user-friendly and informative “location” where the viewer can access current or future arts information and destinations.\r\n\r\nFor the first year, the listing will be free.  The coding within the website will be able to count how many hits each listing receives which will allow us to categorize each listing to determine the 2nd year fee.  This will be a minimal yearly amount which will help us maintain and sustain the website.  Online advertising will be the 3rd phase of the program as we continue to populate our database with ways to customize each listing’s advertising capabilities.\r\n\r\nWe will be working with LA Metro to create a discount card for those going to a play, a concert or to see an art exhibit on a Metro bus.  The Metro LAACE Art Discount Card will help move and connect people to arts destinations.\r\n\r\nBusinesses will be able to access detailed and customized information for each business, venue, organization or individual connected to the arts.\r\n\r\nOur interactive website and database will connect Valley residents to arts, culture and entertainment and eventually expand into the greater Los Angeles area.\r\n"
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "The evaluation will be a multi-step process to include:\r\n-\tVerification of information accuracy by the individual businesses/Individuals on the database through a feedback form.\r\n-\tVerification of full functionality of the website by independent check tests (by people other than those designing and setting up the website).\r\n-\tFeedback from selected businesses/Individuals on the utility of the website.\r\n-\tHow many of the businesses/Individuals include us as a link on their websites.\r\n-\tHow prominent we become on major search engines, so people can locate our website.\r\n"
