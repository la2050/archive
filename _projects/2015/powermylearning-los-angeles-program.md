  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "Throughout the greater Los Angeles community, a substantial opportunity gap persists between low-income and higher-income families. Large numbers of students in LA’s low-income communities are not graduating from high school on time, and even larger numbers are inadequately prepared for college and careers. This, in turn, is contributing to an unprepared workforce and growing income inequality.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, teachers are facing growing pressure to provide personalized instruction to large classes of students with diverse needs and learning levels. PowerMyLearning is addressing these problems by helping all the key constituencies in the learning process—students, teachers, and parents—use digital learning more effectively in school and at home.\r\n\r\nOur program helps teachers provide more personalized learning for students. Instead of giving one lesson to their class, teachers have a PowerMyLearning coach who shows them how to create playlists of digital learning activities (videos from different publishers, educational games, simulations, and more) and then assign those playlists to targeted groups of students. In this model, students receive instruction at their level in the areas they need the most help.\r\n\r\nThis student-centered classroom experience also inspires students to be more self-directed learners.  After completing their assigned playlist of activities, students are free to explore their passions and areas of need. This higher-level thinking and metacognition is essential for success in high school, college, and career.\r\n\r\nHome access to technology, along with an adult who is trained in how to use technology for learning, can transform students’ home learning environments to create rich learning experiences. Families who participate in PowerMyLearning family learning workshops leave empowered with a laptop computer that is theirs to keep and knowledge to strengthen the learning environment at home.\r\n\r\nCurrently, students and teachers in low-income communities have less access to personalized learning, high-impact professional development, and technology than their higher-income peers. PowerMyLearning seeks to close this divide and provide equal access to students, families, and teachers regardless of their zip code."

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "One barrier to implementation of digital learning in classrooms is access to reliable technology and Internet bandwidth at schools. While major strides have been made in improving the tech infrastructure in many Los Angeles schools, on-site technical support to fix problems promptly is sometimes lacking.\r\n\r\nIn order to address this challenge, PowerMyLearning seeks out partnerships with schools that have adequate technology and a history of overcoming tech challenges. We are equipped to help schools setup the procedures to overcome minor tech challenges, but we use our partner selection process to ensure that our partners are as technologically ready to do digital learning as possible."
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    PowerMyLearning proactively measures the results of our Los Angeles program
    and then uses those data to propel program improvements to increase impact.
    To evaluate our Los Angeles programs, PowerMyLearning administers surveys to
    participating families that cover a range of important issues such as
    increases in family confidence in helping their children learn.
    PowerMyLearning partners with LAUSD and charter management organizations to
    secure and analyze California state test data that may be available. We will
    also work with individual schools to collect and analyze achievement data
    that may be available locally, including results from the MAP assessment (a
    highly regarded interim assessment produced by NWEA). To protect student
    privacy, we use data collection protocols approved by an independent
    Institutional Review Board.
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "There is no other organization we are aware of that is taking this comprehensive approach to the use of digital learning to improve achievement, inclusive of family involvement, in-depth training for teachers including blended learning consulting, and a robust free online learning platform. \r\n\r\nTwo organizations that operate in discrete areas of the digital learning space are as follows: \r\n\r\nKhan Academy provides their own content (primarily videos) on a free online platform; by contrast, PowerMyLearning’s free online learning platform, PowerMyLearning Connect, curates all free content from across the web including a wide range of learning modalities. Furthermore, we combine our platform with a strong focus on training and supporting all the key players: students, teachers, and parents. \r\n\r\nGooru learning provides access to a wide range of online content using automated search to organize content on the site; by contrast, PowerMyLearning uses live teachers to curate content, and unlike Gooru, we combine our platform with tested training and support models for students, teachers, and parents."
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "In the 2015-16 school year, PowerMyLearning plans to partner with 7 schools who will receive our program services. These schools include:\r\n\r\nDr. Julian Nava Learning Academy of Arts & Culture (South LA)\r\nDr. Julian Nava Learning Academy of Business and Technology (South LA)\r\nValor Academy (Arleta)\r\nStella Middle Charter Academy (West Adams)\r\nJack H. Skirball Middle School (Watts)\r\nNew Heights Charter School (Leimert Park)\r\nKIPP Scholar Academy (Leimert Park)\r\n\r\nWe also plan to work with additional school partners that we are in the process of securing.\r\n\r\nPowerMyLearning also works closely with other leaders in the blended learning and educational technology space. We were a member of the Los Angeles Next Generation Learning Systems collaboration that submitted a proposal to the Gates Foundation to scale personalized learning district-wide. Members of the team included LAUSD, KIPP LA, and the Partnership for Los Angeles Schools. PowerMyLearning has also partnered with Alliance College-Ready Public Schools to provide a portion of their blended learning professional development for teachers."
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': "We project that PowerMyLearning’s program in Los Angeles will have expenses of $1,520,691.  (Please see budget in the next response.)\r\n\r\nThe revenue to meet these expenses will come from a combination of earned revenue and philanthropy. Each of our partner schools contributes toward the cost of the program since experience has shown that we can reach a deeper partnership with a school that also has some “skin in the game.” We also have a strong base of philanthropic support in place for the upcoming year.  This includes renewal funders and potential new funders. Our revenue for the 2014-15 school year was sufficient to fully cover our expenses and we are confident that revenue will again exceed expenses in the 2015-16 school year\r\n"
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "PowerMyLearning offers a comprehensive approach to addressing key disadvantages that exist in low-income communities.  Rather than apply $100K toward a specific component of the program, we plan to apply the $100K across the full range of costs associated with the program including family training, professional development for educators, and technology tools for students, teachers, and parents.\r\n\r\nThe preliminary budget for 2015-16 is as follows:\r\n\r\nPERSONNEL\r\nSalaries (full-time staff): 496,931\r\nWages (part-time staff): 185,311\r\nPayroll taxes & employee benefits: 121,623\r\nTOTAL PERSONNEL: 803,865\r\n\r\nDistributing Educational Software & Computers:  496,080\r\nRent & utilities: 41,373  \r\nOffice/warehouse expenses: 3,542\r\nProgram supplies & services: 63,537\r\nTravel: 8,993\r\nTelecommunications expenses: 6,788\r\nProfessional & Contractor Fees: 2,172\r\nOther expenses: 1,195\r\nAdministrative expenses: 93,146\r\n\r\nTOTAL EXPENSES: $1,520,691\r\nTotal Cash: 1,024,611\r\nTotal Non-Cash: 496,080"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "In the long-term, PowerMyLearning is committed to scaling the approaches of our program so that we can impact students across the low-income communities of Los Angeles. This Los Angeles-based work will also contribute to the national organization's larger mission of improving educational outcomes in low-income communities nationwide.\r\n\r\nA key lever for scaling our work will be in the gradual introduction of tech-enabled remote services. For example, our coaches currently meet with teachers face-to-face for every interaction. We have plans to build features into our online learning platform that will enable teachers to complete reflections and assignments between meetings with his/her coach, which will make the sessions more effective. We also anticipate leveraging video to enhance the scalability of our work. All of these remote tech-enabled services will be thoroughly tested and piloted to ensure the quality of coaching and the teachers’ experiences with digital learning remain strong.\r\n"
