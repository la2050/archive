  'DESCRIBE IN GREATER DETAIL HOW YOU WILL MAKE LA THE HEALTHIEST PLACE TO LIVE: ': "Our ‘Making for Good’ initiative challenges girls to think about issues in their community by leading them through the engineering design process to build real prototypes of products and services that can improve the problem. This year we have applied this process to health issues. DIY Girls proposes to apply our ‘Making for Good’ process to investigate air quality with the use of technology that will result in student-led solutions for a Los Angeles with clean air by 2050. With support from LA2050, hundreds of girls will take action to improve air pollution in their community and build tech devices that will help others to also take action.\r\n\r\n1. Girls in our elementary school programs will use handheld air quality sensors to collect, display, and share environmental and air pollutant data using smartphone technology. Data will be available online and displayed as a map. After learning about how air quality can affect one’s health, girls will implement the design thinking process to make real, physical prototypes of their ideas for solving the air quality issues with 3D modeling software and a 3D printer. \r\n\r\n2. Middle school girls will investigate whether tree canopy coverage correlates with air quality and pollution in their neighborhoods by designing and building an aerial photography vehicle that will help them survey the tree canopy coverage. Combining this with data collected by sensors, girls will be able to see a correlation between tree coverage and air quality.\r\n\r\n3. Girls in our high school program will learn valuable technical skills as they design and make wearable air quality indicators that illuminate LEDs in response to sensor measurements received by a mobile app. These wearable indicators are visual tools that will spark conversation within the community about air quality. \r\n\r\n4. Girls will be able to speak confidently about air quality in their community and it’s effects on health. They will be prepared to lead workshops where participants build and take home a small air quality indicator empowering them to collect data and take action.\r\n\r\nAs a result of these activities, girls will be equipped to address local government agencies on youth-led, research-based immediate actions that would improve air quality, and consequently, the quality of life in their communities. This project is a hands-on, engaging way for girls to find their voice, build their confidence, and become advocates for the change they want to see in their communities. "

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "One major challenge we anticipate is the amount of time that changes and recommendations based on the data collected by the projects will actually take to be implemented. We want to engage the girls in citizen science, technology and civic engagement. As a result, they will be encouraged to make recommendations to policy makers and other agencies. We hope they don't get discouraged by the amount of time it can take for a change to happen and plan to help them understand that these changes take time. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, once the girls find areas with very poor air quality a barrier can be the lack of technical expertise to identify the root cause of the problem. To overcome this we plan to engage air quality experts to help us analyze data and advise on solutions. An air quality expert from CH2M has already volunteered to be an advisor. "
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "We will gather data using pre and post surveys and interviews. The pre and post assessments include information about the girls in our programs and workshop participants’  experience and measure knowledge of air quality issues in their communities. Data will be analyzed at the end of each program cycle.\r\n\r\nOur evaluation instruments will be designed to measure our objectives:\r\n\r\n1) Girls will demonstrate understanding of technical concepts and skills related to the project\r\n\r\n2) Girls will share findings and propose solutions\r\n\r\n3) Community members will commit to take at least one action to improve air quality as a result of attending workshops\r\n\r\nWe will also track specific actions taken to improve air quality based on the environmental data that is collected and shared. We want to know if these actions made a difference in the community such as increasing public awareness, identifying causes of poor air quality, and reducing health problems related to not having clean air.  "
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "The DIY Girls’ program model integrates engagement, capacity building, and continuity to ensure girls’ success. The afterschool program for 5th grade girls is designed to offer activities that attract young girls to technology, allow them to express creativity and give them more confidence in their technical abilities. We aim to have an effect on girls as they enter adolescence and start to form career interests by providing them the tools and confidence to persist in STEM. Our girls make real things and learn practical technical skills that can be applied creatively. \r\n\r\nOur ‘Making for Good’ program is based on the principle that empowering youth can lead to civic engagement. The ‘Making for Good’ program is unique in its approach to youth engagement; DIY Girls intentionally creates opportunities for student choice and control in shaping the direction of their projects throughout the ‘Making for Good’ program. Girls report feeling more confident in their ability to shape their own future after participating in our ‘Making for Good’ program. This project is unique since it places state of the art technology and “making” of products and services central to the project; girls invent real prototypes or services to solve issues plaguing their community. Girls participating in these programs learn how new technologies, such as 3D modeling and wearable tech, can be used to quickly develop a functional prototype. As a result, our girls create authentically youth-driven solutions. \r\n\r\nThe Clean Air Project curriculum is inspired by and combines the application of two open-source platforms, Air Casting (http://aircasting.org/) and Kids Making Sense (http://kidsmakingsense.org/), to link the investigation of air quality to the creation of technology, fostering engagement among youth in public health and air quality issues through problem solving and solutions-driven engineering. The AirCasting materials assist in the collecting, displaying, and sharing of health and environmental data using wearable sensors and smartphone technology. The Kids Making Sense materials will help our participants interpret and share collected data, identify causes of local air pollution, and lead civic action to protect public health."
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "We partner with 8 LAUSD schools in the San Fernando Valley and the Discovery Cube LA. These organizations provide in-kind space and some materials for our programs. \r\n\r\nWe will also collaborate with engineering societies such as the American Society of Civil Engineers and other technical volunteers to help us with the content  of our project. \r\n\r\nOur project work will be showcased at public events like CicLAvia which will take place in Pacoima in March 2016. "
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': "We have budgeted $175,000 for this project and have submitted requests for funds from the SoCalGas Environmental Champions Grant, NVIDIA Foundation and the eBay Settlement Fund to cover additional costs.  \r\n\r\nOur afterschool programs are partially sponsored by the Durfee Foundation and General Motors as well as some funds provided from the host schools. \r\n\r\nWe have also developed a sustainability plan based on potential opportunities for the project. Our plan includes strategies for increasing funds through traditional fundraising as well as earned revenue. \r\n\r\nOur ideas for bringing in earned revenue include:\r\n\r\nFees for training – The Clean Air project will generate lots of interest from schools, organizations, and corporations that are interested in air quality. We plan to market our services to offer workshops and training for educators interested in replicating this project. \r\n\r\nFees for air quality services - We will also offer companies a service where they can contract a group of girls to take air quality measurements at their locations.\r\n\r\n"
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Salaries  - $61,000\r\nEquipment  -  $10,000\r\nSupplies - $1500\r\nProject Materials -  $15,000\r\nTransportation - $1000\r\nShowcases - $2500\r\nWorkshops - $2500\r\nAdministrative/ Indirect Costs - $6500\r\n\r\n\r\n"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "Our Clean Air project is both scalable and replicable. After completing the project with girls in the San Fernando Valley we plan to expand it to other areas of Los Angeles with poor air quality using the same equipment which includes air quality sensors and smart phones. We will accomplish this by training educators, community organizers, volunteers and environmental justice organizations on our process as well as on the technical project skills required to design and build solutions. We will make our equipment available via a lending library so that scaling the project can be cost effective.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, our ‘Making for Good’ process is flexible enough to be individualized and implemented with different themes, including health, air quality, and other quality of life issues. DIY Girls is interested in continuing to develop our project around issues that directly affect Los Angeles, including access to healthy food, drought alleviation, and clean energy.  We are working to share our process and provide materials online for anyone to use. We also will help other interested parties replicate our model. "
