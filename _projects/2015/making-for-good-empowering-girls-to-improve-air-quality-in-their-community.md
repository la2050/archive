  ‘Making for Good’ is a DIY Girls initiative that implements the design
  thinking process to empower girls to identify and prototype solutions to
  issues encountered in their communities. We will expand our ‘Making for Good’
  project to investigate air quality using open-source technology and propose
  solutions for a Los Angeles with clean air by 2050. This project enables girls
  and others to become advocates for the change they want to see in their
  communities.
