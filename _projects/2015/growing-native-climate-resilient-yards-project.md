  We propose to build Growing Native, a web tool to help Angelenos choose
  beautiful, climate-resilient plants for their yards so the region can depend
  less on imported water. Growing Native will link data on optimal growing
  conditions for California native plants with neighborhood-scale data on
  present and future climate in LA County. Residents will be able to enter their
  address and garden preferences and receive a list of plants that will thrive
  in their yards, as well as plant care advice.
