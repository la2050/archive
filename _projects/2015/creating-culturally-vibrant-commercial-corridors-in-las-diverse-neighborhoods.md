  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: "The cultural assets of Los Angeles’ neighborhoods represent an untapped economic development resource. Our goal is to have Los Angeles’ culturally-rich communities reach their economic potential. Many of these neighborhoods are being discovered due to the installation of new transit rail lines along with market pressures on households to identify affordable housing and commercial climates. This phenomena could very well threaten and in some cases wipe out the cultural viability and longevity of these areas. LA LISC is poised to take on the leadership challenge of working with local stakeholders in 4 distinct neighborhoods to engage businesses, residents, merchant associations, arts-related entities and community based organizations to maximize collaboration and to harness the creative cultural potential to achieve an economic development gain. LA LISC will: (1)\tConvene a cultural economic development summit – LA LISC will host a day-long summit to address the many facets of cultural economic development and connect participants to creative strategies that have been used in region and from across the country. LA LISC envisions an event that includes interactive panels, tours, skills-building and knowledge gaining sessions that highlight how local organizations can impact the ongoing viability of their cultural commercial districts. (2) Activate 4 cultural magnets with a pilot or iconic activity – LA LISC has identified 4 cultural magnets in which to implement a pilot or iconic activity. The four areas are Central Avenue Historic District (Coalition for Responsible Community Development), Little Tokyo (Little Tokyo Service Center), East Los Angeles/Boyle Heights (East Los Angeles Community Corporation and Leimert Park (LP Village 20|20 Vision Initiative). The identified cultural magnets will have an opportunity to explore and categorize their current approaches and determine how best to anchor those activities. \r\n(3)\tSupport and grow entrepreneurial enterprises that are a part of creating neighborhood cultural vibrancy – Small businesses are often the heart and soul of what makes a place culturally great. LA LISC will work with the 4 cultural magnet communities to identify businesses and further define clusters that are essential to their creative economy. The goal will be to assist these businesses with access to capital, information, larger markets and technical assistance."

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    The current infrastructure that promotes Los Angeles tourism and sites for
    filming are often disconnected from smaller non-profit commercial
    development advocacy. At least 4 neighborhoods (and potentially more who
    take advantage of the Cultural Economic Development Summit) will have an
    opportunity to create a cultural economic development plan and strategy that
    is anchored by strengthening current creative economy small businesses. It
    is widely recognized that the long-term success of such strategies will
    involve attracting tourists and visitors from outside the community. Many
    non-profits lack the relationships necessary to successfully externally
    market their cultural districts. On the other hand, the LA Convention and
    Visitor’s Bureau, LA, Inc and groups such as LA Film Locations have access
    to film and music sectors, tourism resources, support for special events and
    festivals, and strong marketing budgets. As the convener, LA LISC will be
    tasked with bringing these groups together.
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "LA LISC is seeking to engage stakeholders in a coordinated effort to develop cultural economic strategies. It is our hope to inspire the need for neighborhood and historic preservation of culture in demanding economic conditions. Success will be evaluated by the following metrics: \r\n•\t10 participant communities/commercial districts and neighborhoods in the Cultural Economic Development Summit (40-50 participants);\r\n•\tFour project partners implement an iconic cultural economic development idea from among their strategy during the grant period;\r\n•\tFour project partners complete inventory of small businesses that contribute to the cultural economy;\r\n•\tAt least 20 businesses receive technical assistance to nurture their growth and development; and\r\n•\tAt least 4 businesses receive financial assistance."
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    As far as LA LISC is aware, there are no other organizations in Los Angeles
    seeking to convene local leaders and stakeholders to support the development
    of cultural economic development strategies for key cultural magnets. LA
    LISC considers the work of partner organizations listed herein as
    complementary to the creation of cultural economic development strategies.
    Our approach is unique in that it increases knowledge on how arts and
    culture can drive the economic outcomes of an area, it has an emphasis on
    cross-community collaboration, and it is focused on nurturing and growing
    small businesses that make up the cultural identity of LA's diverse
    commercial hubs.  
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    This project will involve partnership of at least four identified community
    organizations, with each receiving $10,000 of the total LA2050 Grant Award.
    The four partners are as follows: Coalition for Responsible Community
    Development, Little Tokyo Service Center, East Los Angeles Community
    Corporation and Leimert Park Village 20|20 Vision Initiative.
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    LA LISC expects that the project will cost $215,000. The additional costs
    will be covered by HUD Section 4 grant support secured by LISC to support
    commercial corridor development in Los Angeles ($75,000). The remaining
    balance will be raised from third party sources such as National LISC's
    Creative Placemaking strategy grants in partnership with the Kresge
    Foundation ($40,000). 
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Project Budget:\r\n$40,000 - This cost includes the portion of the budget available for Organizational Partnerships for Cultural District Planning and implementation of iconic activities (Economic revitalization strategies that integrate arts and culture typically involve facility-centric, people-oriented and/or program-based approaches. Each one of the pre-identified cultural magnet communities will be tasked to implement one activity to support their respective strategy.)\r\n\r\n$25,000 - This includes direct costs for Convening Summit on Cultural Economic Development Strategies and Opportunities (The summit will be open to a larger audience of Angeleno leaders who are grappling with external forces impacting the cultural vibrancy of commercial corridors. Moreover, the convening will be designed to encourage the forging of powerful partnerships across communities who are all seeking to achieve sustainability, cultural resilience and economic prosperity.) Direct costs include but are not limited to location, outreach/marketing, refreshments, speaker honorariums, meeting logistics (i.e. meeting printed materials and supplies).\r\n\r\n$35,000 - This cost includes overall program implementation and planning. Organizing the convening, providing technical assistance to partner groups to implement cultural economic development strategies, providing technical assistance to partner groups and small businesses to ensure access to capital, information and larger markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    The success of the this project can be scaled by hosting annual convenings
    among cultural magnet communities in Los Angeles to share best practices and
    outcomes. The intensive technical assistance provided to the first four
    cultural magnet communities can be applied to other similar areas in Los
    Angeles. And finally, LA LISC is part of a national community economic
    development organization and successes from this pilot program can be
    further studied, documented and applied to other LISC offices across the
    country as best practices for seamlessly blending cultural economic
    development strategies, small business and regional cultural tourism plans.
