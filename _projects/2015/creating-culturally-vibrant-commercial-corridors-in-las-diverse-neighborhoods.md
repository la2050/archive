  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: "The cultural assets of Los Angeles’ neighborhoods represent an untapped economic development resource. Our goal is to have Los Angeles’ culturally-rich communities reach their economic potential. Many of these neighborhoods are being discovered due to the installation of new transit rail lines along with market pressures on households to identify affordable housing and commercial climates. This phenomena could very well threaten and in some cases wipe out the cultural viability and longevity of these areas. LA LISC is poised to take on the leadership challenge of working with local stakeholders in 4 distinct neighborhoods to engage businesses, residents, merchant associations, arts-related entities and community based organizations to maximize collaboration and to harness the creative cultural potential to achieve an economic development gain. LA LISC will: (1)\tConvene a cultural economic development summit – LA LISC will host a day-long summit to address the many facets of cultural economic development and connect participants to creative strategies that have been used in region and from across the country. LA LISC envisions an event that includes interactive panels, tours, skills-building and knowledge gaining sessions that highlight how local organizations can impact the ongoing viability of their cultural commercial districts. (2) Activate 4 cultural magnets with a pilot or iconic activity – LA LISC has identified 4 cultural magnets in which to implement a pilot or iconic activity. The four areas are Central Avenue Historic District (Coalition for Responsible Community Development), Little Tokyo (Little Tokyo Service Center), East Los Angeles/Boyle Heights (East Los Angeles Community Corporation and Leimert Park (LP Village 20|20 Vision Initiative). The identified cultural magnets will have an opportunity to explore and categorize their current approaches and determine how best to anchor those activities. \r\n(3)\tSupport and grow entrepreneurial enterprises that are a part of creating neighborhood cultural vibrancy – Small businesses are often the heart and soul of what makes a place culturally great. LA LISC will work with the 4 cultural magnet communities to identify businesses and further define clusters that are essential to their creative economy. The goal will be to assist these businesses with access to capital, information, larger markets and technical assistance."

  districts. (2) Activate 4 cultural magnets with a pilot or iconic activity –
  LA LISC has identified 4 cultural magnets in which to implement a pilot or
  iconic activity. The four areas are Central Avenue Historic District
  (Coalition for Responsible Community Development), Little Tokyo (Little Tokyo
  Service Center), East Los Angeles/Boyle Heights (East Los Angeles Community
  Corporation and Leimert Park (LP Village 20|20 Vision Initiative). The
  identified cultural magnets will have an opportunity to explore and categorize

The goal will be to assist these businesses with access to capital, information, larger markets and technical assistance.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  The current infrastructure that promotes Los Angeles tourism and sites for
  filming are often disconnected from smaller non-profit commercial development
  advocacy. At least 4 neighborhoods (and potentially more who take advantage of
  the Cultural Economic Development Summit) will have an opportunity to create a
  cultural economic development plan and strategy that is anchored by
  strengthening current creative economy small businesses. It is widely
  recognized that the long-term success of such strategies will involve
  attracting tourists and visitors from outside the community. Many non-profits
  lack the relationships necessary to successfully externally market their
  cultural districts. On the other hand, the LA Convention and Visitor’s Bureau,
  LA, Inc and groups such as LA Film Locations have access to film and music
  sectors, tourism resources, support for special events and festivals, and
  strong marketing budgets. As the convener, LA LISC will be tasked with
  bringing these groups together.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  LA LISC is seeking to engage stakeholders in a coordinated effort to develop
  cultural economic strategies. It is our hope to inspire the need for
  neighborhood and historic preservation of culture in demanding economic
  conditions. Success will be evaluated by the following metrics: 
   • 10 participant communities/commercial districts and neighborhoods in the Cultural Economic Development Summit (40-50 participants);
   • Four project partners implement an iconic cultural economic development idea from among their strategy during the grant period;
   • Four project partners complete inventory of small businesses that contribute to the cultural economy;
   • At least 20 businesses receive technical assistance to nurture their growth and development; and
   • At least 4 businesses receive financial assistance.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  As far as LA LISC is aware, there are no other organizations in Los Angeles
  seeking to convene local leaders and stakeholders to support the development
  of cultural economic development strategies for key cultural magnets. LA LISC
  considers the work of partner organizations listed herein as complementary to
  the creation of cultural economic development strategies. Our approach is
  unique in that it increases knowledge on how arts and culture can drive the
  economic outcomes of an area, it has an emphasis on cross-community
  collaboration, and it is focused on nurturing and growing small businesses
  that make up the cultural identity of LA's diverse commercial hubs.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  This project will involve partnership of at least four identified community
  organizations, with each receiving $10,000 of the total LA2050 Grant Award.
  The four partners are as follows: Coalition for Responsible Community
  Development, Little Tokyo Service Center, East Los Angeles Community
  Corporation and Leimert Park Village 20|20 Vision Initiative.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  The success of the this project can be scaled by hosting annual convenings
  among cultural magnet communities in Los Angeles to share best practices and
  outcomes. The intensive technical assistance provided to the first four
  cultural magnet communities can be applied to other similar areas in Los
  Angeles. And finally, LA LISC is part of a national community economic
  development organization and successes from this pilot program can be further
  studied, documented and applied to other LISC offices across the country as
  best practices for seamlessly blending cultural economic development
  strategies, small business and regional cultural tourism plans.
