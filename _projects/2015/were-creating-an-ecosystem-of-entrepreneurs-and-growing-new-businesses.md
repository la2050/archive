title: Were creating an ecosystem of entrepreneurs and growing new businesses.
project_summary: >-
  This summer we opened our first Grid110 space in DTLA. We plan to open
  multiple spaces throughout downtown and around LA, that use an-accelerator
  type model to support the growth of startups, as well as provide programming
  and public events. Each space will focus on a different industry, creating
  sub-communities within the LA startup community and connecting the dots on an
  overall ecosystem.

Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: "Grid110 will make LA the best place to CREATE  by growing new companies through community. \r\n\r\nWe’re creating an ecosystem of entrepreneurs, doers, movers shakers, and business makers, and we’re currently stimulating the economy in Downtown LA by supporting the growth of startup companies, and ultimately creating jobs. \r\n\r\nGRID110 supports early stage businesses and innovative new companies by providing a free workspace, mentoring and access to resources. It’s our aim that startups participating in our program will be able to scale with a stable trajectory, thus stimulating economic development in LA. \r\n\r\nWe launched our first community space this summer, with a focus on downtown and fashion tech, and we plan to open spaces in other neighborhoods and industries in the near future. \r\n\r\nCurrently there are 5 startups in our pilot program, and it's our goal that they will be able to afford their own office space, and will expand their team after receiving mentorship, and access to resources. \r\n\r\nHow will the community benefit?\r\n\r\nWe’re providing complementary workspace to viable companies. The 5 startups we selected for our inaugural program are the first of many companies that will participate in our programming. Cutting out the overhead cost of office space allows companies to put their money into other parts of their business. \r\n\r\nWhile our first space is focused on fashion companies, our second space may focus on growing health startups in Boyle Heights, or entertainment in Hollywood, and we plan to have multiple Grid110 spaces focused on various industries over the next few years.\r\n\r\nMentorship is key in building a successful business. Our program connects startups to the experts they need right when they need them, whether it's legal, financial, or HR advice, we give them the people and tools they need to grow.\r\n\r\nAccess to capital is another important piece of growing a business. We will host a Demo day in January and at the end of each program cycle to connect the community to biggest startup investors in LA. \r\n\r\nCreating jobs and keeping talent in LA will be a hugely important byproduct of our programing, and major part of why we’re doing what we’re doing. If the best new companies exist here, and can hire, why wouldn't the talent stay?!\r\n\r\nWe also plan on hosting public events to help build the overall local startup community and to serve as platform to support all business development and growth."

  evaluation strategy in collaboration with experts.
