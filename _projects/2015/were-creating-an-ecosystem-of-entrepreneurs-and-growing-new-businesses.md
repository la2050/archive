project_summary: >-
  This summer we opened our first Grid110 space in DTLA. We plan to open
  multiple spaces throughout downtown and around LA, that use an-accelerator
  type model to support the growth of startups, as well as provide programming
  and public events. Each space will focus on a different industry, creating
  sub-communities within the LA startup community and connecting the dots on an
  overall ecosystem.
Please specify below: DTLA

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Grid110 will make LA the best place to CREATE by growing new companies through
  community. 
   
   We’re creating an ecosystem of entrepreneurs, doers, movers shakers, and business makers, and we’re currently stimulating the economy in Downtown LA by supporting the growth of startup companies, and ultimately creating jobs. 
   
   GRID110 supports early stage businesses and innovative new companies by providing a free workspace, mentoring and access to resources. It’s our aim that startups participating in our program will be able to scale with a stable trajectory, thus stimulating economic development in LA. 
   
   We launched our first community space this summer, with a focus on downtown and fashion tech, and we plan to open spaces in other neighborhoods and industries in the near future. 
   
   Currently there are 5 startups in our pilot program, and it's our goal that they will be able to afford their own office space, and will expand their team after receiving mentorship, and access to resources. 
   
   How will the community benefit?
   
   We’re providing complementary workspace to viable companies. The 5 startups we selected for our inaugural program are the first of many companies that will participate in our programming. Cutting out the overhead cost of office space allows companies to put their money into other parts of their business. 
   
   While our first space is focused on fashion companies, our second space may focus on growing health startups in Boyle Heights, or entertainment in Hollywood, and we plan to have multiple Grid110 spaces focused on various industries over the next few years.
   
   Mentorship is key in building a successful business. Our program connects startups to the experts they need right when they need them, whether it's legal, financial, or HR advice, we give them the people and tools they need to grow.
   
   Access to capital is another important piece of growing a business. We will host a Demo day in January and at the end of each program cycle to connect the community to biggest startup investors in LA. 
   
   Creating jobs and keeping talent in LA will be a hugely important byproduct of our programing, and major part of why we’re doing what we’re doing. If the best new companies exist here, and can hire, why wouldn't the talent stay?!
   
   We also plan on hosting public events to help build the overall local startup community and to serve as platform to support all business development and growth.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Our biggest challenge is accommodating every new business in LA. We don’t have
  the capacity, or resources to help EVERY new company one-on-one. 
   
   For our first program cycle, we created an application process and chose an industry focus relevant to downtown, but we we're only able to accommodate 5 startups in house.
   
   Alongside our partners, advisors and the community, we’ll choose the next best space and vertical to further support startup growth in LA.
   
   We’ll strive to put on community events with our partners to serve as many people as possible, and will even explore the concept of building and online community platform to support everyone starting a business in LA.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We’re currently bringing together a team to help determine our metrics, and
  how to measure and evaluate our impact. We’re in the process of contacting
  companies, universities, orgs and researchers to help us determine the best
  metrics to measure our work. Over the next 6 months, we plan to develop an
  evaluation strategy in collaboration with experts.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There are many other incubators and accelerators in the area, but most of them
  take equity in their companies. GRID110 is a public benefit cooperation that
  provides free office space, mentoring and resources without taking equity. 
   
   The other differentiator is that we were started by entrepreneurs for entrepreneurs. We’re a team solving problems that we we’re all facing. 
   
   We're a team of community builders dedicated to better connecting LA.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Mayor Eric Garcetti’s Office is our biggest partner (but not a fiscal sponsor)
  and has opened several doors for us in the way of connecting us with key
  stakeholders and relevant members of the community.
   
   Brookfield is currently our largest community sponsor. They own 47% of the buildings on Bunker Hill, and are taking an active interest in supporting the growing ecosystem of startups.
   
   The legal firm Nixon Peabody is also invested in helping Grid110 succeed. They have been providing legal mentorship and consultation to our community.
   
   Various other local businesses have expressed interest in supporting our community programming.
   
   All of the funding from LA2050 will go directly towards Grid110's efforts.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  To operate one space costs around 100-150K per year, which covers basic
  overhead for the space, internet and electricity. 
   
   Many of these items we we're able to find funding for, or secured in-kind donations to help operate our first space.
   
   We know this endeavor will cost us more than $100k as we open more spaces, but 100K will help us get our second space up and running and further support us in building a community platform to connect what's being created in Los Angeles.
   
   At the moment the Grid110 founders and board of directors are volunteering their personal time in lieu of being able to hire a program manager. Hiring a program manager to coordinate mentors, and oversee the day-to-day will be vital to our growth and success. With a program manager we’ll be able to offer more events, and opportunities to further support the growing startup ecosystem in LA.
   
   As we grow we will continue to actively seek out partners, and have had much success in building relations with key members of the community.
   
   We are also currently exploring multiple sustainability and revenue models to further fund our efforts as we grow.

   If we receive the LA2050 funding we are happy to explore inviting the LA2050 community to vote on which industry our next space should focus on. This could be anything from health startups, to entertainment companies, to maybe even supporting innovative and new restaurants or brick and mortar shops in LA. We'd love to involve the community in helping us make the decision.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  The overarching aim at the moment is to activate the ecosystem, promote DTLA
  as a startup hub, and fill gaps in the business development pipeline.
   
   As we continue to expand, we believe we can be the driving force to connect the dots on the entire LA startup ecosystem. 
   
   Through providing mentorship and resources to our current five startup companies with in our pilot program, they are receiving the support and connections necessary to position them for venture funding, or revenue growth, and thus job creation.
   
   With each space we open, we'll be able to help more and more startups on-on-one. We'll continue to curate each advisory board relevant to the industry focus, and continue to grow organically through building sub-communities within each vertical and by providing relevant public programming.
   
   For us, our partners, and our startups this effort has been a win-win-win.
   
   Hiring staff for Grid110 will be vital in order for us to grow beyond our first space and continue to scale in growing the starting ecosystem.
