  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "Los Angeles ranks an appalling 45th\_out of 51 major cities in the U.S. for volunteerism. According to the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) research, long commuting times and high poverty rates, as is the case in Los Angeles, can adversely affect volunteering rates.  \r\n\r\nBy utilizing L.A. Works existing managed project model that mitigates the challenges of long commute times to make it easy to volunteer, and expanding our volunteer leadership programming and curriculum, L.A. Works strives to shift the culture of civic engagement in Los Angeles. \r\n\r\nAt the heart of our organization are our volunteer leaders who manage  opportunities each month at our nonprofit partners’ sites – so anyone can make a difference in L.A., regardless of skill-set, interest, age or schedule. Opportunities include conserving natural environments, serving meals to the homeless, offering companionship to seniors, leading athletic sessions with special-needs youth, and reading to children (to name just a few!). Neither the nonprofit partners nor the volunteers are charged to participate. \r\n\r\nFor nonprofits, this connection provides a critical resource to stretch their budgets, share important information about their missions, and tap volunteers’ unique skill-sets that might not be available or affordable within their staff base.\r\n\r\nWe hope to expand and deepen these connections by building out the managed program model. L.A. Works’ goal is to move our city up in the national rankings by blanketing LA County with quality volunteer opportunities that are happening every day of the week, at a variety of times of the day. Our vision is to make these opportunities so accessible that people won’t even need to leave their neighborhood to engage in meaningful volunteer work. \r\n\r\nL.A. Works Managed Projects are often the “starter project” for people to connect with community service. By not requiring a long-term commitment, the Managed Projects allow volunteers to test out a variety of opportunities until they find the one that best fits their interests. Often, from there, individuals will make a longer-term, deeper connection to the nonprofit organization where they’ve served.\r\n\r\nThe expansion of Managed Projects will contribute to the ongoing effort to improving Los Angeles. With the help of this award, we hope that in the near future, LA will be thought of as a model for service as much as we are known for entertainment, sports, and our weather."
