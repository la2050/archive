  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "Los Angeles ranks an appalling 45th\_out of 51 major cities in the U.S. for volunteerism. According to the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) research, long commuting times and high poverty rates, as is the case in Los Angeles, can adversely affect volunteering rates.  \r\n\r\nBy utilizing L.A. Works existing managed project model that mitigates the challenges of long commute times to make it easy to volunteer, and expanding our volunteer leadership programming and curriculum, L.A. Works strives to shift the culture of civic engagement in Los Angeles. \r\n\r\nAt the heart of our organization are our volunteer leaders who manage  opportunities each month at our nonprofit partners’ sites – so anyone can make a difference in L.A., regardless of skill-set, interest, age or schedule. Opportunities include conserving natural environments, serving meals to the homeless, offering companionship to seniors, leading athletic sessions with special-needs youth, and reading to children (to name just a few!). Neither the nonprofit partners nor the volunteers are charged to participate. \r\n\r\nFor nonprofits, this connection provides a critical resource to stretch their budgets, share important information about their missions, and tap volunteers’ unique skill-sets that might not be available or affordable within their staff base.\r\n\r\nWe hope to expand and deepen these connections by building out the managed program model. L.A. Works’ goal is to move our city up in the national rankings by blanketing LA County with quality volunteer opportunities that are happening every day of the week, at a variety of times of the day. Our vision is to make these opportunities so accessible that people won’t even need to leave their neighborhood to engage in meaningful volunteer work. \r\n\r\nL.A. Works Managed Projects are often the “starter project” for people to connect with community service. By not requiring a long-term commitment, the Managed Projects allow volunteers to test out a variety of opportunities until they find the one that best fits their interests. Often, from there, individuals will make a longer-term, deeper connection to the nonprofit organization where they’ve served.\r\n\r\nThe expansion of Managed Projects will contribute to the ongoing effort to improving Los Angeles. With the help of this award, we hope that in the near future, LA will be thought of as a model for service as much as we are known for entertainment, sports, and our weather."

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "Although L.A. Works is confident that the Managed Projects model is effective, the success of its expansion will be based on significantly increasing the number of nonprofit partner sites. Additionally, we will still need to overcome the same barriers that come with efforts to mobilize people in LA; namely commute times. \r\n\r\nTo overcome these obstacles, we will need to be strategic with our recruitment efforts to ensure that the Project Leaders and volunteers being recruited are matched with issues and nonprofits within their geographic comfort zone. And we will target specific groups and spaces where we know we can find dedicated and passionate changemakers to help us expand our program and to grow with us. By targeting these existing partnerships by region, we know we’ll find the volunteers we need to stick with us through the early stages of expansion. "
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "L.A. Works will evaluate the success of the program through the lens of four important constituents: general volunteers, volunteer leaders, nonprofits, and the clients the nonprofit serves. For the volunteers, volunteer leaders, and nonprofits, L.A. Works will conduct post-project surveys (through a link in the follow-up email to participants) to collect the relevant data in order to track and measure our success in achieving the following desired outcomes. We will ask that the nonprofits provide us with quantitative data on the impact the volunteers have had on their mission and clients served. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, L.A. Works' Director of Programs will conduct qualitative and quantitative baseline, formative and summative research using online questionnaires and one-on-one interviews where necessary throughout the grant cycle."
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "L.A. Works is a proud affiliate of HandsOn, a national network of volunteer centers. HandsOn affiliates in California include HandsOn Bay Area and One OC. Although our programs vary, all of us seek to bring people together to strengthen communities through meaningful volunteer action. \r\n\r\nWhat makes our organization’s approach unique is our heightened expertise in volunteerism. L.A. Works was established in 1991, in the same timeframe that the national HandsOn Network was formed. Our programs have had over two decades to develop, and our Managed Projects program is one of our most solid programs. Its key characteristics include the sustainability of the program model and the impact that the program has in the wide range of issue areas that it serves. By training volunteers to become project leaders, we are giving volunteers the skills to manage their own groups of volunteers. Once they are fully trained, these projects require little oversight from L.A. Works staff. In addition to the training they receive, project leaders and general volunteers are all passionate individuals who care deeply about making a lasting change in the community.\r\n\r\nOur approach is also unique because it puts the changemaking in the hands of the community. Although we provide the training, it’s our community members who bring their unique skills and experiences to the role of Project Leader. It’s people from the community that make Managed Projects the success that it is because they have first hand experience of what the issues are and the best idea of what solutions will work. L.A. Works may be connecting volunteers to the project and volunteers to each other, but it truly is the volunteers who turn the projects into meaningful experiences. \r\n"
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "It order to make the volunteer projects most accessible, L.A. Works hopes to be able to grow our Managed Projects such that we are partnering with at least 150 different nonprofit agencies across Greater LA. Each of these organizations will then have at least a monthly (typically bi-monthly) project with approximately 20 volunteers spending approximately 3 hours at the nonprofit site. If we are to use the Independent Sector value of volunteer time in California at $26/hr, this would average to leveraging the grant funds to provide nonprofits in LA with at least $234,000 of volunteer resources each month.\r\n\r\nIn addition, to raise the profile of volunteerism in LA, L.A. Works will utilize a portion of funds from this grant to commission the production of white papers that detail the extent of volunteerism in LA, its contribution to the local economy, and the level of nontraditional volunteering that is taking place. \r\n"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "Although L.A. Works mobilizes more than 35,000 volunteers in service each year, we only have a full-time staff of nine. We are able to do so much as a grassroots organization thanks to the dedication and generosity of our volunteer leaders. We have more than 90 trained volunteer leaders at our nonprofit partner sites and each quarter we have between 15-20 skilled volunteers assisting with various aspects of our organizational infrastructure – from social media to community connections. \r\n\r\nThe Managed Project program is designed to scale. We have a trained volunteer leader who is assisting with the training of additional leaders and are currently recruiting to identify a volunteer to assist with recruiting additional volunteer leaders from within our own cadre of volunteer participants. Once the volunteer leader is in place and trained on our volunteer database system, there is minimal management time needed to oversee this program on a daily basis.\r\n"
