  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    It has been shown that about half way through habit change programs,
    especially ones designed to impact exercise and nutrition, people may start
    feeling insecure about their progress and like they might fail. They feel
    like they don’t deserve success. I will encourage an open dialogue. I will
    address any and all insecurities within the group on a regular basis
    throughout the program and give extra individual support to anyone needing
    it. I will identify such experiences as natural components of habit change
    and help participants to recognize both that they deserve to succeed and
    will describe the many reasons why that is. 
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "The effectiveness of the program on participants’ overall health and well-being will be measured using objective and subjective data. There will be a third party Registered Nurse to track and keep reports on individual progress.\r\nThe program will develop an individualized service plan (ISP) for each group member that includes:\r\n\r\nQuantitative Baseline\r\n•\tBlood pressure changes\r\n•\tWeight \r\n•\tBMI decrease\r\n\r\nQuantitative Changes\r\n•\tBlood pressure changes\r\n•\tWeight \r\n•\tBMI decrease\r\n\r\nQuantitative Measurements = Qualitative Outcome\r\n•\tOverall mental well-being\r\n•\tMood\r\n•\tAttitude\r\n•\tSelf-Esteem\r\n•\tConfidence\r\n•\tDiscipline\r\n•\tEnergy Level\r\n"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "The American Diabetes Association, American Heart Association, the Center for Managing Chronic Disease, and The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health all have toolkits for walking programs. They are self-motivated guides for a solo-walking program. In addition, there are many non-profits in Los Angeles that help with nutrition, as well as exercise, yoga, and zumba classes. Schools such as UCLA offer one-time lectures on the importance of exercise to one’s health.\r\n\r\nWhat makes this Walking to Wellness program unique is that it utilizes interactive learning in combination with shared experiences in a safe and supportive environment. In my experience as a walking coach, simply suggesting to people that they begin to walk on their own rarely yields behavior change. But being there to walk with them, to talk with them and to encourage them along the way, until walking becomes a habit, provides just the supportive environment needed to effect that desired change. This program includes facilitator-led group walks, individual walking, motivational support from within the group and individually, and positive reinforcement from the facilitator between meetings. We don’t just talk, we “Walk the walk!”\r\n"

    I have volunteered with Groceryships, a wonderful organization whose mission
    is very much in alignment with the goals of this program. Groceryships can
    refer their program participants and alumni to the Walking to Wellness
    Program as a complementary way for those participants to continue their
    journey towards health. As such, I would like to list Groceryships as a
    collaboration partner and will share the balance of the funds of
    approximately $43,000 with them.

  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    Once the program is established, I plan to expand its scope by developing a
    “train the trainer” curriculum, which will allow others to implement the
    program. I also plan to do motivational speaking about the positive impact
    to local communities Walking-To-Wellness has had on exercise and healthy
    living, which will help increase awareness of the program in more
    communities. Alumni will be encouraged to go into their communities and
    share their experiences taking part in the program and how it helped them,
    generating further interest, and growing the number of participants.

   This program is for low-income people who have:
   • Limited resources & lack access to healthy, affordable foods
   • Fewer opportunities for physical activity
   • High stress levels
   • Limited access to health care
   
   This program is for people who suffer from chronic conditions, including but not limited to diabetes, heart disease, cancer, obesity, osteoporosis, depression, in which a lack of exercise and other factors contribute to the originating problem.

   The two main focuses of this program are Walking and Changing Unhealthy Habits, inspired by the book, “The Power of Habit” by Charles Duhigg.
   
   Course Work:
   Introduction to the value of exercise
   Positive effects of exercise on physical & mental well-being
   Understanding how habits work
   Keystone Habits
   3 parts of a habit, aka “The Habit Loop”:
   • Cue
   • Routine
   • Reward
   Diagnosing and reshaping your habits in four steps:
   • Identify the routine
   • Experiment with rewards
   • Isolate the cue
   • Have a plan
   Learn to replace unhealthy habits with healthy habits
   
   Support Group Sharing:
   • Week-to-week progress
   • Goals
   • Stories
   • Areas of difficulty
   • Successes
   • Frustrations
   • Problem solving
   • Questions & answers
   
   Walking:
   30-min. weekly group walk
   Between meetings:
   30-min. 1-on-1 weekly walk with facilitator per participant
   
   Individual support between meetings via text, email & phone.
   
   Monthly Group Follow-Up Meetings:
   For the first 4 months after program completion, participants will continue to meet once a month for ongoing support & personal tune-ups.

   Quantitative Baseline
   • Blood pressure changes
   • Weight 
   • BMI decrease
   
   Quantitative Changes
   • Blood pressure changes
   • Weight 
   • BMI decrease
   
   Quantitative Measurements = Qualitative Outcome
   • Overall mental well-being

   • Attitude
   • Self-Esteem
