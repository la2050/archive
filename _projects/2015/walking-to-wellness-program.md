  The Walking-to-Wellness Program is a qualitatively and quantitatively measured
  health improvement plan, consisting of leader-facilitated group interaction
  focusing on cooperation, developing goals, and the processes required for
  reaching those goals. The program stresses individual attention and support
  and requires a 2-day per week, 7-week commitment to creating a healthier
  lifestyle. The two main elements of this program are Walking and Changing
  Unhealthy Habits.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Although Americans in all income brackets report better emotional health when
  they exercise and eat fruits and vegetables regularly, low-income Americans
  experience an even bigger emotional boost from practicing these good health
  habits than those with higher income levels. More than half of LA County’s
  adult population is overweight or obese. Statistics show that residents from
  low-income areas in LA are at higher risk for preventable diseases that are
  linked to obesity.
   
   This program is for low-income people who have:
   • Limited resources & lack access to healthy, affordable foods
   • Fewer opportunities for physical activity
   • High stress levels
   • Limited access to health care
   
   This program is for people who suffer from chronic conditions, including but not limited to diabetes, heart disease, cancer, obesity, osteoporosis, depression, in which a lack of exercise and other factors contribute to the originating problem.
   
   Research has shown that taking time for fitness is a habit that triggers widespread change. Exercise is a Keystone Habit (more important than other habits) that unlocks the secret of well-being by changing the mental image we have of ourselves. People start thinking of themselves as a person who exercises and has self-discipline. When people exercise, they start eating better and procrastinating less. They start changing other habits unconsciously, become more productive at work, and have less stress.
   
   The two main focuses of this program are Walking and Changing Unhealthy Habits, inspired by the book, “The Power of Habit” by Charles Duhigg.
   
   Course Work:
   Introduction to the value of exercise
   Positive effects of exercise on physical & mental well-being
   Understanding how habits work
   Keystone Habits
   3 parts of a habit, aka “The Habit Loop”:
   • Cue
   • Routine
   • Reward
   Diagnosing and reshaping your habits in four steps:
   • Identify the routine
   • Experiment with rewards
   • Isolate the cue
   • Have a plan
   Learn to replace unhealthy habits with healthy habits
   
   Support Group Sharing:
   • Week-to-week progress
   • Goals
   • Stories
   • Areas of difficulty
   • Successes
   • Frustrations
   • Problem solving
   • Questions & answers
   
   Walking:
   30-min. weekly group walk
   Between meetings:
   30-min. 1-on-1 weekly walk with facilitator per participant
   
   Individual support between meetings via text, email & phone.
   
   Monthly Group Follow-Up Meetings:
   For the first 4 months after program completion, participants will continue to meet once a month for ongoing support & personal tune-ups.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  It has been shown that about half way through habit change programs,
  especially ones designed to impact exercise and nutrition, people may start
  feeling insecure about their progress and like they might fail. They feel like
  they don’t deserve success. I will encourage an open dialogue. I will address
  any and all insecurities within the group on a regular basis throughout the
  program and give extra individual support to anyone needing it. I will
  identify such experiences as natural components of habit change and help
  participants to recognize both that they deserve to succeed and will describe
  the many reasons why that is.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  The effectiveness of the program on participants’ overall health and
  well-being will be measured using objective and subjective data. There will be
  a third party Registered Nurse to track and keep reports on individual
  progress.
   The program will develop an individualized service plan (ISP) for each group member that includes:
   
   Quantitative Baseline
   • Blood pressure changes
   • Weight 
   • BMI decrease
   
   Quantitative Changes
   • Blood pressure changes
   • Weight 
   • BMI decrease
   
   Quantitative Measurements = Qualitative Outcome
   • Overall mental well-being
   • Mood
   • Attitude
   • Self-Esteem
   • Confidence
   • Discipline
   • Energy Level
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  The American Diabetes Association, American Heart Association, the Center for
  Managing Chronic Disease, and The Los Angeles County Department of Public
  Health all have toolkits for walking programs. They are self-motivated guides
  for a solo-walking program. In addition, there are many non-profits in Los
  Angeles that help with nutrition, as well as exercise, yoga, and zumba
  classes. Schools such as UCLA offer one-time lectures on the importance of
  exercise to one’s health.
   
   What makes this Walking to Wellness program unique is that it utilizes interactive learning in combination with shared experiences in a safe and supportive environment. In my experience as a walking coach, simply suggesting to people that they begin to walk on their own rarely yields behavior change. But being there to walk with them, to talk with them and to encourage them along the way, until walking becomes a habit, provides just the supportive environment needed to effect that desired change. This program includes facilitator-led group walks, individual walking, motivational support from within the group and individually, and positive reinforcement from the facilitator between meetings. We don’t just talk, we “Walk the walk!”
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  I have volunteered with Groceryships, a wonderful organization whose mission
  is very much in alignment with the goals of this program. Groceryships can
  refer their program participants and alumni to the Walking to Wellness Program
  as a complementary way for those participants to continue their journey
  towards health. As such, I would like to list Groceryships as a collaboration
  partner and will share the balance of the funds of approximately $43,000 with
  them.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': 'Estimated budget for one year: $56,668 (12 Groups)'
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-

How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Once the program is established, I plan to expand its scope by developing a
  “train the trainer” curriculum, which will allow others to implement the
  program. I also plan to do motivational speaking about the positive impact to
  local communities Walking-To-Wellness has had on exercise and healthy living,
  which will help increase awareness of the program in more communities. Alumni
  will be encouraged to go into their communities and share their experiences
  taking part in the program and how it helped them, generating further
  interest, and growing the number of participants.
