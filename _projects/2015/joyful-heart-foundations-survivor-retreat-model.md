  The demand for our signature Survivor Retreat Program for survivors of
  domestic and sexual violence exceeds its availability and reach. In response,
  we have undertaken an ambitious research project in partnership with
  Georgetown University to evaluate our retreats. Our research findings will be
  used to create a replicable Retreat Model that organizations can implement and
  offer to survivors, the healing professionals who serve them, and communities
  beyond our current capacity and scope.

  The domestic violence and sexual assault service provider community currently
  faces an unprecedented challenge in effectively helping survivors understand
  and heal from the trauma that they have endured. The challenge is twofold:
  there is a void in access to and training for services that holistically
  address a survivor's mind, body and spirit in order to activate long-term
  change. And, for the past forty years, the field has been so entrenched in
  meeting the immediate needs of survivors with limited resources and support
  that staff are themselves suffering from high levels of vicarious trauma. A
  2009 study in Violence Against Women found that 70% of participating domestic
  violence advocates met the criteria for clinical levels of post-traumatic
  stress disorder. As a result, despite extensive personal sacrifice from front
  line workers in the field, the services that survivors receive fail to meet
  the overwhelming need in both volume and quality. This challenge has been
  amplified in Los Angeles, where in just the last year alone, the LAPD
  announced that reports of sexual assault had increased by 21% and domestic
  violence incidents had increased by 33%.
    
   Joyful Heart Foundation's four-day retreat is designed to restore participants' central nervous systems by addressing the physical, emotional and psychological impact of trauma, reducing the short and long term effects of this trauma, and ultimately laying the groundwork for participants to create healthy, permanent change in their own lives. Retreats are separately offered to survivors and healing professionals. The retreat offers 16 key workshops that integrate traditional and alternative healing methods and provide survivors with tools they can implement themselves, post retreat. Survivors are provided with nourishing meals, bodywork, time for reflection, and space and direction to create their own action plans for change and healing. With support from LA2050, JHF will complete 2 survivor retreats that will be evaluated by Georgetown University (a retreat for healing professionals was held and evaluated last year as part of this project). The aim of this project is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the retreat as a new approach to healing and as an evidence-informed model that organizations can bring to their staff and client populations. This project will make LA a better place to LIVE by promoting positive mental health outcomes, community resiliency and increased support for advocates in this work.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  One of the key risks in research is participant drop out rate. Survivors lead
  dynamic lives and many times this translates into unpredictable schedules or
  the inability to maintain a consistent means of contact (changing addresses,
  phone numbers, etc.). We are meeting this challenge by recruiting over the
  minimum number of survivors for each retreat to take into consideration an
  unpredictable retention rate.
   
   Another significant challenge we foresee is that while many partner agencies have a strong interest in the model, this does not necessarily translate into their ability to shift resources, infrastructure and their approaches to effectively implement the model. We are addressing this challenge by conducting thorough Needs Assessments and by creating implementation plans that lay out the changes required to achieve successful implementation of this model.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  The evaluation of the Retreat Model’s effectiveness will be led by Mary Ann
  Dutton, Ph.D., a Professor of Psychiatry at Georgetown University. Dr. Dutton
  is a well-respected clinical psychologist and researcher with over 20 years of
  extensive experience in the areas of intimate partner violence and alternative
  healing practices. The evaluation will include standardized quantitative
  assessment measures that track levels of PTSD symptoms, stress related
  outcomes, and the acquisition of healing and wellness competencies:
  self-efficacy, positive self-concept, increased self-compassion, healthy
  coping skills, decreased isolation, and increased connection among program
  participants. Qualitative assessments will target patterns of isolation and
  physical health factors that directly relate to survivors' abilities to access
  support from family, friends and community. Assessments will be captured in
  data collection periods: 2 weeks prior to retreat and 2 weeks and 3 and 6
  months post retreat.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  We work in partnership with sexual assault, domestic violence and child abuse
  agencies in Los Angeles. Our programs our specifically designed to enhance and
  support existing programs and models; we do not duplicate existing services.
  Our Survivor Retreat Model is the first project of its kind that meets the
  parallel needs of survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault and child
  abuse and the professionals who serve them. It offers a new and innovative
  approach to healing that is currently not available through traditional trauma
  response service providers. In surveying the field and in listening to the
  feedback from survivors themselves (Full Frame Initiative: How Do Survivors
  Define Success? 2014), we hear that traditional services such as emergency
  response, crisis counseling, support groups and case management, while
  necessary and critical, are not providing survivors with the level of long
  term relief from trauma that they are seeking. We also hear from crisis center
  advocates that the high demand for services and the ongoing reduction in
  resources leaves them depleted, with little to no time to step back and assess
  current programming and explore new opportunities for innovation. Our work
  through the Survivor Retreat Research Project seeks to improve the experience
  of domestic violence survivors and advocates by testing, evaluating and
  effectively implementing an innovative, survivor-centered approach to healing.
  The model incorporates survivor and advocate feedback and guidance at every
  level, from program design, implementation, participation, evaluation and
  dissemination. At the center of the model is the belief that every survivor
  holds the capacity to bring healing into their own lives. We believe this
  capacity expands when survivors are offered opportunities for healing that
  engage their body, mind and spirit. Set within the context of a healing
  community, this holistic model draws upon the individual's power to bring
  healing into their lives through their own assets and efforts and acknowledges
  the need for deepening connections to their informal support networks to
  provide continued support in their healing.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Our Los Angeles based program partners are Peace Over Violence, The Village
  Family Services, and the YWCA of Greater Los Angeles. Crisis intervention
  staff from each agency received the Heal the Healers retreat in the first year
  of this research project and continue to receive ongoing support and
  leadership development on a monthly basis, offered by JHF’s clinical team.
  Program partners assist this project by referring survivors to attend the
  retreats offered by Joyful Heart Foundation. Program partners will not receive
  monetary compensation for participating in this project.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  This is a three-year project with a total budget of $1,648,966. The budget for
  the grant period of this proposal (calendar year 2016) is $549,343. We have
  raised $165,000 through private and corporate foundations for this grant
  period and have submitted an additional $255,000 in corporate foundation grant
  applications, with funding decisions made in December 2015. We have also
  scheduled a donor cultivation event on November 5th to fundraise for this
  project. Funding for the first year of this project was successfully secured
  in full.

   The demand for our signature Survivor Retreat Program has long exceeded its availability and reach. In response, we embarked on an ambitious three-year research project in partnership with Georgetown University to conduct retreats within a research model, evaluate their effectiveness, and create a replicable Retreat Model, which can be adopted by partner organizations and offered to survivors, professionals who serve them, and communities beyond our current capacity and scope. With the publication of the model as an evidenced-informed holistic intervention for survivors, agencies within the field will be able to solicit new funding opportunities and expand their offering of healing opportunities to survivors.
   In Year Three of this project, up to three additional retreats will be offered to control group survivors at the conclusion of data collection. Advocates from partner agencies (Peace Over Violence, The Village Family Services and the YWCA of Greater Los Angeles) will shadow JHF staff in these retreats as part of their implementation training. JHF will then conduct a needs assessment of these partner agencies to assess for ability to effectively implement the model. A plan for implementation of the model at these agencies will be developed by JHF, who will provide ongoing technical assistance and mentorship through the implementation period.
    
   Additionally, upon the completion of the research project, we will release a complete evaluation of the retreat development process, retreat experience, and post-retreat findings. We will create a dissemination strategy that balances free distribution with needs for training and fidelity to the model. We will publish our curriculum and support its effective dissemination. We will also empower program partners, key staff and researchers, to strategically share the research findings through conferences and written materials.
