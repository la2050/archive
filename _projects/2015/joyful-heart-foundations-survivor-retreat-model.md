title: Joyful Heart Foundation’s Survivor Retreat Model
project_summary: >-
  The demand for our signature Survivor Retreat Program for survivors of
  domestic and sexual violence exceeds its availability and reach. In response,
  we have undertaken an ambitious research project in partnership with
  Georgetown University to evaluate our retreats. Our research findings will be
  used to create a replicable Retreat Model that organizations can implement and
  offer to survivors, the healing professionals who serve them, and communities
  beyond our current capacity and scope.

  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    The evaluation of the Retreat Model’s effectiveness will be led by Mary Ann
    Dutton, Ph.D., a Professor of Psychiatry at Georgetown University. Dr.
    Dutton is a well-respected clinical psychologist and researcher with over 20
    years of extensive experience in the areas of intimate partner violence and
    alternative healing practices. The evaluation will include standardized
    quantitative assessment measures that track levels of PTSD symptoms, stress
    related outcomes, and the acquisition of healing and wellness competencies:
    self-efficacy, positive self-concept, increased self-compassion, healthy
    coping skills, decreased isolation, and increased connection among program
    participants. Qualitative assessments will target patterns of isolation and
    physical health factors that directly relate to survivors' abilities to
    access support from family, friends and community. Assessments will be
    captured in data collection periods: 2 weeks prior to retreat and 2 weeks
    and 3 and 6 months post retreat.
