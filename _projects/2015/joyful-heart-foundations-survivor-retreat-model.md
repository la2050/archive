title: Joyful Heart Foundation’s Survivor Retreat Model
project_summary: >-
  The demand for our signature Survivor Retreat Program for survivors of
  domestic and sexual violence exceeds its availability and reach. In response,
  we have undertaken an ambitious research project in partnership with
  Georgetown University to evaluate our retreats. Our research findings will be
  used to create a replicable Retreat Model that organizations can implement and
  offer to survivors, the healing professionals who serve them, and communities
  beyond our current capacity and scope.

  'DESCRIBE IN GREATER DETAIL HOW YOU WILL MAKE LA THE HEALTHIEST PLACE TO LIVE: ': "The domestic violence and sexual assault service provider community currently faces an unprecedented challenge in effectively helping survivors understand and heal from the trauma that they have endured. The challenge is twofold: there is a void in access to and training for services that holistically address a survivor's mind, body and spirit in order to activate long-term change. And, for the past forty years, the field has been so entrenched in meeting the immediate needs of survivors with limited resources and support that staff are themselves suffering from high levels of vicarious trauma. A 2009 study in Violence Against Women found that 70% of participating domestic violence advocates met the criteria for clinical levels of post-traumatic stress disorder. As a result, despite extensive personal sacrifice from front line workers in the field, the services that survivors receive fail to meet the overwhelming need in both volume and quality. This challenge has been amplified in Los Angeles, where in just the last year alone, the LAPD announced that reports of sexual assault had increased by 21% and domestic violence incidents had increased by 33%.\r\n \r\nJoyful Heart Foundation's four-day retreat is designed to restore participants' central nervous systems by addressing the physical, emotional and psychological impact of trauma, reducing the short and long term effects of this trauma, and ultimately laying the groundwork for participants to create healthy, permanent change in their own lives. Retreats are separately offered to survivors and healing professionals. The retreat offers 16 key workshops that integrate traditional and alternative healing methods and provide survivors with tools they can implement themselves, post retreat. Survivors are provided with nourishing meals, bodywork, time for reflection, and space and direction to create their own action plans for change and healing. With support from LA2050, JHF will complete 2 survivor retreats that will be evaluated by Georgetown University (a retreat for healing professionals was held and evaluated last year as part of this project). The aim of this project is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the retreat as a new approach to healing and as an evidence-informed model that organizations can bring to their staff and client populations. This project will make LA a better place to LIVE by promoting positive mental health outcomes, community resiliency and increased support for advocates in this work."

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "One of the key risks in research is participant drop out rate. Survivors lead dynamic lives and many times this translates into unpredictable schedules or the inability to maintain a consistent means of contact (changing addresses, phone numbers, etc.). We are meeting this challenge by recruiting over the minimum number of survivors for each retreat to take into consideration an unpredictable retention rate.\r\n\r\nAnother significant challenge we foresee is that while many partner agencies have a strong interest in the model, this does not necessarily translate into their ability to shift resources, infrastructure and their approaches to effectively implement the model. We are addressing this challenge by conducting thorough Needs Assessments and by creating implementation plans that lay out the changes required to achieve successful implementation of this model.\r\n \r\n"
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    The evaluation of the Retreat Model’s effectiveness will be led by Mary Ann
    Dutton, Ph.D., a Professor of Psychiatry at Georgetown University. Dr.
    Dutton is a well-respected clinical psychologist and researcher with over 20
    years of extensive experience in the areas of intimate partner violence and
    alternative healing practices. The evaluation will include standardized
    quantitative assessment measures that track levels of PTSD symptoms, stress
    related outcomes, and the acquisition of healing and wellness competencies:
    self-efficacy, positive self-concept, increased self-compassion, healthy
    coping skills, decreased isolation, and increased connection among program
    participants. Qualitative assessments will target patterns of isolation and
    physical health factors that directly relate to survivors' abilities to
    access support from family, friends and community. Assessments will be
    captured in data collection periods: 2 weeks prior to retreat and 2 weeks
    and 3 and 6 months post retreat. 
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    We work in partnership with sexual assault, domestic violence and child
    abuse agencies in Los Angeles. Our programs our specifically designed to
    enhance and support existing programs and models; we do not duplicate
    existing services. Our Survivor Retreat Model is the first project of its
    kind that meets the parallel needs of survivors of domestic violence, sexual
    assault and child abuse and the professionals who serve them. It offers a
    new and innovative approach to healing that is currently not available
    through traditional trauma response service providers. In surveying the
    field and in listening to the feedback from survivors themselves (Full Frame
    Initiative: How Do Survivors Define Success? 2014), we hear that traditional
    services such as emergency response, crisis counseling, support groups and
    case management, while necessary and critical, are not providing survivors
    with the level of long term relief from trauma that they are seeking. We
    also hear from crisis center advocates that the high demand for services and
    the ongoing reduction in resources leaves them depleted, with little to no
    time to step back and assess current programming and explore new
    opportunities for innovation. Our work through the Survivor Retreat Research
    Project seeks to improve the experience of domestic violence survivors and
    advocates by testing, evaluating and effectively implementing an innovative,
    survivor-centered approach to healing. The model incorporates survivor and
    advocate feedback and guidance at every level, from program design,
    implementation, participation, evaluation and dissemination. At the center
    of the model is the belief that every survivor holds the capacity to bring
    healing into their own lives. We believe this capacity expands when
    survivors are offered opportunities for healing that engage their body, mind
    and spirit. Set within the context of a healing community, this holistic
    model draws upon the individual's power to bring healing into their lives
    through their own assets and efforts and acknowledges the need for deepening
    connections to their informal support networks to provide continued support
    in their healing.

   The demand for our signature Survivor Retreat Program has long exceeded its availability and reach. In response, we embarked on an ambitious three-year research project in partnership with Georgetown University to conduct retreats within a research model, evaluate their effectiveness, and create a replicable Retreat Model, which can be adopted by partner organizations and offered to survivors, professionals who serve them, and communities beyond our current capacity and scope. With the publication of the model as an evidenced-informed holistic intervention for survivors, agencies within the field will be able to solicit new funding opportunities and expand their offering of healing opportunities to survivors.
   In Year Three of this project, up to three additional retreats will be offered to control group survivors at the conclusion of data collection. Advocates from partner agencies (Peace Over Violence, The Village Family Services and the YWCA of Greater Los Angeles) will shadow JHF staff in these retreats as part of their implementation training. JHF will then conduct a needs assessment of these partner agencies to assess for ability to effectively implement the model. A plan for implementation of the model at these agencies will be developed by JHF, who will provide ongoing technical assistance and mentorship through the implementation period.
    
   Additionally, upon the completion of the research project, we will release a complete evaluation of the retreat development process, retreat experience, and post-retreat findings. We will create a dissemination strategy that balances free distribution with needs for training and fidelity to the model. We will publish our curriculum and support its effective dissemination. We will also empower program partners, key staff and researchers, to strategically share the research findings through conferences and written materials.
