title: Free Music Studio Access for Students of Los Angeles
project_summary: >-
  ESR wishes to play a part of Boyle Heights' musical history, and by opening
  it's doors for an after school program, we will continue the flow of great
  musicianship coming out of the neighborhood. This would be a first of it's
  kind opportunity for the youth of LA to have sound-proofed studios to practice
  in at full volume, state of the art music equipment at their disposal, and a
  safe creative environment in which to practice music and let their ideas flow.

'In one sentence, please describe what your organization does': "Our fully back lined studios will be available to students as an after school program so they can learn to play on professional equipment, hone their music skills, and experience the camaraderie and confidence that this environment will foster. \r\n"

Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: "We live in the entertainment capitol, with the music industry based in Los Angeles. With gentrification happening at an alarming rate in DTLA, there are closures of music rehearsal studios and rental rooms going up in price. I decided to build a rehearsal space in Boyle Heights where there was none, and plan to open our doors for students to use the facility for free with grant money. \r\n\r\nBeing a musician has allowed me to travel the world, record records, sell music to film and TV, and has given me a purpose to share my vision and ideas. I want to be an example to the young people here in LA to show them that anything is possible with practice and discipline. And by giving them a space to do this in a neighborhood like Boyle Heights will surely foster some incredible ideas. \r\nFindings indicate that music study uniquely enhances higher brain functions required for reading, mathematics, chess, science, and engineering. If I can be a small but positive change to give back to my community, this would be it. I know from experience that having a creative outlet is so important in keeping kids off the streets and out of trouble. Most kids just need a chance, some guidance and discipline. Music can give them that and so much more. \r\n"
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Adventures in the arts and music expand who we are as human beings. It is part of our spiritual advancement in the ways we communicate - through melody, rhythms and lyrics- breaking down barriers, and allowing us to experience true happiness. \r\nResearch also shows that music can relieve stress, lower blood pressure, and help relieve pain. \r\n\r\nWe will evaluate our work through the musical advancement of the youth that utilize this program. With the youth bands that form at ESR, we would showcase a live performance at an all ages venue in Boyle Heights so they would be able to have the experience of playing live in front of an audience.\r\n\r\nMore musicians make a better environment. Art makes a better city and ultimately a better world. \r\n\r\n"
