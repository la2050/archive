title: 'Foster Families: The Other First Responders'
project_summary: >-
  LA County has the highest number of children in foster care of any county in
  America which results in a continuing need to recruit those willing to serve
  as foster parents. While there are numerous groups working on this problem
  (DCFS, FFA’s) there remains no coordinated source of information. for those
  willing to meet this need. Our proposal focuses on providing consolidated
  “just in time” on-line information to individuals and families willing to
  serve as foster parents.

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "Historically and nationally, the recruitment and retention of resource families capable of providing high-quality care have been persistent challenges for child welfare agencies Fostering or adopting children is very demanding, and so a high rate of families exit care annually. A substantial proportion of resource family attrition is due to foster families exiting the system. \r\nIn California, the need for resource families has been particularly acute for older children and children with severe emotional and behavioral concerns. Los Angeles County maintains two separate, and to some extent parallel, foster care systems. This two-track resource family recruitment system in Los Angeles County has implications and presents challenges for how and where interested individuals and families are able to obtain information about what it means to be a foster parent and where to go for additional training.\r\nRecent evidence clearly indicate that internet inquiries have increased as the number of personal referrals have decreased, suggesting online venues are not being effectively leveraged as a primary contact and resource point for prospective families.  As an example, a single website including a common cross-agency calendar of orientations, should be developed as the central medium through which the child welfare system reaches out to families and brings them into the fold. \r\nThis proposal focuses on first step to standardizing and effectively addressing responses from prospective resource families is the idea of “one-line” recruitment whereby a joint effort would be made to establish a single information source for prospective resource families.  The first step in that process is the creation of a single on-line presence for information essential to understanding what is required to become a resource family. Our purpose in applying for the Challenge 2050 funds is to create not only a centralized website (FosterConnectLA) connecting resource families but to also enhance and support the collaborative relationship between DCFS, FFA's and other relevant child and family serving agencies. The website will have several features to allow potential resource families to find out more about fostering a child and to be able to locate the nearest training or relevant organization in order to become more actively involved.\r\n"

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "One of the fundamental barriers this project will face is the efforts it will take to get everyone to the table in order to discuss the design and functionality of the website. We will have to address the natural competition between FFA's themselves and between the FFA's and DCFS. Individually, they all have their own websites that provide this type of information. One of the advantages we have as a team is our established relationship not only with DCFS but with the FFA's. Although it will take time we are confident that we can get the key players to the table and hopefully all of the players because we will need the all if we are to have a comprehensive up-to-date website.\r\nThe other challenge we will have is establishing a process that will allow all the organizations that wish to contribute information to the website to do so. In our experience this will likely fall to someone as just one more responsibility that needs to be done regularly. \r\n"
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Fundamentally, most important thing that we can evaluate is whether there is an increase in the number of resource families that become foster parents. This however may take time because making individuals and organizations aware of this new resource will not happen overnight. What we hope to see in the short run is a steady increase in the number of families accessing the information on the website. To this end we will make sure that the website tracks how many people come to the website and what content they are accessing.\r\n\r\nIn order to make this successful we will also have to keep track of several things including the number of other websites that choose to provide a link to our website on theirs and the number of organizations that we can successfully get to the planning and design meetings.\r\n"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    No one organization is focused on creating a centralized information portal.
    As previously described, there are several organizations engaged in
    recruiting resource families for the child welfare system. Primarily these
    organizations are The Department of Children and Family Services and the
    foster family agencies which are loosely organized under ACHSA (Association
    of Community Health Service Agencies). There are currently 46 FFA's working
    with DCFS. The issue we are trying to address and solve is in fact the
    sometimes competitive and occasionally complementary relationship between
    these organizations for the benefit of foster children.

  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': '$88,000'
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "FosterConnectLA\t\t\t\r\nPersonnel\t\t                       Effort\tTotal (including Benefits)\r\nProject coordinator\t12 mo\t25%\t        $25,000\r\nAdmin Asst\t                12 mo\t20%\t        $15,000\r\n\t\t\t\r\nMeeting/Convenings\t\t\t $2,500\r\n\t\t\t\r\nTravel (mileage @.55)\t\t\t   $500\r\nSupplies \t\t\t                 $5,000\r\n\t\t\t\r\nUCLA server to host site\t\t\t$0\r\n\t\t\t\r\nSubcontracts\t\t\t\r\nWebsite Design\t\t\t          $40,000\r\n\t\t\t\r\nTotal\t\t\t                          $88,000"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "Once this website is designed it will serve the entire county.  Scaling up this proposal could occur in several different mechanisms in future years including:\r\n\r\nIncrease languages to make website accessible to a wider audience (e.g., Arabic, Asian languages,etc)\r\n\r\nExtent our reach and draw in more partners for dissemination and recruitment – interfaith groups, etc\r\n\r\nModify and enhance website from having one entity (UCLA) being primarily responsible for updates to a distributed model where approved partners can update training and community event information etc\r\n\r\nCreate an accessible smartphone app\r\n\r\n\r\n"
