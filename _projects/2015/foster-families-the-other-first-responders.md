project_summary: >-
  LA County has the highest number of children in foster care of any county in
  America which results in a continuing need to recruit those willing to serve
  as foster parents. While there are numerous groups working on this problem
  (DCFS, FFA’s) there remains no coordinated source of information. for those
  willing to meet this need. Our proposal focuses on providing consolidated
  “just in time” on-line information to individuals and families willing to
  serve as foster parents.
