title: Adventure Education Aboard L.A.s Official Tall Ships
project_summary: "Since 1992, our at-sea programs have proven the effectiveness of adventure learning experiences for at-risk youth in Los Angeles, making a direct impact on educational, economic, and social outcomes for more than 60,000 young people. \r\n\r\nWith this grant, we will provide 40 at-sea programs for middle schools who cannot afford to pay and are already on our waiting list, and \"free\" community programs (Sail LA!) where Angelenos can sail with their families and become part of a real working crew."

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "Our “learning by doing” programs have been operating on the L.A. Waterfront for 23 years. Our proven ability to reach students in new and compelling ways, coupled with a vibrant educational venue (tall ships at sea), is groundbreaking. Our unique program improves students’ ability and interest in continuing their education, particularly in S.T.E.M. subjects, while opening doors of opportunity for maritime careers and vocational training. Our program combines academics, recreation, real world relevance, and fosters lifelong relationships resulting in a win for students, their parents, and ultimately our community. \r\n\r\nOur tall ships provide a challenging and nurturing environment for youth to overcome perceived physical, mental, and emotional limitations. It is very effective with adolescents who are not coping well with the demands of society and are at risk of dropping out of school. Such youths often see themselves as being incapable of living in harmony with mainstream society. \r\n\r\nAdventure education at sea enhances the growth of developing skills such as awareness, communication, and teamwork. Our programs offer real life experience in critical thinking, self-reliance, and the pure enjoyment of being on the water. \r\n\r\nRecent studies show children are spending less time outdoors and are averaging 50 hours of screen time each week. This sedentary behavior contributes to obesity and health problems such as type II diabetes. Movement not only improves our physical health, but also gives a significant boost to our learning abilities. As brain scientist John Medina explains, exercise improves cognition by increasing oxygen flow into the brain. According to Medina, an increase in oxygen is always accompanied by an uptick in mental sharpness. \r\n\r\nIn addition to overall health benefits and inspiring youth to stay in school, the TopSail Youth Program has been directly credited with improving self-esteem, creating responsible behavior, developing problem solving skills, fostering ocean literacy, and inspiring maritime careers and marine science fields of study. \r\n\r\nTraditional teaching styles tend to be less effective at reaching at-risk youth populations. Student boredom is a deterrent to learning. Research confirms that students learn most effectively from active engagement with information and ideas. Students learn better when they take the initiative to apply concepts to practice, to solve real problems, to make decisions, and to reflect on the consequences."

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    Bus transportation is the biggest challenge for getting students to our
    dock. If we can cover the cost of program sails for schools in low-income
    communities, they have a better chance of securing the bus funds. We are
    already addressing the bus transportation challenge through crowdfunding
    campaigns we set up for schools using our social media outlets. We currently
    have several campaigns running.
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    Students who participate in our program have the opportunity to join our
    volunteer Youth Crew to continue their skill building. Youth receive a Sail
    Training Logbook to track new skills and advance through three levels of
    maritime competencies. This Logbook is designed to inform, guide, and
    document their progress. This critical self-evaluation tool allows students
    to set goals, monitor their own progress, receive feedback, and achieve
    certification by the ship’s captain. This certification process is
    recognized by the United States Coast Guard and counts as necessary
    coursework and required sea time. For the public sailing events, we will ask
    participants to complete a short pre- and post- survey to measure the
    effectiveness of adventure learning for families, and track awareness of our
    local marine environment.
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "Yes, there are other organizations doing similar work but none in Los Angeles. We are the only organization in all of Southern California who provides this type of comprehensive at-sea program to middle school and high school students. \r\n\r\nWhat sets us apart is the degree of hands-on involvement that we're able to offer students. The optimum program takes the same group of students from walking onto the dock with no experience to taking charge of all aspects of boat operation during a multi-day voyage. Some of the students who sail with us have never seen the ocean! \r\n\r\nOur volunteers represent diverse backgrounds and cover a wide age range. This allows students to successfully interact with people that they might night otherwise have an opportunity to connect with or learn from. Such positive interaction will serve them later in life and teach youth how to develop meaningful relationships and lifelong bonds. \r\n\r\nOur at-sea programs and our ships impact uncounted numbers of people through the schools and diverse groups who participate in TopSail; plus our volunteer ‘family’ of supporters; and the vast public who are fascinated by tall ships’ adventure education and exploration. \r\n\r\nOur tall ships - the Irving Johnson and Exy Johnson - were built on the L.A. Waterfront between 2000 and 2002. The boats were named after sail training pioneers who sailed around the world seven times with young crews. \r\n\r\nAt their launch, they were proclaimed the Official Tall Ships and Maritime Ambassadors of the City of Los Angeles. They are USCG Sailing School Vessels and the only twin brigantines in the world. \r\n\r\nWe offer the unique educational synergy of a sailing ship -- a ‘tradition with a future’ and a value added key to the success of making LA the Best Place to Learn. \r\n"

  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    We have been operating on the L.A. Waterfront for 23 years. We have the

    placed back in the water, we will be able to expand our program by more than
    30%.
