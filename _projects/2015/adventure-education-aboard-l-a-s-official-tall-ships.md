'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Our “learning by doing” programs have been operating on the L.A. Waterfront
  for 23 years. Our proven ability to reach students in new and compelling ways,
  coupled with a vibrant educational venue (tall ships at sea), is
  groundbreaking. Our unique program improves students’ ability and interest in
  continuing their education, particularly in S.T.E.M. subjects, while opening
  doors of opportunity for maritime careers and vocational training. Our program
  combines academics, recreation, real world relevance, and fosters lifelong
  relationships resulting in a win for students, their parents, and ultimately
  our community. 
   
   Our tall ships provide a challenging and nurturing environment for youth to overcome perceived physical, mental, and emotional limitations. It is very effective with adolescents who are not coping well with the demands of society and are at risk of dropping out of school. Such youths often see themselves as being incapable of living in harmony with mainstream society. 
   
   Adventure education at sea enhances the growth of developing skills such as awareness, communication, and teamwork. Our programs offer real life experience in critical thinking, self-reliance, and the pure enjoyment of being on the water. 
   
   Recent studies show children are spending less time outdoors and are averaging 50 hours of screen time each week. This sedentary behavior contributes to obesity and health problems such as type II diabetes. Movement not only improves our physical health, but also gives a significant boost to our learning abilities. As brain scientist John Medina explains, exercise improves cognition by increasing oxygen flow into the brain. According to Medina, an increase in oxygen is always accompanied by an uptick in mental sharpness. 
   
   In addition to overall health benefits and inspiring youth to stay in school, the TopSail Youth Program has been directly credited with improving self-esteem, creating responsible behavior, developing problem solving skills, fostering ocean literacy, and inspiring maritime careers and marine science fields of study. 
   
   Traditional teaching styles tend to be less effective at reaching at-risk youth populations. Student boredom is a deterrent to learning. Research confirms that students learn most effectively from active engagement with information and ideas. Students learn better when they take the initiative to apply concepts to practice, to solve real problems, to make decisions, and to reflect on the consequences.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Bus transportation is the biggest challenge for getting students to our dock.
  If we can cover the cost of program sails for schools in low-income
  communities, they have a better chance of securing the bus funds. We are
  already addressing the bus transportation challenge through crowdfunding
  campaigns we set up for schools using our social media outlets. We currently
  have several campaigns running.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Students who participate in our program have the opportunity to join our
  volunteer Youth Crew to continue their skill building. Youth receive a Sail
  Training Logbook to track new skills and advance through three levels of
  maritime competencies. This Logbook is designed to inform, guide, and document
  their progress. This critical self-evaluation tool allows students to set
  goals, monitor their own progress, receive feedback, and achieve certification
  by the ship’s captain. This certification process is recognized by the United
  States Coast Guard and counts as necessary coursework and required sea time.
  For the public sailing events, we will ask participants to complete a short
  pre- and post- survey to measure the effectiveness of adventure learning for
  families, and track awareness of our local marine environment.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Yes, there are other organizations doing similar work but none in Los Angeles.
  We are the only organization in all of Southern California who provides this
  type of comprehensive at-sea program to middle school and high school
  students. 
   
   What sets us apart is the degree of hands-on involvement that we're able to offer students. The optimum program takes the same group of students from walking onto the dock with no experience to taking charge of all aspects of boat operation during a multi-day voyage. Some of the students who sail with us have never seen the ocean! 
   
   Our volunteers represent diverse backgrounds and cover a wide age range. This allows students to successfully interact with people that they might night otherwise have an opportunity to connect with or learn from. Such positive interaction will serve them later in life and teach youth how to develop meaningful relationships and lifelong bonds. 
   
   Our at-sea programs and our ships impact uncounted numbers of people through the schools and diverse groups who participate in TopSail; plus our volunteer ‘family’ of supporters; and the vast public who are fascinated by tall ships’ adventure education and exploration. 
   
   Our tall ships - the Irving Johnson and Exy Johnson - were built on the L.A. Waterfront between 2000 and 2002. The boats were named after sail training pioneers who sailed around the world seven times with young crews. 
   
   At their launch, they were proclaimed the Official Tall Ships and Maritime Ambassadors of the City of Los Angeles. They are USCG Sailing School Vessels and the only twin brigantines in the world. 
   
   We offer the unique educational synergy of a sailing ship -- a ‘tradition with a future’ and a value added key to the success of making LA the Best Place to Learn.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  We collaborate with LAUSD Beyond the Bell and Office of Outdoor and
  Environmental Education. We are also collaborating with CalRecycle's
  Environmental Education Initiative to bring professional development to L.A.'s
  teachers aboard our tall ships.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  We are requesting $100,000 for 40 program sails and 22 family adventure sails.
  We do not anticipate any additional costs for this proposal.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  40 program sails (1,400 students) x $1,190 per sail (Title I rate) = $47,600
   22 family adventure sails (Sail LA!) x $2,000 per sail = $44,000
   Administration and Overhead = $5,000
   Marketing and Promotion = $2,000
   Printing = $1,400
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  We have been operating on the L.A. Waterfront for 23 years. We have the
  capacity to increase the number of program sails and youth served annually.
  Once our third vessel, the Swift of Ipswich, has been fully restored and is
  placed back in the water, we will be able to expand our program by more than
  30%.

    answer: "Our “learning by doing” programs have been operating on the L.A. Waterfront for 23 years. Our proven ability to reach students in new and compelling ways, coupled with a vibrant educational venue (tall ships at sea), is groundbreaking. Our unique program improves students’ ability and interest in continuing their education, particularly in S.T.E.M. subjects, while opening doors of opportunity for maritime careers and vocational training. Our program combines academics, recreation, real world relevance, and fosters lifelong relationships resulting in a win for students, their parents, and ultimately our community. \r\n\r\nOur tall ships provide a challenging and nurturing environment for youth to overcome perceived physical, mental, and emotional limitations. It is very effective with adolescents who are not coping well with the demands of society and are at risk of dropping out of school. Such youths often see themselves as being incapable of living in harmony with mainstream society. \r\n\r\nAdventure education at sea enhances the growth of developing skills such as awareness, communication, and teamwork. Our programs offer real life experience in critical thinking, self-reliance, and the pure enjoyment of being on the water. \r\n\r\nRecent studies show children are spending less time outdoors and are averaging 50 hours of screen time each week. This sedentary behavior contributes to obesity and health problems such as type II diabetes. Movement not only improves our physical health, but also gives a significant boost to our learning abilities. As brain scientist John Medina explains, exercise improves cognition by increasing oxygen flow into the brain. According to Medina, an increase in oxygen is always accompanied by an uptick in mental sharpness. \r\n\r\nIn addition to overall health benefits and inspiring youth to stay in school, the TopSail Youth Program has been directly credited with improving self-esteem, creating responsible behavior, developing problem solving skills, fostering ocean literacy, and inspiring maritime careers and marine science fields of study. \r\n\r\nTraditional teaching styles tend to be less effective at reaching at-risk youth populations. Student boredom is a deterrent to learning. Research confirms that students learn most effectively from active engagement with information and ideas. Students learn better when they take the initiative to apply concepts to practice, to solve real problems, to make decisions, and to reflect on the consequences."

    answer: >-
      Bus transportation is the biggest challenge for getting students to our
      dock. If we can cover the cost of program sails for schools in low-income
      communities, they have a better chance of securing the bus funds. We are
      already addressing the bus transportation challenge through crowdfunding
      campaigns we set up for schools using our social media outlets. We
      currently have several campaigns running.

      Students who participate in our program have the opportunity to join our
      volunteer Youth Crew to continue their skill building. Youth receive a
      Sail Training Logbook to track new skills and advance through three levels
      of maritime competencies. This Logbook is designed to inform, guide, and
      document their progress. This critical self-evaluation tool allows
      students to set goals, monitor their own progress, receive feedback, and
      achieve certification by the ship’s captain. This certification process is
      recognized by the United States Coast Guard and counts as necessary
      coursework and required sea time. For the public sailing events, we will
      ask participants to complete a short pre- and post- survey to measure the
      effectiveness of adventure learning for families, and track awareness of
      our local marine environment.

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Yes, there are other organizations doing similar work but none in Los Angeles. We are the only organization in all of Southern California who provides this type of comprehensive at-sea program to middle school and high school students. \r\n\r\nWhat sets us apart is the degree of hands-on involvement that we're able to offer students. The optimum program takes the same group of students from walking onto the dock with no experience to taking charge of all aspects of boat operation during a multi-day voyage. Some of the students who sail with us have never seen the ocean! \r\n\r\nOur volunteers represent diverse backgrounds and cover a wide age range. This allows students to successfully interact with people that they might night otherwise have an opportunity to connect with or learn from. Such positive interaction will serve them later in life and teach youth how to develop meaningful relationships and lifelong bonds. \r\n\r\nOur at-sea programs and our ships impact uncounted numbers of people through the schools and diverse groups who participate in TopSail; plus our volunteer ‘family’ of supporters; and the vast public who are fascinated by tall ships’ adventure education and exploration. \r\n\r\nOur tall ships - the Irving Johnson and Exy Johnson - were built on the L.A. Waterfront between 2000 and 2002. The boats were named after sail training pioneers who sailed around the world seven times with young crews. \r\n\r\nAt their launch, they were proclaimed the Official Tall Ships and Maritime Ambassadors of the City of Los Angeles. They are USCG Sailing School Vessels and the only twin brigantines in the world. \r\n\r\nWe offer the unique educational synergy of a sailing ship -- a ‘tradition with a future’ and a value added key to the success of making LA the Best Place to Learn. \r\n"

      We have been operating on the L.A. Waterfront for 23 years. We have the
      capacity to increase the number of program sails and youth served
      annually. Once our third vessel, the Swift of Ipswich, has been fully
      restored and is placed back in the water, we will be able to expand our
      program by more than 30%.
