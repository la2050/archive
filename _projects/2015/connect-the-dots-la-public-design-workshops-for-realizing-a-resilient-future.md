  'DESCRIBE IN GREATER DETAIL HOW YOU WILL MAKE LA THE HEALTHIEST PLACE TO LIVE: ': "CtD design workshops engage citizens with unseen water systems beneath their feet, using full-scale stormwater and groundwater visualizations on city surfaces. Workshops prompt dialog about potential water-smart public investment, and facilitate partnerships among designers and community members. CtD documents emerging visions for a re-shaped public realm; tests and celebrates temporary demonstration projects at full-scale; and prepares and presents synthesis proposals for long-term change.\r\n\r\nCtD workshops produce recommendations for long-term change that:\r\n•\timprove safety and accessibility for pedestrians and cyclists;\r\n•\tanticipate light rail, BRT, and transit-oriented development;\r\n•\tcapture stormwater as groundwater augmentation;\r\n•\tpromote open space, natural habitat, and urban cooling zones;\r\n•\thonor the specific culture and character of the neighborhood. \r\n\r\nCtD workshops engage communities at multiple scales:\r\n•\tHazel Table, a hands-on teaching tool, delivers three learning objectives: what is an aquifer and how does it work?

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "For CtD to have widespread impact beyond the reach of Great Streets pilot projects and partnerships underway in the Northeast San Fernando Valley, CtD needs to have strong relationships in diverse neighborhoods. CtD plans to work with ALI Latrobe team + public partners to identify and prioritize neighborhoods acc to hydrologic and social equity metrics, and build relationships with community dev’t orgs and Neighborhood Councils, leveraging existing relationship with Great Streets Office.\r\n\r\nA second major barrier is of course, cost. To maximize efficiencies for temporary installations, CtD will invest in building a palette of flat, transportable elements that abstractly evoke a range of possible installations and best practices. Large-scale printed images on banners, temporary site lighting and projected imagery with digital content can be customized for each workshop location.  This kit-of-parts approach is designed to be economical, adaptable, scaleable, and replicable.\r\n"
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    Post-event, CtD coordinates analysis and synthesis of data and generates
    written and visual design and policy recommendations, for review by
    community partners and stakeholders and advocacy to decision-makers.  We
    will evaluate our work based on numbers of event participants (2016 goal: 3
    workshops @ 100 participants per workshop); numbers of design educators and
    professionals involved as volunteers (2016 goal: 3 workshops @ 20 design
    volunteers each); responsiveness to synthesis recommendations (2016 goal: 3
    workshop reports reviewed by professional design teams; presented to 3
    communities @ 15 community leaders; and submitted to public agencies). 
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "CtD’s approach is unique in its application of art and design to deliver cutting-edge science with the potential to shape demonstration projects and public policy. CtD has the support of the prize-winning Drylands Resilience Initiative team, drawn from across sectors and disciplines (ALI, Perkins+Will, Arup, and City of LA Bureau of Engineering).   CtD is a corps of first-users of the Drylands Resilience Initiative’s stormwater decision-making tool, Hazel.\r\n\r\nWhile much wonderful arts-related effort is currently concentrated around reclaiming the LA River as civic space; and much water-supply effort is currently underway by engineers, public utilities, and wholesalers, CtD integrates design thinking into the key to water-resilience:  localization of water supply as a distributed, multi-faceted design challenge, integrated into the surfaces of our buildings, streets, landscapes, and city.  CtD blurs the distinction between arts and utility, and between river and basin, and recognizes that a resilient water supply will need to be embraced by neighborhoods throughout the watershed, in inspiring and surprising ways.\r\n\r\nCtD is also unique in its leadership team: a blend of architects, landscape architects, public artists and successful non-profit managers with drylands design expertise who have hosted large-scale, transformational community events here and in other cities.\r\n"

    every section of LA County.  Evaluating results from 2015 and 2016 will help
    us understand scalability and projected costs. We will work with advisors,
    agencies, and donors  to understand limits and impacts. We anticipate
    writing CtD into larger comprehensive, sustaining grants as part of Arid
    Lands Institute’s Divining LA initiative.  A Divining LA design competition
    (2017-2018) will build on CtD relationships and visioning; community design
    teams will compete for selection to realize demonstration projects.

  CtD documents emerging visions for a re-shaped public realm; tests and

  presents synthesis proposals for long-term change.
   
   CtD workshops produce recommendations for long-term change that:
   • improve safety and accessibility for pedestrians and cyclists;
   • anticipate light rail, BRT, and transit-oriented development;
   • capture stormwater as groundwater augmentation;
   • promote open space, natural habitat, and urban cooling zones;
   • honor the specific culture and character of the neighborhood. 
   
   CtD workshops engage communities at multiple scales:
   • Hazel Table, a hands-on teaching tool, delivers three learning objectives: what is an aquifer and how does it work? How does the design of the built environment impact it? What urban design changes are possible to improve local water resources? Design educators, professionals, and students gather at the Hazel Table with families, residents, and business owners to explore the basics of urban water systems.
   • Hazel Dots are pixels of advanced hydrologic data drawn at full scale. Using high-resolution geospatial data drawn from Arid Lands Institute research, workshop leaders and volunteers lay out full-scale maps of subterranean Los Angeles. A large scale “X-Ray” of the neighborhood’s hydrology emerges. Where are a neighborhood’s underground streams? Storage reservoirs? Contamination sites? Storm drains? Where are the best places to capture stormwater and sink it into the ground? Where are the best places to divert it elsewhere?
