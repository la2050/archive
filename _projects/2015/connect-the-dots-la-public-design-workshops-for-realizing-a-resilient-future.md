project_summary: >-
  Connect the Dots uses art and design to bring complex science to the surfaces
  of our city's streets, shaping sound policy and inspired public space for a
  water-smart future. Working in neighborhoods along the river and across the
  basin, CtD uses advanced hydrologic data as public art, empowering and
  inspiring citizens to help solve our city’s transit, public space, and water.

  CtD design workshops engage citizens with unseen water systems beneath their
  feet, using full-scale stormwater and groundwater visualizations on city
  surfaces. Workshops prompt dialog about potential water-smart public
  investment, and facilitate partnerships among designers and community members.
  CtD documents emerging visions for a re-shaped public realm; tests and
  celebrates temporary demonstration projects at full-scale; and prepares and
  presents synthesis proposals for long-term change.
   
   CtD workshops produce recommendations for long-term change that:
   • improve safety and accessibility for pedestrians and cyclists;
   • anticipate light rail, BRT, and transit-oriented development;
   • capture stormwater as groundwater augmentation;
   • promote open space, natural habitat, and urban cooling zones;
   • honor the specific culture and character of the neighborhood. 
   
   CtD workshops engage communities at multiple scales:
   • Hazel Table, a hands-on teaching tool, delivers three learning objectives: what is an aquifer and how does it work? How does the design of the built environment impact it? What urban design changes are possible to improve local water resources? Design educators, professionals, and students gather at the Hazel Table with families, residents, and business owners to explore the basics of urban water systems.
   • Hazel Dots are pixels of advanced hydrologic data drawn at full scale. Using high-resolution geospatial data drawn from Arid Lands Institute research, workshop leaders and volunteers lay out full-scale maps of subterranean Los Angeles. A large scale “X-Ray” of the neighborhood’s hydrology emerges. Where are a neighborhood’s underground streams? Storage reservoirs? Contamination sites? Storm drains? Where are the best places to capture stormwater and sink it into the ground? Where are the best places to divert it elsewhere? 
   • Full-scale transformational community events, including large-scale graphics and video projections will temporarily transform and celebrate visions generated during workshops. With spaces occupied and tested by cyclists, strollers, vendors, business owners, and community members, participants will evaluate: how is this working? What would I change? 
   
   Through Connect the Dots, the people of Los Angeles’s watersheds will:
   • visualize and appreciate the aquifers beneath their streets;
   • understand the role design plays in replenishing them; and
   • participate in shaping direction for water-smart investments.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  For CtD to have widespread impact beyond the reach of Great Streets pilot
  projects and partnerships underway in the Northeast San Fernando Valley, CtD
  needs to have strong relationships in diverse neighborhoods. CtD plans to work
  with ALI Latrobe team + public partners to identify and prioritize
  neighborhoods acc to hydrologic and social equity metrics, and build
  relationships with community dev’t orgs and Neighborhood Councils, leveraging
  existing relationship with Great Streets Office.
   
   A second major barrier is of course, cost. To maximize efficiencies for temporary installations, CtD will invest in building a palette of flat, transportable elements that abstractly evoke a range of possible installations and best practices. Large-scale printed images on banners, temporary site lighting and projected imagery with digital content can be customized for each workshop location. This kit-of-parts approach is designed to be economical, adaptable, scaleable, and replicable.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Post-event, CtD coordinates analysis and synthesis of data and generates
  written and visual design and policy recommendations, for review by community
  partners and stakeholders and advocacy to decision-makers. We will evaluate
  our work based on numbers of event participants (2016 goal: 3 workshops @ 100
  participants per workshop); numbers of design educators and professionals
  involved as volunteers (2016 goal: 3 workshops @ 20 design volunteers each);
  responsiveness to synthesis recommendations (2016 goal: 3 workshop reports
  reviewed by professional design teams; presented to 3 communities @ 15
  community leaders; and submitted to public agencies).
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  CtD’s approach is unique in its application of art and design to deliver
  cutting-edge science with the potential to shape demonstration projects and
  public policy. CtD has the support of the prize-winning Drylands Resilience
  Initiative team, drawn from across sectors and disciplines (ALI, Perkins+Will,
  Arup, and City of LA Bureau of Engineering). CtD is a corps of first-users of
  the Drylands Resilience Initiative’s stormwater decision-making tool, Hazel.
   
   While much wonderful arts-related effort is currently concentrated around reclaiming the LA River as civic space; and much water-supply effort is currently underway by engineers, public utilities, and wholesalers, CtD integrates design thinking into the key to water-resilience: localization of water supply as a distributed, multi-faceted design challenge, integrated into the surfaces of our buildings, streets, landscapes, and city. CtD blurs the distinction between arts and utility, and between river and basin, and recognizes that a resilient water supply will need to be embraced by neighborhoods throughout the watershed, in inspiring and surprising ways.
   
   CtD is also unique in its leadership team: a blend of architects, landscape architects, public artists and successful non-profit managers with drylands design expertise who have hosted large-scale, transformational community events here and in other cities.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': |-
  CtD funding leverages existing partnerships in place.
   
   Research: CtD’s works closely with the Arid Lands Institute’s research team, including ALI, Perkins+Will, Arup, and City of LA Bureau of Engineering, to provide high-resolution stormwater data and to prioritize neighborhoods thirsty for public investment in quality public space. CtD also actively consults stormwater plans produced by LA County Flood Control, LA DWP, and City of LA Bureau of Sanitation. 
   
   Outreach: CtD Engagement Strategist will make every effort to coordinate outreach and public events with initiatives underway at FoLAR; Water LA/River Project; Trust for Public Land; NorthEast Trees; TreePeople; Ciclavia; Pacoima Beautiful; LACounty Bike Coalition, LAUSD, and others. 
   
   Design Expertise: CtD will invite wide participation by volunteers in the design professionals through the American Institute of Architects | LA and leverage existing alliances with design firms throughout the basin. Firms that have supported CtD development and pilot projects include Production Resources Group; Lehrer Architects; agps; Mia Lehrer + Associates; Roto Architects; Perkins+Will, Rios Clementi Hale; ACMartin; Predock Architects; John Kaliski Architects; (M)Arch Studio; and others.
   
   Policy Impacts: CtD, working with student teams from multiple university design programs, will share vision and policy recommendations with community development organizations, neighborhood councils, and city and county-wide watershed development initiatives. CtD will work to advocate for optimal hydrologic function within the Great Streets Initiative and beyond.
   
   Funding will be dedicated to expanding pilot programs already held in Pacoima (summer 2015) and Van Nuys (Feb 2016); design and fabrication of workshop kit elements; neighborhood outreach and volunteer recruitment; and the creative time of CtD principals.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  $100,000 is an appropriate budget for pilot expansion described above. To
  sustain CtD as a program beyond 2016 will require more comprehensive funding.

  understand scalability and projected costs. We will work with advisors,
  agencies, and donors to understand limits and impacts. We anticipate writing
  CtD into larger comprehensive, sustaining grants as part of Arid Lands
  Institute’s Divining LA initiative. A Divining LA design competition
  (2017-2018) will build on CtD relationships and visioning; community design
  teams will compete for selection to realize demonstration projects.
