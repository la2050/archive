  partners and stakeholders and advocacy to decision-makers.  We will evaluate
  our work based on numbers of event participants (2016 goal: 3 workshops @ 100
  participants per workshop); numbers of design educators and professionals
  involved as volunteers (2016 goal: 3 workshops @ 20 design volunteers each);
  responsiveness to synthesis recommendations (2016 goal: 3 workshop reports
  reviewed by professional design teams; presented to 3 communities @ 15
  community leaders; and submitted to public agencies).
