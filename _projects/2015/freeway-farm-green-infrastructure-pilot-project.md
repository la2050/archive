title: Freeway Farm Green Infrastructure Pilot Project
project_summary: >-
  The majority of California farms are located far removed from the predominate
  consumers - the urban dwelling general public. This project proposes to
  transform an iconic facet of life in Los Angeles by utilise the peri-freeway
  spaces. These spaces, that are normatively occupied by shrubs and ice plants,
  would be replaced with micro-climate appropriate edible fruit/vegetable crops
  & medicinal herbs.

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    One of the challenges will be to encourage collaboration between civic and
    various government agencies. We will create strategic connections with
    individuals who may serve as advocates, liaisons, and partners within each
    necessary agency. By setting up advisory meetings we can be sure that we are
    able to meet each agency's goals and regulations.
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    Freeway Farms will know that we are making a positive impact through
    recognition by community members and civic leaders & positive media reports.
    Our performance metrics are tied to growth in interest from the public and
    to the ability to successfully grow and scale the pilot project.
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    This is a botanical garden + a farm + a transportation infrastructure = a
    usable and self-sustaining place directly within the public consciousness.
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': This is currently in development.
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    We believe the 100,000 will be able to cover the ability to do a pilot
    project. Additional costs will be covered by donations or additional grants.
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Administration: 5-10%\r\nSoil & water testing: 5-10%\r\nDesign & construction of raised beds: 50-60%\r\nPlanning & landscape design: 10-30%\r\nGrowing medium & seeds: 5-10%\r\n\r\n\r\n"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    If the Green Infrastructure Pilot Project is successful then we hope to
    continue growing these patchwork peri-freeway spaces throughout Los Angeles
    county.
