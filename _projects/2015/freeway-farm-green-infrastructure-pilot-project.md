project_summary: >-
  The majority of California farms are located far removed from the predominate
  consumers - the urban dwelling general public. This project proposes to
  transform an iconic facet of life in Los Angeles by utilise the peri-freeway
  spaces. These spaces, that are normatively occupied by shrubs and ice plants,
  would be replaced with micro-climate appropriate edible fruit/vegetable crops
  & medicinal herbs.

  Freeway Farm Green Infrastructure Pilot Project presents a unique opportunity
  to transform a series of overlooked spaces in various states of neglect into a
  network of sustainable agricultural green spaces that can help Angelenos
  better connect with their environment while creating a sense of community and
  civic pride.
   
   Instead of ice plant, these areas can be used for growing fruits and vegetables for consumption by the populace, for sale to area restaurants, or as biomass. Proceeds from these sales can be used to pay for the upkeep, maintenance, and administration of the plots. A secondary use may be to incorporate medicinal gardens that highlight the indigenous plants and uses by the multitude of traditional cultures that make up the diverse population of Los Angeles.
   
   Imagine the experience of watching the organic growth process as you commute on a freeway - weaving utility and beauty, infrastructure and landscape. By adaptive reuse of the peri-freeway spaces into green infrastructure this project will weave neighbourhoods together and inspire residents by making visible the dynamic process of agriculture inside the county.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  One of the challenges will be to encourage collaboration between civic and
  various government agencies. We will create strategic connections with
  individuals who may serve as advocates, liaisons, and partners within each
  necessary agency. By setting up advisory meetings we can be sure that we are
  able to meet each agency's goals and regulations.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Freeway Farms will know that we are making a positive impact through
  recognition by community members and civic leaders & positive media reports.
  Our performance metrics are tied to growth in interest from the public and to
  the ability to successfully grow and scale the pilot project.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  This is a botanical garden + a farm + a transportation infrastructure = a
  usable and self-sustaining place directly within the public consciousness.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': This is currently in development.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  We believe the 100,000 will be able to cover the ability to do a pilot
  project. Additional costs will be covered by donations or additional grants.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  Administration: 5-10%
   Soil & water testing: 5-10%
   Design & construction of raised beds: 50-60%
   Planning & landscape design: 10-30%
   Growing medium & seeds: 5-10%
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  If the Green Infrastructure Pilot Project is successful then we hope to
  continue growing these patchwork peri-freeway spaces throughout Los Angeles
  county.
