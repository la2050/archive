  The “Cool Blocks LA” program will build planet-friendly, disaster resilient,
  socially connected neighborhoods in LA, block by block. By the end of the Cool
  Blocks LA pilot year, at least 10 neighborhood block teams across three Los
  Angeles communities will complete the program. In the process, these teams
  will reduce both their carbon and water footprints by an average of 25% while
  getting to know their neighbors and building their personal and shared
  resiliency.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  As highlighted in the City of Los Angeles’s Sustainable City pLAn, “Climate
  change is...the biggest single challenge facing humanity, as it will bring
  dramatic changes to Los Angeles in the coming years, including wide-ranging
  effects on the health and welfare of residents.”
    
   Forty percent of carbon emissions in Los Angeles come from households. The Cool Blocks LA pilot program will directly address household-level behavior change while fostering long-term health and quality of life for Angelenos. It supports both LA2050’s and the Sustainable City pLAn’s vision for sustainability and resilience for LA, and builds on the knowledge of what can be achieved based on decades of experience furthering pro-social behavior change and community engagement.
    
   A cool block is the organizing unit for this social change initiative.
    
   In collaboration with Neighborhood Councils and Cool Block program creator David Gershon, the NCSA will facilitate the selection of 10 Cool Block neighborhoods and leaders at three Cool Block Cafe events. Each participating neighborhood will be supported in the formation of a Cool Block Team of neighbors who live on a single block or in the same building. Following in-person training of Cool Block Leaders, each team will meet nine times over a five-month period, for the shared purpose of supporting their peers’ desires to live healthy and sustainable lifestyles, improve personal and collective disaster resiliency, build social bonds, and enhance the livability of their block.
    
   Participants will select the actions that support their goals from a list of 112 actions provided in a companion book. Some actions will be completed as individuals, and others are collaborative and will be carried out by the Cool Block Team. 
    
   To address any challenges that arise and support desired outcomes, the NCSA will provide ongoing coaching to each Cool Block Team.
    
   The program will culminate in a Cool Block Party to celebrate each Cool Block’s achievements.
    
   Following completion of the Cool Blocks LA pilot, the NCSA will host a debriefing session with Cool Block Leaders to capture successes and lessons learned and begin planning for a broader rollout in Year 2.
   
   One benefit of the program is the generation of social capital within Cool Blocks, leading to stronger networks and more livable and resilient communities. Also, this grassroots-level effort will heighten the demand for politicians to effect relevant public policy changes.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Behavior change (and particularly the changes we must make to effectively
  address climate change) is notoriously difficult to achieve.
   
   This model is an evidence-based approach that incorporates social and environmental psychology principles and that has been demonstrated to achieve sustained behavior change.
   
   The primary principles that are built into the model and that ensure its effectiveness include:
   social norms
   community support
   incentives
   commitment
   prompts
   convenience
   accountability
   social diffusion
   
   Mr. Gershon will provide extensive training and ongoing coaching to the program administrators and Cool Block Leaders to ensure that the principles are executed, which will also reduce attrition of program participants.
   
   Any unforeseen barriers will be addressed in future iterations of the program once the pilot is complete.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: |-
  Actions taken by participating households and blocks will be measured by
   carbon pollution avoided
   resiliency and livability
   program growth
   number of actions taken
   
   Points will also be awarded for the qualitative contributions of 
   collaboration
   sharing
   participation
   leadership
   social innovation
   mastery
   This will help each team focus on the key performance indicators necessary for their success and the program’s growth.
   
   In consultation with Mr. Gershon, the NCSA will design, implement, and analyze pre and post surveys related to the above measures.
   
   The NCSA will also measure and report on such outputs as: 
   block leader recruitment rates
   participation rate per neighborhood
   number of LA residents and partners reached through Cool Block program education and outreach efforts
   
   Finally, we will measure environmental outcomes that include carbon pollution reduction and water savings per household, using online calculator tools.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  The NCSA is the first organization in the City of Los Angeles to
  systematically bring together Neighborhood and Community Councils—hubs of
  civic engagement in LA, representing nearly 100 communities—to achieve
  collective impact on local sustainability and resilience issues. We offer a
  unique and vital platform to connect, educate, and engage community members on
  such topics, in collaboration with city agency and nonprofit partners.
   
   Our “Cool Block” pilot program will be the first of its kind, anywhere in the world. The Cool Block program builds on and integrates 30 years of experience by the Empowerment Institute and more than 300 communities around the globe which have formed neighborhood-scale “EcoTeams” to foster healthy, sustainable communities.
   
   The Cool Block approach is unique to grassroots sustainability behavior change programs in its ability to improve neighborhoods in a manner that: consistently achieves high impact results; is measurable; promotes social connections; is cost effective; and is highly scalable.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  David Gershon, co-founder and CEO of Empowerment Institute and designer of the
  Cool Block and other sustainable behavior change programs, is one of the
  world’s foremost authorities on behavior change, community empowerment and
  large-system transformation. He applies this expertise to issues requiring
  community, organizational, and societal change. 
   
   Mr. Gershon’s clients include cities, large organizations, government agencies, and social entrepreneurs. He has addressed a wide diversity of issues ranging from low carbon lifestyles, livable neighborhoods, and sustainable communities to organizational talent development, corporate social engagement, and cultural transformation. Over the past thirty years the programs he has designed have won many awards, and a major academic research study described them as “unsurpassed in changing behavior.”
   
   Mr. Gershon will provide $75,000 in in-kind support, through the provision of Cool Block guidebooks and related materials, intensive in-person capacity building training, and project team consulting services.
   
   Other project partners include: Mack Consulting, which will receive $2,000, TreePeople, and Recycle by City.
   
   Recycle by City empowers residents with the local information they need to recycle better, waste less, and keep hazardous materials out of the waste stream.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  The project costs will exceed $100,000, but additional costs are provided
  through in-kind support in the amount of $84,060, which is detailed in the
  budget.

How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  One of the strengths of the underlying Cool Block program is that its
  foundation program, EcoTeams, has been successfully implemented in over 300
  cities across the world, and has been proven to be highly scalable and
  replicable. 
   
   David Gershon will serve as a consultant on the pilot program, and work closely with the NCSA board to develop an effective architecture for scaling up the program.
   
   Our plan is to pilot the program in “early adopter” LA neighborhoods in Year 1 while growing a solid Cool Block program foundation and developing trained Cool Block leaders who can support follow-on work. We will then be poised to expand the Cool Block program exponentially in Years 2 and 3.
   
   Cool Blocks are designed to engage in a web of mutual support with surrounding blocks, and through this mechanism have been shown to not only sustain behavior change, but expand it. Cool Neighborhoods can be created out of 10 adjacent Cool Blocks. The benefits of scale include such things as solar installations that serve entire neighborhoods and community carbon offset program to invest in local renewable energy or urban forestry projects.
   
   In alignment with the Sustainable City Plan and the LA2050 Vision and Goals, our long-term goal is to engage 15% of City of LA households in the Cool Block program—a demonstrated tipping point for social change.
   
   By the end of Year 3, Los Angeles will be in an ideal position to serve as a candidate for an upcoming “Cool Cities Challenge,” a $2.5 million initiative with 20 California cities leading the way to a healthy carbon future by 2020.
