title: Cool Blocks LA
project_summary: >-
  The “Cool Blocks LA” program will build planet-friendly, disaster resilient,
  socially connected neighborhoods in LA, block by block. By the end of the Cool
  Blocks LA pilot year, at least 10 neighborhood block teams across three Los
  Angeles communities will complete the program. In the process, these teams
  will reduce both their carbon and water footprints by an average of 25% while
  getting to know their neighbors and building their personal and shared
  resiliency.
