  Our organization takes pride in teaching "our kids" the importance of living
  in a clean environment. Have you ever heard someone say "The streets raised
  me?" Well, we want to do just that. Raise our children with knowledge. Allow
  them to be proud of where they come from. We do this by showing them how
  important it is to keep up a clean environment. Children from ages 6-18 yrs
  old will help with removing graffiti, and trash from our neighborhoods, parks,
  and beaches.
