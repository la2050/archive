title: >-
  The Cyber Insecurity Initiative of the Los Angeles Health Care Security
  Systems Project
project_summary: >-
  Nearly all of LA’s hospitals use electronic health records.  We have
  identified a mismatch between perceived versus actual vulnerabilities, and
  according to cybersecurity experts, electronic systems are much more
  vulnerable than we realize, which places LA County residents at great risk. 
  Our initiative will conduct a thorough vulnerability assessment of digital
  healthcare information in LA’s hospitals to assess the differences between
  cyber threat perceptions and actual vulnerabilities.

  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    Participation of healthcare technology buyers, users, managers,
    administrators, and compliance officers will provide the questionnaire data
    analysis we need. To be most effective, we will require the buy-in and
    support of these individuals to properly assess cybersecurity concerns. The
    support of both top-level administrators and hospital/healthcare
    associations will help and we have already gained support from them for the
    initiative. Analysis will concentrate on finding the specifics of the gap
    between perceived cyber threats to the healthcare system (by healthcare
    administrators, providers, etc.) and actual threats. This measure will be
    initially assessed through questionnaires and interviews with a wide range
    of healthcare technology buyers, users, disaster managers, administrators,
    and compliance officers. The Cyber Insecurity Initiative will then analyze
    the results and provide recommendations to address the gaps between
    perceived and actual threats.
