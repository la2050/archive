project_summary: >-
  Nearly all of LA’s hospitals use electronic health records.  We have
  identified a mismatch between perceived versus actual vulnerabilities, and
  according to cybersecurity experts, electronic systems are much more
  vulnerable than we realize, which places LA County residents at great risk. 
  Our initiative will conduct a thorough vulnerability assessment of digital
  healthcare information in LA’s hospitals to assess the differences between
  cyber threat perceptions and actual vulnerabilities.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  The residents and visitors of LA County deserve and expect a safe, reliable
  healthcare system that protects their personal health information and provides
  unimpeded information to the appropriate provider in a timely manner. We are
  still at the dawn of a rapidly evolving technological age in healthcare. As
  our use of healthcare technology and cyberspace expands, so do the
  cybersecurity threats. 
   
   The Cyber Insecurity Initiative will proactively address these concerns now, guiding our use of new technology in a safe and responsible manner. By 2050, healthcare will be totally dependent on technology and cyberspace, and the decisions we make now will allow LA to take full advantage of benefits offered by reliable, digitized healthcare while proactively minimizing the risks to the private health information of every individual who uses LA County’s hospitals. 
   
   Additionally, disasters and public health emergencies (such as biological terrorism and pandemic diseases) must be considered. If used to its potential, our healthcare system can use EHRs to mitigate the effects of a disaster and speed the public health emergency response and recovery. In fact, the effective use of EHRs even has the potential to mitigate a pandemic disease early in its tracks. This can only be achieved, however, if the system is safe and secure. 
   
   Finally, the routine and safe use of EHRs will drastically improve the daily lives of all LA County residents and visitors. Healthcare can be provided faster, more effectively, more efficiently, and cheaper thanks to the benefits of digitized healthcare. The Cyber Insecurity Initiative will ensure that we do so in a way that minimizes or negates the potential risks to digitized healthcare as we approach 2050. Residents will feel safer knowing that their medical privacy is secure and the system is working well.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Some healthcare technology buyers, users, disaster managers, administrators,
  and compliance officers may be reluctant to participate. In many cases, these
  individuals are generally aware of such cybersecurity concerns (or
  perceptions), but do not want the issue examined in detail by an outsider to
  the hospital or hospital organization. They may not want attention placed on
  their institution’s weaknesses. We hope to gain buy-in and active support from
  top-level administrators and healthcare/hospital associations. Help them
  understand how it is in their organizations’ best interests to proactively
  study and address these problems. Have them require or encourage their
  subordinates to participate. Assure them that all information is confidential
  and no data will be attributed to any individual, hospital or hospital group.
  We will give them the opportunity to do either a person-to-person survey or a
  text-based survey on their cell phones (to be developed) as well as the tool
  we have ready.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Participation of healthcare technology buyers, users, managers,
  administrators, and compliance officers will provide the questionnaire data
  analysis we need. To be most effective, we will require the buy-in and support
  of these individuals to properly assess cybersecurity concerns. The support of
  both top-level administrators and hospital/healthcare associations will help
  and we have already gained support from them for the initiative. Analysis will
  concentrate on finding the specifics of the gap between perceived cyber
  threats to the healthcare system (by healthcare administrators, providers,
  etc.) and actual threats. This measure will be initially assessed through
  questionnaires and interviews with a wide range of healthcare technology
  buyers, users, disaster managers, administrators, and compliance officers. The
  Cyber Insecurity Initiative will then analyze the results and provide
  recommendations to address the gaps between perceived and actual threats.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  To our knowledge, there are no other organizations conducting healthcare
  cybersecurity perception risk analysis like this. It is highly possible that
  for-profit cybersecurity organizations and the military might be doing related
  assessments and interventions in-house, but if so, their work is private and
  proprietary or classified. While other sectors, especially in the military,
  are being addressed, no organizations are currently seeking to address this
  issue holistically across the healthcare sector. We need a framework for best
  practices, and this has to come primarily from the private sector.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Dignity Health, Providence Partners for Health, Hospital Corporation of
  America , UCLA Center for Public Health and Disasters, University of Florida
  School of Medicine, The LA Healthcare Coalition of the LA County EMS Agency
  are non-paid collaborators. 
   Red-E (a private cyber consulting firm) will receive $10,000 for their role.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  The total anticipated cost of the initiative is approximately $250,000 over
  three years. This figure includes an assumption that our data collection will
  have very robust participation from prospective respondents. COMMET will
  aggressively seek funding from other sources to fund the initiative beyond the
  first year. However, the first-year funding provided by LA2050 is essential to
  get the project started. Also, as an alternative, the data collected during
  the first year with LA2050 funding can still be extremely valuable even if it
  the number of respondents is lower than desired. In other words, the project
  would still be a success if follow-on funding were not secured. The estimate
  of $250,000 is based on our ideal end state interviewing other infrastructure
  as well as the general public. But we can still achieve a very worthwhile goal
  with one year of funding.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
  Principal Investigator – Peter Katona, MD – 10% of time, $20,000 for overall
  coordination.
   Project Manager(s) – Nadia Ho – 50% of time, $35,000 for day to day supervision.
   Surveyors (4) – to be hired - $20,000 ($5,000 each) to handle the person-to-person surveys
   Statistical and IT Consultants – $5,000
   Printing, materials and supplies, etc. – $4,000
   Survey tools - $1,000
   Red-E Consulting - $10,000 to provide the "hacker' perspective.
   COMMET overhead - $5,000
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Once we have data collected and analyzed from the five initial surveyed
  hospital groups in the pilot survey we will make appropriate changes and
  administer the survey to a larger audience form the collaborating hospital
  groups mentioned. Once completed and analyzed we will expand the survey to
  include other healthcare-related institutions such as university healthcare
  systems and large clinics; persons involved with other critical infrastructure
  such as public safety and public health, as well as in-patients and
  out-patients. The pilot survey we will work with is at

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "The residents and visitors of LA County deserve and expect a safe, reliable healthcare system that protects their personal health information and provides unimpeded information to the appropriate provider in a timely manner. We are still at the dawn of a rapidly evolving technological age in healthcare. As our use of healthcare technology and cyberspace expands, so do the cybersecurity threats. \r\n\r\nThe Cyber Insecurity Initiative will proactively address these concerns now, guiding our use of new technology in a safe and responsible manner. By 2050, healthcare will be totally dependent on technology and cyberspace, and the decisions we make now will allow LA to take full advantage of benefits offered by reliable, digitized healthcare while proactively minimizing the risks to the private health information of every individual who uses LA County’s hospitals. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, disasters and public health emergencies (such as biological terrorism and pandemic diseases) must be considered. If used to its potential, our healthcare system can use EHRs to mitigate the effects of a disaster and speed the public health emergency response and recovery. In fact, the effective use of EHRs even has the potential to mitigate a pandemic disease early in its tracks. This can only be achieved, however, if the system is safe and secure. \r\n\r\nFinally, the routine and safe use of EHRs will drastically improve the daily lives of all LA County residents and visitors. Healthcare can be provided faster, more effectively, more efficiently, and cheaper thanks to the benefits of digitized healthcare. The Cyber Insecurity Initiative will ensure that we do so in a way that minimizes or negates the potential risks to digitized healthcare as we approach 2050. Residents will feel safer knowing that their medical privacy is secure and the system is working well.\r\n"

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      Some healthcare technology buyers, users, disaster managers,
      administrators, and compliance officers may be reluctant to participate.
      In many cases, these individuals are generally aware of such cybersecurity
      concerns (or perceptions), but do not want the issue examined in detail by
      an outsider to the hospital or hospital organization. They may not want
      attention placed on their institution’s weaknesses. We hope to gain buy-in
      and active support from top-level administrators and healthcare/hospital
      associations. Help them understand how it is in their organizations’ best
      interests to proactively study and address these problems. Have them
      require or encourage their subordinates to participate.  Assure them that
      all information is confidential and no data will be attributed to any
      individual, hospital or hospital group. We will give them the opportunity
      to do either a person-to-person survey or a text-based survey on their
      cell phones (to be developed) as well as the tool we have ready.
  - name: Please explain how you will evaluate your work.
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      Participation of healthcare technology buyers, users, managers,
      administrators, and compliance officers will provide the questionnaire
      data analysis we need. To be most effective, we will require the buy-in
      and support of these individuals to properly assess cybersecurity
      concerns. The support of both top-level administrators and
      hospital/healthcare associations will help and we have already gained
      support from them for the initiative. Analysis will concentrate on finding
      the specifics of the gap between perceived cyber threats to the healthcare
      system (by healthcare administrators, providers, etc.) and actual threats.
      This measure will be initially assessed through questionnaires and
      interviews with a wide range of healthcare technology buyers, users,
      disaster managers, administrators, and compliance officers. The Cyber
      Insecurity Initiative will then analyze the results and provide
      recommendations to address the gaps between perceived and actual threats.

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      To our knowledge, there are no other organizations conducting healthcare
      cybersecurity perception risk analysis like this. It is highly possible
      that for-profit cybersecurity organizations and the military might be
      doing related assessments and interventions in-house, but if so, their
      work is private and proprietary or classified. While other sectors,
      especially in the military, are being addressed, no organizations are
      currently seeking to address this issue holistically across the healthcare
      sector. We need a framework for best practices, and this has to come
      primarily from the private sector.

      How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you
      cover the additional costs?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      The total anticipated cost of the initiative is approximately $250,000
      over three years. This figure includes an assumption that our data
      collection will have very robust participation from prospective
      respondents. COMMET will aggressively seek funding from other sources to
      fund the initiative beyond the first year. However, the first-year funding
      provided by LA2050 is essential to get the project started. Also, as an
      alternative, the data collected during the first year with LA2050 funding
      can still be extremely valuable even if it the number of respondents is
      lower than desired. In other words, the project would still be a success
      if follow-on funding were not secured. The estimate of $250,000 is based
      on our ideal end state interviewing other infrastructure as well as the
      general public. But we can still achieve a very worthwhile goal with one
      year of funding.
