title: >-
  The Cyber Insecurity Initiative of the Los Angeles Health Care Security
  Systems Project
project_summary: >-
  Nearly all of LA’s hospitals use electronic health records.  We have
  identified a mismatch between perceived versus actual vulnerabilities, and
  according to cybersecurity experts, electronic systems are much more
  vulnerable than we realize, which places LA County residents at great risk. 
  Our initiative will conduct a thorough vulnerability assessment of digital
  healthcare information in LA’s hospitals to assess the differences between
  cyber threat perceptions and actual vulnerabilities.

  How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
    - Money (financial capital)
    - Volunteers/staff (human capital)
    - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
    - Network/relationship support
  How do you plan to use these resources to make change?:
    - Conduct research
    - Engage residents and stakeholders
    - Implement a pilot or new project
    - Expand a pilot or a program
    - Mobilize for systems change
    - Advocate with policymakers and leaders
    - Implement and track policy
  Where will you be working?:
    - County of Los Angeles
  How will your proposal improve the following “Live” metrics?:
    - Healthcare access
    - Percentage of LA communities that are resilient (Dream Metric)
    - >-
      Percentage of residents receiving coordinated healthcare services (Dream
      Metric)
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    Participation of healthcare technology buyers, users, managers,
    administrators, and compliance officers will provide the questionnaire data
    analysis we need. To be most effective, we will require the buy-in and
    support of these individuals to properly assess cybersecurity concerns. The
    support of both top-level administrators and hospital/healthcare
    associations will help and we have already gained support from them for the
    initiative. Analysis will concentrate on finding the specifics of the gap
    between perceived cyber threats to the healthcare system (by healthcare
    administrators, providers, etc.) and actual threats. This measure will be
    initially assessed through questionnaires and interviews with a wide range
    of healthcare technology buyers, users, disaster managers, administrators,
    and compliance officers. The Cyber Insecurity Initiative will then analyze
    the results and provide recommendations to address the gaps between
    perceived and actual threats.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  The residents and visitors of LA County deserve and expect a safe, reliable
  healthcare system that protects their personal health information and provides
  unimpeded information to the appropriate provider in a timely manner. We are
  still at the dawn of a rapidly evolving technological age in healthcare. As
  our use of healthcare technology and cyberspace expands, so do the
  cybersecurity threats. 
   
   The Cyber Insecurity Initiative will proactively address these concerns now, guiding our use of new technology in a safe and responsible manner. By 2050, healthcare will be totally dependent on technology and cyberspace, and the decisions we make now will allow LA to take full advantage of benefits offered by reliable, digitized healthcare while proactively minimizing the risks to the private health information of every individual who uses LA County’s hospitals. 
   
   Additionally, disasters and public health emergencies (such as biological terrorism and pandemic diseases) must be considered. If used to its potential, our healthcare system can use EHRs to mitigate the effects of a disaster and speed the public health emergency response and recovery. In fact, the effective use of EHRs even has the potential to mitigate a pandemic disease early in its tracks. This can only be achieved, however, if the system is safe and secure. 
   
   Finally, the routine and safe use of EHRs will drastically improve the daily lives of all LA County residents and visitors. Healthcare can be provided faster, more effectively, more efficiently, and cheaper thanks to the benefits of digitized healthcare. The Cyber Insecurity Initiative will ensure that we do so in a way that minimizes or negates the potential risks to digitized healthcare as we approach 2050. Residents will feel safer knowing that their medical privacy is secure and the system is working well.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Some healthcare technology buyers, users, disaster managers, administrators,
  and compliance officers may be reluctant to participate. In many cases, these
  individuals are generally aware of such cybersecurity concerns (or
  perceptions), but do not want the issue examined in detail by an outsider to
  the hospital or hospital organization. They may not want attention placed on
  their institution’s weaknesses. We hope to gain buy-in and active support from
  top-level administrators and healthcare/hospital associations. Help them
  understand how it is in their organizations’ best interests to proactively
  study and address these problems. Have them require or encourage their
  subordinates to participate. Assure them that all information is confidential
  and no data will be attributed to any individual, hospital or hospital group.
  We will give them the opportunity to do either a person-to-person survey or a
  text-based survey on their cell phones (to be developed) as well as the tool
  we have ready.

Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  To our knowledge, there are no other organizations conducting healthcare
  cybersecurity perception risk analysis like this. It is highly possible that
  for-profit cybersecurity organizations and the military might be doing related
  assessments and interventions in-house, but if so, their work is private and
  proprietary or classified. While other sectors, especially in the military,
  are being addressed, no organizations are currently seeking to address this
  issue holistically across the healthcare sector. We need a framework for best
  practices, and this has to come primarily from the private sector.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Dignity Health, Providence Partners for Health, Hospital Corporation of
  America , UCLA Center for Public Health and Disasters, University of Florida
  School of Medicine, The LA Healthcare Coalition of the LA County EMS Agency
  are non-paid collaborators. 
   Red-E (a private cyber consulting firm) will receive $10,000 for their role.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Once we have data collected and analyzed from the five initial surveyed
  hospital groups in the pilot survey we will make appropriate changes and
  administer the survey to a larger audience form the collaborating hospital
  groups mentioned. Once completed and analyzed we will expand the survey to
  include other healthcare-related institutions such as university healthcare
  systems and large clinics; persons involved with other critical infrastructure
  such as public safety and public health, as well as in-patients and
  out-patients. The pilot survey we will work with is at
