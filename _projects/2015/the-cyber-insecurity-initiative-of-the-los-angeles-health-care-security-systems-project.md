  The Cyber Insecurity Initiative of the Los Angeles Health Care Security
  Systems Project
project_summary: >-
  Nearly all of LA’s hospitals use electronic health records.  We have
  identified a mismatch between perceived versus actual vulnerabilities, and
  according to cybersecurity experts, electronic systems are much more
  vulnerable than we realize, which places LA County residents at great risk. 
  Our initiative will conduct a thorough vulnerability assessment of digital
  healthcare information in LA’s hospitals to assess the differences between
  cyber threat perceptions and actual vulnerabilities.

  'DESCRIBE IN GREATER DETAIL HOW YOU WILL MAKE LA THE HEALTHIEST PLACE TO LIVE: ': "The residents and visitors of LA County deserve and expect a safe, reliable healthcare system that protects their personal health information and provides unimpeded information to the appropriate provider in a timely manner. We are still at the dawn of a rapidly evolving technological age in healthcare. As our use of healthcare technology and cyberspace expands, so do the cybersecurity threats. \r\n\r\nThe Cyber Insecurity Initiative will proactively address these concerns now, guiding our use of new technology in a safe and responsible manner. By 2050, healthcare will be totally dependent on technology and cyberspace, and the decisions we make now will allow LA to take full advantage of benefits offered by reliable, digitized healthcare while proactively minimizing the risks to the private health information of every individual who uses LA County’s hospitals. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, disasters and public health emergencies (such as biological terrorism and pandemic diseases) must be considered. If used to its potential, our healthcare system can use EHRs to mitigate the effects of a disaster and speed the public health emergency response and recovery. In fact, the effective use of EHRs even has the potential to mitigate a pandemic disease early in its tracks. This can only be achieved, however, if the system is safe and secure. \r\n\r\nFinally, the routine and safe use of EHRs will drastically improve the daily lives of all LA County residents and visitors. Healthcare can be provided faster, more effectively, more efficiently, and cheaper thanks to the benefits of digitized healthcare. The Cyber Insecurity Initiative will ensure that we do so in a way that minimizes or negates the potential risks to digitized healthcare as we approach 2050. Residents will feel safer knowing that their medical privacy is secure and the system is working well.\r\n"

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    Some healthcare technology buyers, users, disaster managers, administrators,
    and compliance officers may be reluctant to participate. In many cases,
    these individuals are generally aware of such cybersecurity concerns (or
    perceptions), but do not want the issue examined in detail by an outsider to
    the hospital or hospital organization. They may not want attention placed on
    their institution’s weaknesses. We hope to gain buy-in and active support
    from top-level administrators and healthcare/hospital associations. Help
    them understand how it is in their organizations’ best interests to
    proactively study and address these problems. Have them require or encourage
    their subordinates to participate.  Assure them that all information is
    confidential and no data will be attributed to any individual, hospital or
    hospital group. We will give them the opportunity to do either a
    person-to-person survey or a text-based survey on their cell phones (to be
    developed) as well as the tool we have ready.
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    Participation of healthcare technology buyers, users, managers,
    administrators, and compliance officers will provide the questionnaire data
    analysis we need. To be most effective, we will require the buy-in and
    support of these individuals to properly assess cybersecurity concerns. The
    support of both top-level administrators and hospital/healthcare
    associations will help and we have already gained support from them for the
    initiative. Analysis will concentrate on finding the specifics of the gap
    between perceived cyber threats to the healthcare system (by healthcare
    administrators, providers, etc.) and actual threats. This measure will be
    initially assessed through questionnaires and interviews with a wide range
    of healthcare technology buyers, users, disaster managers, administrators,
    and compliance officers. The Cyber Insecurity Initiative will then analyze
    the results and provide recommendations to address the gaps between
    perceived and actual threats. 
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    To our knowledge, there are no other organizations conducting healthcare
    cybersecurity perception risk analysis like this. It is highly possible that
    for-profit cybersecurity organizations and the military might be doing
    related assessments and interventions in-house, but if so, their work is
    private and proprietary or classified. While other sectors, especially in
    the military, are being addressed, no organizations are currently seeking to
    address this issue holistically across the healthcare sector. We need a
    framework for best practices, and this has to come primarily from the
    private sector.
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "Dignity Health, Providence Partners for Health, Hospital Corporation of America , UCLA Center for Public Health and Disasters, University of Florida School of Medicine, The LA Healthcare Coalition of the LA County EMS Agency are non-paid collaborators. \r\nRed-E (a private cyber consulting firm) will receive $10,000 for their role. \r\n"
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    The total anticipated cost of the initiative is approximately $250,000 over
    three years. This figure includes an assumption that our data collection
    will have very robust participation from prospective respondents. COMMET
    will aggressively seek funding from other sources to fund the initiative
    beyond the first year. However, the first-year funding provided by LA2050 is
    essential to get the project started. Also, as an alternative, the data
    collected during the first year with LA2050 funding can still be extremely
    valuable even if it the number of respondents is lower than desired. In
    other words, the project would still be a success if follow-on funding were
    not secured. The estimate of $250,000 is based on our ideal end state
    interviewing other infrastructure as well as the general public. But we can
    still achieve a very worthwhile goal with one year of funding.
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Principal Investigator – Peter Katona, MD – 10% of time, $20,000 for overall coordination.\r\nProject Manager(s) – Nadia Ho – 50% of time, $35,000 for day to day supervision.\r\nSurveyors (4) – to be hired - $20,000 ($5,000 each) to handle the person-to-person surveys\r\nStatistical and IT Consultants  –  $5,000\r\nPrinting, materials and supplies, etc. – $4,000\r\nSurvey tools - $1,000\r\nRed-E Consulting - $10,000 to provide the \"hacker' perspective.\r\nCOMMET overhead - $5,000\r\n"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    Once we have data collected and analyzed from the five initial surveyed
    hospital groups in the pilot survey we will make appropriate changes and
    administer the survey to a larger audience form the collaborating hospital
    groups mentioned.  Once completed and analyzed we will expand the survey to
    include other healthcare-related institutions such as university healthcare
    systems and large clinics; persons involved with other critical
    infrastructure such as public safety and public health, as well as
    in-patients and out-patients.  The pilot survey we will work with is at
    https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/healthcybersecurity.
