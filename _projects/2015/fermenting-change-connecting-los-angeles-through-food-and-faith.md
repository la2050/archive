title: 'Fermenting Change: Connecting Los Angeles through food and faith'
project_summary: >-
  The Fermenting Change Event Series will bring together people from diverse
  communities over our shared values of nourishing food and land stewardship.
  Our program will engage Jewish and Muslim school communities and grow to
  become a replicable model for interfaith celebration across the region. By
  building connections around food, justice, and traditional ties to the earth,
  we build relationships across religious and cultural barriers to create an
  interconnected and resilient Los Angeles.

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "One of the obstacles to civic engagement and a unified community is cultural divides: we are a diverse city where people of different backgrounds live side by side, yet in isolation. At Netiya, we believe there is unity in diversity and that beneath our differences lie commonalities. As an interfaith organization, we bring together different groups under a shared agenda: food and stewardship of the land--topics that are common to all faiths and cultures. \r\n\r\nWe propose an event series--Fermenting Change--with the goal of creating cross-cultural understanding and engagement around the critical issues of food justice and land stewardship. To enhance the impact of our events, we will also host eight workshops and/or volunteer events throughout the year. \r\n\r\nTo pilot Fermenting Change, we will create  a Jewish-Muslim partnership, bringing together communities in a celebration of common food traditions, ties to agrarian roots, and commitments to social action. We’ll implement the pilot with Sinai Akiba Academy (a Jewish school) and New Horizon School (a Muslim school), both members of Netiya’s interfaith network that will be implementing Netiya’s Just Food & Gardens program at the end of 2015 and beginning of 2016 respectively. As part of those programs, both schools are creating edible gardens on their properties, and hosting educational workshops on topics ranging from gardening and pest management to water-wise technology, traditional cooking preservation, and food justice. More details on our Just Food & Gardens program can be found here: http://www.netiya.org/programs/\r\n\r\nNext, we will use lessons learned from the pilot to go beyond a Jewish-Muslim partnership to draw in communities of all faiths. We will host a second event using our 42-member network of faith institutions to create a truly universal and interfaith gathering. The event will be both educational--providing classes and workshops--and inspirational, giving participants the tools and connections to participate in volunteer opportunities, advocate for relevant policy changes, and become ambassadors for food justice in their own communities. \r\n\r\nWe see the Fermenting Change series both as a community connection in itself, and also as a means to inspire action and interaction outside of the events. Our events will galvanize participants around social change and food issues, resulting in more city-wide participation in volunteer and cultural events both within and outside of the congregation community."

  One of the obstacles to civic engagement and a unified community is cultural
  divides: we are a diverse city where people of different backgrounds live side
  by side, yet in isolation. At Netiya, we believe there is unity in diversity
  and that beneath our differences lie commonalities. As an interfaith
  organization, we bring together different groups under a shared agenda: food
  and stewardship of the land--topics that are common to all faiths and
  cultures. 
   
   We propose an event series--Fermenting Change--with the goal of creating cross-cultural understanding and engagement around the critical issues of food justice and land stewardship. To enhance the impact of our events, we will also host eight workshops and/or volunteer events throughout the year. 
   
   To pilot Fermenting Change, we will create a Jewish-Muslim partnership, bringing together communities in a celebration of common food traditions, ties to agrarian roots, and commitments to social action. We’ll implement the pilot with Sinai Akiba Academy (a Jewish school) and New Horizon School (a Muslim school), both members of Netiya’s interfaith network that will be implementing Netiya’s Just Food & Gardens program at the end of 2015 and beginning of 2016 respectively.

   Next, we will use lessons learned from the pilot to go beyond a Jewish-Muslim partnership to draw in communities of all faiths.

The event will be both educational--providing classes and workshops--and inspirational, giving participants the tools and connections to participate in volunteer opportunities, advocate for relevant policy changes, and become ambassadors for food justice in their own communities. 
   
   We see the Fermenting Change series both as a community connection in itself, and also as a means to inspire action and interaction outside of the events. Our events will galvanize participants around social change and food issues, resulting in more city-wide participation in volunteer and cultural events both within and outside of the congregation community.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  With any event and volunteer program, the challenge is always in ensuring
  awareness of the events and actual participation. That’s why faith
  institutions are so critical to our mission and purpose. Our faith
  institutions are strong and have dedicated memberships that are eager to
  participate in congregational activities. Our congregations have all the force
  of numbers that we need: where Netiya steps in is in bringing these
  congregations together. Netiya has an existing network of 42 faith
  institutions which is continually expanding. These are faith institutions that
  are not only interested in social justice but also interfaith collaboration.
  We will overcome the obstacle of event participation by drawing on our strong
  partnerships with congregations. Our partners bring the willing and interested
  community members, and we bring the opportunity and programming in which to
  participate.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We will evaluate our impact on civic and social engagement, with the goal that
  our programs will enhance people’s participation both within their own
  communities (geographic, cultural, or religious) and their interaction and
  cooperation with other communities.
   
   Specifically we will look at:
   --overall participation in two major festival events of 2016, one focused on communities of Sinai Akiba Academy and New Horizon School together and one for the general public
   --participation by Fermenting Change attendees at Netiya workshops and volunteer events, as measured by attendance records
   --participation by Fermenting Change attendees at other volunteer and cultural events, as measured through participant surveys
   --attitudes and interest around social action and inter-faith collaboration, as measured by surveys with participants, newsletter readership
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Netiya’s focus on collaboration is what sets us apart from many other
  programs. There are groups that work in the Christian, Muslim, or Jewish world
  but few that are working not only across the geography of the one of the
  largest counties in the country but also very intentionally across ethnic and
  faith lines. We seek to move from conflict, distrust, and former
  "battleground" to breaking new ground, working side by side and ultimately to
  breaking bread together on "common ground" while strengthening the surrounding
  community. Netiya is not a faith institution itself; rather, we show our
  faith-based partners how to use their traditions to connect to community, to
  cultivate and provide fresh food, to steward their land for environmental
  conservation, and to promote our common values of justice for those in
  need.Their facilities and landscapes are grounds for modeling positive
  stewardship and learning to become both more giving and more self-reliant
  communities.
   
   Founded in 2011, Netiya has grown a collaborative network of 42 faith-based institutions across the Greater Los Angeles Area. We have installed 13 Just Gardens, and organized over 160 community-wide educational programs in the past four years on topics ranging from food procurement to food relief; from GMOs to integrated pest control and composting in your congregation's garden; and from fermenting change in a food desert to fermenting food from the garden. We have forged a Board; an Executive Council of seven community leaders from our network institutions that meet weekly; and a network of liaisons from our member institutions that meets twice a year. For the past four years Netiya has partnered with over 60 congregations and organizations all over Los Angeles County to create customized programming for their campers, students, staff, and/or congregants.
   
   We’ve seen how our work can not only grow gardens but also grow leaders and community. Past events include our Local Food Procurement trainings which have resulted in 17 institutions sourcing their food locally. Our 2012 GMO teach-in successfully combined the social and spiritual, utilizing a partner synagogue as host for an event that taught the public critical knowledge about their food. Our Shared Earth Project--a collaboration between a Unitarian Universalist Church and two Jewish Synagogues--has proven that the process of building a garden and sharing a love of food can bring different cultures and faiths together.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': |-
  Our partners will include:
   --New Horizon School
   New Horizon School seeks to develop in each student a positive identity as an American Muslim who is prepared intellectually, socially, emotionally, spiritually, and physically to succeed in a diverse and ever-changing world. New Horizon will host garden volunteer workdays, educational workshops, and will host Fermenting Change events. All events will be open to the public. 
   --Sinai Akiba Academy
   Sinai Akiba Academy is committed to Jewish heritage and traditions. They welcome Jewish students of all backgrounds and affiliations to observe life cycle events, for prayer, rituals, learning, music, and community. Sinai Akiba will host garden volunteer workdays, educational workshops, and will host Fermenting Change events. All events will be open to the public. 
   --Slow Food LA
   The Slow Food Los Angeles Chapter supports local efforts in the worldwide movement to reconnect people with their food and all that it takes to produce it. Slow Food LA members will assist with event programming and outreach for Fermenting Change. 
   --University of California Cooperative Extension (UCCE)
   UCCE operates the Master Gardeners Program (and until earlier this year, the Master Food Preserver program), with the purpose of training people in gardening and food preservation so that their their skills can be imparted to the community. As part of their certification, Master Gardeners and Food Preservers must donate their time to train and teach their skills. Fermenting Change will work with members of these two programs to put on its workshops and event activities. 
   --Proyecto Jardin
   Proyecto Jardin is a community garden in Boyle Heights that is focused on the principles of sustainability to mobilize collective action for food justice. Proyecto Jardin will be a partner on the second Fermenting Change Festival, assisting with outreach, organizing programming, and possibly hosting the main event.
   --Netiya institution network
   42 religious institutions are members of Netiya’s network. Member institutions are located all over the county and include congregations, schools, and service organizations from a variety of religious affiliations. Members of the network will assist with outreach for Fermenting Change. 
   
   Our partners will not be sub-granted a designated portion of the grant, but grant funds will pay for services that Netiya normally charges fees for and will cover costs of program activities that take place at their sites.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  According to the American Community Survey in 2007 (the most recent data
  available), there are more than 6,000 faith-based congregations in Los Angeles
  County, representing a membership of 2.3 million people (close to a quarter of
  the population). This touches every demographic sector – racial and economic –
  and represents a hugely powerful force in community. We estimate that
  virtually every Angeleno lives within walking distance of a religious
  institution--imagine if each of those institutions was a resource to host
  educational opportunities around food, sustainability, and our most pressing
  social issues for ALL in the neighborhood, of ANY faith? What if even a small
  portion of those institutions had an edible garden that grew food for the
  community and inspired others to do the same? The impact would be enormous,
  and this is the vision that Netiya wants to realize.
   
   The Fermenting Change agenda that we plan to implement in 2016 will be the beginning of a replicable and sustainable program to engage citizens of our diverse community. From the success and lessons of 2016, we can not only host more Fermenting Change events, but inspire and train more and more participants to do meaningful volunteer work and engage in social action. We believe that with Fermenting Change we can lay the groundwork for activism that connects people across religious boundaries, cultural barriers, social class, and geography.
