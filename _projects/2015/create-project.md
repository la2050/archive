  The CREATE Project is helping math teachers design lessons that are both
  intuitive and engaging for their students. Using a new app developed at CSUN,
  students can learn math through interactive activities that guide them toward
  their own discoveries of the math concepts. Teaching with this new app will
  help teachers focus on getting through to their kids, rather than just get
  through a textbook.

  At CSUN, the CREATE Project is helping teachers help their students learn math
  in a whole new way that is both intuitive and engaging. Using a new app
  developed by CSUN, teachers can make learning more interactive and dynamic by
  strategically guiding students toward making their own discoveries of various
  math concepts. The app, unlike static pages in a textbook, will allow students
  to explore and see connections between different ways to represent math ideas.
  If they want to explore how much money they can earn or how many songs they
  can download, they can see it visually at their fingertips. Using the app,
  teachers can work in teams to plan the next day’s lesson, focusing on student
  learning and not just getting through a textbook.
   
   The app will also be a transformative tool for teachers. It will help them design and implement lesson activities that focus on exploring the relationships between various representations of math concepts and real-world applications. Teachers will be able to work collaboratively to ensure students understand by creating lessons that meet the learning needs of all their students.
   
   The app design is based on lesson activities developed from previously funded work, which has led to significantly higher student scores on state test scores in mathematics. These students were from low-income, primarily Hispanic communities in Los Angeles. With the app as an additional resource, the Project Director expects students will post even higher standardized test scores in math.
   
   The Project Director is Dr. Ivan Cheng, a faculty member in the CSUN Michael D. Eisner College of Education. Over the past 5 years, he was awarded grants from both the State of California Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Education to support teachers in making math accessible for all students.
   
   Dr. Cheng’s goal is to make sure every student gets quality instruction in math and that every teacher is supported in providing quality instruction for their students. Funding is needed to provide training to help more teachers get through to their students.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  One key challenge for the implementation of this project is recruiting enough
  teachers to make a difference. Our strategy is to work closely with all levels
  of leadership within Los Angeles Unified School District. We have already
  secured unanimous approval from the Board of Education and from the directors
  of mathematics instruction in LAUSD. We have already met with some local
  superintendents and directors in LAUSD, as well as all of the secondary math
  coordinators in the district. What we need now is to get the word out to all
  the teachers in Los Angeles so that they can take advantage of this exciting
  opportunity to make math accessible to all their students.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Dr. Cheng will work with the CSUN Center for Assessment, Research and
  Evaluation (CARE) to evaluate the impact of the CREATE Project on student
  achievement. Dr. Cheng will answer the following evaluation questions: 
   1. What is the impact of the app on student learning?
   2. To what extent do teachers engage in use of the app in their practice during the year?
   3. What barriers to implementation are identified and what are the lessons learned?
   This evaluation will guide improvement in the design of the app and in the training provided for the teachers. It will also provide important data to improve math education across the nation.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  The design of our app is distinctly different from all the online tutorial
  programs that simply focus on mastering procedures without developing an
  understanding of mathematical connections. Instead, our app provides a tool
  for teachers to help them create learning activities that make math make sense
  for students. Our approach is unique in that it provides teachers the power
  and flexibility to address the diverse learning needs of their students
  quickly and frequently in ways that no textbook can. In short, it allows
  teachers to adjust instruction to fit the needs of their students.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Our project partner is the Los Angeles Unifies School District. LAUSD teachers
  will receive $38,000 in stipends.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': 'The total cost of the project is $100,000.'
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
  LA2050 funds will be used to offset the cost of training for 60–100 teachers
  in LAUSD. Specifically funds will cover the cost of conference training
  facilities/food and refreshments ($49,000) and stipends for participants
  ($38,000). The remainder ($13,000) is the mandatory service fee of 26% that
  CSUN applies to all off-campus, externally funded projects. This service fee
  covers the cost of administration, payroll, and facilities.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  As one of the largest teacher preparation universities in California, CSUN is
  well positioned to build upon its success at increasing pupil achievement in
  California public schools by further developing and bringing this intervention
  to scale. One key way that CREATE can impact teaching and pupil student
  achievement at scale is through the preparation of additional high-quality
  teachers in mathematics. In doing so, CREATE will be able to inform the work
  of the Mathematics Teacher Education Partnership (MTEP), sponsored by the
  Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities (APLU), which serves 69
  universities and 87 school districts across 30 states, as well as all 23
  universities in the California State University system. Furthermore, the app
  itself can help sustain changes in practice as more and more teachers embrace
  the guided discovery a new approach for teaching mathematics reaching their
  students. And with the increasing number of classrooms already equipped with
  tablets, the cost of providing the app would be minimal for schools in
  comparison with the cost of textbooks and other print resources.

    answer: "At CSUN, the CREATE Project is helping teachers help their students learn math in a whole new way that is both intuitive and engaging. Using a new app developed by CSUN, teachers can make learning more interactive and dynamic by strategically guiding students toward making their own discoveries of various math concepts. The app, unlike static pages in a textbook, will allow students to explore and see connections between different ways to represent math ideas. If they want to explore how much money they can earn or how many songs they can download, they can see it visually at their fingertips. Using the app, teachers can work in teams to plan the next day’s lesson, focusing on student learning and not just getting through a textbook.\r\n\r\nThe app will also be a transformative tool for teachers. It will help them design and implement lesson activities that focus on exploring the relationships between various representations of math concepts and real-world applications. Teachers will be able to work collaboratively to ensure students understand by creating lessons that meet the learning needs of all their students.\r\n\r\nThe app design is based on lesson activities developed from previously funded work, which has led to significantly higher student scores on state test scores in mathematics. These students were from low-income, primarily Hispanic communities in Los Angeles. With the app as an additional resource, the Project Director expects students will post even higher standardized test scores in math.\r\n\r\nThe Project Director is Dr. Ivan Cheng, a faculty member in the CSUN Michael D. Eisner College of Education. Over the past 5 years, he was awarded grants from both the State of California Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Education to support teachers in making math accessible for all students.\r\n\r\nDr. Cheng’s goal is to make sure every student gets quality instruction in math and that every teacher is supported in providing quality instruction for their students. Funding is needed to provide training to help more teachers get through to their students.\r\n\r\n"

    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      One key challenge for the implementation of this project is recruiting
      enough teachers to make a difference. Our strategy is to work closely with
      all levels of leadership within Los Angeles Unified School District. We
      have already secured unanimous approval from the Board of Education and
      from the directors of mathematics instruction in LAUSD. We have already
      met with some local superintendents and directors in LAUSD, as well as all
      of the secondary math coordinators in the district. What we need now is to
      get the word out to all the teachers in Los Angeles so that they can take
      advantage of this exciting opportunity to make math accessible to all
      their students.

    answer: "Dr. Cheng will work with the CSUN Center for Assessment, Research and Evaluation (CARE) to evaluate the impact of the CREATE Project on student achievement. Dr. Cheng will answer the following evaluation questions: \r\n1. What is the impact of the app on student learning?\r\n2. To what extent do teachers engage in use of the app in their practice during the year?\r\n3. What barriers to implementation are identified and what are the lessons learned?\r\nThis evaluation will guide improvement in the design of the app and in the training provided for the teachers. It will also provide important data to improve math education across the nation.\r\n"

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      The design of our app is distinctly different from all the online tutorial
      programs that simply focus on mastering procedures without developing an
      understanding of mathematical connections. Instead, our app provides a
      tool for teachers to help them create learning activities that make math
      make sense for students. Our approach is unique in that it provides
      teachers the power and flexibility to address the diverse learning needs
      of their students quickly and frequently in ways that no textbook can. In
      short, it allows teachers to adjust instruction to fit the needs of their
      students.

      LA2050 funds will be used to offset the cost of training for 60–100
      teachers in LAUSD. Specifically funds will cover the cost of conference
      training facilities/food and refreshments ($49,000) and stipends for
      participants ($38,000). The remainder ($13,000) is the mandatory service
      fee of 26% that CSUN applies to all off-campus, externally funded
      projects. This service fee covers the cost of administration, payroll, and
      facilities.

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      As one of the largest teacher preparation universities in California, CSUN
      is well positioned to build upon its success at increasing pupil
      achievement in California public schools by further developing and
      bringing this intervention to scale. One key way that CREATE can impact
      teaching and pupil student achievement at scale is through the preparation
      of additional high-quality teachers in mathematics. In doing so, CREATE
      will be able to inform the work of the Mathematics Teacher Education
      Partnership (MTEP), sponsored by the Association of Public and Land-Grant
      Universities (APLU), which serves 69 universities and 87 school districts
      across 30 states, as well as all 23 universities in the California State
      University system. Furthermore, the app itself can help sustain changes in
      practice as more and more teachers embrace the guided discovery a new
      approach for teaching mathematics reaching their students. And with the
      increasing number of classrooms already equipped with tablets, the cost of
      providing the app would be minimal for schools in comparison with the cost
      of textbooks and other print resources.
