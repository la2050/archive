  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "Casa libre intends to make Los Angeles not only a better, but THE BEST place to learn by providing a safe, and empowering environment along with dedicated mentors to propel our inner city youth to succeed, more specifically, in Westlake. California has historically drawn some of the largest numbers of immigrants of any state in the nation and most recently (and particularly since “The Surge” at the border last summer) the highest number of school aged immigrant and refugee children. Unfortunately, as we all witnessed on the news and in the media, their reception has not been the kindest in many places. Sadly because of the stigmas and the stereotypes associated with this population, they are often dismissed as if somehow these children are less worthy of an eduction and come somehow predisposed to be cheap manual labor. There are many institutional reasons why we know this to be true, but as with anything at Casa Libre, we choose to address what is in our control, which we have found to be the value, or in this case, lack of value, placed on education over employment in many of our immigrant communities. We want to put an end to the vicious cycle that this disregard for education creates, not only for individuals, but for the entire City of Los Angeles. When education is undervalued, students underperform. When students underperform, schools lose funding. And when schools lose funding, our communities suffer at every level, whether it be socially, economically, environmentally, health related or otherwise. Our study hall we will provide a safe space and access to technology for kids that sometimes live in one bedroom apartments with up to six people. Here they will be able to feel their educational endeavors validated and have their confidence boosted so that higher education becomes a tangible possibility where it may have been only a dream or worse still, a source of shame.  For new students, we will provide an environment of full immersion, sensitive to all the cultural and linguistic nuances associated with these students, but which will empower them learn a new language with ease. \r\nOur proposal for something as seemingly basic as a study hall may not seem like much of a solution for a problem as systemic and engrained as the one we intend to take on (and do so with our current students everyday), but the simplest solution is usually the right one, no?"

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    The main barrier we sees is overcoming is the stigma associated with study
    halls and the lack of value paced on education in many of our immigrant
    communities. In an effort to combat this, we will also be conducting family
    nights to inform and educate the parents and relatives.  We will also build
    of oof pus existing partnerships with LAUSD, USC and UCLA. 
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    Our work will be evaluated on a monthly basis based on number of
    participants, participation retention, GPA, presentations, hours logged,
    community involvement (volunteres) and Social Media results. 
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    As far as we know, there are other organizations that provide safe places
    for students to do homework. Hoewever, what is unique about our approach is
    that we intend to provide this safe, serene and empowering environment and
    network of mentors, but that we are also going to tackle the undervaluation
    of education in our communities, particularly our immigrant communities in
    Westlake to help put an end to many social ills that stem from this lack of
    education. 
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    For the past 5 years we have been diligently working around the clock in our
    community to empower our High school students to succeed . We have developed
    partnerships with many organizations, but we would intend to take advantage

    (Architecture & Business), UCLA (Chicano Studies), and Cal Tech most
    closely. 
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-

    $100,000!
