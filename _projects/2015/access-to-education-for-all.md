project_summary: >-
  Casa Libre is located in Westlake, Los Angeles, one of the densest immigrant
  communities and in the nation and also one of it's most underserved. Most
  families in our community struggle to get by and education is many times
  sacrificed for subsistence. We aim to provide the highs school students in our
  community a serene after school environment  where they will be empowered to
  pursue their educational goals. 
Please specify below: 'Casa Libre, Westlake, L.A County'
category: 00playlive
'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Casa libre intends to make Los Angeles not only a better, but THE BEST place
  to learn by providing a safe, and empowering environment along with dedicated
  mentors to propel our inner city youth to succeed, more specifically, in
  Westlake. California has historically drawn some of the largest numbers of
  immigrants of any state in the nation and most recently (and particularly
  since “The Surge” at the border last summer) the highest number of school aged
  immigrant and refugee children. Unfortunately, as we all witnessed on the news
  and in the media, their reception has not been the kindest in many places.
  Sadly because of the stigmas and the stereotypes associated with this
  population, they are often dismissed as if somehow these children are less
  worthy of an eduction and come somehow predisposed to be cheap manual labor.
  There are many institutional reasons why we know this to be true, but as with
  anything at Casa Libre, we choose to address what is in our control, which we
  have found to be the value, or in this case, lack of value, placed on
  education over employment in many of our immigrant communities. We want to put
  an end to the vicious cycle that this disregard for education creates, not
  only for individuals, but for the entire City of Los Angeles. When education
  is undervalued, students underperform. When students underperform, schools
  lose funding. And when schools lose funding, our communities suffer at every
  level, whether it be socially, economically, environmentally, health related
  or otherwise. Our study hall we will provide a safe space and access to
  technology for kids that sometimes live in one bedroom apartments with up to
  six people. Here they will be able to feel their educational endeavors
  validated and have their confidence boosted so that higher education becomes a
  tangible possibility where it may have been only a dream or worse still, a
  source of shame. For new students, we will provide an environment of full
  immersion, sensitive to all the cultural and linguistic nuances associated
  with these students, but which will empower them learn a new language with
  ease. 
   Our proposal for something as seemingly basic as a study hall may not seem like much of a solution for a problem as systemic and engrained as the one we intend to take on (and do so with our current students everyday), but the simplest solution is usually the right one, no?
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  The main barrier we sees is overcoming is the stigma associated with study
  halls and the lack of value paced on education in many of our immigrant
  communities. In an effort to combat this, we will also be conducting family
  nights to inform and educate the parents and relatives. We will also build of
  oof pus existing partnerships with LAUSD, USC and UCLA.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Our work will be evaluated on a monthly basis based on number of participants,
  participation retention, GPA, presentations, hours logged, community
  involvement (volunteres) and Social Media results.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  As far as we know, there are other organizations that provide safe places for
  students to do homework. Hoewever, what is unique about our approach is that
  we intend to provide this safe, serene and empowering environment and network
  of mentors, but that we are also going to tackle the undervaluation of
  education in our communities, particularly our immigrant communities in
  Westlake to help put an end to many social ills that stem from this lack of
  education.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  For the past 5 years we have been diligently working around the clock in our
  community to empower our High school students to succeed . We have developed
  partnerships with many organizations, but we would intend to take advantage of
  the ones developed with LAUSD, Los Angeles Conservancy, USC (Architecture &
  Business), UCLA (Chicano Studies), and Cal Tech most closely.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': 'The beauty of our initiative is that it will actually cost less than $100,000!'
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-

    answer: "Casa libre intends to make Los Angeles not only a better, but THE BEST place to learn by providing a safe, and empowering environment along with dedicated mentors to propel our inner city youth to succeed, more specifically, in Westlake. California has historically drawn some of the largest numbers of immigrants of any state in the nation and most recently (and particularly since “The Surge” at the border last summer) the highest number of school aged immigrant and refugee children. Unfortunately, as we all witnessed on the news and in the media, their reception has not been the kindest in many places. Sadly because of the stigmas and the stereotypes associated with this population, they are often dismissed as if somehow these children are less worthy of an eduction and come somehow predisposed to be cheap manual labor. There are many institutional reasons why we know this to be true, but as with anything at Casa Libre, we choose to address what is in our control, which we have found to be the value, or in this case, lack of value, placed on education over employment in many of our immigrant communities. We want to put an end to the vicious cycle that this disregard for education creates, not only for individuals, but for the entire City of Los Angeles. When education is undervalued, students underperform. When students underperform, schools lose funding. And when schools lose funding, our communities suffer at every level, whether it be socially, economically, environmentally, health related or otherwise. Our study hall we will provide a safe space and access to technology for kids that sometimes live in one bedroom apartments with up to six people. Here they will be able to feel their educational endeavors validated and have their confidence boosted so that higher education becomes a tangible possibility where it may have been only a dream or worse still, a source of shame.  For new students, we will provide an environment of full immersion, sensitive to all the cultural and linguistic nuances associated with these students, but which will empower them learn a new language with ease. \r\nOur proposal for something as seemingly basic as a study hall may not seem like much of a solution for a problem as systemic and engrained as the one we intend to take on (and do so with our current students everyday), but the simplest solution is usually the right one, no?"

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      The main barrier we sees is overcoming is the stigma associated with study
      halls and the lack of value paced on education in many of our immigrant
      communities. In an effort to combat this, we will also be conducting
      family nights to inform and educate the parents and relatives.  We will
      also build of oof pus existing partnerships with LAUSD, USC and UCLA.

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      As far as we know, there are other organizations that provide safe places
      for students to do homework. Hoewever, what is unique about our approach
      is that we intend to provide this safe, serene and empowering environment
      and network of mentors, but that we are also going to tackle the
      undervaluation of education in our communities, particularly our immigrant
      communities in Westlake to help put an end to many social ills that stem
      from this lack of education.
