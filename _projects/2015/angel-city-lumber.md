  Everybody loves trees while they’re standing, but In Los Angeles a felled tree
  immediately becomes “green waste,” garbage to be chipped or buried in city
  landfills.  But the natural urban forest of our city overflows with usable
  trees which can be re-purposed into highly sought after lumber.  Angel City
  Lumber offers a vision of Los Angeles in which trees felled in the city are
  given a second life in the hands of the artists, crafts people and builders of
  Los Angeles.
Please specify below: >-
  Based in Boyle Heights, Angel City Lumber will re-use trees found anywhere in
  Los Angeles.

  Wood plays a vital role in Los Angeles’ creative landscape. From the elevated
  design of Disney Concert Hall’s Oak floors to the handmade Walnut mustache
  combs of Offerman Wood Shop - Los Angeles artists love to use quality
  hardwood. Fine furniture makers design and produce elegant tables, chairs and
  credenzas. Artists find beauty in the knots and burls of misshapen trees. And
  Interior designers plan for natural wood floors, decks and ceilings for their
  clients. Undeniably, wood plays an enormous role in the consciousness of Los
  Angeles creative minds.
   
   However, most hardwood lumber offered for sale in Los Angeles comes from elsewhere. Builders looking for White Oak have it trucked in from Maine. A furniture maker hired to build a Walnut credenza ends up with wood from Alabama. And most Douglas Fir flooring found in Los Angeles originated in British Columbia. This is the fundamental problem Angel City Lumber will combat. In a city where hundreds of gorgeous, usable hardwood trees are felled every month - only the smallest percentage are re-used.
   
   As soon as trees are felled in Los Angeles they are considered “green waste.” The city usually chops downed trees into two foot lengths and buries them in landfills - or at best, mulches them. We do this to more than 95% of our urban trees. 
   
   Angel City Lumber takes the fallen trees of our community and mills them into building materials, specifically dimensional lumber, wood slabs, and millworks. We use a state-of-the-art portable Lucas Mill 8-30 for cutting and we dry the wood in our Nyle L200M wood kiln for between 6-8 weeks. Finally, we offer these urban lumber products back to builders, furniture makers, artists, contractors, homeowners, architects and designers in the Los Angeles community. 
   
   We have a strong, uncomplicated vision for Los Angeles. We want to stop burying trees and instead use them to increase the supply of high quality raw materials available to city artists, while at the same time lowering prices. The resources of Los Angeles should be utilized by those living and working in Los Angeles. But beyond that, we take pride in being a small local business created to minimize waste while at the same time bolstering the creative opportunities within Los Angeles.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  For our city to embrace the re-purposing of downed trees there must be a
  network of people on the lookout
   
   The promise of urban lumber is a powerful one. Our main strategy for introducing ourselves lies in contacting as many decision makers as possible. We are reaching out to as many arborists, tree surgeons, park managers and tree services as possible. People who work with trees are frustrated at the lack of options for them and are eager for a solution
   
   The images of what we do are powerful. Downed trees buried versus being made into a beautiful bookshelf, for example. We will have a strong social media presence seeking to spread the word of re-using Los Angeles’ urban trees.
   
   We have begun to establish partnerships. On the conservation side Tree People has been one of our early connections. Conversely, Offerman Wood Shop, and Nick Offerman himself, are equally excited. As a shop supporting independent wood workers, the promise of affordable, local wood is music to their ears
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Angel City Lumber’s mission is to re-use the readily available resource of Los
  Angeles’ urban forest and, in so doing, provide the city with high quality,
  low priced hardwood lumber. By far the best way to evaluate our success lies
  in tracking our market share. By evaluating our sales against those of other
  Los Angeles lumber companies, that do not source their lumber locally, we can
  effectively track what impact we are having on delivering a valuable resource
  to the local artistic community. 
   
   We have no delusions of grandeur - we are starting small in the hopes of instigating a larger change over time. Big lumber companies and home centers’ are in no danger of suddenly seeing their sales dry up. However, by steadily increasing our market share, we hope to present a positive example of how re-using sustainable local resources can not only positively affect our bottom line, but will also aid the creative population we serve.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There are a number of companies throughout the United States practicing urban
  lumber, though Angel City Lumber is the first to set up shop in Los Angeles.
   
   Urban Lumber Company
   Eugene, OR  www.urbanlumber.co
   NY Heartwoods
   Hudson Valley, NY  www.newyorkheartwoods.com
   Wood From the Hood
   Minneapolis, MN   www.woodfromthehood.com
   Urban Hardwoods
   Seattle, WA   www.urbanhardwoods.com/
   
   Angel City Lumber has studied the success stories of these companies and intends to both mimc and improve their processes. We don’t feel the need to be particularly different from these companies, they’ve provided an excellent example of what sustainability looks like in the world of hardwood lumber.
   That being said - there are a few points which differentiate Angel City Lumber. With the exception of NY Heartwoods, the above companies primary income comes from selling premium-priced furniture constructed from urban lumber – not selling the lumber itself. Angel City Lumber will focus on selling competitively priced urban lumber to the public. 
   
   Another excellent point in our favor, Los Angeles houses a vast number of tree species. Due to our favorable climate, typical urban tree species in Los Angeles hail from all six of the inhabitable continents. We will have a more diverse inventory than any of the above companies simply by our geography.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Angel City Lumber is a partnership between Jeff Perry and Charles DeRosa.
  Together we formed a business to turn Los Angeles’ downed trees into
  affordable, high quality lumber. Our intention is to invest the full $100,000
  of the grant into growing the capacity of Angel City to mill, dry and sell
  lumber, sourced from Los Angeles, affordably. 
   
   We do not have any other partners who will receive the grant money.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  Our goal of bringing urban lumber to Los Angeles is highly scaleable. So far
  we have started small, spending $50,000 of our own money to buy a kiln for
  drying, a mill for cutting and paying monthly rent on 5000 square feet of
  commercial real estate to house the business. 
   
   Urban lumber will not catch on immediately - and creating a stock of useable lumber will take time. Drying three thousand board feet of even a single species will take four to six weeks.$100,000 ensures that Angel City Lumber will be given the time necessary to succeed and will also allow us to enlarge our operation more quickly. The grant money will buy an additional kiln for drying more wood and doubling our capacity, a forklift for moving trees which often weigh in excess of 5000 lbs., and help pay the rent over coming months while we create a stock of wood that covers the artistic communities’ needs.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  A second Kiln to double our production $10,000
   A year of rent  $40,000
   A fork lift  $8,000
   Outreach (Business Cards,Brochures $15,000
   Website)
   Hire a part time employee  $25,000
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  We did not start Angel City Lumber simply to sell wood. We were seduced by the
  opportunity to salvage the trees of Los Angeles, otherwise doomed to be buried
  or chipped, and put them in the hands of artists. By using local trees and
  doing the work here in Los Angeles we also saw a way to lower prices -
  allowing artists and builders to pass on savings to their clients.
   
   Our long term plan involves scaling up production - there are thousands of usable trees coming down in Los Angeles annually, we want to salvage as many as possible. This future will require more infrastructure - vehicles with greater hauling capacity, the hiring of employees and expanding locations. 
   
   The beauty of urban lumber is the simplicity of it’s message, re-use local resources that are otherwise being wasted. It is also a sound business plan, as we’ve seen with the success of urban lumber companies elsewhere. Angel City Lumber hopes to expand it’s operation - while at the same time expanding the awareness of Angelenos of the value of our local resources.

    answer: "Wood plays a vital role in Los Angeles’ creative landscape.  From the elevated design of Disney Concert Hall’s Oak floors to the handmade Walnut mustache combs of Offerman Wood Shop - Los Angeles artists love to use quality hardwood.  Fine furniture makers design and produce elegant tables, chairs and credenzas.  Artists find beauty in the knots and burls of misshapen trees.  And Interior designers plan for natural wood floors, decks and ceilings for their clients.  Undeniably, wood plays an enormous role in the consciousness of Los Angeles creative minds.\r\n\r\nHowever, most hardwood lumber offered for sale in Los Angeles comes from elsewhere.  Builders looking for White Oak have it trucked in from Maine.  A furniture maker hired to build a Walnut credenza ends up with wood from Alabama.  And most Douglas Fir flooring found in Los Angeles originated in British Columbia.  This is the fundamental problem Angel City Lumber will combat.  In a city where hundreds of gorgeous, usable hardwood trees are felled every month - only the smallest percentage are re-used.\r\n\r\nAs soon as trees are felled in Los Angeles they are considered “green waste.”  The city usually chops downed trees into two foot lengths and buries them in landfills - or at best, mulches them.  We do this to more than 95% of our urban trees. \r\n\r\nAngel City Lumber takes the fallen trees of our community and mills them into building materials, specifically dimensional lumber, wood slabs, and millworks. We use a state-of-the-art portable Lucas Mill 8-30 for cutting and we dry the wood in our Nyle L200M wood kiln for between 6-8 weeks. Finally, we offer these urban lumber products back to builders, furniture makers, artists, contractors, homeowners, architects and designers in the Los Angeles community. \r\n\r\nWe have a strong, uncomplicated vision for Los Angeles.  We want to stop burying trees and instead use them to increase the supply of high quality raw materials available to city artists, while at the same time lowering prices.  The resources of Los Angeles should be utilized by those living and working in Los Angeles.  But beyond that, we take pride in being a small local business created to minimize waste while at the same time bolstering the creative opportunities within Los Angeles. "

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "For our city to embrace the re-purposing of downed trees there must be a network of people on the lookout\r\n\r\nThe promise of urban lumber is a powerful one. Our main strategy for introducing ourselves lies in contacting as many decision makers as possible. We are reaching out to as many arborists, tree surgeons, park managers and tree services as possible. People who work with trees are frustrated at the lack of options for them and are eager for a solution\r\n\r\nThe images of what we do are powerful. Downed trees buried versus being made into a beautiful bookshelf, for example. We will have a strong social media presence seeking to spread the word of re-using Los Angeles’ urban trees.\r\n\r\nWe have begun to establish partnerships. On the conservation side Tree People has been one of our early connections.  Conversely, Offerman Wood Shop, and Nick Offerman himself, are equally excited.  As a shop supporting independent wood workers, the promise of affordable, local wood is music to their ears"
  - name: Please explain how you will evaluate your work.
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Angel City Lumber’s mission is to re-use the readily available resource of Los Angeles’ urban forest and, in so doing, provide the city with high quality, low priced hardwood lumber.  By far the best way to evaluate our success lies in tracking our market share.  By evaluating our sales against those of other Los Angeles lumber companies, that do not source their lumber locally, we can effectively track what impact we are having on delivering a valuable resource to the local artistic community. \r\n\r\nWe have no delusions of grandeur - we are starting small in the hopes of instigating a larger change over time.  Big lumber companies and home centers’ are in no danger of suddenly seeing their sales dry up.  However, by steadily increasing our market share, we hope to present a positive example of how re-using sustainable local resources can not only positively affect our bottom line, but will also aid the creative population we serve."

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "There are a number of companies throughout the United States practicing urban lumber, though Angel City Lumber is the first to set up shop in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nUrban Lumber Company\r\n\t\tEugene, OR \t\t        www.urbanlumber.co\r\nNY Heartwoods\r\n\t\tHudson Valley, NY  \twww.newyorkheartwoods.com\r\nWood From the Hood\r\n\t\tMinneapolis, MN   \t        www.woodfromthehood.com\r\nUrban Hardwoods\r\n\t\tSeattle, WA   \t\t        www.urbanhardwoods.com/\r\n\r\nAngel City Lumber has studied the success stories of these companies and intends to both mimc and improve their processes.  We don’t feel the need to be particularly different from these companies, they’ve provided an excellent example of what sustainability looks like in the world of hardwood lumber.\r\nThat being said - there are a few points which differentiate Angel City Lumber.  With the exception of NY Heartwoods, the above companies primary income comes from selling premium-priced furniture constructed from urban lumber – not selling the lumber itself.  Angel City Lumber will focus on selling competitively priced urban lumber to the public. \r\n\r\n\tAnother excellent point in our favor, Los Angeles houses a vast number of tree species.  Due to our favorable climate, typical urban tree species in Los Angeles hail from all six of the inhabitable continents.  We will have a more diverse inventory than any of the above companies  simply by our geography. "

      this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner
      receive?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Angel City Lumber is a partnership between Jeff Perry and Charles DeRosa.  Together we formed a business to turn Los Angeles’ downed trees into affordable, high quality lumber.  Our intention is to invest the full $100,000 of the grant into growing the capacity of Angel City to mill, dry and sell lumber, sourced from Los Angeles, affordably.  \r\n\r\nWe do not have any other partners who will receive the grant money."
  - name: >-
      How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you
      cover the additional costs?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Our goal of bringing urban lumber to Los Angeles is highly scaleable.  So far we have started small, spending $50,000 of our own money to buy a kiln for drying, a mill for cutting and paying monthly rent on 5000 square feet of commercial real estate to house the business.  \r\n\r\nUrban lumber will not catch on immediately - and creating a stock of useable lumber will take time.  Drying three thousand board feet of even a single species will take four to six weeks.$100,000 ensures that Angel City Lumber will be given the time necessary to succeed and will also allow us to enlarge our operation more quickly.  The grant money will buy an additional kiln for drying more wood and doubling our capacity, a forklift for moving trees which often weigh in excess of 5000 lbs., and help pay the rent over coming months while we create a stock of wood that covers the artistic communities’ needs."

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "We did not start Angel City Lumber simply to sell wood.  We were seduced by the opportunity to salvage the trees of Los Angeles, otherwise doomed to be buried or chipped, and put them in the hands of artists.  By using local trees and doing the work here in Los Angeles we also saw a way to lower prices - allowing artists and builders to pass on savings to their clients.\r\n\r\nOur long term plan involves scaling up production - there are thousands of usable trees coming down in Los Angeles annually, we want to salvage as many as possible.  This future will require more infrastructure -  vehicles with greater hauling capacity, the hiring of employees and expanding locations. \r\n\r\nThe beauty of urban lumber is the simplicity of it’s message, re-use local resources that are otherwise being wasted.  It is also a sound business plan, as we’ve seen with the success of urban lumber companies elsewhere.  Angel City Lumber hopes to expand it’s operation - while at the same time expanding the awareness of Angelenos of the value of our local resources. "
