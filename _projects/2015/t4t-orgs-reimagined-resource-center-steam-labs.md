title: T4T.org’s ReImagined Resource Center STEAM Labs
project_summary: >-
  We want to build STEAM Labs in 20 Title 1 Schools in Los Angeles. LAUSD has
  among the highest concentration of low-income students in the state, with more
  than 80% living at or below the poverty line. This translates into nearly 400
  high-poverty campuses where all students automatically qualify for subsidized
  lunches.  There is little room in the school budget for a Makers Space. We
  want to teach these students to invent out of ReImagined Resources or found
  objects.

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "We will offer students with no access to a Makers’ Space our exciting ReImagined Resource Center (RRC) STEAM Labs.  STEAM education and hands-on learning is the key to developing the next generation of Scientists and Researchers. RRCs offer a venue in which the students can invent and to share their creations. We will inspire creative and critical thinking through creating head-sets, model homes, robots, simple engines and more out of clean, colorful items captured from manufacturers waste streams. Using this material rather than allowing it to head to landfill will also advance the notion of environmental stewardship in a generation of Los Angeles children. \r\nOffering these students a dedicated room filled with inspiring materials and tools with which to create allows all students regardless of economic realities and opportunity to engage in the design process where they are able to test ideas, fail, rethink and redesign in same way that all successful scientists and engineers operate.\r\n"

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    Our greatest challenge with this project is deciding which schools to offer
    these ReImagined Resource Center STEAM Labs. We have built 9 RRC STEAM Labs
    in Title 1 schools to date.  We have done this through an application
    program. We require the school have dedicated space, an enthusiastic
    Principal and a lead Teacher to take on the responsibility of the RRC STEAM
    Lab. We require a 90% or higher free and reduced lunch program on the
    campus. We offer professional development and teach tool safety,
    project-based-learning best practices, and supply the school with ongoing
    support. We would like to see all 400 high-poverty campuses have a STEAM Lab
    and will continue to raise money to work toward that long-range goal.  Our
    greatest challenge is that there are far more schools in need than budget to
    install the RRC STEAM Labs.
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    The teachers and students who work in the RRC STEAM Labs will evaluate the
    process and our final outcome through feedback forms. This will be done
    through pre-then-post surveys completed by the teachers and students. We
    will measure attitudes toward learning prior to engaging in the RRC STEAM
    Labs and again at the end of the first year of access. 
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "There are several organizations building STEAM Labs in schools. The costs range from $15,000 to $500,000 with the high end being in private schools with the budget to add all of the available and late model technology. Our RRC STEAM Labs cost $5000 which includes the building of the RRC STEAM Lab, the material to fill it and the professional development needed for the teachers to engage effectively as mentors to the next generation of inventors who will access the Lab.\r\n\r\nOur approach is unique in that we use cast-off materials that are created in the manufacturing process. Our RRC STEAM Labs are filled with clean, colorful materials that require creative and critical thinking on behalf of the young inventor. There is no prescriptive process. A student must find something that could be made into a headset, for example, from the materials supplied. We offer reverse engineering with old motors and speakers to help inform the process. Our approach considers the design process from inception to completion to be an exercise in problem solving. In the entire process, we are inspiring environmental stewardship. We can create affordable programs that we believe are better than most at creating opportunities for students to think their way out of design problems.\r\n"
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    Our partners in these RRC STEAM Labs are the manufacturers who supply the
    materials. We have been gathering this material from manufacturers for more
    than a decade. Our suppliers ask only for tax receipts for their donations
    and pictures of the finished projects. Many of the organizations hang those
    pictures in their offices and factories. There is a sense of pride from the
    organizations that take part in this process. We have also begun to have
    conversations about offering internships to students who work with the
    material where appropriate.
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    We at T4T.org have become experts at working within our budgets. We know how
    to bring talent to the table with materials to accomplish what others might
    see as impossible. This challenge excites us and brings the best we have to
    offer in staff and volunteers to this project. We expect to make this happen
    in 20 schools with the $100,000 awarded. These RRC STEAM Labs will all be
    installed in a year with the assistance of T4T.org staff, volunteers,
    educators, and material from the manufacturing community of Los Angeles.
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "RRC budget-\r\nMaterials and storage                                                          $1000\r\nFacilitated day with students to design and build              1200\r\nTools and workbench                                                            1200\r\n   (T4T.org custom connectors and tubing.

  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "We have been building these RRC STEAM Labs for the last two years. The first year we built two, last year we built nine, five of those through a grant from Metabolic Studios as a result of our 2014 application to LA2050. \r\n\r\nIt is our intention to continue to look for grants and to continue to offer these inspiring programs in as many of the 400+ high-poverty schools as possible. We have dozen’s of request and they continue to arrive through our web site, phone calls and email. The demand is there. \r\n\r\nOur long range goal would be to see RRC STEAM Labs in schools all over the country. Where there is manufacturing, there should be a T4T.org outlet building RRC STEAM Labs.\r\n"

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Our T4T.org traveling Makers Space will be filled with ReImagined Resources!
  The items we carry are being discarded by local manufacturers and would be
  headed for Landfill if we didn’t exist. Having a traveling Makers Space allows
  us to bring Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Math (STEAM) Education
  to communities were this has only been a dream. We will have pop-up Makers
  Space in Parks and School-yards around Los Angeles focusing our efforts in
  neighborhoods with Title 1 Schools with more than 90% free and reduces lunch
  programs. We wont necessarily be doing this on the school yard exclusively it
  will simply be the way we identify the communities on our calendar. We will
  have Saturday and Sunday pop-up Makers Spaces in some of the most unlikely
  spots around town!
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Our obstacle will be obtaining permits and we have already begun a
  relationship with the Public Works Department of LA City. We will reach out to
  them to make sure we are in compliance with the City before we set out. We
  also will need at least two staff at each pop-up event and will need to bring
  on extra staff. We will also be looking for volunteer groups to help with
  these events so there will be plenty of helping hands at each open Makers
  experience around town.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We will conduct pre-then-post surveys with everyone who participates. Parents,
  young inventors, anyone who takes place will be asked to answer a few basic
  questions when they arrive about their level of interest in STEAM activities
  and then they will answer the same questions as they complete their invention.
  These findings will be compared to similar surveys we do in schools that have
  T4T.org inspired project based learning and the combined data will be
  available to schools, press and the educational community at large through
  open access data banks and research servers.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  We have not been able to find anyone doing this in Los Angeles. Our unique
  approach is based on the fact that we use material that would have been headed
  to Landfill! In doing this we inspire environmental stewardship in our next
  generation of inventors and scientists.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  We would be doing this with our current list of manufacturers who supply us
  with material. None of the budget will go to that. The $100,000, should we be
  lucky enough to be awarded the grant, would go toward the vehicle, staff and
  outreach to communities. The material we use will be donated from
  manufacturers who receive a tax receipt as our thank you for their donations.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  At T4T.org we are use to working within a budget. We will buy the truck and
  hire the staff we need to get started. We will rely on volunteers and
  manufacturers donations to make up the difference. We don’t go over budget
  because we don’t have anywhere to draw the money from if we did go over
  budget. We have learned to work within our means.

  measured we will approach a car company to support more vehicles as well as
  approach foundations to help us staff future vehicles. We will also write a
  guidebook for any other community that is interested in starting a T4T.org
  style traveling Makers Space using ReImagined Resources from their community.
