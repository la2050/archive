title: T4T.org’s ReImagined Resource Center STEAM Labs
project_summary: >-
  We want to build STEAM Labs in 20 Title 1 Schools in Los Angeles. LAUSD has
  among the highest concentration of low-income students in the state, with more
  than 80% living at or below the poverty line. This translates into nearly 400
  high-poverty campuses where all students automatically qualify for subsidized
  lunches.  There is little room in the school budget for a Makers Space. We
  want to teach these students to invent out of ReImagined Resources or found
  objects.

Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "We will offer students with no access to a Makers’ Space our exciting ReImagined Resource Center (RRC) STEAM Labs.  STEAM education and hands-on learning is the key to developing the next generation of Scientists and Researchers. RRCs offer a venue in which the students can invent and to share their creations. We will inspire creative and critical thinking through creating head-sets, model homes, robots, simple engines and more out of clean, colorful items captured from manufacturers waste streams. Using this material rather than allowing it to head to landfill will also advance the notion of environmental stewardship in a generation of Los Angeles children. \r\nOffering these students a dedicated room filled with inspiring materials and tools with which to create allows all students regardless of economic realities and opportunity to engage in the design process where they are able to test ideas, fail, rethink and redesign in same way that all successful scientists and engineers operate.\r\n"
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  The teachers and students who work in the RRC STEAM Labs will evaluate the
  process and our final outcome through feedback forms. This will be done
  through pre-then-post surveys completed by the teachers and students. We will
  measure attitudes toward learning prior to engaging in the RRC STEAM Labs and
  again at the end of the first year of access. 
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
  - Money (financial capital)
  - Volunteers/staff (human capital)
  - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
  - 'Infrastructure (building/space/vehicles, etc.)'
  - Education/training
  - 'Technical infrastructure (computers, etc.)'
  - Community outreach
