  $100,000 will supply two LAUSD high schools with state-of-the-art fitness
  centers, the SBSM curriculum and professional development training for the
  school’s physical education department.  Following an eight-week
  implementation of the SBSM Curriculum, we expect to improve student passing
  rates by a minimum 25% on the Fitnessgram assessment (California State
  proficiency test for student physical fitness) as well as improve student’s
  perception of fitness and exercise at these high schools.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  According to the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, 42 percent of
  our children are obese or overweight. The problem is particularly acute in
  low-income and minority communities where there is a lack of safe outdoor play
  space and an abundance of fast food restaurants.
   
   Unfortunately, with average Physical Education budgets of only $500, LAUSD schools are rarely able to compensate for the recreational and fitness resources their neighborhoods lack. In fact, according to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the most frequently cited barriers to physical activity opportunities for students are resources, time, and staff capacity. There are 350 middle and high schools in LAUSD, of which SBSM currently serves 95. This leaves over 200 schools in our local district alone without effective physical fitness resources.
   
   SBSM confronts this problem with an innovative approach, providing low-income schools in need of fitness resources with a comprehensive physical education package to promote the lifelong values of exercise and active living. A grant from L.A. 2050 will help supply two LAUSD high schools with state-of-the-art fitness centers, the SBSM Curriculum, and professional development training for the school’s physical education department.
   
   Each new fitness center includes a selection of commercial-grade cardiovascular equipment (ellipticals, hybrid cycles, spin bikes and arm cycles), strength training equipment (weights and strength machines), and mobile equipment such as jump ropes and agility ladders. 
   
   In addition, each new school receives the Sound Body Sound Mind Curriculum and professional development training. The Sound Body Sound Mind Curriculum is an evidence-based instructional program combining circuit training, the fundamentals of movement, and methodologies for motivating students. The Curriculum provides 36 age-appropriate lessons that are structured yet flexible, and also discusses the research and theories that inform them.
   
   Once trained, teachers can empower their students to develop competence and confidence in a variety of fitness activities. Furthermore, students can incorporate these lessons outside of school, thus enabling them to maintain fit and healthy lifestyles into adulthood.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  When going in to LAUSD middle and high schools, one of the biggest obstacles
  that SBSM faces is a lack of dedication from school faculty to the new fitness
  center and a lack of focus on improving physical education at the school. In
  order to have a successful program implementation, we need the entire staff on
  board with the initiative to make sure that these fitness centers will be used
  to their full potential. Not only the P.E. department, but the principle,
  assistant principles, as well as all other teachers at the school need to
  embrace the program and aid in it's effectiveness for years to come. To ensure
  that this happens, we make each school go through an application and interview
  process. The process increases buy-in from the potential grantees, allows us
  to make sure that the school has the proper backing from the administration,
  and shows us whether the school is in need of the fitness center both
  demographically and fiscally.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Following installation of the fitness centers and completion of the teacher
  trainings, each school implements the SBSM curriculum for an eight-week period
  in their classes for a minimum of 100 students. Before and after the
  eight-week program, we require each physical education staff to collect
  student Fitnessgram data for the 100 students. The Fitnessgram is a
  state-mandated test that measure fitness levels in students, and for our
  purposes, evaluates the overall impact of SBSM programming and curriculum on
  student health. Along with the Fitnessgram we require the physical education
  staff to collect survey data measuring student attitudes toward exercise, body
  image, and fitness knowledge. After collection of the two sets of data, we
  conduct comparative analysis of the pre and post fitness center and curriculum
  implementation.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There are organizations doing similar work in childhood obesity prevention
  such as the Youth Policy Institute (YPI) and UCLA Fit For Healthy Weight. We
  have great relationships with both of these nonprofit organizations, and they
  have both done amazing things for the Los Angeles community. We constantly
  look to collaborate with both organizations to best serve the students of
  LAUSD, and each organization has a unique approach on how they go about aiding
  in the improvement of children's health. One of the biggest values of SBSM's
  model is sustainability. Because we are giving schools an entire
  state-of-the-art fitness center and corresponding curriculum, we are giving
  them a fixed-cost investment that will last for years with minimal extra cost.
  Students whose outlets for fitness are sometimes non-existent in low-income
  areas are able to use the fitness center as much as they want and adapt
  physical fitness into their daily lives for long into the future. In order to
  ensure upkeep of our centers, our vendors provide 5-year warranties for all
  fitness equipment, and after the 5-year period, schools are eligible to apply
  for $5,000 worth of maintenance. Although both YPI and UCLA Health are both
  fantastic organizations, most of their initiatives involve manpower, onsite
  professional help, or research that does not necessarily go entirely to
  students. Our transparent model allows us to see direct results from our
  students, and the effects last for years after our first contact with the
  schools without much extra cost out of pocket.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  SBSM will collaborate with UCLA Health, LAUSD, and a UCLA student-led
  volunteer corps. UCLA Health will provide medical expertise along with
  advanced research practices in order to refine the program, LAUSD will provide
  logistical support during the fitness center implementation process, and the
  UCLA student-led volunteer corps will ensure the curriculum instruction and
  data collection are effectively delivered for the hybrid program. All $100,000
  of grant awards will go to the Sound Body Sound Mind Foundation, and we will
  designate that grant money toward equipment costs and building the two fitness
  centers at the LAUSD high schools.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  The $100,000 will cover the entirety of the project. We have implemented 95
  fitness centers within LAUSD over the last 15 years, and have maximized our
  cost-effectiveness in getting the program and fitness centers installed as
  efficiently as possible.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  Budget for SBSM Fitness Centers (Per School)
   
   Commercial-Grade Fitness Equipment (Strength and Cardio Exercise Machines) - $45,800.00
   
   Mobile Fitness Accessories (Jump ropes, Agility Ladders, Sandbells, Balls, etc.) - $3,500
   
   Signage (Fitness Center Sign and Banner) - $400.00
   
   SBSM Curriculum Books (4 Books) - $300.00
   
   Total Expenses (Per School) - $50,000
   
   Total Project Expenses (All Schools) - $100,000
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  SBSM has tried to make scalable program that can be implemented at almost any
  middle or high school by making the program consistent yet flexible. Class
  sizes, student abilities, student behaviors, and the amount of space that a
  school is able to allot for a fitness center varies enormously from school to
  school. Giving each school the ability to tailor their fitness center to the
  school’s needs gives a larger sense of ownership for the school, as well as a
  more effective use of the fitness equipment and program. This is one of the
  reasons why SBSM has grown to impact over 92,000 students per year with our 95
  fitness centers in LAUSD. With the help of the L.A. 2050 grant, SBSM will be
  able to expand our reach in LAUSD even further.

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "According to the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, 42 percent of our children are obese or overweight.  The problem is particularly acute in low-income and minority communities where there is a lack of safe outdoor play space and an abundance of fast food restaurants.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, with average Physical Education budgets of only $500, LAUSD schools are rarely able to compensate for the recreational and fitness resources their neighborhoods lack.  In fact, according to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the most frequently cited barriers to physical activity opportunities for students are resources, time, and staff capacity.  There are 350 middle and high schools in LAUSD, of which SBSM currently serves 95.  This leaves over 200 schools in our local district alone without effective physical fitness resources.\r\n\r\nSBSM confronts this problem with an innovative approach, providing low-income schools in need of fitness resources with a comprehensive physical education package to promote the lifelong values of exercise and active living.  A grant from L.A. 2050 will help supply two LAUSD high schools with state-of-the-art fitness centers, the SBSM Curriculum, and professional development training for the school’s physical education department.\r\n\r\nEach new fitness center includes a selection of commercial-grade cardiovascular equipment (ellipticals, hybrid cycles, spin bikes and arm cycles), strength training equipment (weights and strength machines), and mobile equipment such as jump ropes and agility ladders. \r\n\r\nIn addition, each new school receives the Sound Body Sound Mind Curriculum and professional development training.  The Sound Body Sound Mind Curriculum is an evidence-based instructional program combining circuit training, the fundamentals of movement, and methodologies for motivating students.  The Curriculum provides 36 age-appropriate lessons that are structured yet flexible, and also discusses the research and theories that inform them.\r\n\r\nOnce trained, teachers can empower their students to develop competence and confidence in a variety of fitness activities.  Furthermore, students can incorporate these lessons outside of school, thus enabling them to maintain fit and healthy lifestyles into adulthood."

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      When going in to LAUSD middle and high schools, one of the biggest
      obstacles that SBSM faces is a lack of dedication from school faculty to
      the new fitness center and a lack of focus on improving physical education
      at the school.  In order to have a successful program implementation, we
      need the entire staff on board with the initiative to make sure that these
      fitness centers will be used to their full potential.  Not only the P.E.
      department, but the principle, assistant principles, as well as all other
      teachers at the school need to embrace the program and aid in it's
      effectiveness for years to come.  To ensure that this happens, we make
      each school go through an application and interview process.  The process
      increases buy-in from the potential grantees,  allows us to make sure that
      the school has the proper backing from the administration, and shows us
      whether the school is in need of the fitness center both demographically
      and fiscally.

      Following installation of the fitness centers and completion of the
      teacher trainings, each school implements the SBSM curriculum for an
      eight-week period in their classes for a minimum of 100 students.  Before
      and after the eight-week program, we require each physical education staff
      to collect student Fitnessgram data for the 100 students.  The Fitnessgram
      is a state-mandated test that measure fitness levels in students, and for
      our purposes, evaluates the overall impact of SBSM programming and
      curriculum on student health.  Along with the Fitnessgram we require the
      physical education staff to collect survey data measuring student
      attitudes toward exercise, body image, and fitness knowledge.  After
      collection of the two sets of data, we conduct comparative analysis of the
      pre and post fitness center and curriculum implementation.

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      There are organizations doing similar work in childhood obesity prevention
      such as the Youth Policy Institute (YPI) and UCLA Fit For Healthy Weight. 
      We have great relationships with both of these nonprofit organizations,
      and they have both done amazing things for the Los Angeles community.  We
      constantly look to collaborate with both organizations to best serve the
      students of LAUSD, and each organization has a unique approach on how they
      go about aiding in the improvement of children's health.  One of the
      biggest values of SBSM's model is sustainability.  Because we are giving
      schools an entire state-of-the-art fitness center and corresponding
      curriculum, we are giving them a fixed-cost investment that will last for
      years with minimal extra cost.  Students whose outlets for fitness are
      sometimes non-existent in low-income areas are able to use the fitness
      center as much as they want and adapt physical fitness into their daily
      lives for long into the future.  In order to ensure upkeep of our centers,
      our vendors provide 5-year warranties for all fitness equipment, and after
      the 5-year period, schools are eligible to apply for $5,000 worth of
      maintenance.  Although both YPI and UCLA Health are both fantastic
      organizations, most of their initiatives involve manpower, onsite
      professional help, or research that does not necessarily go entirely to
      students.  Our transparent model allows us to see direct results from our
      students, and the effects last for years after our first contact with the
      schools without much extra cost out of pocket.

      provide logistical support during the fitness center implementation
      process, and the UCLA student-led volunteer corps will ensure the
      curriculum instruction and data collection are effectively delivered for
      the hybrid program.  All $100,000 of grant awards will go to the Sound
      Body Sound Mind Foundation, and we will designate that grant money toward
      equipment costs and building the two fitness centers at the LAUSD high
      schools.

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "SBSM has tried to make scalable program that can be implemented at almost any middle or high school by making the program consistent yet flexible.  Class sizes, student abilities, student behaviors, and the amount of space that a school is able to allot for a fitness center varies enormously from school to school.  Giving each school the ability to tailor their fitness center to the school’s needs gives a larger sense of ownership for the school, as well as a more effective use of the fitness equipment and program.  This is one of the reasons why SBSM has grown to impact over 92,000 students per year with our 95 fitness centers in LAUSD. With the help of the L.A. 2050 grant, SBSM will be able to expand our reach in LAUSD even further.\r\n"
