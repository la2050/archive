title: SBSM Healthy Tomorrow Initiative
project_summary: >-
  $100,000 will supply two LAUSD high schools with state-of-the-art fitness
  centers, the SBSM curriculum and professional development training for the
  school’s physical education department.  Following an eight-week
  implementation of the SBSM Curriculum, we expect to improve student passing
  rates by a minimum 25% on the Fitnessgram assessment (California State
  proficiency test for student physical fitness) as well as improve student’s
  perception of fitness and exercise at these high schools.

  'DESCRIBE IN GREATER DETAIL HOW YOU WILL MAKE LA THE HEALTHIEST PLACE TO LIVE: ': "According to the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, 42 percent of our children are obese or overweight.  The problem is particularly acute in low-income and minority communities where there is a lack of safe outdoor play space and an abundance of fast food restaurants.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, with average Physical Education budgets of only $500, LAUSD schools are rarely able to compensate for the recreational and fitness resources their neighborhoods lack.  In fact, according to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the most frequently cited barriers to physical activity opportunities for students are resources, time, and staff capacity.  There are 350 middle and high schools in LAUSD, of which SBSM currently serves 95.  This leaves over 200 schools in our local district alone without effective physical fitness resources.\r\n\r\nSBSM confronts this problem with an innovative approach, providing low-income schools in need of fitness resources with a comprehensive physical education package to promote the lifelong values of exercise and active living.  A grant from L.A. 2050 will help supply two LAUSD high schools with state-of-the-art fitness centers, the SBSM Curriculum, and professional development training for the school’s physical education department.\r\n\r\nEach new fitness center includes a selection of commercial-grade cardiovascular equipment (ellipticals, hybrid cycles, spin bikes and arm cycles), strength training equipment (weights and strength machines), and mobile equipment such as jump ropes and agility ladders. \r\n\r\nIn addition, each new school receives the Sound Body Sound Mind Curriculum and professional development training.  The Sound Body Sound Mind Curriculum is an evidence-based instructional program combining circuit training, the fundamentals of movement, and methodologies for motivating students.  The Curriculum provides 36 age-appropriate lessons that are structured yet flexible, and also discusses the research and theories that inform them.\r\n\r\nOnce trained, teachers can empower their students to develop competence and confidence in a variety of fitness activities.  Furthermore, students can incorporate these lessons outside of school, thus enabling them to maintain fit and healthy lifestyles into adulthood."

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    When going in to LAUSD middle and high schools, one of the biggest obstacles
    that SBSM faces is a lack of dedication from school faculty to the new
    fitness center and a lack of focus on improving physical education at the
    school.  In order to have a successful program implementation, we need the
    entire staff on board with the initiative to make sure that these fitness
    centers will be used to their full potential.  Not only the P.E. department,
    but the principle, assistant principles, as well as all other teachers at
    the school need to embrace the program and aid in it's effectiveness for
    years to come.  To ensure that this happens, we make each school go through
    an application and interview process.  The process increases buy-in from the
    potential grantees,  allows us to make sure that the school has the proper
    backing from the administration, and shows us whether the school is in need
    of the fitness center both demographically and fiscally.
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    Following installation of the fitness centers and completion of the teacher
    trainings, each school implements the SBSM curriculum for an eight-week
    period in their classes for a minimum of 100 students.  Before and after the
    eight-week program, we require each physical education staff to collect
    student Fitnessgram data for the 100 students.  The Fitnessgram is a
    state-mandated test that measure fitness levels in students, and for our
    purposes, evaluates the overall impact of SBSM programming and curriculum on
    student health.  Along with the Fitnessgram we require the physical
    education staff to collect survey data measuring student attitudes toward
    exercise, body image, and fitness knowledge.  After collection of the two
    sets of data, we conduct comparative analysis of the pre and post fitness
    center and curriculum implementation.
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    There are organizations doing similar work in childhood obesity prevention
    such as the Youth Policy Institute (YPI) and UCLA Fit For Healthy Weight. 
    We have great relationships with both of these nonprofit organizations, and
    they have both done amazing things for the Los Angeles community.  We
    constantly look to collaborate with both organizations to best serve the
    students of LAUSD, and each organization has a unique approach on how they
    go about aiding in the improvement of children's health.  One of the biggest
    values of SBSM's model is sustainability.  Because we are giving schools an
    entire state-of-the-art fitness center and corresponding curriculum, we are
    giving them a fixed-cost investment that will last for years with minimal
    extra cost.  Students whose outlets for fitness are sometimes non-existent
    in low-income areas are able to use the fitness center as much as they want
    and adapt physical fitness into their daily lives for long into the future. 
    In order to ensure upkeep of our centers, our vendors provide 5-year
    warranties for all fitness equipment, and after the 5-year period, schools
    are eligible to apply for $5,000 worth of maintenance.  Although both YPI
    and UCLA Health are both fantastic organizations, most of their initiatives
    involve manpower, onsite professional help, or research that does not
    necessarily go entirely to students.  Our transparent model allows us to see
    direct results from our students, and the effects last for years after our
    first contact with the schools without much extra cost out of pocket.
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    SBSM will collaborate with UCLA Health, LAUSD, and a UCLA student-led
    volunteer corps.  UCLA Health will provide medical expertise along with
    advanced research practices in order to refine the program, LAUSD will
    provide logistical support during the fitness center implementation process,
    and the UCLA student-led volunteer corps will ensure the curriculum
    instruction and data collection are effectively delivered for the hybrid
    program.  All $100,000 of grant awards will go to the Sound Body Sound Mind
    Foundation, and we will designate that grant money toward equipment costs
    and building the two fitness centers at the LAUSD high schools.
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "SBSM has tried to make scalable program that can be implemented at almost any middle or high school by making the program consistent yet flexible.  Class sizes, student abilities, student behaviors, and the amount of space that a school is able to allot for a fitness center varies enormously from school to school.  Giving each school the ability to tailor their fitness center to the school’s needs gives a larger sense of ownership for the school, as well as a more effective use of the fitness equipment and program.  This is one of the reasons why SBSM has grown to impact over 92,000 students per year with our 95 fitness centers in LAUSD. With the help of the L.A. 2050 grant, SBSM will be able to expand our reach in LAUSD even further.\r\n"
