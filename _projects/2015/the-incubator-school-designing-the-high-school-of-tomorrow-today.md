project_summary: >-
  The Incubator School will build on our playbook for entrepreneurship education
  by developing a high school and an evaluation model that meet the needs of
  21st Century students, families, and communities. Outcomes include a detailed
  plan for an innovative school that can function within the constraints of
  staffing and budget faced by other urban schools, and an evaluation system for
  on-going feedback and improvement. Both will be developed and piloted in 2016
  and expanded in 2017.
