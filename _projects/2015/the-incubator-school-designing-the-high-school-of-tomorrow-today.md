  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "We will use this funding to build and implement two products:\r\n(1)  A complete overview of a high school model, focused on cultivating entrepreneurial skills and mindsets;\r\n(2)  A comprehensive evaluation and learning system for grades 6-12\r\n \r\nThe high school model will build on our innovative middle grades design, allowing us to continue testing and refining our practices as we add one grade per year. Our oldest cohort of students is currently in 9th grade; this grant will support piloting of core elements in the spring of their 9th grade year and fall of their 10th grade year, as well as the development of the full 9-12 arc.\r\n \r\nOur design requirements are twofold- extending and deepening elements of our existing model to meet the needs of older adolescents and creating new programs specific to high school students. Extensions include: entrepreneurship education, blended learning, outside mentors and experts, social-emotional learning. High School Specific Components will be: Individual Impact Projects, early access to college level courses, internships in exponential careers.\r\n\r\nStudents at all grade levels at Incubator School participate in Impact Projects, the learning design that best encapsulates our approach:  rigorous design challenges which provide a context for applying knowledge and skills to real-world problems.\r\n\r\nA major goal of all of these experiences will be to help students develop the skills and abilities needed for the “Exponential Careers” that are projected to be highest need in our local and national economy.\r\n\r\nOur second grant outcome, an evaluation and learning system, will differ from traditional evaluation systems in several ways:\r\no\tExplicit focus not just on external reporting but on generating data for internal learning and improvement;\r\no\tBalance of traditional school success indicators with measures of the process and impact of unique design elements;\r\no\tMethods to document high-impact practices for incorporation in the playbook and other forms of dissemination within LA County and beyond.\r\n \r\nAt a minimum, the evaluation and learning system will include:·          \r\no\tA portfolio of success metrics to both meet accountability requirements and measure our unique mission.\r\no\tAnnual surveys of key constituents;\r\no\tData templates for collecting and analyzing administrative, survey, and achievement data;\r\no\tDocumentation of key model components\r\no\tTemplate for Annual Report"

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "As a very new school, our leadership team, faculty, and governance council has limited time and resources to step back from the day to day work and think broadly about designing our high school model and evaluation system at the level of detail necessary to implement and receive feedback that is timely and effective.\r\n\r\nOur strategy is to structure professional development time around the collaborative development of key elements of the high school model, using a Human-Centered Design process to guide and inform our work. This includes some extended weekend and vacation retreats to add additional detail to the broad plans already developed as part of our pilot school application and playbook.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we plan to bring in a trusted partner, Catherine Nelson, to co-create our system of school-wide evaluation both to free up time for the leadership team to focus on implementation of the model and day to day instruction, and to ensure the system and results are valid and reliable.\r\n"
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "An evaluation and learning system is one of our two grant deliverables.  Metrics for the two deliverables:\r\n(1) High school model\r\nKey components in place by December 2016:\r\ni. Curriculum arcs, including tools for evaluating and providing feedback on student learning\r\nii. Plan for implementing internships\r\niii. Extension of advisory program to cover older teen issues and post high school transition\r\niv. Development of model for implementing individual impact project program for select middle school and all high school students\r\nv. Passes peer review by advisory board of high school design thought leaders\r\nvi. Student achievement data (short run) and post-high school success data (long run).\r\n(2) Evaluation and learning system\r\ni. Portfolio of success metrics developed and approved by full Governing Council by March 2016\r\nii. Constituent surveys developed and piloted May 2016\r\niii. Full annual report template approved by Governing Council by December 2016.\r\n"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "There are other alternative models of high school design nationally. Very few are actively addressing the fundamental disconnect between the current model of education and the one we need for the 21st century. Some of our collaborative partners and inspirations include--Summit Public Charter Schools, Design Tech High, Building 21, The Workshop School, High Tech High, Big Picture Learning, and Da Vinci Schools.\r\n\r\nSome districts also realize that schools must be fundamentally re-designed. Boston recently launched a high school redesign initiative. It remains to be seen if top down efforts will be successful at developing truly innovative models. \r\n\r\nThe Incubator School believes that our unique position in the second largest district in the country, with key autonomies provided by our pilot status, gives us a special advantage in the movement to truly transform high school. As a pilot school we share just enough of the conditions faced by a traditional public school to avoid claims that successes we have are dependent upon circumstances that are unrealistic or unscalable.\r\n\r\nWhat makes our approach unique is our focus on Impact-Based learning. Focusing on impact overcomes the dichotomy between rigor and real-world learning by ensuring the measure of success for student work is its effect on the world at various scales, judged by those affected and real-world experts.\r\n\r\nWe take common core and college readiness standards seriously, yet aim to exceed them through engagement with real world challenges and student-driven impact goals that combine the rigor of standards-based schools with the relevance of experiential learning models.\r\nFinally, we believe an inclusionary model--whether of students with diverse learning styles and abilities or of socioeconomic, racial, and cultural diversity-- serves to nurture our core values of boldness, innovation, tenacity, and empathy in all students. For all these reasons, IncSchool’s explicit goal is to integrate socio-economic and racial backgrounds within LAUSD by offering an innovative, responsive educational program that meets the support and enrichment needs of all students. The diversity of our student population means we can serve as a laboratory for schools almost anywhere who aim to implement innovative solutions to the shortcomings of secondary education."
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "Dr. Catherine Nelson will lead the development and piloting of the evaluation and learning system and support development of the high school model. Dr. Nelson has 20+ years of experience in K-12 educational evaluation and coaching schools and other educational institutions in using data to improve. Nelson has done related work with schools and districts (City Charter High School, Rowland Unified School District), grantmaking foundations (Heinz Foundation, California Endowment, Ball Foundation), professional associations (National Council of Teachers of English, National Council for Social Studies), and professional development organizations (Boundless Readers, Human Systems Dynamics).\r\n \r\nShe will collaborate with school leadership and stakeholders to develop indicators of success in our unique mission that are measurable and useful for decision-making. The process will begin with intensive internal data collection to define key elements of the school’s model. This internal research will be balanced with external benchmarking against effective practices nationally where feasible. Nelson will lead development of a set of indicators, related data collection instruments and data use protocols, and a template for a comprehensive annual report. At each stage of the process, products will be vetted by an internal committee.\r\n \r\nThe resulting data will inform on-going adjustments to our program model, provide updates to stakeholders on progress toward school-wide goals, and serve as proof of concept for external bodies including the district and accreditation bodies such as WASC.\r\n \r\nThe development of the evaluation system for grades 6-12 will proceed in tandem with building the high school model. Dr. Nelson will support the team and conduct research as needed on best practices related to specific model elements and facilitate review of the model by an external panel of experts in high school reform. We are budgeting $30,000 of the funding for Dr. Nelson’s services based on her estimate of the time required to complete deliverables listed.\r\n\r\nWe have relationships with local leaders at Da Vinci Schools and Big Picture. We have support from local start-ups, tech companies, and nonprofit organizations who will partner in developing a robust internship program: Google LA, CTRL Collective, LA + Acumen, and Gamedesk, and others. At the post-secondary level, we have partnerships with local colleges and universities including Otis and LMU."
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    We believe the total cost of the project will be approximately $180,000.
    This includes payment for Dr. Nelson’s services beyond the spring semester,
    costs for weekend, vacation, and summer planning sessions and professional
    development for leadership team and faculty, and short term additional
    staffing (3 part-time instructional aides and 1 internship manager) required
    until we reach sustainable scale. The additional $80,000 will be covered
    through a matching grant from the NGLC which we have available to us.
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "$30,000 \tConsultant Fees for Development and Implementation of Phase One of School-Wide Evaluation System\r\n\r\n$20,000\tCoverage for stipends and other costs associated with four multi-day, weekend and/or vacation planning sessions for 10 full-time staff and professional development for leadership, faculty, governance council and/or other stakeholders to design the high school model and revise based on feedback from on-going evaluations\r\n\r\n$50,000\tAdditional staffing: three part-time instructional aides to support increased personalization for Individual Impact Projects for over 100 students, and a part-time Internship Coordinator position to build the foundation and systems for our internship program. These positions will be built into our regular operating budget once enrollment grows to sustainable scale."
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "Our goal is to develop an innovative 6-12 model that starts-up students ready for real-world impact, now. Once we reach scale, approximately 600 students in 7 grades, the core elements of the model will be sustainable based solely on per pupil spending provided by Los Angeles Unified School District. This would make us financially sustainable and establish us as a model for innovative and cost-effective high school design.\r\n\r\nLeadership is being developed and promoted from within with an aim to ensuring teacher leaders understand and can sustain the culture and core methods of teaching and learning either at The Incubator School, or at new schools that wish to access our playbook and future publications identifying effective practices. A pipeline for innovative educators and an internal teacher development system are both envisioned for long term access to innovative educators. We will continue to invite partners and interested guests to observe the model in action and, once the model is fully operating and we have evidence of success, begin to explore the development of professional development opportunities similar to what Da Vinci and Big Picture Schools developed for educators and school leaders."
