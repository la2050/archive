title: 'The Incubator School: Designing the High School of Tomorrow Today'
project_summary: >-
  The Incubator School will build on our playbook for entrepreneurship education
  by developing a high school and an evaluation model that meet the needs of
  21st Century students, families, and communities. Outcomes include a detailed
  plan for an innovative school that can function within the constraints of
  staffing and budget faced by other urban schools, and an evaluation system for
  on-going feedback and improvement. Both will be developed and piloted in 2016
  and expanded in 2017.

Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "We will use this funding to build and implement two products:\r\n(1)  A complete overview of a high school model, focused on cultivating entrepreneurial skills and mindsets;\r\n(2)  A comprehensive evaluation and learning system for grades 6-12\r\n \r\nThe high school model will build on our innovative middle grades design, allowing us to continue testing and refining our practices as we add one grade per year. Our oldest cohort of students is currently in 9th grade; this grant will support piloting of core elements in the spring of their 9th grade year and fall of their 10th grade year, as well as the development of the full 9-12 arc.\r\n \r\nOur design requirements are twofold- extending and deepening elements of our existing model to meet the needs of older adolescents and creating new programs specific to high school students. Extensions include: entrepreneurship education, blended learning, outside mentors and experts, social-emotional learning. High School Specific Components will be: Individual Impact Projects, early access to college level courses, internships in exponential careers.\r\n\r\nStudents at all grade levels at Incubator School participate in Impact Projects, the learning design that best encapsulates our approach:  rigorous design challenges which provide a context for applying knowledge and skills to real-world problems.\r\n\r\nA major goal of all of these experiences will be to help students develop the skills and abilities needed for the “Exponential Careers” that are projected to be highest need in our local and national economy.\r\n\r\nOur second grant outcome, an evaluation and learning system, will differ from traditional evaluation systems in several ways:\r\no\tExplicit focus not just on external reporting but on generating data for internal learning and improvement;\r\no\tBalance of traditional school success indicators with measures of the process and impact of unique design elements;\r\no\tMethods to document high-impact practices for incorporation in the playbook and other forms of dissemination within LA County and beyond.\r\n \r\nAt a minimum, the evaluation and learning system will include:·          \r\no\tA portfolio of success metrics to both meet accountability requirements and measure our unique mission.\r\no\tAnnual surveys of key constituents;\r\no\tData templates for collecting and analyzing administrative, survey, and achievement data;\r\no\tDocumentation of key model components\r\no\tTemplate for Annual Report"
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "An evaluation and learning system is one of our two grant deliverables.  Metrics for the two deliverables:\r\n(1) High school model\r\nKey components in place by December 2016:\r\ni. Curriculum arcs, including tools for evaluating and providing feedback on student learning\r\nii. Plan for implementing internships\r\niii. Extension of advisory program to cover older teen issues and post high school transition\r\niv. Development of model for implementing individual impact project program for select middle school and all high school students\r\nv. Passes peer review by advisory board of high school design thought leaders\r\nvi. Student achievement data (short run) and post-high school success data (long run).\r\n(2) Evaluation and learning system\r\ni. Portfolio of success metrics developed and approved by full Governing Council by March 2016\r\nii. Constituent surveys developed and piloted May 2016\r\niii. Full annual report template approved by Governing Council by December 2016.\r\n"
