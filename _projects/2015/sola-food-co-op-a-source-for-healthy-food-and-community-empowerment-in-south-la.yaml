  SoLA Food Co-op a source for healthy food and community empowerment in South
  LA
project_summary: >-
  SoLA  seeks to provide better access to natural, organic and non GMO foods in
  South LA in the form of a full service grocery cooperative. We envision our
  store as a place not only for shopping but for learning , in cooking and
  nutrition classes, and for the community to gather, share prepared foods,
  fresh juices, and organic coffee. We feel that in an area long overlooked,
  with too few grocery stores, that is a food desert, a health foods cooperative
  is a brilliant solution.
