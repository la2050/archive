  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "KCRW is more than just a radio station. KCRW envisions a future as the premier multimedia forum for music, news, and culture. Building the KCRW Media Center is only the first step toward securing this future.\r\n\r\nMuch in the same way that KCRW is a destination platform for artists and audiences, the KCRW Media Center will become a physical destination and a multipurpose venue. The 35,000-square-foot facility will provide three times its current studio and production space and boasts a 1,400-square-foot performance studio for established and emerging artists for decades to come.  An audience viewing gallery will enable hundreds of people to experience intimate live in-studio sessions and performances each week, and we will broadcast these performances to millions of listeners and viewers worldwide. The building will be engineered to provide live broadcasts and public programming in shared SMC-KCRW spaces, including a 180-capacity auditorium and the 18,000-square-foot Wallis Annenberg Plaza Courtyard and Outdoor Stage.  \r\n\r\nThe KCRW Media Center will be located on the campus of Santa Monica College’s Center for Media and Design (CMaD). Conceived as a way to unite the College’s instructional facilities with its professional broadcasting partner, the CMaD campus will accommodate collaboration through shared spaces and public programming. The campus is located at the center of a transit corridor in Santa Monica’s Creative District near the LA Metro Expo Line stop at Bergamot Station and along expanded bus and bike routes. The campus design was even awarded the Urban Land Institute’s Los Angeles Real Creativity Award as an outstanding example of urban placemaking.\r\n\r\nThe KCRW Media Center will be a Los Angeles landmark and a space to galvanize the public.  Through programming on the radio, online and at hundreds of in-person events, KCRW will serve as the thought-leading community center of Los Angeles—a true “center” for this sprawling city often characterized as lacking just that. It will be a vibrant, publicly-accessible space for cultural discovery, civic discourse, and community building. With the ability to present live public programming in its own space, KCRW will deepen its relationship with members, engage new audiences, and stake its claim as the cultural epicenter for Los Angeles.\r\n"

  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    As a public media service, one of our most important duties is to evaluate
    the efficacy of our model, and structure our programs so they might become
    resources for a sustainable public media landscape.  We measure success by
    tracking growth in listening loyalty and membership support among our
    audiences. We evaluate the impact of our programs through qualitative and
    quantitative metrics that examine listenership/viewership data, community
    feedback, participation via digital platforms, and attendance at live
    events. We measure our success in advancing access to arts and culture
    through feedback from the artists, storytellers, and public and private
    cultural institutions with whom we partner. We measure success in building
    and engaging communities through the attendance and feedback received at our
    original live event programming.  These metrics inform KCRW’s leadership of
    the public response to our work and guide strategic decision making and
    investment in new opportunities.
