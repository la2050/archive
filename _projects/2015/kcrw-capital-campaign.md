  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "KCRW is more than just a radio station. KCRW envisions a future as the premier multimedia forum for music, news, and culture. Building the KCRW Media Center is only the first step toward securing this future.\r\n\r\nMuch in the same way that KCRW is a destination platform for artists and audiences, the KCRW Media Center will become a physical destination and a multipurpose venue. The 35,000-square-foot facility will provide three times its current studio and production space and boasts a 1,400-square-foot performance studio for established and emerging artists for decades to come.  An audience viewing gallery will enable hundreds of people to experience intimate live in-studio sessions and performances each week, and we will broadcast these performances to millions of listeners and viewers worldwide. The building will be engineered to provide live broadcasts and public programming in shared SMC-KCRW spaces, including a 180-capacity auditorium and the 18,000-square-foot Wallis Annenberg Plaza Courtyard and Outdoor Stage.  \r\n\r\nThe KCRW Media Center will be located on the campus of Santa Monica College’s Center for Media and Design (CMaD). Conceived as a way to unite the College’s instructional facilities with its professional broadcasting partner, the CMaD campus will accommodate collaboration through shared spaces and public programming. The campus is located at the center of a transit corridor in Santa Monica’s Creative District near the LA Metro Expo Line stop at Bergamot Station and along expanded bus and bike routes. The campus design was even awarded the Urban Land Institute’s Los Angeles Real Creativity Award as an outstanding example of urban placemaking.\r\n\r\nThe KCRW Media Center will be a Los Angeles landmark and a space to galvanize the public.  Through programming on the radio, online and at hundreds of in-person events, KCRW will serve as the thought-leading community center of Los Angeles—a true “center” for this sprawling city often characterized as lacking just that. It will be a vibrant, publicly-accessible space for cultural discovery, civic discourse, and community building. With the ability to present live public programming in its own space, KCRW will deepen its relationship with members, engage new audiences, and stake its claim as the cultural epicenter for Los Angeles.\r\n"

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    As with any large-scale construction project, the most challenging obstacle
    we face is deviation from the original estimated construction timeline for
    the KCRW Media Center. KCRW addresses such obstacles by working with our
    senior leadership, Santa Monica College (SMC) leadership, and the project
    management team (LPI, Inc. and C.W. Driver), to oversee the design and
    construction schedule and budget.
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    As a public media service, one of our most important duties is to evaluate
    the efficacy of our model, and structure our programs so they might become
    resources for a sustainable public media landscape.  We measure success by
    tracking growth in listening loyalty and membership support among our
    audiences. We evaluate the impact of our programs through qualitative and
    quantitative metrics that examine listenership/viewership data, community
    feedback, participation via digital platforms, and attendance at live
    events. We measure our success in advancing access to arts and culture
    through feedback from the artists, storytellers, and public and private
    cultural institutions with whom we partner. We measure success in building
    and engaging communities through the attendance and feedback received at our
    original live event programming.  These metrics inform KCRW’s leadership of
    the public response to our work and guide strategic decision making and
    investment in new opportunities.
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "KCRW is a flagship NPR station serving Southern California for over 30 years. There are five other public radio stations in Los Angeles. KPCC is operated by Minnesota-based American Public Media and provides news/talk programming as a service of Pasadena City College. KUSC is the University of Southern California’s classical music station and also operates two stations in San Francisco. KCSN is a modern rock music station out of California State University Northridge. KKJZ is licensed through California State University Long Beach and features Jazz and Blues music. KPFK is Pacifica Radio’s progressive local station featuring music, politics and public affairs programs. Of these, KPCC is the only other NPR affiliate. KPCC and KCRW complement one another yet provide a different value and service to the community and have about 30% audience crossover.  Because of our unique format (a mix of music, news and cultural programming) KCRW reaches an educated, affluent and influential audience with the ability and inclination to impact change locally.  Our audience is also significantly younger and demographically diverse than other public media outlets. KCRW also partners with music and cultural venues all over Los Angeles to promote emerging musicians through curated shows.\r\n\r\nAs a free, public service media resource, we strive to be reflective of our communities and provide an accessible forum where the public can become better informed and engaged members of their community. KCRW serves the wider national network of public media stations as an essential source of trendsetting programming that reflects the spirit of Los Angeles and inspires audiences far beyond our city limits. KCRW programs reach millions more worldwide through syndication by Public Radio International, NPR, and 175 public media network affiliates (including stations in major US markets in New York, San Francisco, Washington DC, Seattle, Chicago, Dallas and Atlanta).  \r\n\r\nOur listeners view and value KCRW as a local, mission-driven institution, and praise KCRW as a credible source for information and public discourse. Fernando J. Guerra, Director of the Center for the Study of Los Angeles at Loyola Marymount University, has said: “KCRW has sustained the civic dialogue in Los Angeles for the past 20 years. This dialogue leads to action and promotes justice. In a geographically large and diverse city, KCRW provides a ‘center’ where the challenges, solutions, and hope for the city can be discussed."
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "For this project, KCRW’s primary partner is Santa Monica College. The college secured capital funds to support construction and renovation of its Center for Media and Design (CMaD) campus from Measure AA, approved in 2008 by Santa Monica-Malibu voters. From these funds, the college will allocate over $28 million to build the KCRW Media Center.\r\n\r\nKCRW is celebrated for its event programming.  Whether broadcasting live from Park City as the official radio partner of the Sundance Film Festival, or our World Music Festival Series at the Hollywood Bowl, KCRW contributes to the vibrant cultural landscape by partnering with preeminent cultural institutions to offer over 100 live events each year, attended by 250,000 people throughout Southern California.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, KCRW has no publicly accessible space to host the hundreds of events we organize each year. By this time next year, KCRW will have multiple dedicated, publicly accessible spaces to accommodate our passionate audience and host the diverse roster of events we already produce. Our new home will also give us the capacity and flexibility to explore new partnerships and event series that, up till now, we have been unable to produce.\r\n\r\nKCRW has a reputation as a thought leader, tastemaker, and digital pioneer—the first to partner with emerging platforms (such as iTunes and Spotify) to make its content available on whatever medium audiences seek. By adopting digital technologies KCRW has created a global footprint that includes millions of people worldwide from over 10,000 cities and 183 countries.  \r\n\r\nAn LA2050 grant award would go directly to KCRW to support public programming in the KCRW Media Center.\r\n"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "At the time of submission of this proposal, KCRW has secured 85% of the funding required to successfully meet the campaign objectives. Construction of the KCRW Media Center will take place in one single phase with the expansion and site improvements underway at the College’s Center for Media and Design (CMaD) campus, located at 1660 Stewart Street in Santa Monica, CA.  The California Division of the State Architect (DSA) permits were approved on June 26, 2013.  Project contractors C.W. Driver began work on the site on October 1, 2013.  A public groundbreaking ceremony was held in June 2014 and buildout of the KCRW Media Center is scheduled to be complete by August 2016.  Installation, training and commissioning of broadcast systems and equipment will take place over a three-month period, estimated to begin in August 2016.  KCRW will move into the building in December 2016. \t\r\n\r\nThe impact of the KCRW Media Center will be fully realized when KCRW has the resources and stability to create new platforms that allow us to arrive at the future one step ahead of our passionate audience with the kind of quality programming that defines KCRW.  The $10 million raised through our Programming and Technology Fund will provide KCRW with the resources to: (1) Produce more live event programming to build community, (2) Develop new shows and multimedia content to educate and enlighten listeners, and (3) Create new technologies and platforms to extend our service and engage new audiences. \r\n\r\nBy this time next year KCRW will move to its new 35,000-square-foot multipurpose headquarters and redefine its role in the lives of people who call Los Angeles 'home'.  KCRW will expand its program offerings, enhance its journalistic coverage, and provide greater access for its legion of devoted audiences from all around the world by working toward the following measurable objectives:\r\n\r\n- The state-of-the-art KCRW Media Center opens in December 2016 \r\n- New programming—on-air, online and in-person—is phased in beginning in 2014\r\n- Connect to new audiences so that by 2017\r\n- Weekly listeners increase to 625,000 (baseline: 533,000)\r\n- Web traffic increases to 688,000 unique monthly visitors (baseline: 510,000) \r\n- Cumulative mobile app downloads increase to 600,000 (baseline: 450,000) \r\n- Social media audience increases to 2.5 million (baseline: 1.5 million)\r\n- Event audience increases to 268,000 (baseline: 212,970)\r\n- Internship opportunities increase to 50 (baseline: 25) \r\n"
