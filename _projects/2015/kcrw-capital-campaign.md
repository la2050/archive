  KCRW is more than just a radio station. KCRW envisions a future as the premier
  multimedia forum for music, news, and culture. Building the KCRW Media Center
  is only the first step toward securing this future.
   
   Much in the same way that KCRW is a destination platform for artists and audiences, the KCRW Media Center will become a physical destination and a multipurpose venue. The 35,000-square-foot facility will provide three times its current studio and production space and boasts a 1,400-square-foot performance studio for established and emerging artists for decades to come. An audience viewing gallery will enable hundreds of people to experience intimate live in-studio sessions and performances each week, and we will broadcast these performances to millions of listeners and viewers worldwide. The building will be engineered to provide live broadcasts and public programming in shared SMC-KCRW spaces, including a 180-capacity auditorium and the 18,000-square-foot Wallis Annenberg Plaza Courtyard and Outdoor Stage. 
   
   The KCRW Media Center will be located on the campus of Santa Monica College’s Center for Media and Design (CMaD). Conceived as a way to unite the College’s instructional facilities with its professional broadcasting partner, the CMaD campus will accommodate collaboration through shared spaces and public programming. The campus is located at the center of a transit corridor in Santa Monica’s Creative District near the LA Metro Expo Line stop at Bergamot Station and along expanded bus and bike routes. The campus design was even awarded the Urban Land Institute’s Los Angeles Real Creativity Award as an outstanding example of urban placemaking.
   
   The KCRW Media Center will be a Los Angeles landmark and a space to galvanize the public. Through programming on the radio, online and at hundreds of in-person events, KCRW will serve as the thought-leading community center of Los Angeles—a true “center” for this sprawling city often characterized as lacking just that. It will be a vibrant, publicly-accessible space for cultural discovery, civic discourse, and community building. With the ability to present live public programming in its own space, KCRW will deepen its relationship with members, engage new audiences, and stake its claim as the cultural epicenter for Los Angeles.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  As with any large-scale construction project, the most challenging obstacle we
  face is deviation from the original estimated construction timeline for the
  KCRW Media Center. KCRW addresses such obstacles by working with our senior
  leadership, Santa Monica College (SMC) leadership, and the project management
  team (LPI, Inc. and C.W. Driver), to oversee the design and construction
  schedule and budget.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  As a public media service, one of our most important duties is to evaluate the
  efficacy of our model, and structure our programs so they might become
  resources for a sustainable public media landscape. We measure success by
  tracking growth in listening loyalty and membership support among our
  audiences. We evaluate the impact of our programs through qualitative and
  quantitative metrics that examine listenership/viewership data, community
  feedback, participation via digital platforms, and attendance at live events.
  We measure our success in advancing access to arts and culture through
  feedback from the artists, storytellers, and public and private cultural
  institutions with whom we partner. We measure success in building and engaging
  communities through the attendance and feedback received at our original live
  event programming. These metrics inform KCRW’s leadership of the public
  response to our work and guide strategic decision making and investment in new
  opportunities.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  KCRW is a flagship NPR station serving Southern California for over 30 years.
  There are five other public radio stations in Los Angeles. KPCC is operated by
  Minnesota-based American Public Media and provides news/talk programming as a
  service of Pasadena City College. KUSC is the University of Southern
  California’s classical music station and also operates two stations in San
  Francisco. KCSN is a modern rock music station out of California State
  University Northridge. KKJZ is licensed through California State University
  Long Beach and features Jazz and Blues music. KPFK is Pacifica Radio’s
  progressive local station featuring music, politics and public affairs
  programs. Of these, KPCC is the only other NPR affiliate. KPCC and KCRW
  complement one another yet provide a different value and service to the
  community and have about 30% audience crossover. Because of our unique format
  (a mix of music, news and cultural programming) KCRW reaches an educated,
  affluent and influential audience with the ability and inclination to impact
  change locally. Our audience is also significantly younger and demographically
  diverse than other public media outlets. KCRW also partners with music and
  cultural venues all over Los Angeles to promote emerging musicians through
  curated shows.
   
   As a free, public service media resource, we strive to be reflective of our communities and provide an accessible forum where the public can become better informed and engaged members of their community. KCRW serves the wider national network of public media stations as an essential source of trendsetting programming that reflects the spirit of Los Angeles and inspires audiences far beyond our city limits. KCRW programs reach millions more worldwide through syndication by Public Radio International, NPR, and 175 public media network affiliates (including stations in major US markets in New York, San Francisco, Washington DC, Seattle, Chicago, Dallas and Atlanta). 
   
   Our listeners view and value KCRW as a local, mission-driven institution, and praise KCRW as a credible source for information and public discourse. Fernando J. Guerra, Director of the Center for the Study of Los Angeles at Loyola Marymount University, has said: “KCRW has sustained the civic dialogue in Los Angeles for the past 20 years. This dialogue leads to action and promotes justice. In a geographically large and diverse city, KCRW provides a ‘center’ where the challenges, solutions, and hope for the city can be discussed.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  For this project, KCRW’s primary partner is Santa Monica College. The college
  secured capital funds to support construction and renovation of its Center for
  Media and Design (CMaD) campus from Measure AA, approved in 2008 by Santa
  Monica-Malibu voters. From these funds, the college will allocate over $28
  million to build the KCRW Media Center.
   
   KCRW is celebrated for its event programming. Whether broadcasting live from Park City as the official radio partner of the Sundance Film Festival, or our World Music Festival Series at the Hollywood Bowl, KCRW contributes to the vibrant cultural landscape by partnering with preeminent cultural institutions to offer over 100 live events each year, attended by 250,000 people throughout Southern California. 
   
   Currently, KCRW has no publicly accessible space to host the hundreds of events we organize each year. By this time next year, KCRW will have multiple dedicated, publicly accessible spaces to accommodate our passionate audience and host the diverse roster of events we already produce. Our new home will also give us the capacity and flexibility to explore new partnerships and event series that, up till now, we have been unable to produce.
   
   KCRW has a reputation as a thought leader, tastemaker, and digital pioneer—the first to partner with emerging platforms (such as iTunes and Spotify) to make its content available on whatever medium audiences seek. By adopting digital technologies KCRW has created a global footprint that includes millions of people worldwide from over 10,000 cities and 183 countries. 
   
   An LA2050 grant award would go directly to KCRW to support public programming in the KCRW Media Center.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  The total project budget for KCRW’s Capital Campaign is $48 million. To date,
  we’ve secured over $41 million of our goal from the College, our Board of
  Directors, and a growing group of major supporters. We have over 85% of the
  total project budget committed. KCRW will continue to solicit major gifts from
  over 200 foundation and individual donor prospects (identified as part of a
  2013 wealth screening of our donor database). We will also solicit gifts from
  our more than 50,000 members through on-air pledge drive for the Campaign in
  December 2015.
   
   KCRW is a public radio station supported by two organizations—the KCRW Foundation and Santa Monica College. The College holds the FCC broadcast license on behalf of the station and from its beginnings, KCRW has operated as a department of the College and is acknowledged as “a community service of Santa Monica College.” The KCRW Foundation is the primary operating organization of KCRW. Financial and strategic oversight of the KCRW Foundation is provided by the Foundation Board of Directors, two of whom are ex-officio members from the College. All revenues (except a grant from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, received by the College) go directly to the KCRW Foundation and nearly all of KCRW's expenses, including 90% of all salaries, are paid by the Foundation. 
   
   Santa Monica College secured capital funds to support construction and renovation of its Center for Media and Design (CMaD) campus from Measure AA, approved in 2008 by Santa Monica-Malibu voters. From these funds, the college will allocate over $28 million to build the KCRW Media Center and KCRW Foundation will provide $10 million to support the design, equipment and furnishing costs for the building. KCRW will not be required to pay rent to the College for use of the KCRW Media Center. This is in keeping with our current arrangement with the College, whereby we do not pay rent to the College for our current office space. We do anticipate increases in programming expenses in the first few years of our operation from the KCRW Media Center, as we plan to (1) produce more original news, music, and cultural programming with expanded production space, and (2) produce more live programming and public events from our new headquarters to celebrate our inaugural year in the new facility. For this reason, our Campaign budget includes $10 million to support new programming and technology.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-

  potential of our new facility, KCRW has committed to raising $10 million to
  invest in new programs and explore new technologies that best serve our
  audience—on air, online and in person. All of the $100,000 provided by an
  LA2050 grant award would support these public programming expenses.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  At the time of submission of this proposal, KCRW has secured 85% of the
  funding required to successfully meet the campaign objectives. Construction of
  the KCRW Media Center will take place in one single phase with the expansion
  and site improvements underway at the College’s Center for Media and Design
  (CMaD) campus, located at 1660 Stewart Street in Santa Monica, CA. The
  California Division of the State Architect (DSA) permits were approved on June
  26, 2013. Project contractors C.W. Driver began work on the site on October 1,
  2013. A public groundbreaking ceremony was held in June 2014 and buildout of
  the KCRW Media Center is scheduled to be complete by August 2016.
  Installation, training and commissioning of broadcast systems and equipment
  will take place over a three-month period, estimated to begin in August 2016.
  KCRW will move into the building in December 2016. 
   
   The impact of the KCRW Media Center will be fully realized when KCRW has the resources and stability to create new platforms that allow us to arrive at the future one step ahead of our passionate audience with the kind of quality programming that defines KCRW. The $10 million raised through our Programming and Technology Fund will provide KCRW with the resources to: (1) Produce more live event programming to build community, (2) Develop new shows and multimedia content to educate and enlighten listeners, and (3) Create new technologies and platforms to extend our service and engage new audiences. 
   
   By this time next year KCRW will move to its new 35,000-square-foot multipurpose headquarters and redefine its role in the lives of people who call Los Angeles 'home'. KCRW will expand its program offerings, enhance its journalistic coverage, and provide greater access for its legion of devoted audiences from all around the world by working toward the following measurable objectives:
   
   - The state-of-the-art KCRW Media Center opens in December 2016 
   - New programming—on-air, online and in-person—is phased in beginning in 2014
   - Connect to new audiences so that by 2017
   - Weekly listeners increase to 625,000 (baseline: 533,000)
   - Web traffic increases to 688,000 unique monthly visitors (baseline: 510,000) 
   - Cumulative mobile app downloads increase to 600,000 (baseline: 450,000) 
   - Social media audience increases to 2.5 million (baseline: 1.5 million)
   - Event audience increases to 268,000 (baseline: 212,970)
   - Internship opportunities increase to 50 (baseline: 25)
