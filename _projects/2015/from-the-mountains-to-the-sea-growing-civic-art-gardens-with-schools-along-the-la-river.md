  From the Mountains to the Sea growing Civic Art Gardens with schools along the
  LA River
project_summary: >-
  We will produce a Civic Arts and Engagement Program connecting communities and
  cultures by creating, cultivating and sustaining "art gardens" (serving as
  outdoor classrooms, meeting places, art studios, urban gardens) in public open
  spaces along the LA River. In partnership with adjacent schools representing a
  diversity of people and environments, we’ll show how to bring more Beauty to
  civic spaces and build community through creating healthy and happy places for
  people of all ages to “play”.

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to play.: "\"From the Mountains to the Sea\" will be a program to produce, cultivate and sustain beautiful and healthy interactive civic spaces along the 51 mile long LA RIver. \"From the Mountains to the Sea\" will also be the theme for the network of \"civic art gardens\" sponsored by schools within walking distance of the river. The first art garden will be hosted with Harvard-Westlake School where Coldwater Canyon meets the LA River.\r\n\r\nThis program will serve students from pre through grad school, related stakeholders and extended communities. These sites will catalyze a multitude of opportunities for everyone to engage, educate, create, perform, gather, gaze and play. \r\n\r\n\"From the Mountains to the Sea\" civic art gardens will also focus attention on water issues through thematic public art and drought tolerant gardens. The program for each site includes a graffiti proof tile floor and wall that make up the “outdoor classroom, performance, meeting” space. Our first site will feature the stunning art work of world renown artist Damian Elwes, who is also a parent at the first school. Damian lived in the mountains of Columbia where he painted the life size imagery from a cloud forest source of the Amazon which will be reprinted on 1’x1’ graffiti proof tiles to make 20’x20’ floor. The wall will be from his 20’ x 8’ depiction of a life size coral reef made of these tiles on a curved modular surface. Connecting the two will be a drought tolerant garden of native plants, reminiscent of the same plants seen \r\nin both the mountains and the sea paintings, illustrating the “story of water” from the mountains to the sea, including how plants relate to water. \r\n\r\nThe sites will be inspiring, safe, lovely places to be alone with oneself, visit with friends, study with classes, greet neighbors, or feel like a tourist. They will provide curated opportunities to meet others with shared interests, have fun, develop communities, and enjoy beautiful outdoor experiences and environments. \r\n\r\nInaugural celebrations and thematic festivals will grow communities, connect potential projects with potential patrons, and be civic scale opportunities for people of all ages to play in beautiful spaces activated with vitality that might otherwise stay empty. \r\n\r\n\"From the Mountains to the Sea\" Civic Art Gardens, seeded by LA2050, can start growing right now and help make LA the best place to connect, live, create, learn and PLAY together!"

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "Aligning public and private bureaucracy, community support and creative talent can present challenges. Aligning the resources necessary to realize the vision is challenging as well.\_There are many groups doing great work although few coordinate and communicate with one another even though their missions and visions may align. Our group, Unycyn Civic Arts, is founded upon the idea of bringing visions together. \r\n\r\nWe believe focusing on aligning missions and visions of individuals, the groups they represent and their networks, will provide a \"win-win” holistic experience for those involved and facilitate the flow of resources and attention to civic scale opportunities.\r\n\r\nOne way to avoid obstacles is to try and recognize their negative potential early enough to redirect the flow of effort to keep moving forward in accordance with mission, vision and goals. \r\n"
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "We aim to help transform public places into beautiful and healthy civic spaces in a sustainable way.\r\n\r\nWe propose to complete a prototype art garden along the river and create a replicable program for other communities to produce civic art gardens.\r\n\r\nWe plan to meet our fundraising goals to build this project and program by growing tools we've created including flowproject.la, an online platform to match patrons with projects and Unycyn Civic Arts, a non-profit patron support group. \r\n\r\nWe will create a timeline for the process which includes contacting schools and partners, curating projects, aligning resources, installing inaugural art garden, and hosting a celebratory civic arts festival “funraiser”."
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "Many groups are working on making healthy and beautiful civic spaces along the river, at schools, and beyond. They serve as models for elements of our work. These groups: patronize edible gardens at schools, crowdfund support for creative and educational projects, organize professionals and volunteers to improve and maintain public spaces along the river, programming arts and events in public spaces along the river, align public policy and permissions for projects along the river and endeavor to bring joy to public spaces.\r\n\r\nWe are focusing on producing healthy and beautiful civic spaces with public art and urban gardens hosted by schools adjacent to the river and connected with their surrounding communities and establish a program to support arts, education, design, environment and community. \r\n\r\nOur approach is unique because it identifies, coordinates and synthesizes opportunities to leverage work others are already doing to transform public open spaces into beautiful and healthy civic places. We provide opportunities to align missions and visions of individuals and groups to coordinate and produce results at the civic scale. We identify opportunities in all categories that help make LA a better place now and in 2050:\r\n\r\nCONNECT - opportunities for students, parents, teachers, neighborhoods and neighboring communities\_to gather and engage in the arts \r\nCREATE - opportunities for artists and patrons to make and foster beautiful civic spaces\r\nLEARN - opportunities to work with artists, engage in civic design process and program outdoor classrooms and community spaces\r\nLIVE - opportunities to cultivate and grow beautiful and healthy civic spaces along the LA River connecting 51 miles of watershed neighbors along a river from the mountains to the sea\r\nPLAY - opportunities for interactive play places surround by nature, art and gardens"
