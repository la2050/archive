project_summary: >-
  We will produce a Civic Arts and Engagement Program connecting communities and
  cultures by creating, cultivating and sustaining "art gardens" (serving as
  outdoor classrooms, meeting places, art studios, urban gardens) in public open
  spaces along the LA River. In partnership with adjacent schools representing a
  diversity of people and environments, we’ll show how to bring more Beauty to
  civic spaces and build community through creating healthy and happy places for
  people of all ages to “play”.

  The program identifies 10 schools near the LA River, from valley headwaters
  through central cities to sea port. The prototype "seed" project is at
  Harvard-Westlake High School in the San Fernando Valley, and grows with other
  schools near 51 miles of river

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  "From the Mountains to the Sea" will be a program to produce, cultivate and
  sustain beautiful and healthy interactive civic spaces along the 51 mile long
  LA RIver. "From the Mountains to the Sea" will also be the theme for the
  network of "civic art gardens" sponsored by schools within walking distance of
  the river. The first art garden will be hosted with Harvard-Westlake School
  where Coldwater Canyon meets the LA River.
   
   This program will serve students from pre through grad school, related stakeholders and extended communities. These sites will catalyze a multitude of opportunities for everyone to engage, educate, create, perform, gather, gaze and play. 
   
   "From the Mountains to the Sea" civic art gardens will also focus attention on water issues through thematic public art and drought tolerant gardens. The program for each site includes a graffiti proof tile floor and wall that make up the “outdoor classroom, performance, meeting” space. Our first site will feature the stunning art work of world renown artist Damian Elwes, who is also a parent at the first school. Damian lived in the mountains of Columbia where he painted the life size imagery from a cloud forest source of the Amazon which will be reprinted on 1’x1’ graffiti proof tiles to make 20’x20’ floor. The wall will be from his 20’ x 8’ depiction of a life size coral reef made of these tiles on a curved modular surface. Connecting the two will be a drought tolerant garden of native plants, reminiscent of the same plants seen 
   in both the mountains and the sea paintings, illustrating the “story of water” from the mountains to the sea, including how plants relate to water. 
   
   The sites will be inspiring, safe, lovely places to be alone with oneself, visit with friends, study with classes, greet neighbors, or feel like a tourist. They will provide curated opportunities to meet others with shared interests, have fun, develop communities, and enjoy beautiful outdoor experiences and environments. 
   
   Inaugural celebrations and thematic festivals will grow communities, connect potential projects with potential patrons, and be civic scale opportunities for people of all ages to play in beautiful spaces activated with vitality that might otherwise stay empty. 
   
   "From the Mountains to the Sea" Civic Art Gardens, seeded by LA2050, can start growing right now and help make LA the best place to connect, live, create, learn and PLAY together!
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Aligning public and private bureaucracy, community support and creative talent
  can present challenges. Aligning the resources necessary to realize the vision
  is challenging as well. There are many groups doing great work although few
  coordinate and communicate with one another even though their missions and
  visions may align. Our group, Unycyn Civic Arts, is founded upon the idea of
  bringing visions together. 
   
   We believe focusing on aligning missions and visions of individuals, the groups they represent and their networks, will provide a "win-win” holistic experience for those involved and facilitate the flow of resources and attention to civic scale opportunities.
   
   One way to avoid obstacles is to try and recognize their negative potential early enough to redirect the flow of effort to keep moving forward in accordance with mission, vision and goals.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We aim to help transform public places into beautiful and healthy civic spaces
  in a sustainable way.
   
   We propose to complete a prototype art garden along the river and create a replicable program for other communities to produce civic art gardens.
   
   We plan to meet our fundraising goals to build this project and program by growing tools we've created including flowproject.la, an online platform to match patrons with projects and Unycyn Civic Arts, a non-profit patron support group. 
   
   We will create a timeline for the process which includes contacting schools and partners, curating projects, aligning resources, installing inaugural art garden, and hosting a celebratory civic arts festival “funraiser”.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Many groups are working on making healthy and beautiful civic spaces along the
  river, at schools, and beyond. They serve as models for elements of our work.
  These groups: patronize edible gardens at schools, crowdfund support for
  creative and educational projects, organize professionals and volunteers to
  improve and maintain public spaces along the river, programming arts and
  events in public spaces along the river, align public policy and permissions
  for projects along the river and endeavor to bring joy to public spaces.
   
   We are focusing on producing healthy and beautiful civic spaces with public art and urban gardens hosted by schools adjacent to the river and connected with their surrounding communities and establish a program to support arts, education, design, environment and community. 
   
   Our approach is unique because it identifies, coordinates and synthesizes opportunities to leverage work others are already doing to transform public open spaces into beautiful and healthy civic places. We provide opportunities to align missions and visions of individuals and groups to coordinate and produce results at the civic scale. We identify opportunities in all categories that help make LA a better place now and in 2050:
   
   CONNECT - opportunities for students, parents, teachers, neighborhoods and neighboring communities to gather and engage in the arts 
   CREATE - opportunities for artists and patrons to make and foster beautiful civic spaces
   LEARN - opportunities to work with artists, engage in civic design process and program outdoor classrooms and community spaces
   LIVE - opportunities to cultivate and grow beautiful and healthy civic spaces along the LA River connecting 51 miles of watershed neighbors along a river from the mountains to the sea
   PLAY - opportunities for interactive play places surround by nature, art and gardens
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Schools within walking distance to the river, government entities, LARRC,
  LACMA, patrons, parents, community businesses, corporate design sponsors,
  artists, scientists, Village Gardeners, Heal the Bay, Learning Gardens, LA
  Urban Farms, P.S. Arts, DCA and many more groups have agreed and/or will be
  contacted asap to partner based on the alignment of their missions with ours.
  The opportunity is to coordinate work they might be doing separately within a
  united program and vision. Partners will not be receiving money from the
  initial grant. Schools and artists may receive support, though not necessarily
  from the initial grant.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  The pilot civic art garden project will cost $500k. Money for this will be
  raised by selling selected tiles of the artwork, patron donations, and
  crowdsourcing platforms, online auctions, merchandise related to the projects
  and foundations whose missions align with our vision, as well as parent and
  community sponsored events. We will document this process to provide a program
  for other host schools, along with coordinating opportunities and resources to
  develop civic art gardens along the river near their schools.
   
   We've also developed technology tools to help support projects like ours: flowproject.la, a crowdsourcing website matching projects with patron gifts of time, talent, resources and treasure, and it's offshoot thecurrent, an enewsletter, connect participants and patrons with projects, news and events. All these sustainable revenue streams will help support the growth of the program as well as the growth of each site.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  Project Coordination $20k
   Program Administration $20k
   Permits $10k
   Design Fees $10k
   Professional Services (accounting/legal/insurance) $10k
   Documentation of Prototype Process to become Civic Design Program $10k
   School Program Support $10k
   Update/Maintain Unycyn Civic Arts Databases: flowproject.la, unycyn.com $10k
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  We will produce a prototype civic art garden, document the process, and
  develop a program expanding this opportunity to other schools along the river,
  serving students from elementary though grad school. The program includes
  events connecting communities at the site(s).
   
   We've identified 8 high schools along the river as pilot sites, from public schools specializing in the arts, to parochial schools for catholics and muslims. The other 2 two schools we plan to work with are Inner City Arts to reach elementary school children and Sci-Arc to offer college and graduate students opportunities to engage in real world applications of civic design studies.
   
   Winning the LA2050 grant will provide seed money for the coordination of partners with this program and producing the prototype garden. In addition to the treasure, winning the LA2050 grant offers opportunities for counsel and potential partnerships with your advisors and their time, talents and resources as well. It would be an honor to work with you to help make LA a better place to play in the most livable, educational, connecting and creative senses of the word! Thanks for the opportunity to share our project and ideas with the public!
