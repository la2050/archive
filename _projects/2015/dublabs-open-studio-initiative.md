  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "DUBLAB’s proposed project will make L.A. the best place to connect by introducing to Los Angeles an arts-oriented space intended both to engage members of the public, and serve as a community hub for Angelenos to meet, mingle and hear music together.  DUBLAB experimented with a storefront studio during our Spring 2015 Proton Drive Fundraiser and saw tremendous results.\r\n\r\nDublab has a long history of making LA the best place to connect. Over the years, dublab has presented hundreds of free concerts throughout the city of Los Angeles. Dublab has curated the main music stages at the Eagle Rock Music Festival for six years running, at the Abbot Kinney Festival for the past three years and, for four years, we presented a series of free, dublab curated concerts as part of the Levitt Pavilion summer series. Our organization has also contributed to numerous free, public programs at the Music Center, Getty Center, Hammer Museum, LACMA, Los Angeles Public Library, Santa Monica Pier, Grammy Museum, REDCAT, cicLAvia, and dozens of other major arts institutions in Los Angeles. DUBLAB also serves as a creative incubator for musicians in Los Angeles to develop their sonic experimentations in both live performance settings and studio­ based radio broadcasts.\r\n\r\nFollowing are a few projects that exemplify dublab’s achievements: \r\n\r\nSleepless (a collaboration with the Music Center) - http://musiccenterblog.com/2015/09/23/sleepless-the-music-center-after-hours/\r\n\r\nVision Version - http://dublab.tv/vision-version\r\n\r\nSecondhand Sureshots - http://dublab.tv/secondhand-sureshots\r\n\r\nHammer Made in LA Soundmap App (music curator) - http://dublab.com/hammer-museums-free-made-in-l-a-soundmap-app-with-music-curated-by-dublab/ \r\n\r\nTonalism - http://dublab.com/events/17916/tonalism-presented-by-dublab-sonos/\r\n\r\nInto Infinity (a collaboration with Creative Commons) - http://intoinfinity.org/\r\n\r\nLight from Los Angeles - http://superheadz.com/dublab/\r\n\r\ndublab.jp - http://dublab.jp/\r\n\r\ndublab.de - http://dublab.de/\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    The most significant barrier to realizing our project will be finding an
    appropriate space that meets all of our criteria and allows us to deliver an
    important contribution to the city.  Our project requires a space that can
    house a small radio station in such a way that DJs and presenters are
    visible to the public, and provides an inviting atmosphere to facilitate
    public engagement. DUBLAB plans to leverage its many partnerships within the
    Los Angeles community to find such a space. Additionally, the generous
    funding provided through the LA2050 Initiative will provide ample latitude
    in finding the correct space for this project.
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "DUBLAB's Open Studio Initiative will be evaluated by the following metrics: \r\n\r\nPUBLIC FEEDBACK:\r\n \r\nTo evaluate the response from the public, an e-mail survey will be conducted with participants at the end of the project’s first year. Feedback given by the public will be compiled with anecdotal reports from studio staff. \r\n\r\nMEDIA RESPONSE: \r\n\r\nPress received will be taken into consideration alongside public opinion. Positive coverage in at least one major Los Angeles media outlet per event will be considered a success. We will also take into account the depth of social media activity throughout the course of the initiative and the number of followers gained. \r\n\r\nStaff Review:\r\n\r\nThe staff will conduct a review at the end of each month of operation to evaluate the studio's success based on enthusiasm of the audience and depth of engagement. At the end of the first year of operation we will determine if the quality of the project successfully fulfilled the initiative's goals."
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "DUBLAB is a unique organization in Los Angeles. Although there are other radio stations active in the area, such as KCRW and KPFK, dublab provides community focused broadcasting exclusively involving music.  DUBLAB provides a platform for L.A.’s creative community to connect with each other and with the rest of the world.\r\n"
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    The Open Studio Initiative will tap into dublab’s collective of
    internationally recognized musicians, DJ’s and filmmakers in order to
    provide programming to the public and spread awareness of our new studio
    location. We will invite a wide array of collaborators, ranging from
    pioneering elders to influential, up and coming musicians and artists to
    participate in public radio broadcasts.
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': 'We anticipate that the project will cost $100,000.'
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Studio and office furniture\t$15,000\r\nDesign and decoration for indoor and outdoor areas $15,000\r\nSignage\t$1,000\r\nOffice equipment\t$3,000\r\nStudio audio equipment $15,000\r\nWeb/Wi-fi Set up  $500\r\nBenches, and patio furniture $3,000\r\nLighting\t$5,000\r\nMoving expenses $500\r\nRental Deposit $4,000\r\nRent for first 3 months\t$6,000\r\nUtilities for first 3 months\t$600\r\nConstruction, building modifications and repairs $26,400\r\nSound proof\t$5,000\r\n\r\nTotal $100,000\r\n"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    DUBLAB’s ongoing commitment to having a positive impact on way that people
    engage with art in Los Angeles has led to our organization’s interest in
    permanently establishing a non-commercial public space for our radio
    station. The success of our proposal would help dublab find and establish a
    public radio station far beyond LA2050’s yearlong period of funding. We are
    confident that dublab will be able to permanently make the studio
    established by the Open Studio Initiative a central part of dublab’s
    operations for many years to come.
