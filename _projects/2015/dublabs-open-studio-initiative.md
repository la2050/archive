  DUBLAB proposes to relocate our studio to a storefront location along a busy
  thoroughfare, and reimagine our radio station’s role in engaging with the
  public. By making our studio visible and our broadcast audible from the
  sidewalk, as well as providing seating and free wifi, we hope to give a
  community members a unique space to meet, connect and engage with the arts.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  DUBLAB’s proposed project will make L.A. the best place to connect by
  introducing to Los Angeles an arts-oriented space intended both to engage
  members of the public, and serve as a community hub for Angelenos to meet,
  mingle and hear music together. DUBLAB experimented with a storefront studio
  during our Spring 2015 Proton Drive Fundraiser and saw tremendous results.
   
   Dublab has a long history of making LA the best place to connect. Over the years, dublab has presented hundreds of free concerts throughout the city of Los Angeles. Dublab has curated the main music stages at the Eagle Rock Music Festival for six years running, at the Abbot Kinney Festival for the past three years and, for four years, we presented a series of free, dublab curated concerts as part of the Levitt Pavilion summer series. Our organization has also contributed to numerous free, public programs at the Music Center, Getty Center, Hammer Museum, LACMA, Los Angeles Public Library, Santa Monica Pier, Grammy Museum, REDCAT, cicLAvia, and dozens of other major arts institutions in Los Angeles. DUBLAB also serves as a creative incubator for musicians in Los Angeles to develop their sonic experimentations in both live performance settings and studio­ based radio broadcasts.
   
   Following are a few projects that exemplify dublab’s achievements:

Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  The most significant barrier to realizing our project will be finding an
  appropriate space that meets all of our criteria and allows us to deliver an
  important contribution to the city. Our project requires a space that can
  house a small radio station in such a way that DJs and presenters are visible
  to the public, and provides an inviting atmosphere to facilitate public
  engagement. DUBLAB plans to leverage its many partnerships within the Los
  Angeles community to find such a space. Additionally, the generous funding
  provided through the LA2050 Initiative will provide ample latitude in finding
  the correct space for this project.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: |-
  DUBLAB's Open Studio Initiative will be evaluated by the following metrics: 
   
   PUBLIC FEEDBACK:
    
   To evaluate the response from the public, an e-mail survey will be conducted with participants at the end of the project’s first year. Feedback given by the public will be compiled with anecdotal reports from studio staff. 
   
   MEDIA RESPONSE: 
   
   Press received will be taken into consideration alongside public opinion. Positive coverage in at least one major Los Angeles media outlet per event will be considered a success. We will also take into account the depth of social media activity throughout the course of the initiative and the number of followers gained. 
   
   Staff Review:
   
   The staff will conduct a review at the end of each month of operation to evaluate the studio's success based on enthusiasm of the audience and depth of engagement. At the end of the first year of operation we will determine if the quality of the project successfully fulfilled the initiative's goals.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  DUBLAB is a unique organization in Los Angeles. Although there are other radio
  stations active in the area, such as KCRW and KPFK, dublab provides community
  focused broadcasting exclusively involving music. DUBLAB provides a platform
  for L.A.’s creative community to connect with each other and with the rest of
  the world.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  The Open Studio Initiative will tap into dublab’s collective of
  internationally recognized musicians, DJ’s and filmmakers in order to provide
  programming to the public and spread awareness of our new studio location. We
  will invite a wide array of collaborators, ranging from pioneering elders to
  influential, up and coming musicians and artists to participate in public
  radio broadcasts.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': 'We anticipate that the project will cost $100,000.'
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  Studio and office furniture $15,000
   Design and decoration for indoor and outdoor areas $15,000
   Signage $1,000
   Office equipment $3,000
   Studio audio equipment $15,000
   Web/Wi-fi Set up $500
   Benches, and patio furniture $3,000
   Lighting $5,000
   Moving expenses $500
   Rental Deposit $4,000
   Rent for first 3 months $6,000
   Utilities for first 3 months $600
   Construction, building modifications and repairs $26,400
   Sound proof $5,000
   
   Total $100,000
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  DUBLAB’s ongoing commitment to having a positive impact on way that people
  engage with art in Los Angeles has led to our organization’s interest in
  permanently establishing a non-commercial public space for our radio station.
  The success of our proposal would help dublab find and establish a public
  radio station far beyond LA2050’s yearlong period of funding. We are confident
  that dublab will be able to permanently make the studio established by the
  Open Studio Initiative a central part of dublab’s operations for many years to
  come.
