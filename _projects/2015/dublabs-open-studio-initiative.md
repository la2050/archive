Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "DUBLAB’s proposed project will make L.A. the best place to connect by introducing to Los Angeles an arts-oriented space intended both to engage members of the public, and serve as a community hub for Angelenos to meet, mingle and hear music together.  DUBLAB experimented with a storefront studio during our Spring 2015 Proton Drive Fundraiser and saw tremendous results.\r\n\r\nDublab has a long history of making LA the best place to connect. Over the years, dublab has presented hundreds of free concerts throughout the city of Los Angeles. Dublab has curated the main music stages at the Eagle Rock Music Festival for six years running, at the Abbot Kinney Festival for the past three years and, for four years, we presented a series of free, dublab curated concerts as part of the Levitt Pavilion summer series. Our organization has also contributed to numerous free, public programs at the Music Center, Getty Center, Hammer Museum, LACMA, Los Angeles Public Library, Santa Monica Pier, Grammy Museum, REDCAT, cicLAvia, and dozens of other major arts institutions in Los Angeles. DUBLAB also serves as a creative incubator for musicians in Los Angeles to develop their sonic experimentations in both live performance settings and studio­ based radio broadcasts.\r\n\r\nFollowing are a few projects that exemplify dublab’s achievements: \r\n\r\nSleepless (a collaboration with the Music Center) - http://musiccenterblog.com/2015/09/23/sleepless-the-music-center-after-hours/\r\n\r\nVision Version - http://dublab.tv/vision-version\r\n\r\nSecondhand Sureshots - http://dublab.tv/secondhand-sureshots\r\n\r\nHammer Made in LA Soundmap App (music curator) - http://dublab.com/hammer-museums-free-made-in-l-a-soundmap-app-with-music-curated-by-dublab/ \r\n\r\nTonalism - http://dublab.com/events/17916/tonalism-presented-by-dublab-sonos/\r\n\r\nInto Infinity (a collaboration with Creative Commons) - http://intoinfinity.org/\r\n\r\nLight from Los Angeles - http://superheadz.com/dublab/\r\n\r\ndublab.jp - http://dublab.jp/\r\n\r\ndublab.de - http://dublab.de/\r\n\r\n\r\n"
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "DUBLAB's Open Studio Initiative will be evaluated by the following metrics: \r\n\r\nPUBLIC FEEDBACK:\r\n \r\nTo evaluate the response from the public, an e-mail survey will be conducted with participants at the end of the project’s first year. Feedback given by the public will be compiled with anecdotal reports from studio staff. \r\n\r\nMEDIA RESPONSE: \r\n\r\nPress received will be taken into consideration alongside public opinion. Positive coverage in at least one major Los Angeles media outlet per event will be considered a success. We will also take into account the depth of social media activity throughout the course of the initiative and the number of followers gained. \r\n\r\nStaff Review:\r\n\r\nThe staff will conduct a review at the end of each month of operation to evaluate the studio's success based on enthusiasm of the audience and depth of engagement. At the end of the first year of operation we will determine if the quality of the project successfully fulfilled the initiative's goals."
