  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: "Homelessness in LA has sky-rocketed and creative solutions are needed to solve this problem. Our organization is doing its part by providing business and entrepreneurial training to residents of homeless shelters throughout Los Angeles. While our clients are getting excellent business training and are even partnered with a team graduate students who volunteer to help them with their business ideas, our clients still lack basic resources needed to actually launch and run their businesses. Many of our clients have struggled with homelessness, addictions and have been incarcerated for many years. For some entrepreneurship is their only option for income. Last summer we were able to secure a small facility for a few of our clients and successfully launched 4  new businesses. However the space could only hold 4 businesses and was also restrictive on the types of businesses permitted to use the space. We have 14 new clients currently going through our training program that will need access to space to launch their businesses in a few months. This funding will allow us to secure a larger facility to help more of our clients launch, grow and operate their small businesses.\r\n"

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    One major challenge we face is dealing with the variety of businesses our
    clients propose. We have some clients starting food businesses, some
    starting craft businesses, some starting welding and/or furniture
    businesses. Our challenge/solution is to find a facility that we can
    renovate to create separate work areas for each category of business. For
    instance, we would like to create a commercial kitchen in part of the space,
    have an industrial section and an offices section, a warehouse section and a
    store front. If we are unable to secure such a location we will have to rent
    two separate locations (hopefully next to each other) to accomplish the same
    goal.
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    The most obvious performance indicator for us is the number of businesses
    that are able to launch as well as the amount of revenue the various
    businesses generate. We are also looking at how many of our clients are able
    to move out of the shelters and into permanent housing. Additionally there
    are qualitative items that are relevant to our work, such as increased
    quality of life as well as the pride/self confidence that goes along with
    entrepreneurship -  especially for those coming from a background of
    homelessness, poverty, domestic violence and substance abuse.
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    Yes, there are other organizations doing similar work; the SBA, SCORE, etc.
    However, we are unique in at least three distinct ways. First we are working
    with a target demographic that most other organizations do not work with.
    Secondly, each of our clients are put on a team of 2-3 graduate students who
    volunteer as business mentors for our clients and help the develop their
    business ideas and business plans. Finally we are providing funding
    (micro-loans)  and other resources for our clients allowing them to overcome
    a major barrier in entrepreneurship.
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    We have several partner organizations that we work with. First off we work
    with homeless shelters including URM, Hope Gardens, PATH, Upward Bound
    House, 4 different Salvation Army Shelters, Chrysalis, San Fernando Valley
    Rescue Mission, DWC. Additionally we work with Pepperdine University who
    supplies student volunteers/business mentors. However, the $100k will be
    used to secure work space and equipment for our clients and access to
    micro-loans for working capital. Our partner organizations will not need to
    access these funds.
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': We have budgeted $100k for 1 year. See projections below
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
    A 1 year lease in the valley for the size of facility we are looking at is
    $4k per month - roughly $50k for the year. We will utilize $30k to renovate
    the facility and to purchase equipment. The remaining $20k will be used to
    provide micro-loans for our clients. On average our clients need $2k to
    start their businesses. This means we will be able to provide loans for at
    least 10 clients
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    We have already had several organizations approach us in the past from 
    Orange County, Arizona, Seattle and others. However, we have been very
    hesitant to pursue these options as we want to first prove our concept. Up
    until this last summer our program has been strictly and educational
    program. However as mentioned, this last summer we were able to secure a
    small facility to prove our concept - "homeless people can indeed start
    businesses." - though our success has been small so far. With this grant we
    will be able to prove it on a larger scale and then be ready to implement it
    in other areas of LA County and other cities across the nation
