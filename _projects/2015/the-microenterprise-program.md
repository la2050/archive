  'In one to three sentences, please describe your proposal.': >-
    We would like to set up an incubator facility for our clients to use as
    workspace, office space and a store front. 
  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: "Homelessness in LA has sky-rocketed and creative solutions are needed to solve this problem. Our organization is doing its part by providing business and entrepreneurial training to residents of homeless shelters throughout Los Angeles. While our clients are getting excellent business training and are even partnered with a team graduate students who volunteer to help them with their business ideas, our clients still lack basic resources needed to actually launch and run their businesses. Many of our clients have struggled with homelessness, addictions and have been incarcerated for many years. For some entrepreneurship is their only option for income. Last summer we were able to secure a small facility for a few of our clients and successfully launched 4  new businesses. However the space could only hold 4 businesses and was also restrictive on the types of businesses permitted to use the space. We have 14 new clients currently going through our training program that will need access to space to launch their businesses in a few months. This funding will allow us to secure a larger facility to help more of our clients launch, grow and operate their small businesses.\r\n"
  How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
    - Money (financial capital)
    - Volunteers/staff (human capital)
    - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
    - 'Infrastructure (building/space/vehicles, etc.)'
    - Education/training
    - 'Technical infrastructure (computers, etc.)'
    - Community outreach
    - Network/relationship support
  How do you plan to use these resources to make change?:
    - Engage residents and stakeholders
    - Implement a pilot or new project
    - Expand a pilot or a program
    - Mobilize for systems change
  Where will you be working?:
    - Central LA
    - San Fernando Valley
    - Westside
  How will your proposal improve the following “Create” metrics?:
    - Concentration of manufacturing activity in LA
    - Minority- and women-owned firms
    - >-
      Recruiting and retention rates for local higher education institutions
      (Dream Metric)
    - >-
      Percentage of graduates from local higher education institutions that
      remain in LA County 5 years after graduating (Dream Metric)
    - >-
      Unemployment rates (and opportunities) for the formerly incarcerated
      (Dream Metric)
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    The most obvious performance indicator for us is the number of businesses
    that are able to launch as well as the amount of revenue the various
    businesses generate. We are also looking at how many of our clients are able
    to move out of the shelters and into permanent housing. Additionally there
    are qualitative items that are relevant to our work, such as increased
    quality of life as well as the pride/self confidence that goes along with
    entrepreneurship -  especially for those coming from a background of
    homelessness, poverty, domestic violence and substance abuse.

  Homelessness in LA has sky-rocketed and creative solutions are needed to solve
  this problem. Our organization is doing its part by providing business and
  entrepreneurial training to residents of homeless shelters throughout Los
  Angeles. While our clients are getting excellent business training and are
  even partnered with a team graduate students who volunteer to help them with
  their business ideas, our clients still lack basic resources needed to
  actually launch and run their businesses. Many of our clients have struggled

  will allow us to secure a larger facility to help more of our clients launch,
  grow and operate their small businesses.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  One major challenge we face is dealing with the variety of businesses our
  clients propose. We have some clients starting food businesses, some starting
  craft businesses, some starting welding and/or furniture businesses. Our
  challenge/solution is to find a facility that we can renovate to create
  separate work areas for each category of business. For instance, we would like
  to create a commercial kitchen in part of the space, have an industrial
  section and an offices section, a warehouse section and a store front. If we
  are unable to secure such a location we will have to rent two separate
  locations (hopefully next to each other) to accomplish the same goal.

  especially for those coming from a background of homelessness, poverty,
  domestic violence and substance abuse.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Yes, there are other organizations doing similar work; the SBA, SCORE, etc.
  However, we are unique in at least three distinct ways. First we are working
  with a target demographic that most other organizations do not work with.
  Secondly, each of our clients are put on a team of 2-3 graduate students who
  volunteer as business mentors for our clients and help the develop their
  business ideas and business plans. Finally we are providing funding
  (micro-loans) and other resources for our clients allowing them to overcome a
  major barrier in entrepreneurship.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  We have several partner organizations that we work with. First off we work
  with homeless shelters including URM, Hope Gardens, PATH, Upward Bound House,
  4 different Salvation Army Shelters, Chrysalis, San Fernando Valley Rescue
  Mission, DWC. Additionally we work with Pepperdine University who supplies
  student volunteers/business mentors. However, the $100k will be used to secure
  work space and equipment for our clients and access to micro-loans for working
  capital. Our partner organizations will not need to access these funds.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  We have already had several organizations approach us in the past from Orange
  County, Arizona, Seattle and others. However, we have been very hesitant to
  pursue these options as we want to first prove our concept. Up until this last
  summer our program has been strictly and educational program. However as
  mentioned, this last summer we were able to secure a small facility to prove
  our concept - "homeless people can indeed start businesses." - though our
  success has been small so far. With this grant we will be able to prove it on
  a larger scale and then be ready to implement it in other areas of LA County
  and other cities across the nation
