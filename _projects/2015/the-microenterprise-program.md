'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Homelessness in LA has sky-rocketed and creative solutions are needed to solve
  this problem. Our organization is doing its part by providing business and
  entrepreneurial training to residents of homeless shelters throughout Los
  Angeles. While our clients are getting excellent business training and are
  even partnered with a team graduate students who volunteer to help them with
  their business ideas, our clients still lack basic resources needed to
  actually launch and run their businesses. Many of our clients have struggled
  with homelessness, addictions and have been incarcerated for many years. For
  some entrepreneurship is their only option for income. Last summer we were
  able to secure a small facility for a few of our clients and successfully
  launched 4 new businesses. However the space could only hold 4 businesses and
  was also restrictive on the types of businesses permitted to use the space. We
  have 14 new clients currently going through our training program that will
  need access to space to launch their businesses in a few months. This funding
  will allow us to secure a larger facility to help more of our clients launch,
  grow and operate their small businesses.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  One major challenge we face is dealing with the variety of businesses our
  clients propose. We have some clients starting food businesses, some starting
  craft businesses, some starting welding and/or furniture businesses. Our
  challenge/solution is to find a facility that we can renovate to create
  separate work areas for each category of business. For instance, we would like
  to create a commercial kitchen in part of the space, have an industrial
  section and an offices section, a warehouse section and a store front. If we
  are unable to secure such a location we will have to rent two separate
  locations (hopefully next to each other) to accomplish the same goal.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  The most obvious performance indicator for us is the number of businesses that
  are able to launch as well as the amount of revenue the various businesses
  generate. We are also looking at how many of our clients are able to move out
  of the shelters and into permanent housing. Additionally there are qualitative
  items that are relevant to our work, such as increased quality of life as well
  as the pride/self confidence that goes along with entrepreneurship -
  especially for those coming from a background of homelessness, poverty,
  domestic violence and substance abuse.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Yes, there are other organizations doing similar work; the SBA, SCORE, etc.
  However, we are unique in at least three distinct ways. First we are working
  with a target demographic that most other organizations do not work with.
  Secondly, each of our clients are put on a team of 2-3 graduate students who
  volunteer as business mentors for our clients and help the develop their
  business ideas and business plans. Finally we are providing funding
  (micro-loans) and other resources for our clients allowing them to overcome a
  major barrier in entrepreneurship.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  We have several partner organizations that we work with. First off we work
  with homeless shelters including URM, Hope Gardens, PATH, Upward Bound House,
  4 different Salvation Army Shelters, Chrysalis, San Fernando Valley Rescue
  Mission, DWC. Additionally we work with Pepperdine University who supplies
  student volunteers/business mentors. However, the $100k will be used to secure
  work space and equipment for our clients and access to micro-loans for working
  capital. Our partner organizations will not need to access these funds.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': We have budgeted $100k for 1 year. See projections below
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
  A 1 year lease in the valley for the size of facility we are looking at is $4k
  per month - roughly $50k for the year. We will utilize $30k to renovate the
  facility and to purchase equipment. The remaining $20k will be used to provide
  micro-loans for our clients. On average our clients need $2k to start their
  businesses. This means we will be able to provide loans for at least 10
  clients
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  We have already had several organizations approach us in the past from Orange
  County, Arizona, Seattle and others. However, we have been very hesitant to
  pursue these options as we want to first prove our concept. Up until this last
  summer our program has been strictly and educational program. However as
  mentioned, this last summer we were able to secure a small facility to prove
  our concept - "homeless people can indeed start businesses." - though our
  success has been small so far. With this grant we will be able to prove it on
  a larger scale and then be ready to implement it in other areas of LA County
  and other cities across the nation

While our clients are getting excellent business training and are even partnered with a team graduate students who volunteer to help them with their business ideas, our clients still lack basic resources needed to actually launch and run their businesses. Many of our clients have struggled with homelessness, addictions and have been incarcerated for many years. For some entrepreneurship is their only option for income. Last summer we were able to secure a small facility for a few of our clients and successfully launched 4  new businesses. However the space could only hold 4 businesses and was also restrictive on the types of businesses permitted to use the space. We have 14 new clients currently going through our training program that will need access to space to launch their businesses in a few months. This funding will allow us to secure a larger facility to help more of our clients launch, grow and operate their small businesses.\r\n"

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      One major challenge we face is dealing with the variety of businesses our
      clients propose. We have some clients starting food businesses, some
      starting craft businesses, some starting welding and/or furniture
      businesses. Our challenge/solution is to find a facility that we can
      renovate to create separate work areas for each category of business. For
      instance, we would like to create a commercial kitchen in part of the
      space, have an industrial section and an offices section, a warehouse
      section and a store front. If we are unable to secure such a location we
      will have to rent two separate locations (hopefully next to each other) to
      accomplish the same goal.

      The most obvious performance indicator for us is the number of businesses
      that are able to launch as well as the amount of revenue the various
      businesses generate. We are also looking at how many of our clients are
      able to move out of the shelters and into permanent housing. Additionally
      there are qualitative items that are relevant to our work, such as
      increased quality of life as well as the pride/self confidence that goes
      along with entrepreneurship -  especially for those coming from a
      background of homelessness, poverty, domestic violence and substance
      abuse.

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      Yes, there are other organizations doing similar work; the SBA, SCORE,
      etc. However, we are unique in at least three distinct ways. First we are
      working with a target demographic that most other organizations do not
      work with. Secondly, each of our clients are put on a team of 2-3 graduate
      students who volunteer as business mentors for our clients and help the
      develop their business ideas and business plans. Finally we are providing
      funding (micro-loans)  and other resources for our clients allowing them
      to overcome a major barrier in entrepreneurship.

      Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on
      this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner
      receive?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      We have several partner organizations that we work with. First off we work
      with homeless shelters including URM, Hope Gardens, PATH, Upward Bound
      House, 4 different Salvation Army Shelters, Chrysalis, San Fernando Valley
      Rescue Mission, DWC. Additionally we work with Pepperdine University who
      supplies student volunteers/business mentors. However, the $100k will be
      used to secure work space and equipment for our clients and access to
      micro-loans for working capital. Our partner organizations will not need
      to access these funds.

      Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement
      this project.
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      A 1 year lease in the valley for the size of facility we are looking at is
      $4k per month - roughly $50k for the year. We will utilize $30k to
      renovate the facility and to purchase equipment. The remaining $20k will
      be used to provide micro-loans for our clients. On average our clients
      need $2k to start their businesses. This means we will be able to provide
      loans for at least 10 clients

      We have already had several organizations approach us in the past from 
      Orange County, Arizona, Seattle and others. However, we have been very
      hesitant to pursue these options as we want to first prove our concept. Up
      until this last summer our program has been strictly and educational
      program. However as mentioned, this last summer we were able to secure a
      small facility to prove our concept - "homeless people can indeed start
      businesses." - though our success has been small so far. With this grant
      we will be able to prove it on a larger scale and then be ready to
      implement it in other areas of LA County and other cities across the
      nation
