  'DESCRIBE IN GREATER DETAIL HOW YOU WILL MAKE LA THE HEALTHIEST PLACE TO LIVE: ': "The Water LA Training and Certification program will expand the city’s pool of workers capable of retrofitting and maintaining LA homes and yards to capture, conserve, and reuse water. It will help expand LA’s local water supply, improve water quality in local streams, increase tree canopy, enhance climate resilience, and strengthen our green economy.\r\n\r\nToday, LA relies on imported water for nearly 90% of its supply. Meanwhile, rain that falls in the city runs off from roads to storm drains to the LA River to the ocean, wasting a potential supply and polluting our waterways in the process. This system of water management is not sustainable.\r\n\r\nThe Water LA program aims to improve this situation by spreading water harvesting practices to residential landscapes across the region. Replacing thirsty, rain-repelling turf with native plants, rain gardens and edible landscapes; installing rain tanks and greywater systems to provide alternative irrigation sources; building infiltration trenches and parkway basins to recharge our aquifers and capture runoff from the street – Water LA aims to expand adoption of all of these urban acupuncture solutions.\r\n\r\nLA’s enthusiastic response to local turf rebate programs shows how eager residents are to make their homes more water-resilient and cut their potable water use. But many Angelenos encounter barriers to making these changes on their own, like a lack of technical skills to do the design and installation, or a shortage of time to do proper maintenance. These residents have struggled to find professionals trained in water-smart retrofitting or maintenance. \r\n\r\nWe aim to close this gap between LA’s desire for water and climate resilient home landscapes and their ability to design, implement, and maintain those retrofits by training local gardeners, contractors, and youth in techniques to capture, conserve, and reuse water on residential parcels. We will work with expert NGOs and green businesses to develop appropriate curriculum and to train instructors at LA Trade Tech (a member of the LA Community College District), enabling them to offer the curriculum in the fall of 2016.\r\n\r\nThis training will enable and empower residents to make changes on their properties and cultivate a new culture of water stewardship across the city. It will also bolster the city’s green economy - helping the design, construction and maintenance of residential green infrastructure grow into a recognized and legitimate trade in our region and beyond.

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "Finding instructors with extensive training in these specialized technical areas will be a challenge. LA Trade Tech will deliver the courses, allowing the program to take advantage of the strong institutional infrastructure in place through the region’s community college district. While the school employs excellent technical instructors with years of experience, few have completed formal coursework in these specialties. Even fewer have studied them through an integrated lens and a practical, hands-on framework. These circumstances could create teaching challenges.\r\n\r\nWhen the curriculum is developed, we will work through this challenge by providing an intensive “train the trainers” course to Trade Tech instructors. We will work with Watershed Management Group, a Tucson-based NGO that routinely conducts trainings in this field, to develop and teach a pedagogy-focused course for staff at the college."
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "We will measure our success by our ability to hit two key benchmarks by August 2016:\r\n\r\n•\tSuccessful development of curricula for courses in the design, installation, and maintenance of key urban acupuncture strategies (site assessment, rain tanks, rain grading, native plants, greywater systems, parkway basins, infiltration trenches, permeable surfaces, and edible landscapes);\r\n•\tAdministration of a “train the trainers” course for LA Trade Tech instructors.\r\n\r\nCompleting curriculum development and teacher training will enable LA Trade Tech to offer these courses to students in the fall of 2016."
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "We are intentionally partnering with organizations offering similar trainings to develop the curricula for these courses. These NGOs and small businesses agree that this community college-based instructional approach is complementary to (and not competitive with) their existing efforts. \r\n\r\nWe collectively seek to support widespread transfer of these skills and rapid uptake of these strategies throughout Los Angeles. Instituting an integrated training program that’s affordable and accessible to both youth and professionals in transition helps accelerate this shift. Partnering with LA Trade Tech helps establish this skill set as a legitimate trade.\r\n\r\nWe are also working with our agency partners on a program tailored to educate city workers in green infrastructure design and maintenance. While urban acupuncture and green infrastructure work at different scales and under a different regulatory framework, they share the same principles and practices. As such, graduates of the Water LA Training Program would be well positioned to move into municipal careers if they chose, offering the City a well-trained 21st century workforce.\r\n\r\nThis program differs from existing offerings in three key ways: duration, depth, and scope. Water LA’s program will be spread out over a longer period of time than most comparable programs. Some of our partner organizations – American Rainwater Catchment Systems Association, Greywater Action, and Watershed Management Group – offer occasional, intensive trainings in their specialty areas. These courses are designed to facilitate intensive learning over a short period of time, and are best suited to workers who can take a block of days off from work. Water LA, operating on a community college semester timetable, will appeal to local workers whose schedules don’t allow them to access courses structured in this manner. Water LA’s program will include a significant apprenticeship component, offering a greater depth of guided learning than our partner organizations’ existing programs. \r\n\r\nThe Water LA Training program will offer classes in a wide range of water and climate resilient retrofits. Most existing courses are specialized, focusing on a single technique. Offering all the courses in the framework of a comprehensive, integrated program within a single institution, differentiates the program from the others, allowing our partners to continue to target workers focused on developing a single area of expertise."
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "Our partners include many of the City agencies, NGOs, and green businesses that collaborated with us throughout the development of the Water LA pilot program. That program retrofit three-dozen homes with urban acupuncture, and through an iterative stakeholder process, developed standard plans and guidance for a suite of affordable strategies for homeowners. These plans and guides are slated for formal adoption by the City of Los Angeles at the end of 2015.\r\n\r\nSeveral of these partners will continue to collaborate with us over the next three years on the Water LA Phase 2 project, where we will retrofit 100 homes and install 1,000 parkway basins in disadvantaged and climate vulnerable communities in the San Fernando Valley.\r\n\r\nOur relationship with LA Trade Tech has been developing over the past year through a series of discussions with Community College Trustees, Chancellors, and staff. \r\n\r\nFor the Water LA Training and Certification Program, LADWP, LA Sanitation, LA Building & Safety, and LA Trade Tech will all provide in-kind time and expertise to the program development. \r\n\r\nThe River Project will provide project management, facilitate coordination among partners, participate in curriculum development and training the trainers across all strategies, and receive $33,000. Watershed Management Group will participate in curriculum development for site assessment, rain tanks and rain grading/rain gardens, facilitate overall program integration, lead the “train the trainers” effort, and receive $27,000. The American Rainwater Catchment Systems Association, Greywater Action, La Loma Development and Theodore Payne Foundation will participate in curriculum development and training for their respective specialities, and receive $10,000 each."
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': "We anticipate that integrating and adapting existing materials, development of a comprehensive, bi-lingual curricula, delivery of a successful “train-the-trainers” course, and technical support for instructors over the first program year will cost approximately $150,000.  \r\n\r\nWe are currently working with LADWP and LASAN on developing a “blue-green academy” to train city workers in water-related green infrastructure design and maintenance. This program is complementary to ours, and we are in discussion with them about providing additional support to the Water LA Training and Certification Program."
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Task Budget:\r\n\r\nCurriculum Development:                        $60,000 \t\r\nTrain the Trainers course:\t\t\t    $15,000\t\r\nProject Management & Coordination:    $25,000\t\r\n"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "Throughout the program development, we will be working closely with the Trustees and Chancellors of the LA Community College District to lay the groundwork for a plan to scale the program up to be offered at the other Community Colleges throughout the region: Mission, Valley, Pierce, City, East, West, Southwest and Harbor.  \r\n\r\nAs Angelenos interest in adopting urban acupuncture strategies grows, students in the first three years of classes will have opportunities to serve requisite field apprenticeships with Water LA small business partners, and with our NGO partners as we retrofit 100 more homes and 1,000 parkway basins through the Water LA Phase 2 pilot.\r\n\r\nOur ultimate aim is to design a curriculum that can be transferred to colleges throughout the California Community College System and ultimately, the west."
