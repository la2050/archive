  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "South Bay Contemporary (SBC), a non-profit arts organization dedicated to building the arts in the South Bay area of Los Angeles, has a 10 year track record of putting on great exhibitions and related classes. SBC is now developing membership and community programs, and seeks to bridge cultural and generational divides through arts education.\r\n\r\nSBC will use this grant to provide a high quality, multi-generational arts experience for children, families and seniors throughout the South Bay. Arts and creativity is a critical part of human development, enabling children and adolescents to mature into functional, productive adults that are able to think creatively and solve problems. Tragically, arts programs have been drastically cut from many school curriculums, and low-income families are disproportionally affected due to limited low- or no-cost arts activities. For seniors, the process of observing and making art offers a wide range of health benefits and enhances imagination and creativity, helping them to realize their unique, unlived potential; but unfortunately there is a lack of high-quality art programs available to low-income seniors.\r\n\r\nSBC plans to build a 3,000 sq ft exhibition and learning space at CRAFTED at the Port of Los Angeles, a vibrant 26,000 sq. ft. arts and crafts marketplace on the LA Waterfront in San Pedro, featuring the work of more than 50 resident artists and craftspeople. The market provides an opportunity for a culturally, geographically and creatively diverse population of artists to share and sell their work with the public.\r\n\r\nSBC plans to further that mission and help realize the vision of CRAFTED as a creative campus on the LA Waterfront. SBC’s goal for collaborating with CRAFTED is to join with an established creative community to offer a unique arts education program.\r\n\r\nPrograms offered in the new exhibition/education space will have two components: thought-provoking exhibitions focused on environmental sustainability and storytelling; and hands-on intergenerational arts workshops led by major Los Angeles artists. SBC already has commitments from Tracy Weiss, who is well known for her work with recycled plastics (http://www.zhibit.org/traceyweiss); Hyung Mo Lee, Dawn Ertl (http://dawnertl.tumblr.com) and found object artist and SBC co-founder Ben Zask. We will offer a minimum of 6 major exhibitions and a series of workshops, complemented by a regular program of activities led by SBC staff and artists.\r\n"

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "The LA Waterfront is owned by the City of Los Angeles, and managed by its Board of Harbor Commissioners and the Harbor Department - the Port of Los Angeles.  Our shared overarching mission is to connect Angelenos to their waterfront.  However, due to its geographically remote location at the southernmost tip of LA at the end of a narrow corridor of land formed along the 110 freeway, many LA Waterfront destinations (including CRAFTED) struggle to bring a critical mass of visitors to their locations. For that reason, we will work with and through our partners to and organize our offering as part of their program of service, and make it available to an existing audience.  \r\n\r\nWe plan to focus on the South Bay, and we will partner with Anderson Senior Centers (a program of City of LA Parks and Rec), Boys and Girls Clubs in the South Bay and the Harbor Community Benefit Foundation to reach our target audiences.  SBC has existing partnerships with these organizations."
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "We estimate that in this one-year pilot program, we can provide half-day, intensive arts workshops led by a working artist for 960 children and seniors, and expose approximately 180,000 individuals and families to the SBC special exhibitions and smaller-scale arts activities at CRAFTED.  We will know that we are successful if we are able to provide our program to our anticipated numbers; and if we are able to assist LA2050 in its goal of increasing the number of households in LA that have participated in the arts through engagement with an arts/cultural institution.\r\n\r\nThrough this program, SBC will create mentorship opportunities for young interns and volunteers to develop leadership skills.  This program should create six paid internship opportunities and help these young adults become permanently employed in the arts. \r\n\r\nWe will also evaluate our work based on number of new SBC memberships, grant awards and donation contributions, sales of art objects and increased visitors. "
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "Angels Gate Cultural Center is also located in San Pedro and is run by the City of Los Angeles, Parks and Recreation Dept.  Located near Pt Fermin, the property was formerly an Army barracks and is there are 52 artist studios an art gallery and various educational spaces.\r\n\r\nAGCC is in a beautiful, naturalistic setting, and does great work curating exhibits and working in schools. They have a waiting list for their studios and are in a less accessible location from the rest of the city of San Pedro and the harbor.  We feel that there is a need for both locations and they appeal in different ways.\r\n\r\nWhile many organizations share our concern about cuts in arts education, and many are working to restore some form of arts education in LA neighborhoods, we believe that this will be the only non-profit arts education program that intends to provide an intergenerational experience, offering the opportunity for rich dialogue, human connection and storytelling.  We feel that this project supports LA 2050 Connect metrics, in a unique way not only by providing a cultural experience, but also social and emotional support for seniors through the opportunity to connect with each other and youth.\r\n"
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "SBC will partner with CRAFTED to secure the space at a reduced rate that’s affordable for SBC under the terms of the grant.  CRAFTED will receive $20,000 of the grant in rent for the space.  Because the SBC facility will locate within CRAFTED’s existing space, the cost of build out is minimal.\r\n\r\nAnderson Senior Center, located a few miles from CRAFTED is currently in transition.  They have a new director and in the process of brainstorming ways to bring new activities and programs to the center.  \r\n\r\nAbout Harbor Community Benefit Foundation  Harbor Community Benefit foundation supports programs that have a positive effect on the environment of the harbor communities.  In the past, they have supported our focus on projects that address the environment and bring in art exhibitions and workshops that promote sustainability.\r\n\r\nAbout Boys and Girls Club of Wilmington and San Pedro   The Boys and Girls Club of San Pedro has a history of growing support from the community and have a well developed Arts Academy as well as support for academics.  They actively take children to cultural destinations for  enrichment and the workshops at CRAFTED will add to their nearby options . \r\n\r\nthese organizations will benefit from our programming as indicated by the services we are planning.  See budget"
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': We do not anticipate this project to cost more than the existing budget.
