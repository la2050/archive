title: '#FeedtheDolphins'
project_summary: >-
  Tiny Rebellion will use the $100,000 dollar grant to create a campaign around
  four unrecognized dolphin statues located in the Santa Monica area that serve
  as donation points for the cities homeless service agencies. The
  #FeedtheDolphins campaign will include lead up promotions to a one-day
  experiential event that will raise awareness for the existing donation

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "In an effort to create positive change in the local community, Tiny Rebellion devoted a summer to solving the homeless problem in Santa Monica. After conducting research on both the Santa Monica resident and homeless population, the agency realized a connection needed to be made between the local community and vagrant society. \r\n\r\nCity data states downtown Santa Monica attracts 40,000 visitors a day, many of whom come for the purpose of shopping. On average, locals spend $43 dollars per trip, which if you take just a quarter of the daily visitors, still adds up to $430,000 dollars spent per day. \r\n\r\nScattered throughout the commercial district of Santa Monica are four dolphin statues built by the city to solicit donations to local homeless service agencies. The installations are large -bronze- structures placed in various social hubs, but while the resources are in place to support this program, the dolphins only bring in $10,000 dollars a year because they are not advertised to the public.\r\n\r\nTiny Rebellion wants to change this. The #FeedtheDolphins campaign will connect the Santa Monica community to an existing city program that empowers residents to fight homelessness in their daily routine. The dolphin statues are a great way to turn shoppers spare change into positive change, but they need an agency behind them to kick-start their success. Tiny Rebellion will put it’s advertising know how to create a one-day experiential event to raise awareness for the dolphin donation statues. \r\n\r\nThe agency will build a large cardboard structure around one dolphin that is animated by LED projections. Brand ambassadors will show curious passerby’s how to donate, and each time a person contributes a digital block will appear showing the price of a basic necessity (toiletries, clean clothes, access to internet, ect.). Over the course of the day these small purchases -donations- will build up like bricks showing how small change can help someone move from homeless to housed. At the end of the event the completed home will contain information on local NGO’s allowing visitors to further connect with homeless service agencies in their area. \r\n\r\nBy advertising an existing program, the #FeedtheDolphins campaign will connect Santa Monica residents to a solution for homelessness shifting the mindset of the community from passive concern to active problem solving.

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    A major challenge will be educating the public on the importance of
    incorporating #FeedtheDolphins into their daily routine. The campaign may
    attract an increase in initial donations, but the program will only become a
    success if the Santa Monica community continues to actively contribute after
    the one-day event. In order to overcome this challenge, Tiny Rebellion will
    position the pop-up installation as an educational experience. Visitors will
    learn about the locations of the dolphins, the local services they support,
    and how their spare change can add up to make a lasting difference. The goal
    of event will be to inspire residents to incorporate #FeedtheDolphins into
    their daily routine. 
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    We understand that metrics are essential to evaluate the success of the
    LA2050 goals. Through communication with the city government, Tiny Rebellion
    found that on average, the dolphin statues bring in $10,000 dollars a year
    for local homeless service agencies. Tiny Rebellion will measure the success
    of the campaign by evaluating how much donations increase from previous
    years. By creating a splash page and social media network around
    #FeedtheDolphins, the agency will also be able to gauge the lasting
    impression of the pop-up installation, and community engagement with
    fighting homelessness.
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    What is unique about our proposed campaign is that currently no one else is
    activating the dolphins, or even bringing attention to them. We have
    identified a system that is already in place, but need funding to let our
    agency discover its real potential. 
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    Tiny Rebellion will work primarily with the city of Santa Monica on the
    #FeedtheDolphins campaign. The majority of the grant will be put towards the
    pop-up installation with the city only receiving payments for event location
    permits. Any remaining money after the event will be used to maintain the
    life of the campaign on all social media channels.
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': "Tiny Rebellion worked with its in-house production team to draft two official budgets for the #FeedtheDolphins campaign. The agency estimates that dependent upon vendor costs, the project will run between $83,325.61 and $99,737.79. Tiny Rebellion has close working relationships with a number of vendors. The agency is confident that it can negotiate a budget within the $100,000 dollar cap. If the grand total does exceed the LA2050 grant, the agency will either cover the difference out of pocket, or shift some of the work internal to reduce the final cost. \r\n\r\n "
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Vendor Hard Cost Budget:\r\n- Cardboard Structure with Internal Frame and Signage: $39,706.88\r\n- Exterior Projections (Static): $4,706.00\r\n- Interior Projection with Motion-Sensor LED Trigger and (1) Color Wash: $8,823.75\r\n- Event Location Permits: $9,412.00\r\n- 24HR Security/Ambassadors (during installation, activation, and dismantle): $6,000.15\r\n- Installation Supervision, Labor, and Equipment: $10,588.50\r\n- Warehouse Handling and Transportation: $2,117.70\r\n- Travel (assume all-day activation & overnight dismantle): $1,911.81\r\n- Projected Sales Tax: $3,529.50\r\n- Project Management: $12,941.50\r\n- Grand Total: $99,737.79\r\n\r\nThis budget reflects the absolute hard costs from vendors. A second budget, drafted of the same expenses, found that the project would cost $83,325.61, which reflects a more accurate grand total of the campaign. The Immediate pricing from vendors are often much hire than what the agency ends up paying. "
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "To scale the success of the event Tiny Rebellion would take a two pronged approach to not only increase local engagement with #FeedtheDolphins, but also expand the program to other areas of Los Angeles. In conjunction with the city, Tiny Rebellion would tap into the thriving art community in Santa Monica to host competitions for local artists to decorate the four dolphins. Similar to how other cities have iconic animal statues, such as the Chicago cows, the Santa Monica dolphins would become celebrated icons of the West Side community. The agency would also work with the city to update the statue plaques to provide more information on the donation programs, and the #FeedtheDolphins campaign. \r\n\tAfter the initial success of the #FeedtheDolphins campaign in Santa Monica, Tiny Rebellion would like to expand the program across greater Los Angeles. The agency would use this campaign as a case study to partner with other city governments and business hubs to build donation statues in other commercial areas. By giving neighborhoods across the city ‘dolphins’ of their own, the #FeedtheDolphins campaign will not only bring together the West Side community, but has the potential to connect all of Los Angeles to the homeless situation. \r\n"
