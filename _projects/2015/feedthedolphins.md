  four unrecognized dolphin statues located in the Santa Monica area that serve
  as donation points for the cities homeless service agencies. The
  #FeedtheDolphins campaign will include lead up promotions to a one-day

'In one sentence, please describe what your organization does': >-
  Tiny Rebellion is a Santa Monica-based agency that exists to accelerate
  business as the most powerful force for positive change; we believe that
  brands have not only the opportunity, but also the obligation to make the
  world a better place to live.  
Where will you be working?:
  - Westside
How do you plan to use these resources to make change?:
  - Engage residents and stakeholders
  - Expand a pilot or a program
  - Mobilize for systems change
How will your proposal improve the following “Connect” metrics?:
  - Rates of volunteerism
  - Adults getting sufficient social & emotional support
  - Participation in neighborhood councils
  - Percentage of Angelenos that volunteer informally (Dream Metric)
  - Government responsiveness to residents’ needs (Dream Metric)
  - Attendance at public/open streets gatherings (Dream Metric)
Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "In an effort to create positive change in the local community, Tiny Rebellion devoted a summer to solving the homeless problem in Santa Monica. After conducting research on both the Santa Monica resident and homeless population, the agency realized a connection needed to be made between the local community and vagrant society. \r\n\r\nCity data states downtown Santa Monica attracts 40,000 visitors a day, many of whom come for the purpose of shopping. On average, locals spend $43 dollars per trip, which if you take just a quarter of the daily visitors, still adds up to $430,000 dollars spent per day. \r\n\r\nScattered throughout the commercial district of Santa Monica are four dolphin statues built by the city to solicit donations to local homeless service agencies. The installations are large -bronze- structures placed in various social hubs, but while the resources are in place to support this program, the dolphins only bring in $10,000 dollars a year because they are not advertised to the public.\r\n\r\nTiny Rebellion wants to change this. The #FeedtheDolphins campaign will connect the Santa Monica community to an existing city program that empowers residents to fight homelessness in their daily routine. The dolphin statues are a great way to turn shoppers spare change into positive change, but they need an agency behind them to kick-start their success. Tiny Rebellion will put it’s advertising know how to create a one-day experiential event to raise awareness for the dolphin donation statues. \r\n\r\nThe agency will build a large cardboard structure around one dolphin that is animated by LED projections. Brand ambassadors will show curious passerby’s how to donate, and each time a person contributes a digital block will appear showing the price of a basic necessity (toiletries, clean clothes, access to internet, ect.). Over the course of the day these small purchases -donations- will build up like bricks showing how small change can help someone move from homeless to housed. At the end of the event the completed home will contain information on local NGO’s allowing visitors to further connect with homeless service agencies in their area. \r\n\r\nBy advertising an existing program, the #FeedtheDolphins campaign will connect Santa Monica residents to a solution for homelessness shifting the mindset of the community from passive concern to active problem solving. "
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We understand that metrics are essential to evaluate the success of the LA2050
  goals. Through communication with the city government, Tiny Rebellion found
  that on average, the dolphin statues bring in $10,000 dollars a year for local
  homeless service agencies. Tiny Rebellion will measure the success of the
  campaign by evaluating how much donations increase from previous years. By
  creating a splash page and social media network around #FeedtheDolphins, the
  agency will also be able to gauge the lasting impression of the pop-up
  installation, and community engagement with fighting homelessness.
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
  - Money (financial capital)
  - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
  - Community outreach
  - Network/relationship support
