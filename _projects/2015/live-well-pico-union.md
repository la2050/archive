'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Clinica Romero's Healthy Pico Union project would aim to provide comprehensive
  services including medical, mental health, health education, nutrition, and
  exercise classes to underserved individuals living in the Pico Union
  neighborhood of Los Angeles as a means of combating chronic health issues such
  as obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. 
   
   Currently, individuals who access services at our clinic have the ability to see a medical provider and enroll themselves in a healthy living counseling group that focuses on the connection between physical and emotional health. Participants in the group learn how emotional issues and pain can negatively impact physical health, such as depression decreasing energy levels, motivation and disrupting sleep. We also look at how often individuals engage in unhealthy physical practices trying to treat emotional pain, such as overeating or eating unhealthy foods that provide short-term comfort. Another example might be subconsciously gaining and maintaining obesity as a way of hiding from relationships due to past trauma. The group will learn and practice healthy eating, exercise, and the accountability and motivation we can get from healthy relationships.
   
   Unfortunately for our group participants, the Pico Union area lacks safe, green space where individuals and their families can regularly work out in order to stay healthy. An additional barrier that prevents local families from regularly exercising is exposure to violence due to gang activity at local parks during evening hours (when families are most likely to have the time to engage in these activities). 
   
   Through bringing exercise equipment to our Pico Union clinic site located at 123 S. Alvarado St., we will provide a space where families can safely engage in healthy practices that will improve their overall health. We plan to purchase outdoor exercise equipment that will withstand various weather conditions. Families will be able to access equipment during our regular hours that include extended evening hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Challenges with this project would be to have people consistently use the
  equipment and develop a healthier lifestyle for themselves and their families.
  Overcoming this will take a designated community health advocate to ensure
  patients and communities participate in the healthy living program. The
  community health advocate will identify community and patients, be their
  motivator during designated times, and follow up on progress and interest
  levels.

Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: No.
