project_summary: >-
  Clinica Romero is a community health clinic dedicated to improve the health
  and lives of patients and community at large that proposes a holistic approach
  to healthier lifestyles. 
Please specify below: Clinica Romero Pico Union Clinic Site
category: live
'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Clinica Romero's Healthy Pico Union project would aim to provide comprehensive
  services including medical, mental health, health education, nutrition, and
  exercise classes to underserved individuals living in the Pico Union
  neighborhood of Los Angeles as a means of combating chronic health issues such
  as obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. 
   
   Currently, individuals who access services at our clinic have the ability to see a medical provider and enroll themselves in a healthy living counseling group that focuses on the connection between physical and emotional health. Participants in the group learn how emotional issues and pain can negatively impact physical health, such as depression decreasing energy levels, motivation and disrupting sleep. We also look at how often individuals engage in unhealthy physical practices trying to treat emotional pain, such as overeating or eating unhealthy foods that provide short-term comfort. Another example might be subconsciously gaining and maintaining obesity as a way of hiding from relationships due to past trauma. The group will learn and practice healthy eating, exercise, and the accountability and motivation we can get from healthy relationships.
   
   Unfortunately for our group participants, the Pico Union area lacks safe, green space where individuals and their families can regularly work out in order to stay healthy. An additional barrier that prevents local families from regularly exercising is exposure to violence due to gang activity at local parks during evening hours (when families are most likely to have the time to engage in these activities). 
   
   Through bringing exercise equipment to our Pico Union clinic site located at 123 S. Alvarado St., we will provide a space where families can safely engage in healthy practices that will improve their overall health. We plan to purchase outdoor exercise equipment that will withstand various weather conditions. Families will be able to access equipment during our regular hours that include extended evening hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Challenges with this project would be to have people consistently use the
  equipment and develop a healthier lifestyle for themselves and their families.
  Overcoming this will take a designated community health advocate to ensure
  patients and communities participate in the healthy living program. The
  community health advocate will identify community and patients, be their
  motivator during designated times, and follow up on progress and interest
  levels.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: |-
  Clinica Romero will 
   
   -Install a minimum of 5 outdoor exercise stations 
   -Provide nutrition classes to the local community
   -Engage in counseling to find the root causes of chronic obesity and diabetes
   -Publicize availability of workshops and exercise space 
   -Maintain social media presence.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: No.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Each of these partners would assist in referring community members to our
  healthy living program:
   
   Accion Westlake $10,0000
   Inquilinos Unidos $10,000
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': 'Enhancing our Healthy Living Group will not exceed $100,000.'
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  Exercise Equipment, installation & insurance: $30,000
   Partners: $20,000
   Nutritionist: $15,000
   Community Health Advocate: $15,000
   Marketing/promotional: $20,000
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Clinica Romero will continue to engage local community partners to bring
  community awareness to the exercise equipment, healthy living classes and
  medical services provided at our Pico Union site.

      Challenges with this project would be to have people consistently use the
      equipment and develop a healthier lifestyle for themselves and their
      families. Overcoming this will take a designated community health advocate
      to ensure patients and communities participate in the healthy living
      program. The community health advocate will identify community and
      patients, be their motivator during designated times, and follow up on
      progress and interest levels.
