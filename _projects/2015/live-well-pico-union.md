  'DESCRIBE IN GREATER DETAIL HOW YOU WILL MAKE LA THE HEALTHIEST PLACE TO LIVE: ': "Clinica Romero's Healthy Pico Union project would aim to provide comprehensive services including medical, mental health, health education, nutrition, and exercise classes to underserved individuals living in the Pico Union neighborhood of Los Angeles as a means of combating chronic health issues such as obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. \r\n\r\nCurrently, individuals who access services at our clinic have the ability to see a medical provider and enroll themselves in a healthy living counseling group that focuses on the connection between physical and emotional health. Participants in the  group learn how emotional issues and pain can negatively impact physical health, such as depression decreasing energy levels, motivation and disrupting sleep. We also look at how often individuals engage in unhealthy physical practices trying to treat emotional pain, such as overeating or eating unhealthy foods that provide short-term comfort. Another example might be subconsciously gaining and maintaining obesity as a way of hiding from relationships due to past trauma. The group will learn and practice healthy eating, exercise, and the accountability and motivation we can get from healthy relationships.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for our group participants, the Pico Union area lacks safe, green space where individuals and their families can regularly work out in order to stay healthy. An additional barrier that prevents local families from regularly exercising is exposure to violence due to gang activity at local parks during evening hours (when families are most likely to have the time to engage in these activities). \r\n\r\nThrough bringing exercise equipment to our Pico Union clinic site located at 123 S. Alvarado St., we will provide a space where families can safely engage in healthy practices that will improve their overall health. We plan to purchase outdoor exercise equipment that will withstand various weather conditions. Families will be able to access equipment during our regular hours that include extended evening hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays. "

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    Challenges with this project would be to have people consistently use the
    equipment and develop a healthier lifestyle for themselves and their
    families. Overcoming this will take a designated community health advocate
    to ensure patients and communities participate in the healthy living
    program. The community health advocate will identify community and patients,
    be their motivator during designated times, and follow up on progress and
    interest levels.
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Clinica Romero will \r\n\r\n-Install a minimum of 5 outdoor exercise stations \r\n-Provide nutrition classes to the local community\r\n-Engage in counseling to find the root causes of chronic obesity and diabetes\r\n-Publicize availability of workshops and exercise space \r\n-Maintain social media presence.
