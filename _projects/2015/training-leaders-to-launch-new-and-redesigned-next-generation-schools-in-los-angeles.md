project_summary: >-
  Reframe engages frontline educators in collaborative school design, rethinking
  the factory school model in favor of designs that personalize learning for
  students. Our programs include: free, monthly workshops across LA; deeper
  2-day bootcamps; a 6-month Redesign program open to any existing school
  (public, charter, private); and a prestigious 1-year Next Gen Fellowship for
  leaders who want to launch innovative new schools. Reframe will help LA become
  the next hub for K-12 education innovation.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  The technology revolution in education is accelerating. Despite LAUSD's iPad
  rollout challenges, the silver lining is that there is now a hyper-awareness
  that education technology is a tool that needs to be complemented by clear
  instructional plans and more investment in talent. 
   
   Reframe Labs will bring together educators, central office leaders, families, and entrepreneurs to discuss the future of school. We will facilitate professional learning experiences for existing schools that want to implement personalized learning practices, as well as train leaders to design and launch innovative new schools. Specifically, Reframe will emphasize innovation around student ownership, use of real-time data, competency-based progression, learning time, staffing, academic content, and physical space. By building a true community of practice, we believe these innovative new schools will lead to higher student academic proficiency and growth, and higher through-college graduation rates (building on early research by RAND as well as other national proof points). Reframe's focus on community-building and talent development will help make Los Angeles the best place to learn as it becomes the next hub for K-12 education innovation.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Reframe Labs will focus on talent development, with the ultimate goal to
  prepare those leaders to launch new and redesigned schools. When it comes to
  K-12 education, however, Los Angeles is the most politically-complex urban
  district in the nation. With a school board looking to stabilize a district
  still looking for a permanent superintendent, there is a risk that the board
  may object to and block the launch of new schools. For leaders looking to
  create new charter schools, this would mean denial of charter authorization
  from the district, and lead to an appeals process with the L.A. County Board
  of Education and, if necessary, the California Department of Education. While
  there may still be a pathway for the launch of charter schools through these
  appeals, Reframe would increase its work with existing schools seeking to
  redesign their instructional models. Our strategy would then deemphasize new
  schools and instead focus on redesigns.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  As a talent development pipeline, Reframe will count the number of attendees
  that graduate from our different programs and use surveys to evaluate our
  impact. We will also count the number of new and redesigned schools that
  emerge from our programs. For those leaders who ultimately go through our
  Redesign and Next Gen Fellowship programs (we aim to be one of the Top 3
  professional learning experiences attendees will have ever encountered), we
  will measure the schools' impact on student learning, from both proficiency
  and growth perspectives, as measured by state tests (using API, which we
  believe will be replaced soon with another state measure).
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There is no other organization training leaders to design and launch next
  generation school models in Los Angeles. In other cities across the countries,
  there are organizations that fund innovative new schools but do not run talent
  development programs (i.e.: NewSchools Venture Fund, Silicon School Fund, Next
  Generation Learning Challenges, and Charter School Growth Fund). There are
  also some organizations starting to focus on innovative teacher training
  (i.e.: BetterLesson, Relay, Highlander Institute FUSE, and CityBridge) and
  these are highly complementary and of course needed. Building Excellent
  Schools (BES) is a respected organization that trains new principals; in many
  ways, Reframe Labs will be a BES 2.0, training new leaders with an emphasis on
  new learning practices. 
   
   While Reframe will work with anybody who wants to discuss the future of school, our biggest investments will be on school leaders because they have the most control over instructional decisions at school sites. The Reframe talent development model is designed to be a funnel for surfacing the coalition of the willing--district, charter, or private--and investing more into those who show promise for advancing new and redesigned schools.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Reframe is fortunate to have connections with virtually every other
  organization nationally focused on next gen learning. When it comes to
  Reframe's programming in Los Angeles, however, 100% of this grant award will
  be used internally. None of it will be used to subcontract other partners.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': |-
  Overhead cost (3 FTEs and operations) is approximately $600,000/year.
   
   Our Programming has four levels: Discover (one day workshops), Spark (two-day bootcamps), Redesign (six-month program), and Next Gen Fellowship (1-year fellowship). Programming costs are variable based on the number of participants. Our Year 1 forecast for each program, respectively: 600, 360, 50, 5. With these assumptions, our Year 1 program costs will be $1,024,500. 
   
   We anticipate covering the additional cost via philanthropy and are in conversations with other funders. We will also explore making certain components fee-for-service. 
   
   A grant from LA2050 and the publicity that will accompany it will not only help launch Reframe's talent development programs but catalyze other funders as well.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
  A $100,000 grant from LA2050 will go towards hiring one full-time partner who
  can help shape and facilitate our design programs with educators. This person
  will ideally be a teacher turned instructional lead and principal, who also
  has had some consulting experience.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Reframe will make all proprietary content freely accessible to all.
  Unfortunately, we know from experience that even the best (and priciest)
  research, white papers, and strategic plans ultimately lie on a shelf
  collecting dust. What brings those findings to life for the masses are direct
  coaching experiences. Reframe will engage educators in collaborative school
  design, applying the latest research and practices. 
   
   As a member of LAUSD's Instructional Technology Initiative (I'm one of five expert resources for the Task Force), I will ensure that Reframe's professional learning opportunities are open to all interested throughout the district. 
   
   I will also diffuse lessons learned through my national network, providing a blueprint for next gen talent development to other regional organizations.

  - name: Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "The technology revolution in education is accelerating. Despite LAUSD's iPad rollout challenges, the silver lining is that there is now a hyper-awareness that education technology is a tool that needs to be complemented by clear instructional plans and more investment in talent. \r\n\r\nReframe Labs will bring together educators, central office leaders, families, and entrepreneurs to discuss the future of school. We will facilitate professional learning experiences for existing schools that want to implement personalized learning practices, as well as train leaders to design and launch innovative new schools. Specifically, Reframe will emphasize innovation around student ownership, use of real-time data, competency-based progression, learning time, staffing, academic content, and physical space. By building a true community of practice, we believe these innovative new schools will lead to higher student academic proficiency and growth, and higher through-college graduation rates (building on early research by RAND as well as other national proof points). Reframe's focus on community-building and talent development will help make Los Angeles the best place to learn as it becomes the next hub for K-12 education innovation.\r\n"

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      Reframe Labs will focus on talent development, with the ultimate goal to
      prepare those leaders to launch new and redesigned schools. When it comes
      to K-12 education, however, Los Angeles is the most politically-complex
      urban district in the nation. With a school board looking to stabilize a
      district still looking for a permanent superintendent, there is a risk
      that the board may object to and block the launch of new schools. For
      leaders looking to create new charter schools, this would mean denial of
      charter authorization from the district, and lead to an appeals process
      with the L.A. County Board of Education and, if necessary, the California
      Department of Education. While there may still be a pathway for the launch
      of charter schools through these appeals, Reframe would increase its work
      with existing schools seeking to redesign their instructional models. Our
      strategy would then deemphasize new schools and instead focus on
      redesigns.

    answer: >-
      As a talent development pipeline, Reframe will count the number of
      attendees that graduate from our different programs and use surveys to
      evaluate our impact. We will also count the number of new and redesigned
      schools that emerge from our programs. For those leaders who ultimately go
      through our Redesign and Next Gen Fellowship programs (we aim to be one of
      the Top 3 professional learning experiences attendees will have ever
      encountered), we will measure the schools' impact on student learning,
      from both proficiency and growth perspectives, as measured by state tests
      (using API, which we believe will be replaced soon with another state
      measure).

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "There is no other organization training leaders to design and launch next generation school models in Los Angeles. In other cities across the countries, there are organizations that fund innovative new schools but do not run talent development programs (i.e.: NewSchools Venture Fund, Silicon School Fund, Next Generation Learning Challenges, and Charter School Growth Fund). There are also some organizations starting to focus on innovative teacher training (i.e.: BetterLesson, Relay, Highlander Institute FUSE, and CityBridge) and these are highly complementary and of course needed. Building Excellent Schools (BES) is a respected organization that trains new principals; in many ways, Reframe Labs will be a BES 2.0, training new leaders with an emphasis on new learning practices. \r\n\r\nWhile Reframe will work with anybody who wants to discuss the future of school, our biggest investments will be on school leaders because they have the most control over instructional decisions at school sites. The Reframe talent development model is designed to be a funnel for surfacing the coalition of the willing--district, charter, or private--and investing more into those who show promise for advancing new and redesigned schools. \r\n\r\n"

    answer: >-
      Reframe is fortunate to have connections with virtually every other
      organization nationally focused on next gen learning. When it comes to
      Reframe's programming in Los Angeles, however, 100% of this grant award
      will be used internally. None of it will be used to subcontract other
      partners.

      How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you
      cover the additional costs?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Overhead cost (3 FTEs and operations) is approximately $600,000/year.\r\n\r\nOur Programming has four levels: Discover (one day workshops), Spark (two-day bootcamps), Redesign (six-month program), and Next Gen Fellowship (1-year fellowship). Programming costs are variable based on the number of participants. Our Year 1 forecast for each program, respectively: 600, 360, 50, 5.  With these assumptions, our Year 1 program costs will be $1,024,500. \r\n\r\nWe anticipate covering the additional cost via philanthropy and are in conversations with other funders. We will also explore making certain components fee-for-service. \r\n\r\nA grant from LA2050 and the publicity that will accompany it will not only help launch Reframe's talent development programs but catalyze other funders as well."

    answer: "Reframe will make all proprietary content freely accessible to all. Unfortunately, we know from experience that even the best (and priciest) research, white papers, and strategic plans ultimately lie on a shelf collecting dust. What brings those findings to life for the masses are direct coaching experiences. Reframe will engage educators in collaborative school design, applying the latest research and practices. \r\n\r\nAs a member of LAUSD's Instructional Technology Initiative (I'm one of five expert resources for the Task Force), I will ensure that Reframe's professional learning opportunities are open to all interested throughout the district. \r\n\r\nI will also diffuse lessons learned through my national network, providing a blueprint for next gen talent development to other regional organizations. \r\n\r\n"
