  Training leaders to launch new and redesigned next generation schools in Los
  Angeles
project_summary: >-
  Reframe engages frontline educators in collaborative school design, rethinking
  the factory school model in favor of designs that personalize learning for
  students. Our programs include: free, monthly workshops across LA; deeper
  2-day bootcamps; a 6-month Redesign program open to any existing school
  (public, charter, private); and a prestigious 1-year Next Gen Fellowship for
  leaders who want to launch innovative new schools. Reframe will help LA become
  the next hub for K-12 education innovation.

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "The technology revolution in education is accelerating. Despite LAUSD's iPad rollout challenges, the silver lining is that there is now a hyper-awareness that education technology is a tool that needs to be complemented by clear instructional plans and more investment in talent. \r\n\r\nReframe Labs will bring together educators, central office leaders, families, and entrepreneurs to discuss the future of school. We will facilitate professional learning experiences for existing schools that want to implement personalized learning practices, as well as train leaders to design and launch innovative new schools. Specifically, Reframe will emphasize innovation around student ownership, use of real-time data, competency-based progression, learning time, staffing, academic content, and physical space. By building a true community of practice, we believe these innovative new schools will lead to higher student academic proficiency and growth, and higher through-college graduation rates (building on early research by RAND as well as other national proof points). Reframe's focus on community-building and talent development will help make Los Angeles the best place to learn as it becomes the next hub for K-12 education innovation.\r\n"

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    Reframe Labs will focus on talent development, with the ultimate goal to
    prepare those leaders to launch new and redesigned schools. When it comes to
    K-12 education, however, Los Angeles is the most politically-complex urban
    district in the nation. With a school board looking to stabilize a district
    still looking for a permanent superintendent, there is a risk that the board
    may object to and block the launch of new schools. For leaders looking to
    create new charter schools, this would mean denial of charter authorization
    from the district, and lead to an appeals process with the L.A. County Board
    of Education and, if necessary, the California Department of Education.
    While there may still be a pathway for the launch of charter schools through
    these appeals, Reframe would increase its work with existing schools seeking
    to redesign their instructional models. Our strategy would then deemphasize
    new schools and instead focus on redesigns.
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    As a talent development pipeline, Reframe will count the number of attendees
    that graduate from our different programs and use surveys to evaluate our
    impact. We will also count the number of new and redesigned schools that
    emerge from our programs. For those leaders who ultimately go through our
    Redesign and Next Gen Fellowship programs (we aim to be one of the Top 3
    professional learning experiences attendees will have ever encountered), we
    will measure the schools' impact on student learning, from both proficiency
    and growth perspectives, as measured by state tests (using API, which we
    believe will be replaced soon with another state measure). 
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "There is no other organization training leaders to design and launch next generation school models in Los Angeles. In other cities across the countries, there are organizations that fund innovative new schools but do not run talent development programs (i.e.: NewSchools Venture Fund, Silicon School Fund, Next Generation Learning Challenges, and Charter School Growth Fund). There are also some organizations starting to focus on innovative teacher training (i.e.: BetterLesson, Relay, Highlander Institute FUSE, and CityBridge) and these are highly complementary and of course needed. Building Excellent Schools (BES) is a respected organization that trains new principals; in many ways, Reframe Labs will be a BES 2.0, training new leaders with an emphasis on new learning practices. \r\n\r\nWhile Reframe will work with anybody who wants to discuss the future of school, our biggest investments will be on school leaders because they have the most control over instructional decisions at school sites. The Reframe talent development model is designed to be a funnel for surfacing the coalition of the willing--district, charter, or private--and investing more into those who show promise for advancing new and redesigned schools. \r\n\r\n"
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    Reframe is fortunate to have connections with virtually every other
    organization nationally focused on next gen learning. When it comes to
    Reframe's programming in Los Angeles, however, 100% of this grant award will
    be used internally. None of it will be used to subcontract other partners. 
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "Reframe will make all proprietary content freely accessible to all. Unfortunately, we know from experience that even the best (and priciest) research, white papers, and strategic plans ultimately lie on a shelf collecting dust. What brings those findings to life for the masses are direct coaching experiences. Reframe will engage educators in collaborative school design, applying the latest research and practices. \r\n\r\nAs a member of LAUSD's Instructional Technology Initiative (I'm one of five expert resources for the Task Force), I will ensure that Reframe's professional learning opportunities are open to all interested throughout the district. \r\n\r\nI will also diffuse lessons learned through my national network, providing a blueprint for next gen talent development to other regional organizations. \r\n\r\n"
