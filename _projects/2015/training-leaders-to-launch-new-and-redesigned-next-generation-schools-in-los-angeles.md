Where will you be working?:
  - County of Los Angeles
  - City of Los Angeles
  - LAUSD
How do you plan to use these resources to make change?:
  - Engage residents and stakeholders
  - Implement a pilot or new project
How will your proposal improve the following “Learn” metrics?:
  - District-wide graduation rates
  - HS student proficiency in English & Language Arts and Math
  - Academic Performance Index* scores
  - College matriculation rates
Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "The technology revolution in education is accelerating. Despite LAUSD's iPad rollout challenges, the silver lining is that there is now a hyper-awareness that education technology is a tool that needs to be complemented by clear instructional plans and more investment in talent. \r\n\r\nReframe Labs will bring together educators, central office leaders, families, and entrepreneurs to discuss the future of school. We will facilitate professional learning experiences for existing schools that want to implement personalized learning practices, as well as train leaders to design and launch innovative new schools. Specifically, Reframe will emphasize innovation around student ownership, use of real-time data, competency-based progression, learning time, staffing, academic content, and physical space. By building a true community of practice, we believe these innovative new schools will lead to higher student academic proficiency and growth, and higher through-college graduation rates (building on early research by RAND as well as other national proof points). Reframe's focus on community-building and talent development will help make Los Angeles the best place to learn as it becomes the next hub for K-12 education innovation.\r\n"
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  As a talent development pipeline, Reframe will count the number of attendees
  that graduate from our different programs and use surveys to evaluate our
  impact. We will also count the number of new and redesigned schools that
  emerge from our programs. For those leaders who ultimately go through our
  Redesign and Next Gen Fellowship programs (we aim to be one of the Top 3
  professional learning experiences attendees will have ever encountered), we
  will measure the schools' impact on student learning, from both proficiency
  and growth perspectives, as measured by state tests (using API, which we
  believe will be replaced soon with another state measure). 
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
  - Money (financial capital)
  - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
  - Network/relationship support
