project_summary: >-
  Let’s create LA LandfillHarmonics inspired by Parqaguay’s LandfillHarmonics.
  LAUSD has among the highest concentration of low-income students in the state,
  with more than 80% living at or below the poverty line. This translates into
  nearly 400 high-poverty campuses where all students automatically qualify for
  subsidized lunches.  There is little room in the school budget for the arts.
  Where is music for these children? We want to teach them to make music out of
  found objects.
Please specify below: 'Parks, community centers and Title 1 Schools in LA County.'

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Our T4T.org traveling Makers Space will be filled with ReImagined Resources!
  The items we carry are being discarded by local manufacturers and would be
  headed for Landfill if we didn’t exist. Having a traveling Makers Space allows
  us to bring Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Math (STEAM) Education
  to communities were this has only been a dream. We will have pop-up Makers
  Space in Parks and School-yards around Los Angeles focusing our efforts in
  neighborhoods with Title 1 Schools with more than 90% free and reduces lunch
  programs. We wont necessarily be doing this on the school yard exclusively it
  will simply be the way we identify the communities on our calendar. We will
  have Saturday and Sunday pop-up Makers Spaces in some of the most unlikely
  spots around town!
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Our obstacle will be obtaining permits and we have already begun a
  relationship with the Public Works Department of LA City. We will reach out to
  them to make sure we are in compliance with the City before we set out. We
  also will need at least two staff at each pop-up event and will need to bring
  on extra staff. We will also be looking for volunteer groups to help with
  these events so there will be plenty of helping hands at each open Makers
  experience around town.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We will conduct pre-then-post surveys with everyone who participates. Parents,
  young inventors, anyone who takes place will be asked to answer a few basic
  questions when they arrive about their level of interest in STEAM activities
  and then they will answer the same questions as they complete their invention.
  These findings will be compared to similar surveys we do in schools that have
  T4T.org inspired project based learning and the combined data will be
  available to schools, press and the educational community at large through
  open access data banks and research servers.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  We have not been able to find anyone doing this in Los Angeles. Our unique
  approach is based on the fact that we use material that would have been headed
  to Landfill! In doing this we inspire environmental stewardship in our next
  generation of inventors and scientists.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  We would be doing this with our current list of manufacturers who supply us
  with material. None of the budget will go to that. The $100,000, should we be
  lucky enough to be awarded the grant, would go toward the vehicle, staff and
  outreach to communities. The material we use will be donated from
  manufacturers who receive a tax receipt as our thank you for their donations.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  At T4T.org we are use to working within a budget. We will buy the truck and
  hire the staff we need to get started. We will rely on volunteers and
  manufacturers donations to make up the difference. We don’t go over budget
  because we don’t have anywhere to draw the money from if we did go over
  budget. We have learned to work within our means.

How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  We see this as a pilot project and with the data collected and successes
  measured we will approach a car company to support more vehicles as well as
  approach foundations to help us staff future vehicles. We will also write a
  guidebook for any other community that is interested in starting a T4T.org
  style traveling Makers Space using ReImagined Resources from their community.

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: "We will offer students with no access to music education a way to engage, to express, and to share their stories through music. We will inspire creative and critical thinking as we undertake the task of learning to create instruments out of waste streams. We will advance the notion of environmental stewardship in a generation of Los Angeles children. And, we will bring the Maestro Favio Chavez or Maestro Szaran from Paraguay to Los Angeles to speak to the group making instruments and inform our approach to creating the Orchestra. \r\nIn doing this we honor the original work of Maestro Favio Chavez and we bring a community of Angelenos to a world of music seemingly out of reach. This Orchestra will perform at local venues, schools, community centers, and parks offering as many communities an opportunity to experience the creativity and joy of the LA LandFillHarmonic’s Youth.\r\nOur Orchestra will reflect the vast cultural and ethnic diversity of Los Angeles in that the group will learn to play some classical music and will be invited to enhance that music with their own cultural interpretation.\r\n"
  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    Our major challenge will be finding the materials and the conductor who can
    help take this idea to completion. The materials will be sourced, as all of
    T4T.org materials are, from manufacturers’ waste stream. We will approach
    those manufacturers who have materials we will need for flutes, violins,
    cellos, and more. We already have relationships with many of the
    organizations we will need for this part of the project. The more
    challenging part will be finding the conductor who can see the vision. In
    order to accommodate this learning curve we will work with the Paraguay
    Orchestra leaders to inform our search and engage with the individuals we
    know in the Hollywood and film industry music world to find the right person
    to fill this role. 
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    The music instructors and the general public who will attend the free
    concerts offered by this Orchestra in the fall of 2016 will evaluate our
    final outcome through feedback forms offered at the concerts. The process
    itself will be evaluated by pre-then-post surveys undertaken by the children
    involved in the making of instruments and the playing of those instruments
    once they are made. 
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    We have tried to locate groups doing this and have found none. We have begun
    a dialogue with Creative Visions (the group producing the film and
    documentary about Paraguay’s LandfillHarmonics) and they told us we are the
    first group or City to suggest an Orchestra in the style and philosophy of
    Maestro Favio Chavez’s Orchestra in Paraguay. They welcomed our efforts and
    offered to support us in whatever way possible.
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    We will be doing this independently and will reserve a portion of the budget
    to pay an honorarium for Maestro Favio Chavez’s expenses to come here and
    meet with our musicians and budding orchestra. This money will be spent in
    Los Angeles on local talent for making the instruments and training the
    orchestra for performances.
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    We at T4T.org have become experts at working within our budgets. We know how
    to bring talent to the table with materials to accomplish what others might
    see as impossible. This challenge excites us and brings the best we have to
    offer in staff and volunteers to this project. We expect to make this happen
    with the $100,000 awarded. The Orchestra will be ready to perform free
    concerts in a year with the assistance of the music community, T4T.org
    staff, and material from the manufacturing community of Los Angeles.

    Harmonic Orchestra of Paraguay and Los Angeles. We will compile a guidebook
    for anyone interested in creating their own Orchestra and we will present
    that guidebook to Maestro Favio Chavez for his use with any group
    approaching him for help in duplicating his efforts in Paraguay.

    answer: "We will offer students with no access to music education a way to engage, to express, and to share their stories through music. We will inspire creative and critical thinking as we undertake the task of learning to create instruments out of waste streams. We will advance the notion of environmental stewardship in a generation of Los Angeles children. And, we will bring the Maestro Favio Chavez or Maestro Szaran from Paraguay to Los Angeles to speak to the group making instruments and inform our approach to creating the Orchestra. \r\nIn doing this we honor the original work of Maestro Favio Chavez and we bring a community of Angelenos to a world of music seemingly out of reach. This Orchestra will perform at local venues, schools, community centers, and parks offering as many communities an opportunity to experience the creativity and joy of the LA LandFillHarmonic’s Youth.\r\nOur Orchestra will reflect the vast cultural and ethnic diversity of Los Angeles in that the group will learn to play some classical music and will be invited to enhance that music with their own cultural interpretation.\r\n"

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      Our major challenge will be finding the materials and the conductor who
      can help take this idea to completion. The materials will be sourced, as
      all of T4T.org materials are, from manufacturers’ waste stream. We will
      approach those manufacturers who have materials we will need for flutes,
      violins, cellos, and more. We already have relationships with many of the
      organizations we will need for this part of the project. The more
      challenging part will be finding the conductor who can see the vision. In
      order to accommodate this learning curve we will work with the Paraguay
      Orchestra leaders to inform our search and engage with the individuals we
      know in the Hollywood and film industry music world to find the right
      person to fill this role.

      The music instructors and the general public who will attend the free
      concerts offered by this Orchestra in the fall of 2016 will evaluate our
      final outcome through feedback forms offered at the concerts. The process
      itself will be evaluated by pre-then-post surveys undertaken by the
      children involved in the making of instruments and the playing of those
      instruments once they are made.

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      We have tried to locate groups doing this and have found none. We have
      begun a dialogue with Creative Visions (the group producing the film and
      documentary about Paraguay’s LandfillHarmonics) and they told us we are
      the first group or City to suggest an Orchestra in the style and
      philosophy of Maestro Favio Chavez’s Orchestra in Paraguay. They welcomed
      our efforts and offered to support us in whatever way possible.

      Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on
      this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner
      receive?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      We will be doing this independently and will reserve a portion of the
      budget to pay an honorarium for Maestro Favio Chavez’s expenses to come
      here and meet with our musicians and budding orchestra. This money will be
      spent in Los Angeles on local talent for making the instruments and
      training the orchestra for performances.

      How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      We at T4T.org have become experts at working within our budgets. We know
      how to bring talent to the table with materials to accomplish what others
      might see as impossible. This challenge excites us and brings the best we
      have to offer in staff and volunteers to this project. We expect to make
      this happen with the $100,000 awarded. The Orchestra will be ready to
      perform free concerts in a year with the assistance of the music
      community, T4T.org staff, and material from the manufacturing community of
      Los Angeles.

      In the years following the establishment of this Orchestra we will engage
      any other county of city interested in following the path of the LandFill
      Harmonic Orchestra of Paraguay and Los Angeles. We will compile a
      guidebook for anyone interested in creating their own Orchestra and we
      will present that guidebook to Maestro Favio Chavez for his use with any
      group approaching him for help in duplicating his efforts in Paraguay.
