title: Creating a Space for the Creative Class
project_summary: >-
  Los Angeles is home to thousands of craft furniture makers that lack access to
  tools, resources, and educational opportunities to grow their businesses.
  These furniture makers grapple with questions about how to best design and
  build a product and get it to market. Off The Saw will create a year-long
  series of discussions to examine how craftsmanship can survive and thrive in
  our city and to create a toolkit for building LA's creative economy.

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: "Los Angeles is the creative capital of the state and the nation. More than 44% of all creative workers in California are located in our city and they contribute $80 billion to our economy directly. Creative occupations often require high levels of education and skills training in a particular discipline; in the case of craft furniture making, the occupation also requires the skill to run and grow a business. The furniture & decorative arts sector is expected to grow 11.5% over the next five years, but we need to give business owners in the craft furniture field the tools that they need to achieve this growth.  \r\n\r\nWe propose to convene leading thinkers in the field for in-depth discussions about the obstacles to craft furniture making and ways to overcome them. Based on these conversations, we will create a small business toolkit for furniture makers. We will draw on experts from furniture production, product design, gallery sales, private collections, marketing, branding, business management, and the media. We will seek input from our community on topics of conversation, but initial ideas include product development, business management, media relations, social media, marketing strategies, client growth and management, sales strategies, and the role of craft in the 21st century. The thoughts and ideas that come out of these conversations will be accessible to our community through white papers, podcasts, and business support resources. \r\n\r\nOur secondary goals are to:\r\n1) Improve and expand workshop offerings for professional furniture makers and the general public to empower the community to create and to elevate the craft of furniture making.\r\n2) Formalize and expand our pilot apprenticeship program to provide training and job placement in order to attract and retain creative talent. \r\n\r\nAchieving these goals will empower individual makers with knowledge and resources, support the creative industry’s infrastructure, and ensure the sustainability and economic power of the crafts in Los Angeles. \r\n"

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "Obstacle: On-going funding. \r\n\r\nBackground: Off The Saw was established as a business venture so that it could be nimble and responsive to changing needs. Yet our profit status is also our challenge. We are mission driven and operate day-to-day more as a non-profit, but as an LLC we don't have access to foundation support and grants.\r\n\r\nStrategies:\r\nSeek corporate sponsorship.\r\nExpand revenue streams.\r\nInvestigate non-profit status and grant funding.\r\n\r\nObstacle: Sustained program participation. \r\n\r\nBackground: Off The Saw relies financially on attendance at workshops and participation in the cooperative shop. There has been tremendous demand for these services, but we need to continually increase participation. \r\n\r\nStrategies:\r\nMaintain communication with past participants and seek their input.\r\nIncrease outreach to the LA community.\r\nImprove use of social media. \r\nBuild partnerships with other LA-based organizations in the arts and crafts.\r\n\r\n"
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "1) Survey the community to identify needs. \r\n2) Based on survey results, form a committee to direct the work.\r\n3) Seek regular input from the committee. \r\n4) Use survey tools before and after each event. \r\n5) Track number of downloads of the business toolkit. \r\n6) Track press hits and share results with our community. "
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "Other organizations doing complementary work are local community colleges and Community Wood Shop LA. Some of these groups host maker talks, but none of them have aimed to create a comprehensive business toolkit geared specifically toward furniture makers. \r\n\r\nOff The Saw’s proposal is unique because we are a collective wood shop for professionals who make their living as furniture makers, and as such, we are intimately familiar with the challenges that these business owners face. Beyond our collective, we have built a community around woodworking by acting as a gathering space and resource for woodworkers in Los Angeles. This knowledge, experience, and community make us the perfect organization to host this speaker series and to build this toolkit. \r\n"
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    Off The Saw will be the sole recipient of the grant money. We believe
    strongly in collaboration and have deep relationships with art and craft
    institutions in the Los Angeles region. We will seek input from and
    partnership with the CSULB Art Department: Wood, Craft in America Center,
    Offerman Wood Shop, LA Box Collective, and other artisan makers to include
    Sidecar Furniture,  Artifact Woodworks, and Riiska Design. 
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "This proposal will create a speaker series and business toolkit. Capturing the thoughts, experiences, and resources shared by our experts in the business toolkit will create a scalable resource that we can share with craft furniture makers throughout Los Angeles, California, and the US. In addition to promoting the resources through our own network, we will work with partner organizations to leverage their networks as well. While the content of the business toolkit will be geared toward craft furniture makers, we fully expect that the salient points can be extrapolated and applied by artists and artisans more generally. \r\n\r\nOur secondary goals are to grow our existing workshop and apprenticeship programs. We would like to formalize a curriculum for both programs that can be shared with other collective wood shops. \r\n\r\nMore generally, interest in collective shops is growing rapidly as a way to leverage resources and create community. We have already shared our ideas and experiences with similar ventures in Austin, Minneapolis, Northern California, and North Carolina. We will continue to share our perspective and offer our curriculum and toolkit as resources for these new ventures. \r\n"
