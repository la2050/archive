title: The Academy Project--Helping Foster Youth THRIVE!!
project_summary: "50% of the 21,000 kids in foster care in LA end up homeless, in gangs, institutionalized or in jail, with 8% having dropped out of school (3 x the statewide rate), due to frequent school changes. Starting in Grade 7, TAP is building a year-round, in-school solution that integrates individual needs & guarantees youth a consistent placement through high school. Within a community of peers, TAP provides a safe place where youth thrive & discover otherwise ignored talents and wasted potential.  \r\n"

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "California Standards Test (CST) results show the proficiency rate for the statewide student population to be 53% for English & 60% for Math, but only 29% & 37% respectively for foster youth. 75% of foster youth are working below grade level & only 58% will graduate high school (V’s 84% statewide). \r\n\r\nThe LA County Board of Supervisors Blue Ribbon Commission concluded “A State of Emergency exists. If we knew that 50% of all children in foster care end up homeless, or incarcerated upon aging out of the system & only 4% received any higher education, we would not tolerate such a negligent system.”\r\n\r\nWe are failing this population, our citizens for LA2050. The best place to learn is where every child has equal opportunity to succeed. TAP’s new, innovative education engagement model will achieve this. The LA2050 grant would allow us to bring the following design to life.\r\n\r\nThe Academy will start in Grade 7. A founding tenet is keeping school as the point of stability in a foster youth’s life. Students are guaranteed a tuition free placement through to completion of high school. The Academy will operate as a school-within-a-school, with an extended year round schedule providing the opportunity to participate in a variety of enrichment programs outside of class. \r\n\r\nStudents will be selected from a pool, created by self-submit applications & recommendations from experts (Social Workers, Lawyers, CASA). Engagement begins prior to the start of the school year, during a summer camp, focused on building trust & setting bi-directional expectations. \r\n\r\nA comprehensive battery of tests will be completed (medical, dental, academic etc.) that will shape students’ individualized holistic plans.  A licensed therapist will be matched with each student. Once the type & frequency of therapy sessions are prescribed, they will be included in each student’s plan, along with any required remediation & other appointments that would usually disrupt progress at school (e.g. court appearances). \r\n\r\nThe Academy will create a community for students, a home, with a core curriculum teacher & a site-based clinical social worker assigned to each class for the duration. After two years full time within The Academy, students will join mainstream high school. They will continue to have this ‘home’ for extra-curricular programs & support (therapy, tutoring, SAT preparation etc.). \r\n\r\nTAP will ensure they graduate career & college ready & prepared to be well-rounded citizens for LA2050.

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "Work is underway to address each of our main challenges: finding a partner school; solving transportation issues; securing delivery partners; avoiding stigma. \r\n\r\nThe last is the most complex. Foster status can manifest in low self-esteem & negative self image. Foster youth exhibit so much anxiety, worried their foster status might be exposed, they completely withdraw from social interactions. Perceptions of them as troubled & delinquent compound this. Concerns are, attending The Academy could isolate youth further.  \r\nFindings from the Vera Institute (foster youth found solace with other foster youth) disprove this idea. Steps we are taking to address stigma include: starting in 7th grade so they can mainstream into high school as a “regular” kid; leveraging the experience of experts & former foster youth; understanding lessons learnt from other successful programs; creating a culture of self-respect, replacing worthlessness with value, & a feeling of pride for overcoming adversity.   "
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Our solution has been designed with input from former foster youth & experts in the field, including a study by Princeton University. Our Focus Groups have determined evaluation metrics across 2 areas:\r\nStudent: Individual baseline metrics established via tests applied on joining TAP. Academic proficiency & general well being will be monitored for improvement\r\nSchool Community: Several recent studies (The Invisible Achievement Gap) have provided baseline metrics for LA’s foster youth. TAP will also work with Partner Schools to establish these. Targets: improve student attendance rates; totally eliminate transfer rates to alternative schools; reduce discipline & expulsion rates; increase CST participation rates & eventual scores; reduce drop-out rates; improve AP & CTE enrollment & passage rates; improve graduation rates; improve college attendance rates. \r\nWe are working to define other metrics related to improvement to life outcomes (unemployment, homelessness, future health & happiness)"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "Complementary, yes. We are in the process of engaging many organizations as our intent is to take an “open-source” approach to The Academy, encouraging other interested entities to leverage their proven approaches in helping youth. By establishing partnerships, we can not only enrich students’ experiences, but enable these organizations to enhance their own depth & reach, while cutting back on ineffective replication.  \r\n\r\nIn the past few years the issues surrounding Transition Age foster Youth--TAY--(18 - 24 years) have  gathered much needed attention. There are many organizations in LA catering to needs such as housing, mentoring, job search, higher education prep etc. While this is invaluable, there remains a gap in addressing many root causes that manifest much earlier. The LAUSD Foster Youth Achievement Program was created to monitor this gap, but they recognize that they need support from community partners to make an impactful difference. \r\n\r\nAs far as we are aware, from extensive research & networking, our in-school solution for foster youth is unique. Some schools are trialling the school-within-a-school approach for general remediation & are seeing early signs of success.  Several organizations do provide mentoring support for foster youth (e.g. Children Uniting Nations), outside of the school structure. There are several organisations that seek to provide after-school enrichment programs in LA, but few are targeted specifically at foster youth & their specific needs, much less seeking to create a community & sense of camaraderie among peers.\r\n\r\nThe closest ‘rival’ to TAP in LA is First Star (https://www.firststar.org). They have a summer Academy delivered in partnership with UCLA (The Bruin Guardian Scholars Academy). While we hope to begin our program with a similar summer camp structure, the Academy will go much deeper in providing support to students throughout the school year.\r\n\r\nWe have a State of Emergency, and the LA County Board of Supervisors recognizes that. Failing to educate & prepare foster youth for adult life fully & as early as possible, creates other issues for our City (gang membership, homelessness, incarceration, food stamps, subsidised health care etc.)  If we do what we’ve always done, we’ll get what we’ve always got. It’s time to try something new. \r\n"
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "TAP will work to launch our solution with the first cohort of 20 students starting at the beginning of academic year ‘16 - ‘17. The goal is to build a scalable model that can be replicated in other LA schools, & demonstrate thought leadership for other cities looking to address this issue.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of this grant application “the project” is the transition between completing the design phase & being ready for the first day of school . Our goal is to build the most robust solution as possible for that first, pilot year. Money will also be allotted to a Summer Camp, to kick off The Academy & ease students into their new world. We anticipate working with a range of partners to bring TAP to life. \r\n\r\nOrganisations we have approached & are in tentative discussions on partnering opportunities include: CASA, HopSkipDrive, Department of Children & Family Services, LAUSD, Los Angeles County Office of Education, First Star, The Alliance for Children’s Rights, United Friends of Children, Boys and Girls Club, iFoster, United Way, A Place Called Home, CITY, California Youth Connection, Guardian Scholars, iFoster, Unicamp, Future is Now, Children’s Institute, Coalition for Engaged Education, Education Coordinating Council, California Child Welfare Co-Investment Partnership, United Teachers Association, LA County Education Foundation, Children’s Law Institute, among others\r\n\r\nWe anticipate many of our partners services will be provided for free during the life of this specific project , as part of a proof of concept driven by joint goals & values. We will also rely heavily on skilled volunteers. The majority of the  costs associated with partner services will be assumed into the ongoing operating costs of The Academy Project, post Day 1.  This is out of scope of the budget for this application.  "
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': "For the purpose of this proposal, “the project” is the transition between completing the design phase & being ready for the 1st day of school, effectively Feb. 1st-Sept. 1st.\r\n\r\nFor the past year we have relied on in-kind donations to carry us through, e.g. office space, phone & internet services, fees, expert consultations & guidance & professionals volunteering their time.  We hope to continue to receive some if not all of these benefits as we move forward.\r\n\r\nTo have as robust a solution as possible for Day 1 of school, we anticipate needing between $120 - $150k total. This does not include the funds we will secure for the complete operation of the school from Day 1 onwards; work is underway to secure this before the start of the school year. Costs will reduce as we define more clearly which of the several paths the design & delivery takes e.g. variables that may change in the next few months: Contributions to/from the Partner School; Recruitment of personnel; Transportation; Finalizing corporate sponsorships.\r\n\r\nWe intend to influence these variables as much as possible to keep costs low & to continue to capitalize on in-kind donations. We have made the following assumptions for our proposal budget to bring us in line with $100k:\r\nDedicated workspace will be required to enable collaboration on the design. We would make use of sharing spaces such as Blankspace / Nextspace to minimize cost\r\nSalaries for core faculty should be at the higher end of the scale (as per LA market rates), given the demands placed on & commitment expected from faculty\r\nPartners services will be provided largely at their cost during this time, as part of a proof of concept driven by joint goals & values\r\nWe are in the process of expanding our Board to include professional expertise such as Finance, Legal, Marketing etc.\r\nWherever possible, skilled volunteers will be used to achieve remaining objectives, using web resources such as Catchafire, Idealist, VolunteerMatch, all of which we are already members\r\nWe are already capitalizing on free IT tools & services. e.g. Salesforce.com, Google suite \r\nNot included in this budget is a separate project to have the physical classroom ready for Day 1. We are optimistic our network of potential corporate sponsors can be leveraged here.\r\nAlso not included in this budget are the funds we will secure to underpin the complete operation of the school (e.g. full year salaries for faculty). Work is already underway to secure this before the school year starts. "
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "$14k for Office Space for 7 months \r\n$15k for Curriculum & Policy Development (consultancy fee, materials, behavioral management tools, design and execution of the battery of tests etc)\r\n$25k to Recruit Core Faculty & have them onboarded part time (20 hours per week) for 3 months prior to school starting, to be part of the design process (fully loaded salaries: $84k for Class Teacher; $79k for Social Worker, if not provided by DCFS)\r\n$3k training / professional development for core team, to ensure Day 1 readiness\r\n$10k for strategy development (recruiting partner school, completing operating model, advisory services, volunteer stipends, materials etc)\r\n$15k total for residential camp for 1 week. This again may reduce as we develop partnerships in the coming months\r\n$13k for marketing, to help raise awareness for TAP, to attract applicants & to galvanize support. A lot will be done via social media and relationship development\r\n$5k total contingency (e.g. unexpected costs, or advisory services"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "Significant preparations have been made to ensure the TAP solution is successful & scalable. Over the last year, collaboration with experts & former foster youth, including research led by Princeton University on TAP’s behalf, has contributed to our solid plan. The first cohort of TAP will clearly be important, as we pilot the solution for the first time, monitor against our key metrics & ensure we capitalize on lessons learnt. We are confident we are building something that can make a substantial difference in these kids lives.\r\n\r\nOnce through the first 2 pilot years, The Academy Project will scale our successful model by recruiting more schools thus, serving more & more foster youth.  We hope to replicate this model with an eye toward expediency, by opening & expanding our afterschool programs to non-TAP foster youth within our first few years of operation, in parallel to scaling “The Academy” to more schools.  As the success of TAP is replicated, more resources will be made available, & stakeholders will look to TAP as an organization that continues to innovate & create complete, thoughtful, & effective solutions to issues facing foster youth.  We will continue to explore engagement in earlier grades, & continued support beyond graduation.  We will continue to promote Professional Development both within TAP & amongst the greater educational community, with specialized trainings on foster youth, foster care & education, & therapies for victims of trauma.  \r\n\r\nThe Academy Project hopes to expand our reach by engaging Child Welfare Agencies throughout the country, guiding them to use The Academy Project approach as a basis for their own successes in caring for foster youth.  \r\n\r\nMany years down the line, it is our hope that The Academy Project will have taken the place of continuation schools & group homes, keeping foster youth engaged & thriving in public schools & foster family placements.  \r\n\r\nIt is our belief that our greatest assets are the youth we serve & it is because of them that we will be successful & able to scale to reach more & more youth.  By caring, nurturing & supporting these youth, they will no doubt thrive & continue to reach for the limitless potential that they all possess.  \r\n"

Costs will reduce as we define more clearly which of the several paths the design & delivery takes e.g. variables that may change in the next few months: Contributions to/from the Partner School; Recruitment of personnel; Transportation; Finalizing corporate sponsorships.
   
   We intend to influence these variables as much as possible to keep costs low & to continue to capitalize on in-kind donations. We have made the following assumptions for our proposal budget to bring us in line with $100k:
   Dedicated workspace will be required to enable collaboration on the design. We would make use of sharing spaces such as Blankspace / Nextspace to minimize cost
   Salaries for core faculty should be at the higher end of the scale (as per LA market rates), given the demands placed on & commitment expected from faculty
   Partners services will be provided largely at their cost during this time, as part of a proof of concept driven by joint goals & values
   We are in the process of expanding our Board to include professional expertise such as Finance, Legal, Marketing etc.
   Wherever possible, skilled volunteers will be used to achieve remaining objectives, using web resources such as Catchafire, Idealist, VolunteerMatch, all of which we are already members
   We are already capitalizing on free IT tools & services. e.g. Salesforce.com, Google suite 
   Not included in this budget is a separate project to have the physical classroom ready for Day 1. We are optimistic our network of potential corporate sponsors can be leveraged here.
   Also not included in this budget are the funds we will secure to underpin the complete operation of the school (e.g. full year salaries for faculty). Work is already underway to secure this before the school year starts.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  $14k for Office Space for 7 months 
   $15k for Curriculum & Policy Development (consultancy fee, materials, behavioral management tools, design and execution of the battery of tests etc)
   $25k to Recruit Core Faculty & have them onboarded part time (20 hours per week) for 3 months prior to school starting, to be part of the design process (fully loaded salaries: $84k for Class Teacher; $79k for Social Worker, if not provided by DCFS)
   $3k training / professional development for core team, to ensure Day 1 readiness
   $10k for strategy development (recruiting partner school, completing operating model, advisory services, volunteer stipends, materials etc)
   $15k total for residential camp for 1 week. This again may reduce as we develop partnerships in the coming months
   $13k for marketing, to help raise awareness for TAP, to attract applicants & to galvanize support. A lot will be done via social media and relationship development
   $5k total contingency (e.g. unexpected costs, or advisory services
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Significant preparations have been made to ensure the TAP solution is
  successful & scalable. Over the last year, collaboration with experts & former
  foster youth, including research led by Princeton University on TAP’s behalf,
  has contributed to our solid plan. The first cohort of TAP will clearly be
  important, as we pilot the solution for the first time, monitor against our
  key metrics & ensure we capitalize on lessons learnt. We are confident we are
  building something that can make a substantial difference in these kids lives.
   
   Once through the first 2 pilot years, The Academy Project will scale our successful model by recruiting more schools thus, serving more & more foster youth. We hope to replicate this model with an eye toward expediency, by opening & expanding our afterschool programs to non-TAP foster youth within our first few years of operation, in parallel to scaling “The Academy” to more schools. As the success of TAP is replicated, more resources will be made available, & stakeholders will look to TAP as an organization that continues to innovate & create complete, thoughtful, & effective solutions to issues facing foster youth. We will continue to explore engagement in earlier grades, & continued support beyond graduation. We will continue to promote Professional Development both within TAP & amongst the greater educational community, with specialized trainings on foster youth, foster care & education, & therapies for victims of trauma. 
   
   The Academy Project hopes to expand our reach by engaging Child Welfare Agencies throughout the country, guiding them to use The Academy Project approach as a basis for their own successes in caring for foster youth. 
   
   Many years down the line, it is our hope that The Academy Project will have taken the place of continuation schools & group homes, keeping foster youth engaged & thriving in public schools & foster family placements. 
   
   It is our belief that our greatest assets are the youth we serve & it is because of them that we will be successful & able to scale to reach more & more youth. By caring, nurturing & supporting these youth, they will no doubt thrive & continue to reach for the limitless potential that they all possess.
