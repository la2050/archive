  The ApplicantLab essay-writing software tool is currently live for MBA
  candidates, but my dream is to expand it for college applications also. This
  money could help me "pivot" my existing tool to adapt it for high schoolers; I
  could offer it for free for LAUSD students and thus help expand pathways to
  college. "Admissions Consultants" charge thousands to help with essay-writing;
  ApplicantLab can level the playing field!

  This grant money will help me adapt the product and test it out -- I would
  then offer it to LAUSD students for free. This would give them an advantage in
  college applications vs. their peers from other cities who face similar
  resource constraints (e.g., dire counselor-to-student ratios), but who would
  not have accesss to advice like this. 
   
   I think the college essay intimidates kids and totally stresses them out -- and I see repeated, common mistakes in essays that might be keeping kids from being accepted to the best college possible. Students need a tool to teach them how to tell their story in an effective, compelling way that will make college admissions officers (and their scholarship-granting counterparts) take notice.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Barrier 1: Development cost -- as you may know, software development is
  extremely expensive. However, the good news is that I already have the core
  platform built, so it would simply need to be "pivoted" / adapted for this new
  audience. This overcomes the obstacle of the expense of building new software
  from scratch. 
   
   Barrier 2: Usability -- I would need to sit down with high schoolers (and English teachers) to assess which "UX" (user experience) would most resonate with them. The platform may need to be adapted to accomodate students with varying levels of English proficiency. I will overcome this obstacle by using the cache' of this award to build relationships with LAUSD schools.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: |-
  I envision the project unfolding over three key phases in 2016: 
   
   Phase 1: basic research, spring of 2016 -- meet with LAUSD counselors / English teachersto learn their tips for college essays. We will thus amalgamate "best practices" from LAUSD's finest. Meet with students who have recently completed the college process to learn which challenges they faced. 
   
   Metric of success: a product plan with concrete deliverables. 
   
   Phase 2: development, summer of 2016 -- take the feedback from Phase 1 back to my developers and UX designer and iteratively create the new product, getting constant feedback along the way. Hire LAUSD students to help (internships!).
   
   Metric of success: software developed & delivered to LAUSD
   
   Phase 3: launch, autumn of 2016 -- make the product available to help with the UC and "Common App" essays. View this as a prototype/pilot: get feedback & iterate!
   
   Metric of success: successful pilot + tons of feedback + college acceptances!
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There is one other online service, based in NYC, that offers an essay writing
  platform. It's called www.story2.com
   
   My proposed product is unique in that it provides a start-to-finish strategy for the FULL college application, not just one essay in isolation. For example, my product allows users to think about which stories to use in their essays, which stories to write about in their recomendations, which stories to put in their "brag sheet", etc. 
   
   In other words, my patent-pending platform covers the creation of the FULL application, not just one essay.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': (see later question on budget)
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 â€“ how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  Should $100k not be sufficient, here is my plan: As any entrepreneur will tell
  you, sometimes you take a loss in the short-term in order to build a business
  for the long term. Should additional capital be required, I would first pursue
  funds from philanthropic organizations. I would also pursue Venture Capital to
  help build out the rest of the product. If I can get this product in the hands
  of LAUSD, and working for LAUSD kids (for free), then that will be a seal of
  approval that would allow me to *sell* the product to other school districts
  around the nation -- a business plan that would hopefully be appealing to an
  early-stage investor.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  Software coders: $40k
   
   UX consultant: $10k
   
   Content advisor: $5k
   
   Compensating LAUSD counselors and English teachers for their time: $10 k 
   
   Conducting focus-groups & research interviews with LAUSD students: $5k (combination of direct compensation, plus, e.g. buying pizza for focus groups)
   
   Hiring 2 LAUSD students as summer interns
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  To scale the success, there would be a constant iteration of feedback from
  students using the product -- we can learn what works & what doesn't. The
  product will therefore get better and better over time. 
   
   In terms of scaling the business itself, as mentioned above, getting this product into the hands of LAUSD will be a huge signal to other school systems that the product really works. I could then charge them to use it, and use those funds to continue growing the business. 
   
   *NOTE ABOUT THE YOUTUBE VIDEO below! This was a pitch I gave last year; I have since (summer of 2015) completely re-done my UX (for the better!). The fundamental product is the same, but the look-n-feel is much better now. Please let me know if you'd like a tour of the current product (which I am just now getting ready to unveil). Thank you!
