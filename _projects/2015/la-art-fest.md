  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: "Los Angeles is filled with hundreds of cultures that stay hidden from view.  Artists often represent the vanguard of a community's curiosity and inclusion and tolerance.   A painting, a sculpture, an installation, a song, a play, a dance, are seen by fellow artists as expressions from a fellow traveller.  An environment where artists and their friends and neighbors congregate to see the art of fellow Angelenos is a great way to learn about and celebrate the different cultures of Los Angeles.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a mega-city, a world class city, an international media center, a gateway city, Los Angeles is in a unique position to demonstrate new and innovative approaches for cultivating connectivity in a world with more diaspora, more urbanization, more fragmentation, more clustering .  Cultivating city-wide communication and learning by and about artists and their creations, artists from LA's various communities should help to make Angelenos more curious, interested, and knowledgable about the cultures in the City of Angels, more tolerant of their neighbors and work colleagues.\r\n\r\nInteraction in a forum like LAARTFEST would foster better understanding of the \"other\" in a creative and positive, family-friendly forum.\r\n"

"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "Santa Monica is producing an event called the Glow.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': |-
  Los Angeles needs an arts festival! 
   
   Focus on: 
   
   ➢ Employ Musicians
   ➢ Sell Fine Art and Support a Fine art exhibition
   ➢ Employ Fine artists
   ➢ Art installations
   ➢ Engage Artists to produce for Craft Booths
   ➢ Employ Food Booths and Food Trucks
   ➢ Employ Artists for installations
   ➢ Employ Performance artists
   ➢ Employ Multi-Cultural music stage
   ➢ Employ Experimental music stage
   ➢ Employ DJs music/dance stage (Night)
   
   This event would be supported by the artists representing hundreds of cultures within LA. The event will be a success for all of our communities. An environment where artists and their friends and neighbors congregate to see the art of fellow Angelenos is a great way to learn about and celebrate the different cultures of Los Angeles. Artists often represent the vanguard of a community's curiosity and inclusion and tolerance. A painting, a sculpture, an installation, a song, a play, a dance, are seen by fellow artists as expressions from a fellow traveller. 
   
   
   As a mega-city, a world class city, an international media center, a gateway city, Los Angeles is in a unique position to demonstrate new and innovative approaches for cultivating connectivity in a world with more diaspora, more urbanization, more fragmentation and more clustering . Cultivating city-wide communication and learning by and about artists and their creations, artists from LA's various communities should help to make Angelenos more curious, interested, and knowledgeable about the cultures in the City of Angels, ultimately more tolerant of their neighbors and work colleagues.
   
   Interaction in a forum like LA ART FEST would foster understanding of the "other" in a creative and positive, family-friendly forum.
   
   Reasons art projects benefit the larger community:
   
   • Artists create economies that benefit the smaller community and often times the larger community. 
   • Cultural diversity rubs off on each other. Supporting cultural diversity offers better understanding of our fellow man. 
   
   • Education: As community members become exposed to information about, various cultural efforts, the more they want. Education/information is always good. 
   
   • Cooperation: Cultural efforts help bring people together to accomplish great things for the community.
