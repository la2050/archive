'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': |-
  Los Angeles needs an arts festival! 
   
   Focus on: 
   
   ➢ Employ Musicians
   ➢ Sell Fine Art and Support a Fine art exhibition
   ➢ Employ Fine artists
   ➢ Art installations
   ➢ Engage Artists to produce for Craft Booths
   ➢ Employ Food Booths and Food Trucks
   ➢ Employ Artists for installations
   ➢ Employ Performance artists
   ➢ Employ Multi-Cultural music stage
   ➢ Employ Experimental music stage
   ➢ Employ DJs music/dance stage (Night)
   
   This event would be supported by the artists representing hundreds of cultures within LA. The event will be a success for all of our communities. An environment where artists and their friends and neighbors congregate to see the art of fellow Angelenos is a great way to learn about and celebrate the different cultures of Los Angeles. Artists often represent the vanguard of a community's curiosity and inclusion and tolerance. A painting, a sculpture, an installation, a song, a play, a dance, are seen by fellow artists as expressions from a fellow traveller. 
   
   
   As a mega-city, a world class city, an international media center, a gateway city, Los Angeles is in a unique position to demonstrate new and innovative approaches for cultivating connectivity in a world with more diaspora, more urbanization, more fragmentation and more clustering . Cultivating city-wide communication and learning by and about artists and their creations, artists from LA's various communities should help to make Angelenos more curious, interested, and knowledgeable about the cultures in the City of Angels, ultimately more tolerant of their neighbors and work colleagues.
   
   Interaction in a forum like LA ART FEST would foster understanding of the "other" in a creative and positive, family-friendly forum.
   
   Reasons art projects benefit the larger community:
   
   • Artists create economies that benefit the smaller community and often times the larger community. 
   • Cultural diversity rubs off on each other. Supporting cultural diversity offers better understanding of our fellow man. 
   
   • Education: As community members become exposed to information about, various cultural efforts, the more they want. Education/information is always good. 
   
   • Cooperation: Cultural efforts help bring people together to accomplish great things for the community.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Logistics will be the most difficult aspect of the LAAF. Logistical challenges
  below:
   
   Location:
   
   1. Outdoor field for large art installations and sculptures and performance stages ≈ 5 acres (last time Richard Murello donated his 5 acre space in the Arts District near Sci Arc for these purposes)This festival we would like the sculptures to be placed in the Historic State Park in Chinatown. 
   
   2. Indoor space for flat art exhibition requires ≈ 25,000 sq. ft . 
    
   Permits
   
   1. Permits= Request to City Council
   2. Petition for street closure
   3. Get Special Daily Beer and Wine license from State of Ca. 
   Public amenities
   1. Recruit food service artisans
   2. Porto Potties = Contact Porto San United Site Services
   3. Security= C.A.S.T. Security
   
   Administrative
   
   1. Insurance=City of Los Angeles local city council
   2. Security= C.A.S.T. Security

Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: |-
  Evaluations:
   
   Attendance - Attendance will be measured by counting the number of attendees. The diversity of attendees will be measured by analyzing surnames in a database format. 
   
   Quality of presentations - Successful presentations will be measured by the number of presentations, the diversity of presentations, and the artistic merit of the presentations. A catalog of presentations will be produced for review by event producers and Los Angeles cultural affairs administrators.
   
   Successful administration of the event will be measured by evaluating conformance with the budget, permit compliance and management of vendors and implementation of sculpture installations.
   
   Post on-line survey to artists, performers and guests. 
   Timeline for every aspect of the event will be created. 
   Once goals are met they will be checked off. 
   Weekly meetings with production team for 6 months leading up to the event will allow for information to be shared.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Santa Monica is producing an event called the Glow. The triennial, all-night
  event that re-imagines Santa Monica Beach as a playground for thoughtful and
  participatory, temporary art. - See more at:
  http://glowsantamonica.org/#sthash.3PKtpNZO.dpuf
   
   My approach focuses on creating a gateway for artists to connect with the community to create cultural exchanges. 
   
   It also includes 3 music stages:
   
   ➢ Experimental music 
   ➢ Electronic Music (DJ'S)
   ➢ Multi-Cultural Stage that will feature various musicians and performers including representations by ethnic artists. 
   
   ➢ Food Booths and Food Trucks
   
   ➢ Sales of crafts created by local artists will draw in visitors and create micro-economies for local artists. 
   
   ➢ An indoor fine art exhibition 
   
   ➢ Art installations both outdoor and indoor with fire and water elements.
   
   ➢ Indoor and outdoor performance artists. Giant walking puppets!

How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  The LA ART FEST would start out in 1 area of Los Angeles DTLA then expand to
  other surrounding communities in L.A. 
   
   An umbrella organization for the LA ART FEST would help guide a city-wide effort. Moving the art festival around the city would allow each community an opportunity to offer their own version of the the LA ART FEST with an art exhibition, crafts and food aspect as well as a musical component. 
   
   As a multi-cultural art event people would share their own particulat cultural manifestation. Since there are hundreds of cultures throughout the L.A. area there is no shortage of content for future LA Art Fests. Content would be presented for exhibitions, performance and crafts presentations. 
   
   Multi-cultural food purveyors would be included to help share the pride of our collective community. There is such a vast array of choices with the new food trucks and other food vendors that each LA ART FEST would contain completely new content each time.
