Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: "Los Angeles is filled with hundreds of cultures that stay hidden from view.  Artists often represent the vanguard of a community's curiosity and inclusion and tolerance.   A painting, a sculpture, an installation, a song, a play, a dance, are seen by fellow artists as expressions from a fellow traveller.  An environment where artists and their friends and neighbors congregate to see the art of fellow Angelenos is a great way to learn about and celebrate the different cultures of Los Angeles.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a mega-city, a world class city, an international media center, a gateway city, Los Angeles is in a unique position to demonstrate new and innovative approaches for cultivating connectivity in a world with more diaspora, more urbanization, more fragmentation, more clustering .  Cultivating city-wide communication and learning by and about artists and their creations, artists from LA's various communities should help to make Angelenos more curious, interested, and knowledgable about the cultures in the City of Angels, more tolerant of their neighbors and work colleagues.\r\n\r\nInteraction in a forum like LAARTFEST would foster better understanding of the \"other\" in a creative and positive, family-friendly forum.\r\n"
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Evaluations:\r\n\r\nAttendance - Attendance will be measured by counting the number of attendees.  The diversity of attendees will be measured by analyzing surnames in a database format. \r\n\r\nQuality of presentations - Successful presentations will be measured by the number of presentations, the diversity of presentations, and the artistic merit of the presentations.  A catalog of presentations will be produced for review by event producers and Los Angeles cultural affairs administrators.\r\n\r\nSuccessful administration of the event will be measured by evaluating conformance with the budget, permit compliance and management of vendors and implementation of sculpture installations. "
