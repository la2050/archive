project_summary: >-
  We will connect LA’s most vulnerable communities on a neighbor-to-neighbor and
  community-to-community level through the power of volunteerism. New
  neighborhood networks and community coalitions will coalesce around the issue
  of preparedness for home fires. These efforts will lead to a more
  inter-connected LA with more resilient and prepared individuals and
  communities, for any type of disaster large or small, especially in
  vulnerable, low-income communities.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Knowing your neighbors and being engaged in your community creates the social
  connectedness we all need to live productive, healthy and fulfilled lives.
  This belonging and the active participation in civic life are important values
  in and of themselves. But what happens when disaster strikes? In particular,
  what happens if you are poor, without insurance or financial security and live
  in a vulnerable area? Then the lack of community and belonging as well as
  financial means can spell complete devastation. When your apartment burns
  down, you want to know your neighbors, be part of a larger community network
  and prepared to respond and then recover after the smoke clears. The effects
  of disasters large and small are exponentially worse for poorer communities.
  Families struggling to pay rent are less likely to store resources, own a car
  and have a safe space to stay in an emergency. At the same time, low-income
  communities are much more likely to be struck by disaster in the first place,
  considering housing conditions, including construction quality, heating and
  electrical wiring, is often not up to standard. ARCLA is acutely aware of
  these disparities as the vast majority of fires we respond to are in
  vulnerable neighborhoods where underserved residents (most of our disaster
  relief clients) find themselves in an extremely precarious position after a
  residential fire, often teetering on the precipice of homelessness and abject
  poverty.
   In response, the Red Cross developed a unique campaign to prevent home fires and increase community resilience with a focus on low-income areas most vulnerable to disaster. We commissioned a study to rank each of LA’s communities according to disaster vulnerability. Those ranking highest are the focus of this initiative. Striving for increased community resilience, the program is based on working with coalitions of community stakeholders to install smoke alarms and provide fire and disaster safety education through home visits. Neighbor-to-neighbor, community-to-community, a coalition of volunteers, staff and our community partners will work together within vulnerable communities across LA to strengthen resilience and save lives.
   Overall, the project will forge real interconnectedness and community resilience from the ground up through the power of volunteerism, while working to ensure that a resilient LA continues to be a place for all to connect, learn, create, play and live in, even after disaster, inevitably, strikes.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Most LA residents understand that disasters happen frequently, including home
  fires. Very few, however, turn this knowledge into preparedness action. The
  community canvassing approach is effective because receiving information
  directly in your community or from a peer resonates and seeing a neighbor take
  action inspires to do the same. 
   Another challenge is the pace of coalition-building. Fortunately, our partnership with the LA Department of Public Health (DPH) is already addressing this. Its LA County Community Disaster Resiliency, a 3-year campaign focused on community coalition-building to strengthen resilience from a health perspective, ended in June. We participated quarterly over the past year to create a transition plan for 6 of their coalitions to work with ARCLA (6 DPH-targeted communities overlap with the 15 ARCLA-targeted communities). Working with groups already focused on resiliency-building in their communities will help create trust and collaboration from the outset.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We will employ several formative and summative tools throughout the
  initiative’s duration. Quantitative and qualitative data will be compiled
  quarterly with a comprehensive report produced bi-annually. Progress will be
  monitored by a staff committee monthly and a Board committee quarterly. 
   Major outcomes include:
   Implement a coalition-driven preparedness effort based on home fire preparedness and installing 2,500 smoke alarms in each of the 5 targeted communities (Van Nuys, El Monte, Koreatown, Paramount and East LA), reaching 20,000 residents.
   Measurable outputs to be tracked include:
   -Number of households canvassed
   -Number of home visits
   -Number of smoke alarms installed
   -Number of smoke alarm battery replacements conducted
   -Number of households trained in smoke alarm testing and maintenance
   -Community-based coalitions: Collaborate with at least 15 new partners 
   -Conduct follow-up every 6 months to provide additional support as residents implement their preparedness plans
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  We collaborate with a wide variety of organizations and are active members of
  a large number of coalitions working on emergency management and safety
  issues. Our approach, however, of creating greater resiliency throughout LA by
  first targeting the most vulnerable communities through a broad preparedness
  campaign anchoring in prevention of home fires, a daily threat, is unique.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  While responsibility for the overall Home Fire Preparedness strategy and
  implementation lies with ARCLA, we are only able to achieve our goals with the
  support from and continuous collaboration with a large number of important
  partner organizations. The largest coalition partners to date include: LA
  County Fire Department, Long Beach C.E.R.T, Los Angeles C.E.R.T.,Hope
  Worldwide, LA City Fire Department, Long Beach Fire Department, and the
  University of Southern California. The following on-going partnerships will
  also support the implementation of our project: Community Police Advisory
  Board, City of Los Angeles Office of Emergency Management, LA County Office of
  Emergency Management, Neighborhood Councils and Emergency Network Los Angeles.
  These partners offer additional preparedness training, cross-promote programs
  and services, serve in a program advisory capacity, help identify new
  community volunteers and work to identify Neighborhood Councils and
  community-based organizations as potential coalition partners. Three factors
  critical to the success of these collaborations are: shared mission; continual
  dialogue about best practices; and exchange of ideas, promotion and training
  programs. These relationships are collaborative in nature and do not encompass
  redistribution of grant funding as the majority of the material costs are
  absorbed by the Red Cross.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  Since the Home Fire Campaign is volunteer-led, the largest expenses will
  revolve around a percentage of its staff management, meeting costs, smoke
  alarms, installation kits, printing and travel. 
   
   The total projected annual cost will be approximately $1,000,000. We will make up the remaining $900,000 through funding from individual donors, foundations as well as corporate and government partners.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  Salary (% of Preparedness program staff)  $30,000
   Community and coalition meeting costs $5,000 
   Supplies (smoke alarms, installation kits)  $60,000 
   Printing   $5,000
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  The Los Angeles Home Fire Campaign is part of a larger, four-year campaign.
  The project design includes reaching a total of 15 targeted communities, which
  rank very high on the vulnerability index specifically created for this
  effort. This first year will focus on five of the 15 high-risk and vulnerable
  communities: Van Nuys, South El Monte/El Monte, Koreatown, Paramount and East
  Los Angeles (Belvedere, City Terrace and Eastmont). The strategic plan for the
  campaign further involves working with area community groups and volunteers
  and canvassing the neighborhoods to conduct a minimum of 500 smoke alarm
  installations and family preparedness plans in each designated community
  (totaling at least 2,500 annually). By beginning with the five of the 15 focus
  communities listed above during the first, growing it by five additional
  neighborhoods in the second year (San Fernando, Rosemead, South San
  Gabriel/San Gabriel, Bell/Bell Gardens, Compton/East Compton, South Los
  Angeles: Exposition Park, Vermont Square and Leimert Park) and then scaling it
  to the full 15 communities by the end of the third project year (Pacoima,
  Pomona, Huntington Park/Walnut Park, Wilmington, Westlake/Pico Union), the
  initiative will have been scaled to cover a vast portion of LA County by the
  end of the campaign’s third year. 
   
   Once it has expanded into all 15 communities, year four of the effort will revolve around coalition capacity building, including running a series of coalition convenings, resulting in a stronger network of community coalitions throughout Los Angeles County. The work proposed here will cover year one of the proposed initiative and will be scaled citywide as outlined by the end of its four-year duration.

    answer: "Knowing your neighbors and being engaged in your community creates the social connectedness we all need to live productive, healthy and fulfilled lives. This belonging and the active participation in civic life are important values in and of themselves. But what happens when disaster strikes? In particular, what happens if you are poor, without insurance or financial security and live in a vulnerable area? Then the lack of community and belonging as well as financial means can spell complete devastation. When your apartment burns down, you want to know your neighbors, be part of a larger community network and prepared to respond and then recover after the smoke clears. The effects of disasters large and small are exponentially worse for poorer communities. Families struggling to pay rent are less likely to store resources, own a car and have a safe space to stay in an emergency. At the same time, low-income communities are much more likely to be struck by disaster in the first place, considering housing conditions, including construction quality, heating and electrical wiring, is often not up to standard. ARCLA is acutely aware of these disparities as the vast majority of fires we respond to are in vulnerable neighborhoods where underserved residents (most of our disaster relief clients) find themselves in an extremely precarious position after a residential fire, often teetering on the precipice of homelessness and abject poverty.\r\nIn response, the Red Cross developed a unique campaign to prevent home fires and increase community resilience with a focus on low-income areas most vulnerable to disaster. We commissioned a study to rank each of LA’s communities according to disaster vulnerability. Those ranking highest are the focus of this initiative. Striving for increased community resilience, the program is based on working with coalitions of community stakeholders to install smoke alarms and provide fire and disaster safety education through home visits. Neighbor-to-neighbor, community-to-community, a coalition of volunteers, staff and our community partners will work together within vulnerable communities across LA to strengthen resilience and save lives.\r\nOverall, the project will forge real interconnectedness and community resilience from the ground up through the power of volunteerism, while working to ensure that a resilient LA continues to be a place for all to connect, learn, create, play and live in, even after disaster, inevitably, strikes.\r\n"

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Most LA residents understand that disasters happen frequently, including home fires. Very few, however, turn this knowledge into preparedness action. The community canvassing approach is effective because receiving information directly in your community or from a peer resonates and seeing a neighbor take action inspires to do the same. \r\nAnother challenge is the pace of coalition-building. Fortunately, our partnership with the LA Department of Public Health (DPH) is already addressing this. Its LA County Community Disaster Resiliency, a 3-year campaign focused on community coalition-building to strengthen resilience from a health perspective, ended in June. We participated quarterly over the past year to create a transition plan for 6 of their coalitions to work with ARCLA (6 DPH-targeted communities overlap with the 15 ARCLA-targeted communities). Working with groups already focused on resiliency-building in their communities will help create trust and collaboration from the outset."

    answer: "We will employ several formative and summative tools throughout the initiative’s duration. Quantitative and qualitative data will be compiled quarterly with a comprehensive report produced bi-annually. Progress will be monitored by a staff committee monthly and a Board committee quarterly. \r\nMajor outcomes include:\r\nImplement a coalition-driven preparedness effort based on home fire preparedness and installing 2,500 smoke alarms in each of the 5 targeted communities (Van Nuys, El Monte, Koreatown, Paramount and East LA), reaching 20,000 residents.\r\nMeasurable outputs to be tracked include:\r\n-Number of households canvassed\r\n-Number of home visits\r\n-Number of smoke alarms installed\r\n-Number of smoke alarm battery replacements conducted\r\n-Number of households trained in smoke alarm testing and maintenance\r\n-Community-based coalitions: Collaborate with at least 15 new partners \r\n-Conduct follow-up every 6 months to provide additional support as residents implement their preparedness plans "

      We collaborate with a wide variety of organizations and are active members
      of a large number of coalitions working on emergency management and safety
      issues. Our approach, however, of creating greater resiliency throughout
      LA by first targeting the most vulnerable communities through a broad
      preparedness campaign anchoring in prevention of home fires, a daily

      While responsibility for the overall Home Fire Preparedness strategy and
      implementation lies with ARCLA, we are only able to achieve our goals with
      the support from and continuous collaboration with a large number of
      important partner organizations. The largest coalition partners to date
      include: LA County Fire Department, Long Beach C.E.R.T, Los Angeles
      C.E.R.T.,Hope Worldwide, LA City Fire Department, Long Beach Fire
      Department, and the University of Southern California. The following
      on-going partnerships will also support the implementation of our project:
      Community Police Advisory Board, City of Los Angeles Office of Emergency
      Management, LA County Office of Emergency Management, Neighborhood
      Councils and Emergency Network Los Angeles. These partners offer
      additional preparedness training, cross-promote programs and services,
      serve in a program advisory capacity, help identify new community
      volunteers and work to identify Neighborhood Councils and community-based
      organizations as potential coalition partners. Three factors critical to
      the success of these collaborations are: shared mission; continual
      dialogue about best practices; and exchange of ideas, promotion and
      training programs. These relationships are collaborative in nature and do
      not encompass redistribution of grant funding as the majority of the
      material costs are absorbed by the Red Cross.

    answer: "The Los Angeles Home Fire Campaign  is part of a larger, four-year campaign. The project design includes reaching a total of 15 targeted communities, which rank very high on the vulnerability index specifically created for this effort. This first year will focus on five of the 15 high-risk and vulnerable communities: Van Nuys, South El Monte/El Monte, Koreatown, Paramount and East Los Angeles (Belvedere, City Terrace and Eastmont). The strategic plan for the campaign further involves working with area community groups and volunteers and canvassing the neighborhoods to conduct a minimum of 500 smoke alarm installations and family preparedness plans in each designated community (totaling at least 2,500 annually). By beginning with the five of the 15 focus communities listed above during the first, growing it by five additional neighborhoods in the second year (San Fernando, Rosemead, South San Gabriel/San Gabriel, Bell/Bell Gardens, Compton/East Compton, South Los Angeles: Exposition Park, Vermont Square and Leimert Park) and then scaling it to the full 15 communities by the end of the third project year (Pacoima, Pomona, Huntington Park/Walnut Park, Wilmington, Westlake/Pico Union), the initiative will have been scaled to cover a vast portion of LA County by the end of the campaign’s third year. \r\n\r\nOnce it has expanded into all 15 communities, year four of the effort will revolve around coalition capacity building, including running a series of coalition convenings, resulting in a stronger network of community coalitions throughout Los Angeles County. The work proposed here will cover year one of the proposed initiative and will be scaled citywide as outlined by the end of its four-year duration.\r\n"
