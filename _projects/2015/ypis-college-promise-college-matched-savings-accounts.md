  YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE helps low-income students prepare for and go to college
  through financial education and a unique 3:1 match that puts $981 into special
  savings accounts for 1,300 students who otherwise may not be able to afford
  school. $981 is the gap to cover community college costs after financial aid,
  an amount that also makes it three times more likely students will enroll in
  college—and four times more likely they’ll graduate. That’s something great
  for L.A. now and in 2050.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  L.A. is a wonderful place to learn, but only for those with access to
  opportunities. At the college level, access includes funds for entry and
  graduation. YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE provides funding and financial education,
  along with academic and college readiness support, to help L.A. families learn
  and thrive. 
   
   An L.A. family earning less than $30,000 annually receives an average of $5,819 in financial aid toward the $6,800 annual cost of an L.A. community college. That leaves $981 still needed to make it happen. YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE steps in to provide this with special College Savings Individual Development Accounts paired with financial education, financial aid workshops, and one-on-one financial coaching. 
   
   Take Ricardo Morales, who is a student at College of the Canyons. He’s majoring in architecture. His brother Juan Daniel attends L.A. Mission College as a business major. Their youngest brother Jose is a senior in high school and hopes to attend college as well. Their family strongly believes in the importance of education, and the brothers are motivated to succeed, but their family has been concerned about the money it will take to help all three of them graduate. “I thought my children weren’t going to be able to go to college because we didn’t have the resources,” their mother says.
   
   But the family found YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE, and all three sons signed up. With generous support from LA2050, all three can receive matching funds needed to help them achieve their college dreams. 
   
   Because YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE isn’t just a match. For every dollar a student puts into their account, our program will TRIPLE the amount, up to $660. Factor in two bonuses provided by the program, and suddenly each student has the $981 they need to cover what is otherwise a daunting funding gap for many low-income students.
   
   But this can only happen if—and only if—YPI receives $100,000 to match U.S. Department of Health and Human Services funds already in hand, because current YPI funding does not cover the match requirements. The support of LA2050 is vital to ensure that at least 262 more low-income L.A. students will have access to learn, changing their lives, their families’ lives, and the landscape of our city. 
   
   By 2050, not only will these students be college graduates—so will their children. Leveling the playing field and creating opportunity: That’s how we make L.A. the best place to learn.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  The major strength of YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE is also its major barrier:
  providing a triple match to L.A. students in need. The U.S. Department of
  Health and Human Services will match deposits dollar-for-dollar, up to
  $494,650. That would mean putting $761 into the bank accounts of 1,300
  low-income students. 
   
   This doesn’t just cover the gap for one year of college. The Assets and Education Initiative of the Corporation for Enterprise Development reports that children with even $500 saved for college are three times more likely to enroll in college and four times more likely to graduate from college.
   
   YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE can therefore make it four times more likely that 1,300 young low-income L.A. students graduate college, profoundly changing their lives and the lives of their families for years to come. But we must raise $494,650 in nonfederal, private funds to make this happen. And $100,000 from LA2050 is a big part of this.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  For YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE partnership with LA2050, we will evaluate our
  success based on achieving these goals: 
   
   At least 262 low-income students open matched College Savings Individual Development Accounts to receive $26 sign-up bonus.
   
   Each student saves at least $220 to receive 3:1 match.
   
   Each student makes deposits for six consecutive months to receive a $75 bonus match.
   
   In total, YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE students supported by LA2050 save over $250,000 to use for their college education (including students’ savings and matching funds).
   
   At least 262 students receive financial literacy education, financial coaching, and participate in a financial aid workshop to increase their financial capability.
   
   At least 262 students enroll in or continue college.
   
   This evaluation will allow us to see how YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE serves students like the Morales brothers and how, working together, we can change lives and transform the L.A. landscape.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE is a unique program and resource for the City of Los
  Angeles, because we integrate this program—and the students it supports—into a
  larger set of high-touch services for students and their families, all geared
  toward the goals of increasing academic achievement, elevating income, and
  improving access to support as we work to eradicate intergenerational poverty.
   
   There are four other L.A.-based organizations currently providing College Savings Individual Development Accounts to students. All are valuable members of our community, but they are all more narrowly focused on economic development. None of them provide YPI’s holistic array of individualized, wrap-around services that further create change in the lives of the students benefiting from college matched savings accounts. YPI does this not only through the financial literacy classes, financial aid workshops, and one-on-one financial counseling that we require as part of YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE, but also through college and career preparatory programs and counseling provided for our low-income families.
   
   This represents only one portion of our cradle-to-college-and-career continuum of programming that assists more than 100,000 people across 125 sites, including the students and families who will benefit from YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE. We operate five schools (three public charter and two LAUSD), 78 afterschool programs, and we’ve opened 83 Public Computer Centers. Our services include an extensive range of programs that encourage lifespan learning and self-sufficiency, such as academic tutoring; GED, ESL, and professional development programs; college preparation; job readiness and employment assistance; school dropout prevention services; reconnection services for out-of-school youth; early childhood development services; parenting education; health education and referral services; legal services; and individualized case management. All of these services are free of charge, and together with YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE, provide an immersive and wide-scope set of opportunities for students and their families to change their lives—and therefore to change the landscape our city now and in 2050.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  We are honored to have many L.A. organizations collaborating with us to
  maximize YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE, but none of them would receive any portion of
  this grant award. Nor would YPI. Every single dollar of the $100,000 grant
  will go directly into matched college savings accounts for these ambitious
  L.A. students in need, like the Morales brothers.
   
   Although none of our partners are receiving any direct funding to support this project, they are deeply committed to making this program—and our families—thrive. YPI is working with a large and diverse array of collaborators to help us identify and recruit the initial 1,300 low-income students who will open matched college savings account during the first five years of our program, including LAUSD; the City of L.A.’s Housing & Community Investment Department FamilySource Centers; the City of L.A.’s Economic & Workforce Development Department YouthSource Centers; the Local Initiatives Support Corporation-funded Financial Opportunity Center; the Mexican Consulate; the Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs; El Nido Family Centers; Hollygrove; Hollywood Community Housing Corporation; Korean Churches for Community Development; Los Angeles City College; Los Angeles Mission College; MEND; the Salvadoran American Leadership and Education Fund; the Thai Community Development Center; and the UCLA Community Based Learning Program.
   
   YPI is collaborating with Citi Community Development and Junior Achievement Finance Park to provide financial workshops and one-on-one financial counseling for our enrolled students and their families. We are also collaborating with AmeriCorps to provide College & Career Ambassadors and one-on-one college and career support to these undeserved students, which includes individualized counseling and workshops to help understand financial aid opportunities and complete financial aid applications. For banking access for the participating students, we are partnering with Citibank Financial Services to provide each student with a College Savings Individual Development Account through its Citi Microfinance Platform. 
   
   By working together, we look forward to putting $100,000 directly into the savings accounts of these L.A. students in need so they can graduate college and change the lives of their families for decades to come—the year 2050 and beyond.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  The initial five years of YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE has a projected budget of
  $1,163,882. This amount establishes College Savings Individual Development
  Accounts for 1,300 low-income L.A. students and provides each of them with
  $761 in savings accounts funds ($660 in triple-match and $101 in savings
  incentives). This five-year budget also covers costs for financial literacy
  classes, financial aid workshops, and one-on-one financial counseling—all of
  which are required elements for each student and family enrolled in YPI’s
  COLLEGE PROMISE, in order to help ensure successful progress and completion.
  This budget also covers all personnel and administrative costs associated for
  five years of the program.
   
   YPI was honored to receive an Assets for Independence (AFI) grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which will cover 50% of this five-year budget—so long as we can match it with private funds. YPI therefore now has a profound opportunity to affect post-secondary success for L.A. students in need, but we can only do so with the participation of private funders. 
   
   This is both a humbling endorsement of our work and a call to do even better, in our longstanding mission to provide high quality education and much needed wraparound services to at-risk youth and families. While YPI has been successful in securing public funding, including this valuable Department of Health and Human Services grant, government grants are highly restrictive and do not cover all program costs. Private support helps our government dollars work harder and smarter, and shifting YPI’s internal systems in this much-needed way can only be done with the help of donors who see the value of its long-term impact. United Way of Greater Los Angeles is already joining us in creating this impact, and we will continue to pursue this extraordinarily necessary private funding through foundation grants and individual donors. 
   
   An award of $100,000 through LA2050 and the Goldhirsh Foundation will profoundly impact this program and the landscape of learning in Los Angeles. YPI cannot meet the needs of our families for college financial assistance without your help.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
  The entirety of the $100,000 for YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE will go directly into
  the College Savings Individual Development Accounts of low-income L.A.
  students who will otherwise not be able to afford college.
   
   When a student saves $220 in his/her account, our program adds triple that amount—bringing the account to $880. Our program also provides an initial sign-up bonus of $26, as well as a $75 bonus at the six-month mark, if the student has saved $120 in those first six months. In total, our program provides up to $761 of matching funds for each account.
   
   With $100,000, we can do this for 131 L.A. students. Because the Department of Health and Human Services will match this, that $100,000 becomes $200,000—and doubles the number of students helped to 262. That’s the three Morales brothers, plus 259 more young people in L.A. who otherwise will not be able to attend and complete college. Together, YPI and LA2050 can do it.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE starts with an initial five-year plan to provide
  triple-matched college savings accounts to 1,300 low-income L.A. students,
  while concurrently providing them and their families with financial literacy
  classes, college financial aid workshops, and one-on-one financial coaching.
  After this initial term, we plan to extend and expand the program for another
  long-term period that can provide this opportunity to an additional 2,600
  students—doubling our current number of students. 
   
   We can do this—and support this model throughout our L.A. region—by continuing to view the program in the scope of high-touch, individualized, and place-based support for youth and their families, providing them with a holistic range of services that create empowerment and change for all aspects of their learning and their lives. We will continue collaborating with community organizations, government programs, and private funders to ensure future success for these L.A. students.
   
   As the program continues and expands, we will be mindful of re-shaping it to meet family, neighborhood, and community needs. Financial education curriculum and design of matched savings accounts will be replicated through staff training and strong relationships with financial institutions. But other components—such as participant outreach and retention (regular savings deposits)—will be customized based on language, cultural, and other considerations specific to the many communities, populations, and traditions that are part of our L.A. landscape.
   
   Our L.A. landscape is itself a dynamic element of change. Partnering with LA2050, we’re optimistic that by the year 2050 the beneficiaries of these matched college savings accounts will be sending their own children to college—part of a tradition of learning in Los Angeles where everyone who wishes for, envisions, and strives for college enrollment and completion can achieve it.

  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "The entirety of the $100,000 for YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE will go directly into the College Savings Individual Development Accounts of low-income L.A. students who will otherwise not be able to afford college.\r\n\r\nWhen a student saves $220 in his/her account, our program adds triple that amount—bringing the account to $880. Our program also provides an initial sign-up bonus of $26, as well as a $75 bonus at the six-month mark, if the student has saved $120 in those first six months. In total, our program provides up to $761 of matching funds for each account.\r\n\r\nWith $100,000, we can do this for 131 L.A. students. Because the Department of Health and Human Services will match this, that $100,000 becomes $200,000—and doubles the number of students helped to 262. That’s the three Morales brothers, plus 259 more young people in L.A. who otherwise will not be able to attend and complete college. Together, YPI and LA2050 can do it."

  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE starts with an initial five-year plan to provide triple-matched college savings accounts to 1,300 low-income L.A. students, while concurrently providing them and their families with financial literacy classes, college financial aid workshops, and one-on-one financial coaching. After this initial term, we plan to extend and expand the program for another long-term period that can provide this opportunity to an additional 2,600 students—doubling our current number of students. \r\n\r\nWe can do this—and support this model throughout our L.A. region—by continuing to view the program in the scope of high-touch, individualized, and place-based support for youth and their families, providing them with a holistic range of services that create empowerment and change for all aspects of their learning and their lives. We will continue collaborating with community organizations, government programs, and private funders to ensure future success for these L.A. students.\r\n\r\nAs the program continues and expands, we will be mindful of re-shaping it to meet family, neighborhood, and community needs. Financial education curriculum and design of matched savings accounts will be replicated through staff training and strong relationships with financial institutions. But other components—such as participant outreach and retention (regular savings deposits)—will be customized based on language, cultural, and other considerations specific to the many communities, populations, and traditions that are part of our L.A. landscape.\r\n\r\nOur L.A. landscape is itself a dynamic element of change. Partnering with LA2050, we’re optimistic that by the year 2050 the beneficiaries of these matched college savings accounts will be sending their own children to college—part of a tradition of learning in Los Angeles where everyone who wishes for, envisions, and strives for college enrollment and completion can achieve it."

      college through financial education and a unique 3:1 match that puts $981
      into special savings accounts for 1,300 students who otherwise may not be
      able to afford school. $981 is the gap to cover community college costs
      after financial aid, an amount that also makes it three times more likely
      students will enroll in college—and four times more likely they’ll

    explanation: ''
    answer: "L.A. is a wonderful place to learn, but only for those with access to opportunities. At the college level, access includes funds for entry and graduation. YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE provides funding and financial education, along with academic and college readiness support, to help L.A. families learn and thrive. \r\n\r\nAn L.A. family earning less than $30,000 annually receives an average of $5,819 in financial aid toward the $6,800 annual cost of an L.A. community college. That leaves $981 still needed to make it happen. YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE steps in to provide this with special College Savings Individual Development Accounts paired with financial education, financial aid workshops, and one-on-one financial coaching. \r\n\r\nTake Ricardo Morales, who is a student at College of the Canyons. He’s majoring in architecture. His brother Juan Daniel attends L.A. Mission College as a business major. Their youngest brother Jose is a senior in high school and hopes to attend college as well. Their family strongly believes in the importance of education, and the brothers are motivated to succeed, but their family has been concerned about the money it will take to help all three of them graduate. “I thought my children weren’t going to be able to go to college because we didn’t have the resources,” their mother says.\r\n\r\nBut the family found YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE, and all three sons signed up. With generous support from LA2050, all three can receive matching funds needed to help them achieve their college dreams. \r\n\r\nBecause YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE isn’t just a match. For every dollar a student puts into their account, our program will TRIPLE the amount, up to $660. Factor in two bonuses provided by the program, and suddenly each student has the $981 they need to cover what is otherwise a daunting funding gap for many low-income students.\r\n\r\nBut this can only happen if—and only if—YPI receives $100,000 to match U.S. Department of Health and Human Services funds already in hand, because current YPI funding does not cover the match requirements. The support of LA2050 is vital to ensure that at least 262 more low-income L.A. students will have access to learn, changing their lives, their families’ lives, and the landscape of our city. \r\n\r\nBy 2050, not only will these students be college graduates—so will their children. Leveling the playing field and creating opportunity: That’s how we make L.A. the best place to learn."
  - name: >-
      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "The major strength of YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE is also its major barrier: providing a triple match to L.A. students in need. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will match deposits dollar-for-dollar, up to $494,650. That would mean putting $761 into the bank accounts of 1,300 low-income students. \r\n\r\nThis doesn’t just cover the gap for one year of college. The Assets and Education Initiative of the Corporation for Enterprise Development reports that children with even $500 saved for college are three times more likely to enroll in college and four times more likely to graduate from college.\r\n\r\nYPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE can therefore make it four times more likely that 1,300 young low-income L.A. students graduate college, profoundly changing their lives and the lives of their families for years to come. But we must raise $494,650 in nonfederal, private funds to make this happen. And $100,000 from LA2050 is a big part of this."

    answer: "For YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE partnership with LA2050, we will evaluate our success based on achieving these goals: \r\n\r\nAt least 262 low-income students open matched College Savings Individual Development Accounts to receive $26 sign-up bonus.\r\n\r\nEach student saves at least $220 to receive 3:1 match.\r\n\r\nEach student makes deposits for six consecutive months to receive a $75 bonus match.\r\n\r\nIn total, YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE students supported by LA2050 save over $250,000 to use for their college education (including students’ savings and matching funds).\r\n\r\nAt least 262 students receive financial literacy education, financial coaching, and participate in a financial aid workshop to increase their financial capability.\r\n\r\nAt least 262 students enroll in or continue college.\r\n\r\nThis evaluation will allow us to see how YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE serves students like the Morales brothers and how, working together, we can change lives and transform the L.A. landscape."

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE is a unique program and resource for the City of Los Angeles, because we integrate this program—and the students it supports—into a larger set of high-touch services for students and their families, all geared toward the goals of increasing academic achievement, elevating income, and improving access to support as we work to eradicate intergenerational poverty.\r\n\r\nThere are four other L.A.-based organizations currently providing College Savings Individual Development Accounts to students. All are valuable members of our community, but they are all more narrowly focused on economic development. None of them provide YPI’s holistic array of individualized, wrap-around services that further create change in the lives of the students benefiting from college matched savings accounts. YPI does this not only through the financial literacy classes, financial aid workshops, and one-on-one financial counseling that we require as part of YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE, but also through college and career preparatory programs and counseling provided for our low-income families.\r\n\r\nThis represents only one portion of our cradle-to-college-and-career continuum of programming that assists more than 100,000 people across 125 sites, including the students and families who will benefit from YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE. We operate five schools (three public charter and two LAUSD), 78 afterschool programs, and we’ve opened 83 Public Computer Centers. Our services include an extensive range of programs that encourage lifespan learning and self-sufficiency, such as academic tutoring; GED, ESL, and professional development programs; college preparation; job readiness and employment assistance; school dropout prevention services; reconnection services for out-of-school youth; early childhood development services; parenting education; health education and referral services; legal services; and individualized case management. All of these services are free of charge, and together with YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE, provide an immersive and wide-scope set of opportunities for students and their families to change their lives—and therefore to change the landscape our city now and in 2050."

      this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner
      receive?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "We are honored to have many L.A. organizations collaborating with us to maximize YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE, but none of them would receive any portion of this grant award. Nor would YPI. Every single dollar of the $100,000 grant will go directly into matched college savings accounts for these ambitious L.A. students in need, like the Morales brothers.\r\n\r\nAlthough none of our partners are receiving any direct funding to support this project, they are deeply committed to making this program—and our families—thrive. YPI is working with a large and diverse array of collaborators to help us identify and recruit the initial 1,300 low-income students who will open matched college savings account during the first five years of our program, including LAUSD; the City of L.A.’s Housing & Community Investment Department FamilySource Centers; the City of L.A.’s Economic & Workforce Development Department YouthSource Centers; the Local Initiatives Support Corporation-funded Financial Opportunity Center; the Mexican Consulate; the Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs; El Nido Family Centers; Hollygrove; Hollywood Community Housing Corporation; Korean Churches for Community Development; Los Angeles City College; Los Angeles Mission College; MEND; the Salvadoran American Leadership and Education Fund; the Thai Community Development Center; and the UCLA Community Based Learning Program.\r\n\r\nYPI is collaborating with Citi Community Development and Junior Achievement Finance Park to provide financial workshops and one-on-one financial counseling for our enrolled students and their families. We are also collaborating with AmeriCorps to provide College & Career Ambassadors and one-on-one college and career support to these undeserved students, which includes individualized counseling and workshops to help understand financial aid opportunities and complete financial aid applications. For banking access for the participating students, we are partnering with Citibank Financial Services to provide each student with a College Savings Individual Development Account through its Citi Microfinance Platform. \r\n\r\nBy working together, we look forward to putting $100,000 directly into the savings accounts of these L.A. students in need so they can graduate college and change the lives of their families for decades to come—the year 2050 and beyond."

      How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you
      cover the additional costs?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "The initial five years of YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE has a projected budget of $1,163,882. This amount establishes College Savings Individual Development Accounts for 1,300 low-income L.A. students and provides each of them with $761 in savings accounts funds ($660 in triple-match and $101 in savings incentives). This five-year budget also covers costs for financial literacy classes, financial aid workshops, and one-on-one financial counseling—all of which are required elements for each student and family enrolled in YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE, in order to help ensure successful progress and completion. This budget also covers all personnel and administrative costs associated for five years of the program.\r\n\r\nYPI was honored to receive an Assets for Independence (AFI) grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which will cover 50% of this five-year budget—so long as we can match it with private funds. YPI therefore now has a profound opportunity to affect post-secondary success for L.A. students in need, but we can only do so with the participation of private funders. \r\n\r\nThis is both a humbling endorsement of our work and a call to do even better, in our longstanding mission to provide high quality education and much needed wraparound services to at-risk youth and families. While YPI has been successful in securing public funding, including this valuable Department of Health and Human Services grant, government grants are highly restrictive and do not cover all program costs. Private support helps our government dollars work harder and smarter, and shifting YPI’s internal systems in this much-needed way can only be done with the help of donors who see the value of its long-term impact. United Way of Greater Los Angeles is already joining us in creating this impact, and we will continue to pursue this extraordinarily necessary private funding through foundation grants and individual donors. \r\n\r\nAn award of $100,000 through LA2050 and the Goldhirsh Foundation will profoundly impact this program and the landscape of learning in Los Angeles. YPI cannot meet the needs of our families for college financial assistance without your help."

    answer: "The entirety of the $100,000 for YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE will go directly into the College Savings Individual Development Accounts of low-income L.A. students who will otherwise not be able to afford college.\r\n\r\nWhen a student saves $220 in his/her account, our program adds triple that amount—bringing the account to $880. Our program also provides an initial sign-up bonus of $26, as well as a $75 bonus at the six-month mark, if the student has saved $120 in those first six months. In total, our program provides up to $761 of matching funds for each account.\r\n\r\nWith $100,000, we can do this for 131 L.A. students. Because the Department of Health and Human Services will match this, that $100,000 becomes $200,000—and doubles the number of students helped to 262. That’s the three Morales brothers, plus 259 more young people in L.A. who otherwise will not be able to attend and complete college. Together, YPI and LA2050 can do it."

    answer: "YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE starts with an initial five-year plan to provide triple-matched college savings accounts to 1,300 low-income L.A. students, while concurrently providing them and their families with financial literacy classes, college financial aid workshops, and one-on-one financial coaching. After this initial term, we plan to extend and expand the program for another long-term period that can provide this opportunity to an additional 2,600 students—doubling our current number of students. \r\n\r\nWe can do this—and support this model throughout our L.A. region—by continuing to view the program in the scope of high-touch, individualized, and place-based support for youth and their families, providing them with a holistic range of services that create empowerment and change for all aspects of their learning and their lives. We will continue collaborating with community organizations, government programs, and private funders to ensure future success for these L.A. students.\r\n\r\nAs the program continues and expands, we will be mindful of re-shaping it to meet family, neighborhood, and community needs. Financial education curriculum and design of matched savings accounts will be replicated through staff training and strong relationships with financial institutions. But other components—such as participant outreach and retention (regular savings deposits)—will be customized based on language, cultural, and other considerations specific to the many communities, populations, and traditions that are part of our L.A. landscape.\r\n\r\nOur L.A. landscape is itself a dynamic element of change. Partnering with LA2050, we’re optimistic that by the year 2050 the beneficiaries of these matched college savings accounts will be sending their own children to college—part of a tradition of learning in Los Angeles where everyone who wishes for, envisions, and strives for college enrollment and completion can achieve it."
