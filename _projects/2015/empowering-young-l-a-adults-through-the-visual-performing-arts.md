  Throughout the following year PIECES will be expanding its programming to
  better serve its growing number of young artists seeking a place to grow
  artistically and to create. To effectively do so, we will offer more
  professional learning opportunities, conduct outreach to secure more
  volunteers, mentors and staff, as well as organize events for the community
  that showcase the work of our members. Our purpose for doing this is to ensure
  that more and more of our young artists find success.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  By expanding, PIECES will be filling the void there is of available places for
  young people to create. For young artists 18-25 years of age, who outgrow
  after-school programs, graduate or that drop out of school, a place like
  PIECES plays a vital role in whether or not they aspire to do greater things
  or settle for less in life. 
   
   Our experience with this overlooked age group has been that since they are no longer considered children and therefore lose various types of support, they can truly lose track of their dreams while trying to figure out how to live in their new roles as adults.
   
   Through the community at PIECES, we all learn that we have the power to succeed in what we work hard for, if we continuously are open to learning, and that we have a stronger voice when we unite our creative minds. 
   
   PIECES creates opportunities, a support system, a community – what many of our current members call their second home. We would like to bring what we have to all of the young artists living in the West Los Angeles area and to those who travel from across L.A. County to participate in our programs. We will be providing enriching and fulfilling opportunities with a mission of sparking creativity, success, innovation and union.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Our main obstacle has always been that not everyone in our community sees the
  importance of the arts and in offering opportunities in the arts. Highlighting
  more success stories that will come from reaching a larger number of young
  people in our community will serve as proof that the arts can lead to success
  and do enrich people and the communities surrounding them.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  PIECES keeps track of membership and volunteer numbers by requiring all
  members and volunteers to complete a free application. We also keep track of
  attendance through sign-in sheets for every event, class, meeting and
  workshop. 
   
   We are able to track whether or not we have been able to reach and retain a larger number of young artists and volunteers through the count in application numbers and attendance names. 
   
   Most importantly, we focus each day on providing valuable experiences for the young people that we serve. Records of learning, paid and unpaid professional opportunities are kept to ensure that we are keeping true to our mission.
   
   To better understand the experiences, needs and opinions of our volunteers, guests and members, we will be introducing an anonymous suggestion box and surveys.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Most organizations that focus on the visual and/or performing arts only serve
  artists up to the age of 18. We have come across at least two organizations
  that serve our age group (18-25). 
   
   From our research, what makes us unique and effective is the fact that we are able to provide a wide array of professional opportunities (both paid and unpaid), instruction and mentorship; all while promoting our members as artists and not as at-risk youth. It is important to us to have our artists feel like artists and for our community to see them as such. This has helped open the doors to life changing opportunities for our members and has helped build a tight-knit, supportive community and a feeling of pride and achievement among them.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': Not applicable.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  Having been operating for three years, we can safely estimate that the total
  cost of us fulfilling our goals for this new year will not cost over $100,000.
  We estimate that the maximum amount that we will need to cover programming and
  general operations expenses will be $89,000.00.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-

How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  We will scale the success of our proposal by matching our current membership
  and attendance numbers to the following year's. We will also match the number
  of events we organized and participated in, the number of new workshops,
  classes and professional opportunities we were able to provide for our
  members, compared to previous years. 
   
   Social media follows and likes, newsletter subscriptions will also tell whether or not we were able to reach more people in our community than before. 
   
   Furthermore, the results from surveys will tell how effective our attempts of reaching and serving our community have been.
