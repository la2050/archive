Where will you be working?:
  - East LA
  - South LA
  - Westside
  - LAUSD
How do you plan to use these resources to make change?:
  - Expand a pilot or a program
How will your proposal improve the following “Create” metrics?:
  - Employment in the creative industries
  - Minority- and women-owned firms
Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: "1.4 million computer specialist job openings are expected in the U.S. by 2020, but only 30% of these positions are expected to be filled by U.S. computing graduates. Currently only 12% of engineers are U.S. women; 2% of engineers are women from underrepresented minorities. By teaching and inspiring girls to be interested in coding and giving them the skills to face life’s challenges we are preparing girls to become successful professionals in computer science fields. Girls Inc. takes a comprehensive approach to working with girls with the ultimate goal of on time graduation from high school and the tools needed to attend and graduate from a four year college. Collaborating with Whiz Girls to give the girls the tools to learn coding and stay interested in technology will produce strong, educated and entrepreneurial women. \r\nTo double our impact, not only will we teach coding and entrepreneurship to inner city middle school and high school girls through our healthy balanced lifestyle way of life including meditation/yoga, etc,  We will empower teachers and train them with WhizGirls Academy curriculum as well.Our goal is to empower these girls with entrepreneurship skills and create empowered leaders. Essentially we are fostering the girls and giving them the digital skills to survive and thrive in the digital age that we live in.  And  most importantly we are creating the pipeline of future female tech founders by training them at an early age.  "
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "The effectiveness of the program will be measured by pre-surveys, post-surveys, and a follow-up survey one year after participation. Evaluation results will help us:\r\nMonitor girls’ knowledge and skills as they progress through the program.\r\nTailor our programming to fit the needs of girls.\r\nReport to funders about our progress. \r\nKeep in touch with alumnae as they enter college and the workforce.\r\n"
