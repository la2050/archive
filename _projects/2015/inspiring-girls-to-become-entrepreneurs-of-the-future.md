  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: "1.4 million computer specialist job openings are expected in the U.S. by 2020, but only 30% of these positions are expected to be filled by U.S. computing graduates. Currently only 12% of engineers are U.S. women; 2% of engineers are women from underrepresented minorities. By teaching and inspiring girls to be interested in coding and giving them the skills to face life’s challenges we are preparing girls to become successful professionals in computer science fields. Girls Inc. takes a comprehensive approach to working with girls with the ultimate goal of on time graduation from high school and the tools needed to attend and graduate from a four year college. Collaborating with Whiz Girls to give the girls the tools to learn coding and stay interested in technology will produce strong, educated and entrepreneurial women. \r\nTo double our impact, not only will we teach coding and entrepreneurship to inner city middle school and high school girls through our healthy balanced lifestyle way of life including meditation/yoga, etc,  We will empower teachers and train them with WhizGirls Academy curriculum as well.Our goal is to empower these girls with entrepreneurship skills and create empowered leaders. Essentially we are fostering the girls and giving them the digital skills to survive and thrive in the digital age that we live in.  And  most importantly we are creating the pipeline of future female tech founders by training them at an early age.  "

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    Working with girls from vulnerable communities brings the challenge of
    working with girls who have not had the same exposure to technology as their
    counterparts in wealthier communities. The education gap will be addressed
    by utilizing age appropriate, fun activities that break coding down into
    easily understable lessons. Having trained, professional staff and
    volunteers working with the girls creates a safe, all-girl environment which
    promotes learning. At WhizGirls Academy, our challenges have been hiring
    full time teachers that know how to code and feel comfortable with
    technology.
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "The effectiveness of the program will be measured by pre-surveys, post-surveys, and a follow-up survey one year after participation. Evaluation results will help us:\r\nMonitor girls’ knowledge and skills as they progress through the program.\r\nTailor our programming to fit the needs of girls.\r\nReport to funders about our progress. \r\nKeep in touch with alumnae as they enter college and the workforce.\r\n"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    There are no other organizations taking a holistic approach to meet the
    needs of girls. Girls Inc. addresses these needs and delivers age
    appropriate programming from 1st through 12th grade. WhizGirls Academy also
    takes a holistic approach, not only teaching coding but also incorporating
    physical activity and meditation to support a well rounded experience. 
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    Girls Inc LA and WhizGirls Academy will collaborate and will equally receive
    $50,000 to implement the project.
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    The key to success is having trained, professional staff and volunteers as
    mentors for the girls. Partnering with school districts allow easier access
    for the girls to participate in the programs. Recruiting teachers and
    volunteers to support the work will further expand the reach and impact of
    the program allowing for more girls to participate.
