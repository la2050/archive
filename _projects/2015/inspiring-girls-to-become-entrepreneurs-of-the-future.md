'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  1.4 million computer specialist job openings are expected in the U.S. by 2020,
  but only 30% of these positions are expected to be filled by U.S. computing
  graduates. Currently only 12% of engineers are U.S. women; 2% of engineers are
  women from underrepresented minorities. By teaching and inspiring girls to be
  interested in coding and giving them the skills to face life’s challenges we
  are preparing girls to become successful professionals in computer science
  fields. Girls Inc. takes a comprehensive approach to working with girls with
  the ultimate goal of on time graduation from high school and the tools needed
  to attend and graduate from a four year college. Collaborating with Whiz Girls
  to give the girls the tools to learn coding and stay interested in technology
  will produce strong, educated and entrepreneurial women. 
   To double our impact, not only will we teach coding and entrepreneurship to inner city middle school and high school girls through our healthy balanced lifestyle way of life including meditation/yoga, etc, We will empower teachers and train them with WhizGirls Academy curriculum as well.Our goal is to empower these girls with entrepreneurship skills and create empowered leaders. Essentially we are fostering the girls and giving them the digital skills to survive and thrive in the digital age that we live in. And most importantly we are creating the pipeline of future female tech founders by training them at an early age.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Working with girls from vulnerable communities brings the challenge of working
  with girls who have not had the same exposure to technology as their
  counterparts in wealthier communities. The education gap will be addressed by
  utilizing age appropriate, fun activities that break coding down into easily
  understable lessons. Having trained, professional staff and volunteers working
  with the girls creates a safe, all-girl environment which promotes learning.
  At WhizGirls Academy, our challenges have been hiring full time teachers that
  know how to code and feel comfortable with technology.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  The effectiveness of the program will be measured by pre-surveys,
  post-surveys, and a follow-up survey one year after participation. Evaluation
  results will help us:
   Monitor girls’ knowledge and skills as they progress through the program.
   Tailor our programming to fit the needs of girls.
   Report to funders about our progress. 
   Keep in touch with alumnae as they enter college and the workforce.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There are no other organizations taking a holistic approach to meet the needs
  of girls. Girls Inc. addresses these needs and delivers age appropriate
  programming from 1st through 12th grade. WhizGirls Academy also takes a
  holistic approach, not only teaching coding but also incorporating physical
  activity and meditation to support a well rounded experience.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Girls Inc LA and WhizGirls Academy will collaborate and will equally receive
  $50,000 to implement the project.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  The cost of the Girls Inc. program for this project is $133,000. Board member
  contributions of $50,000 have been designated to cover overhead so that all
  remaining donations will go directly to program. The balance of $33,000 will
  be funded through the Girls Inc. LA Celebration Luncheon.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-

  volunteers to support the work will further expand the reach and impact of the

    answer: "1.4 million computer specialist job openings are expected in the U.S. by 2020, but only 30% of these positions are expected to be filled by U.S. computing graduates. Currently only 12% of engineers are U.S. women; 2% of engineers are women from underrepresented minorities. By teaching and inspiring girls to be interested in coding and giving them the skills to face life’s challenges we are preparing girls to become successful professionals in computer science fields. Girls Inc. takes a comprehensive approach to working with girls with the ultimate goal of on time graduation from high school and the tools needed to attend and graduate from a four year college. Collaborating with Whiz Girls to give the girls the tools to learn coding and stay interested in technology will produce strong, educated and entrepreneurial women. \r\nTo double our impact, not only will we teach coding and entrepreneurship to inner city middle school and high school girls through our healthy balanced lifestyle way of life including meditation/yoga, etc,  We will empower teachers and train them with WhizGirls Academy curriculum as well.Our goal is to empower these girls with entrepreneurship skills and create empowered leaders. Essentially we are fostering the girls and giving them the digital skills to survive and thrive in the digital age that we live in.  And  most importantly we are creating the pipeline of future female tech founders by training them at an early age.  "

      Working with girls from vulnerable communities brings the challenge of
      working with girls who have not had the same exposure to technology as
      their counterparts in wealthier communities. The education gap will be
      addressed by utilizing age appropriate, fun activities that break coding
      down into easily understable lessons. Having trained, professional staff
      and volunteers working with the girls creates a safe, all-girl environment
      which promotes learning. At WhizGirls Academy, our challenges have been
      hiring full time teachers that know how to code and feel comfortable with
      technology.

      The key to success is having trained, professional staff and volunteers as
      mentors for the girls. Partnering with school districts allow easier
      access for the girls to participate in the programs. Recruiting teachers
      and volunteers to support the work will further expand the reach and
      impact of the program allowing for more girls to participate.
