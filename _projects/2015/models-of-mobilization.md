title: Models of Mobilization
project_summary: >-
  TreePeople will conduct a pilot-to-scale project in two communities that will
  determine what inhibits and motivates people to take specific environmental
  actions related to rainwater harvesting and tree canopy, based on
  socioeconomic, cultural, and environmental characteristics.  With the
  information we learn, we will create models to mobilize similar communities
  throughout LA, which has the potential to reduce water importation by at least
  40% and increase tree canopy to an equitable 25%.

Where will you be working?:
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South LA
  - County of Los Angeles
  - City of Los Angeles
  - LAUSD
  - >-
    The pilot will hone in on Huntington Park and Pacoima.  Countywide scaling
    to follow. 
How do you plan to use these resources to make change?:
  - Conduct research
  - Engage residents and stakeholders
  - Implement a pilot or new project
  - Mobilize for systems change
How will your proposal improve the following “Live” metrics?:
  - Exposure to air toxins
  - Percent of imported water
  - Percentage of tree canopy cover (Dream Metric)
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Ultimately, we will consider the project a success if it produces replicable
  models that can be implemented more broadly in similar communities in the LA
  region.  Short-term success is based on outputs listed previously (homeowners
  trained, rainwater harvesting projects completed, residents and students
  engaged, trees planted and cared for). Measurement tools include
  TreeMapLA.org, a mobile tool created by TreePeople that tallies eco-benefits
  of trees based on their individual traits, like species and size.  Water
  benefits will be measured by square footage of landscape transformed, and/or
  gallons of rain captured through rain barrels.  We will use CBSM surveys to
  measure people-related results related to barriers and motivators.  TreePeople
  uses an organizational database, Salesforce, to record and store all program
  data, such as workshops given, number and identity of attendees, project
  volunteers, quantity of rain barrels distributed, location, number and species
  of trees planted.  
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
  - Money (financial capital)
  - Volunteers/staff (human capital)
  - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
  - Community outreach
