  TreePeople will conduct a pilot-to-scale project in two communities that will
  determine what inhibits and motivates people to take specific environmental
  actions related to rainwater harvesting and tree canopy, based on
  socioeconomic, cultural, and environmental characteristics. With the
  information we learn, we will create models to mobilize similar communities
  throughout LA, which has the potential to reduce water importation by at least
  40% and increase tree canopy to an equitable 25%.
Please specify below: >-
  The pilot will hone in on Huntington Park and Pacoima. Countywide scaling to
  follow.

  To meet LA’s needs, TreePeople’s Strategic Vision goals over the next 10 years
  are to increase tree canopy throughout LA to an equitable 25% and to develop a
  water supply that is at least 50% locally sourced. Our proposed program,
  Models of Mobilization, will engage Angelenos in making LA more livable by
  creating replicable models to inspire changes at the community level related
  to climate resilience, air quality and water conservation. 
   
   This innovative series of hands-on pilot projects, based in multiple schools as well as two environmental justice areas, Huntington Park and Pacoima/NE San Fernando Valley, will develop models of community engagement to scale throughout LA County.
   
   Activities include the following:
   • Teach rainwater harvesting practices to at least 700 households, covering turf removal, drought-resistant landscaping, and rainwater harvesting techniques;
    
   • Test best practices with residents in Huntington Park to increase tree canopy through long-term stewardship of the urban forest through tree planting and tree care activities;
    
   • Engage residents in under-served areas of the NE San Fernando Valley to explore rainwater harvesting and landscape transformation at residences and schools;
   
   • Train and support at least 150 teachers to bring water conservation and recycling action projects to their classrooms and schoolyards; guide at least 4,000 students in projects on campus, impacting 150,000 students across LA County.
   
   To prepare for bringing this program to a wider scale, these pilot projects will use of Community Based Social Marketing practices through tree planting and tree care programs with local residents, as well as student training and teacher professional development in K-12 schools county-wide.
    
   Carrying out these projects encompasses the following steps: 
   (1) Assess environmental needs; (2) Gauge community readiness; (3) Test behavior change strategies; (4) Connect with new and current partners; (5) Educate and train communities about simple and practical ways to improve urgent and longer-term environmental issues; (6) Implement projects (turf removal, landscape transformation, rain barrel installation, tree planting and tree care) at residential, community, or school sites; (7) Follow-up with participants to analyze endurance of lifestyle changes; (8) Evaluate data based on socioeconomic and geographic characteristics; and (9) Create models for scaling up to effect larger change.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Since 2012, TreePeople has had an active exchange with multiple Australian
  cities, to learn from their experience with a 12-year drought. We have learned
  of several barriers to engaging in eco-friendly behavior, which range from
  lack of knowledge to busy lives and financial strains. The approach we are
  using involves deep listening to understand what prevents people from taking
  action. For example, in low-income environmental justice areas like the
  communities in this project, we’ve found a major barrier to be the cost
  involved with implementing tree canopy and rainwater harvesting activities.
  TreePeople is addressing this barrier by working with businesses, local
  government agencies and utilities to provide rebates and other financial
  incentives that render the costs to next-to nothing. At the same time, we are
  testing types of rewards (monetary, social recognition, altruism) that prove
  most effective at sustaining the behavior long-term for those who do take
  initial actions.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Ultimately, we will consider the project a success if it produces replicable
  models that can be implemented more broadly in similar communities in the LA
  region. Short-term success is based on outputs listed previously (homeowners
  trained, rainwater harvesting projects completed, residents and students
  engaged, trees planted and cared for). Measurement tools include
  TreeMapLA.org, a mobile tool created by TreePeople that tallies eco-benefits
  of trees based on their individual traits, like species and size. Water
  benefits will be measured by square footage of landscape transformed, and/or
  gallons of rain captured through rain barrels. We will use CBSM surveys to
  measure people-related results related to barriers and motivators. TreePeople
  uses an organizational database, Salesforce, to record and store all program
  data, such as workshops given, number and identity of attendees, project
  volunteers, quantity of rain barrels distributed, location, number and species
  of trees planted.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  TreePeople has led much of the effort to capture stormwater at the parcel
  level since the 1990s – work that is now coming to notable fruition. A
  Multi-Agency Collaborative (MAC), initiated and facilitated by TreePeople is
  focused on integrated management to capture stormwater in a distributed,
  decentralized way (see Partners section). Supporting this are results of the
  Stormwater Capture Master Plan, completed in 2015 as a result of TreePeople’s
  partnership with LA Dept. of Water & Power. Both the MAC and the Master Plan
  highlight the need for distributed stormwater capture at homes and schools in
  order to build a local water supply over the next 20 years.
   
   We are taking a comprehensive approach to the issues of water supply and tree canopy, partnering with and training neighborhood councils, industry professionals, and home improvement stores to create a holistic nexus of support that will reach a maximum number of community members who will what they need to make water-friendly changes to their homes. This network will create a groundswell of “innovators”, which will lead to a large mobilization of the public to capture rainwater at home. 
   
   TreePeople’s comprehensive emphasis on both policy change and community engagement – a “top-down and bottom-up approach” is rare among environmental organizations. TreePeople’s role as a leader that coalesces people and guides them to take responsibility for their own homes, schools, and neighborhoods is unique. Nobody that we know in LA can fill those shoes at the present time. 
   
   That said, we believe strongly that sustainability is achievable only with an engaged, committed, educated, and prepared populace and we must work in partnership with other environmental and community organizations as well as government agencies in order to do so. TreePeople is the only nonprofit in LA that is touching upon all audiences – the schools, government agencies, corporate partners, the media and the general public – to drive change toward rainwater harvesting as well as a healthy tree canopy. There are other organizations, that are focused on planting and caring for trees and we often work together on a project basis - such as City Plants, Northeast Trees, and LA Conservation Corps. We also work regularly on water policy issues with Heal the Bay and Council for Watershed Health.

  TreePeople’s partners are critical to its work, as they are the vehicle that
  moves our ideas forward. The philosophy of all of TreePeople’s programs is to
  engender a sense of personal responsibility to care for the environment, which
  is the best way to influence long-term environmental stewardship. To that end,
  our most important partners are those who connect us to the people of Los
  Angeles. These include the Neighborhood Council Sustainability Alliance,
  Communities for a Better Environment, Pacoima Beautiful, and hundreds of K-12
  school campuses. 
   
   TreePeople is leading a revolution in water conservation in Los Angeles, through a Multi-Agency Collaboration (MAC) with the three leading water agencies: LA Dept. of Water & Power, and LA County and LA City Public Works Departments. Other strategic relationships, including MOUs or other contracts, have been established with multiple government agencies including LA Unified School District Office of Sustainability, Metro Area Transit, US Forest Service (Angeles Forest), City of LA Dept. of Recreation & Parks, and City of Huntington Park. Industry and corporate partners include Tetra Tech, ARCSA (rainwater catchment professionals) and Macerich Malls. 
   
   Our community-based partners play an important role in the pilot, as they provide the milieu for our outreach efforts and they essentially have a ready-made constituency with clearly defined sociological indices. At the community level, TreePeople will provide trainings to homeowners, school children and water industry professionals. To do so, we are partnering with home improvement stores and retail malls, the American Rainwater Catchment Systems Association (ARCSA), plumbers’ union, and the Neighborhood Council Sustainability Alliance. Trainings will give audiences vital understanding of new technologies and practices related to landscape transformation, cistern installation and care, and proper use of multiple forms of water.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  The lean budget to carry out Models of Mobilization in the two communities is
  $305,000. The supportive elements, including policy and systemic policy work,
  along with work with the schools, increases the comprehensive and supportive
  budget to $1,030,000. We have funding for most of the supportive elements but
  are seeking funds from the LA2050 Challenge to launch the pilot project in the
  communities of Huntington Park and Pacoima.

How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  The Models of Mobilization pilot-to-scale project will determine the best ways
  to mobilize LA communities most impacted by environmental justice issues to
  protect their health and make livable neighborhoods by adopting eco-friendly
  behavior in relation to trees and water. Because we believe strongly that the
  only way to ensure LA becomes more sustainable is to lead people in taking
  personal responsibility for the environment, we have designed this project to
  create turnkey models based on socioeconomic, geographic, and environmental
  characteristics. These models will then be ready to be applied in communities
  with similar characteristics. 
   
   To support scaling, the MAC is also bringing the public water agencies together to determine how to achieve similar goals at the systemic level. The MAC is helping to break down walls that have existed between these agencies – and their budgets – for decades. The long-term results could include more efficiency in resource management, along with funding to support community-based and home-based projects in our region that provide multiple benefits for the public, including water security, water quality, flood protection, energy efficiency, access to green space and local jobs.
   
   Scaling efforts will combine the data and models produced by this project with our “success formula” which multiplies the following: (a) Educating and engaging people with nature-based solutions (landscape transformation, rainwater capture, etc); (b) Developing and implementing communications tools and strategies to mobilize a critical mass; (c) Creating partnerships at the community and systemic levels for better urban ecosystem management; (d) Drive policy changes that promote green infrastructure at all government levels. 
   
   Much of TreePeople’s community-based work is focused on environmental justice areas, where pollution is high, eco-assets are low, and socioeconomic challenges are immense. When people think of human rights, they often think of civil liberties, workplace protections, and the right to happiness. Trees and water aren’t what usually come to mind. But it is trees and water – and their many benefits – that have a tremendous impact on wellness and health. Bringing people together for community projects that raise the environmental assets makes neighborhoods cleaner, healthier, and more livable.
