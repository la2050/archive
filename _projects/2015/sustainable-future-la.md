Schools would be encouraged and supported through the pilot to connect students, their families, and other community members in collaborations to implement environmentally friendly projects such as planting trees on and around campus to reduce the heat island effect in their community, or install rain barrels and rain gardens. The Los Angeles World’s Fair will work to develop partnerships in furtherance of this goal.\r\n\r\nSuccessful implementation of the pilot, and subsequently scaling to schools in other communities, would improve the resiliency of these communities by helping reduce the impacts of climate change -- for example, climate change is expected to increase the number of extreme heat days by 50% -- increasing tree canopy coverage would create a virtuous cycle -- reducing the heat island effect and therefore the need for additional energy and water to run air conditioning, which in turn would reduce the generation of additional greenhouse gas emissions.\r\n\r\nBased on the success of the pilot, additional modules would be developed in the future to provide deeper dives into specific sustainability topics.\r\n"

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    Adoption of the curriculum by schools may be a challenge.  Our goal is to
    develop strategic partnerships with organizations that have existing
    relationships with schools/ districts that would be able to influence  the
    adoption of this program on a pilot basis.  Assistance from LA2050 would be
    greatly appreciated! The provision of the curriculum at no cost to the
    schools, and bringing grant funds to bear to support community outreach for
    projects, such as tree planting, are expected to be significant factors in
    overcoming these obstacles.
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "We will:\r\n- Survey pilot schools to determine their bike/walk/transit scores before and after delivery of the curriculum.\r\n- Track the number of trees planted through the program, and project tree canopy coverage at maturity.\r\n- Assess students’ knowledge about sustainability issues at the beginning and end of the curriculum.\r\n- Engage and track numbers of family and community members involved in curriculum supported activities.\r\n- Track the number of schools willing to participate in the initial and subsequent phases of the pilot.\r\n"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "LA DWP has a free-tree program, as does TreePeople -- their efforts are complementary, and we are exploring partnerships with both.  The Metropolitan Water District and LA DWP have rebate programs for water and energy conservation measures that would help support implementation of potential activities (such as installation of rain barrels, and other water and energy saving devices).\r\n\r\nThis proposed curriculum is unique in trying to help students understand the direct connection between their actions and the global environment, and providing tools and resources to do something about it.\r\n"
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "The U.S. Green Building Council -- Los Angeles Chapter will work with us through: The Green Apple Day of Service program for implementation of projects at schools, and The Center for Green Schools, which can assist in development of the curriculum.\r\n\r\nWe are also exploring partnerships with the Los Angeles Unified School District, TreePeople, and LA DWP.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, all of the grant award would be utilized by the LAWF to support development of curriculum content and the delivery platform, as well as engage schools to participate in the pilot.\r\n\r\nWe expect to engage additional partners  -- local community businesses, nonprofits and local government agencies -- to support implementation of various activities, such as tree planting, installation of rain barrels, and others as identified by the specific schools.\r\n"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "The proposal includes piloting at two levels, both of which will inform decisions about scaling in the future:\r\n\r\nThe initial pilot curriculum will provide a broad introduction to sustainability.  We will assess the effectiveness of this, and the desirability of developing subsequent curricula to provide deeper dives into specific sustainability topics (e.g., transportation, climate change, healthy food).\r\n\r\nThe proposal includes piloting at a small number of schools initially (we currently envision piloting the program at three schools).  The ultimate goal is to scale delivery of the curriculum to additional schools throughout Los Angeles County to maximize its potential impact and help make all communities a better place to live.\r\n"

  Cities now house the majority of the population on the planet, and will bear

   - Track the number of trees planted through the program, and project tree canopy coverage at maturity.
   - Assess students’ knowledge about sustainability issues at the beginning and end of the curriculum.
   - Engage and track numbers of family and community members involved in curriculum supported activities.
   - Track the number of schools willing to participate in the initial and subsequent phases of the pilot.
