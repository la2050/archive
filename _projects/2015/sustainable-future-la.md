  We propose to develop and implement a sustainability curriculum targeted to
  elementary school students. The fun and engaging educational content and
  related activities will provide a broad overview of sustainability, and
  emphasize how everyone is connected and how personal actions can have global
  effects. Our objective is to personalize climate change, and help develop an
  aware generation with the skill set to make and advocate for environmentally
  friendly choices.
