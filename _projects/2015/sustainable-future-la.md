'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Cities now house the majority of the population on the planet, and will bear
  the brunt of climate change-related impacts. We propose to develop and
  implement a sustainability curriculum for elementary school students that will
  personalize climate change, and help develop an aware generation with the
  skill set to make and advocate for environmentally friendly choices, and
  thereby help make Los Angeles a better place to live.
   
   Our proposal consists of a pilot sustainability curriculum to be delivered online so students can access it both in class and at home. The fun and engaging educational content and related activities will provide a broad overview of sustainability -- climate change and greenhouse gases, transportation alternatives, energy, water, waste, heat island effect, healthy food and sustainable living -- and emphasize how everyone and everything is connected and how personal actions can have global effects.
    
   As part of the curriculum, students and parents would be encouraged to implement related activities, such as exploring environmentally friendly transportation options (walking, biking, public transit), and reducing waste, energy and water use on campus and at home. Schools would be encouraged and supported through the pilot to connect students, their families, and other community members in collaborations to implement environmentally friendly projects such as planting trees on and around campus to reduce the heat island effect in their community, or install rain barrels and rain gardens. The Los Angeles World’s Fair will work to develop partnerships in furtherance of this goal.
   
   Successful implementation of the pilot, and subsequently scaling to schools in other communities, would improve the resiliency of these communities by helping reduce the impacts of climate change -- for example, climate change is expected to increase the number of extreme heat days by 50% -- increasing tree canopy coverage would create a virtuous cycle -- reducing the heat island effect and therefore the need for additional energy and water to run air conditioning, which in turn would reduce the generation of additional greenhouse gas emissions.
   
   Based on the success of the pilot, additional modules would be developed in the future to provide deeper dives into specific sustainability topics.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Adoption of the curriculum by schools may be a challenge. Our goal is to
  develop strategic partnerships with organizations that have existing
  relationships with schools/ districts that would be able to influence the
  adoption of this program on a pilot basis. Assistance from LA2050 would be
  greatly appreciated! The provision of the curriculum at no cost to the
  schools, and bringing grant funds to bear to support community outreach for
  projects, such as tree planting, are expected to be significant factors in
  overcoming these obstacles.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: |-
  We will:
   - Survey pilot schools to determine their bike/walk/transit scores before and after delivery of the curriculum.
   - Track the number of trees planted through the program, and project tree canopy coverage at maturity.
   - Assess students’ knowledge about sustainability issues at the beginning and end of the curriculum.
   - Engage and track numbers of family and community members involved in curriculum supported activities.
   - Track the number of schools willing to participate in the initial and subsequent phases of the pilot.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  LA DWP has a free-tree program, as does TreePeople -- their efforts are
  complementary, and we are exploring partnerships with both. The Metropolitan
  Water District and LA DWP have rebate programs for water and energy
  conservation measures that would help support implementation of potential
  activities (such as installation of rain barrels, and other water and energy
  saving devices).
   
   This proposed curriculum is unique in trying to help students understand the direct connection between their actions and the global environment, and providing tools and resources to do something about it.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  The U.S. Green Building Council -- Los Angeles Chapter will work with us
  through: The Green Apple Day of Service program for implementation of projects
  at schools, and The Center for Green Schools, which can assist in development
  of the curriculum.
   
   We are also exploring partnerships with the Los Angeles Unified School District, TreePeople, and LA DWP.
   
   At the moment, all of the grant award would be utilized by the LAWF to support development of curriculum content and the delivery platform, as well as engage schools to participate in the pilot.
   
   We expect to engage additional partners -- local community businesses, nonprofits and local government agencies -- to support implementation of various activities, such as tree planting, installation of rain barrels, and others as identified by the specific schools.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  We have sized development and implementation of the pilot to cost $100,000. We
  also expect to utilize existing programs that would provide resources at no
  cost through donation or rebates, such as trees and rain barrels. The program
  could readily scale should additional funds become available.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-

  24,600
   Sustainability Consultant...........................................................$ 33,500
   Website development/ curriculum delivery consultant ..........$ 13,400
   Outreach/ marketing/ communications ....................................$ 4,700
   Monitoring/measuring/ assessment ....................................... $ 7,800
   Specific project implementation materials...............................$ 5,500
   Administration ............................................................................$ 10,500
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  The proposal includes piloting at two levels, both of which will inform
  decisions about scaling in the future:
   
   The initial pilot curriculum will provide a broad introduction to sustainability. We will assess the effectiveness of this, and the desirability of developing subsequent curricula to provide deeper dives into specific sustainability topics (e.g., transportation, climate change, healthy food).
   
   The proposal includes piloting at a small number of schools initially (we currently envision piloting the program at three schools). The ultimate goal is to scale delivery of the curriculum to additional schools throughout Los Angeles County to maximize its potential impact and help make all communities a better place to live.

      DESCRIBE IN GREATER DETAIL HOW YOU WILL MAKE LA THE HEALTHIEST PLACE TO
      LIVE: 
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Cities now house the majority of the population on the planet, and will bear the brunt of climate change-related impacts. We propose to develop and implement a sustainability curriculum for elementary school students that will personalize climate change, and help develop an aware generation with the skill set to make and advocate for environmentally friendly choices, and thereby help make Los Angeles a better place to live.\r\n\r\nOur proposal consists of a pilot sustainability curriculum to be delivered online so students can access it both in class and at home.  The fun and engaging educational content and related activities will provide a broad overview of sustainability -- climate change and greenhouse gases, transportation alternatives, energy, water, waste, heat island effect, healthy food and sustainable living -- and emphasize how everyone and everything is connected and how personal actions can have global effects.\r\n \r\nAs part of the curriculum, students and parents would be encouraged to implement related activities, such as exploring environmentally friendly transportation options (walking, biking, public transit), and reducing waste, energy and water use on campus and at home. Schools would be encouraged and supported through the pilot to connect students, their families, and other community members in collaborations to implement environmentally friendly projects such as planting trees on and around campus to reduce the heat island effect in their community, or install rain barrels and rain gardens. The Los Angeles World’s Fair will work to develop partnerships in furtherance of this goal.\r\n\r\nSuccessful implementation of the pilot, and subsequently scaling to schools in other communities, would improve the resiliency of these communities by helping reduce the impacts of climate change -- for example, climate change is expected to increase the number of extreme heat days by 50% -- increasing tree canopy coverage would create a virtuous cycle -- reducing the heat island effect and therefore the need for additional energy and water to run air conditioning, which in turn would reduce the generation of additional greenhouse gas emissions.\r\n\r\nBased on the success of the pilot, additional modules would be developed in the future to provide deeper dives into specific sustainability topics.\r\n"

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      Adoption of the curriculum by schools may be a challenge.  Our goal is to
      develop strategic partnerships with organizations that have existing
      relationships with schools/ districts that would be able to influence  the
      adoption of this program on a pilot basis.  Assistance from LA2050 would
      be greatly appreciated! The provision of the curriculum at no cost to the
      schools, and bringing grant funds to bear to support community outreach
      for projects, such as tree planting, are expected to be significant
      factors in overcoming these obstacles.
  - name: Please explain how you will evaluate your work.
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "We will:\r\n- Survey pilot schools to determine their bike/walk/transit scores before and after delivery of the curriculum.\r\n- Track the number of trees planted through the program, and project tree canopy coverage at maturity.\r\n- Assess students’ knowledge about sustainability issues at the beginning and end of the curriculum.\r\n- Engage and track numbers of family and community members involved in curriculum supported activities.\r\n- Track the number of schools willing to participate in the initial and subsequent phases of the pilot.\r\n"

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "LA DWP has a free-tree program, as does TreePeople -- their efforts are complementary, and we are exploring partnerships with both.  The Metropolitan Water District and LA DWP have rebate programs for water and energy conservation measures that would help support implementation of potential activities (such as installation of rain barrels, and other water and energy saving devices).\r\n\r\nThis proposed curriculum is unique in trying to help students understand the direct connection between their actions and the global environment, and providing tools and resources to do something about it.\r\n"

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      We have sized development and implementation of the pilot to cost
      $100,000.  We also expect to utilize existing programs that would provide
      resources at no cost through donation or rebates, such as trees and rain
      barrels.  The program could readily scale should additional funds become
      available.

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "The proposal includes piloting at two levels, both of which will inform decisions about scaling in the future:\r\n\r\nThe initial pilot curriculum will provide a broad introduction to sustainability.  We will assess the effectiveness of this, and the desirability of developing subsequent curricula to provide deeper dives into specific sustainability topics (e.g., transportation, climate change, healthy food).\r\n\r\nThe proposal includes piloting at a small number of schools initially (we currently envision piloting the program at three schools).  The ultimate goal is to scale delivery of the curriculum to additional schools throughout Los Angeles County to maximize its potential impact and help make all communities a better place to live.\r\n"
