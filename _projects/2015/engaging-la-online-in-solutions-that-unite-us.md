title: Engaging LA Online in Solutions that Unite Us
project_summary: >-
  The possibilities are limitless if the people of LA can come together and make
  things happen. This is the platform that brings in all of the residents of LA
  that are “too busy” by giving them a way to participate online with text and
  video which matches both their schedules and how they want government to
  communicate with them; and democratically distills the contributions of
  millions of participants in to a small, high-quality, representative set for
  city and neighborhood council meetings.

'In one sentence, please describe what your organization does': >-
  We are building the online platform that engages everyone in finding solutions
  that unite us while keeping it fair, balanced and civil and distilling it down
  to a small, high-quality, and representative set for our elected leaders.

How do you plan to use these resources to make change?:
  - Engage residents and stakeholders
  - Implement a pilot or new project
  - Mobilize for systems change
  - Implement and track policy
How will your proposal improve the following “Connect” metrics?:

  - Participation in neighborhood councils
  - Government responsiveness to residents’ needs (Dream Metric)
  - Total number of local social media friends and connections (Dream Metric)
Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "Synaccord is building the platform that engages people in finding the solutions that unite us. Unlike other online forms, Synaccord provides structured discussions by text or video clip in small diverse groups that are fair, balanced, and civil. The deliberation and voting process democratically distills the many thousands of ideas into a small, high-quality, representative set that can easily be considered by a neighborhood or city council. We make democratic participation scalable. \r\n\r\nFor this project we will build on the platform we have developed that asks “What are the most important issues in the US” (see the 1 minute demo at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-P5xMvOZ0Y). The platform allows discussions to be structured, and the depth and headings of the structure can be configured.  LA’s Great Streets Project needs this kind of application, and we would also work with city and neighborhood council members to put other specific meeting topics with broad appeal.\r\nNeighborhood Councils will be able to increase their participation, effectively, because people will be able to engage at the time of their convenience, using the device that they are comfortable with. It will be effective because online participation also fairly distills the contributions in to a small, high-quality, and representative set that can be reviewed by the neighborhood council during their meetings.\r\n\r\nThe project will enhance government responsiveness because Residents of LA will be able to get together and find their most important issues, uncover the underlying problems, and create the solutions that unite them and make their support visible to their government in terms that are most meaningful to it – the number of registered voters for and against it. By seeing majority support on issues, elected representative can more confidently act on them. \r\n\r\nVoting rates by race will increase because we measure and market to achieve to balanced participation compared to census data and we drive people to register to vote. When there is an under represented segment we will increase market spending in that demographic in order to achieve balance. When people register online they are asked to register to vote or to verify their registration. (but it is not required.  It is also possible for Citizens of other countries whom are residents of LA to register and participate).\r\n\r\nThis is a new form of civic social media that people will be able to connect through."
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We will evaluate our work by the growth in participation, and the demographic
  balance of the participants, as well as the number of solutions reached with
  overwhelming support.  These statistics will be available through a web page
  on the platform and will be updated in real-time. 
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
  - Money (financial capital)
  - Volunteers/staff (human capital)
  - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
  - 'Infrastructure (building/space/vehicles, etc.)'
  - Community outreach
