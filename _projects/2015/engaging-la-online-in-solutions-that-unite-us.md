title: Engaging LA Online in Solutions that Unite Us
project_summary: >-
  The possibilities are limitless if the people of LA can come together and make
  things happen. This is the platform that brings in all of the residents of LA
  that are “too busy” by giving them a way to participate online with text and
  video which matches both their schedules and how they want government to
  communicate with them; and democratically distills the contributions of
  millions of participants in to a small, high-quality, representative set for
  city and neighborhood council meetings.

The platform allows discussions to be structured, and the depth and headings of the structure can be configured.  LA’s Great Streets Project needs this kind of application, and we would also work with city and neighborhood council members to put other specific meeting topics with broad appeal.\r\nNeighborhood Councils will be able to increase their participation, effectively, because people will be able to engage at the time of their convenience, using the device that they are comfortable with. It will be effective because online participation also fairly distills the contributions in to a small, high-quality, and representative set that can be reviewed by the neighborhood council during their meetings.\r\n\r\nThe project will enhance government responsiveness because Residents of LA will be able to get together and find their most important issues, uncover the underlying problems, and create the solutions that unite them and make their support visible to their government in terms that are most meaningful to it – the number of registered voters for and against it. By seeing majority support on issues, elected representative can more confidently act on them. \r\n\r\nVoting rates by race will increase because we measure and market to achieve to balanced participation compared to census data and we drive people to register to vote. When there is an under represented segment we will increase market spending in that demographic in order to achieve balance. When people register online they are asked to register to vote or to verify their registration. (but it is not required.

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    The major barrier is the one government is facing at all levels –
    participation.  We will reach out to participants through both online and
    in-person programs.  Online we will reach out to people through social media
    using targeted ads based on LA location and demographic.  In person we will
    also reach out to people through talks and demonstrations at neighborhood
    council meetings, and other events. 
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    We will evaluate our work by the growth in participation, and the
    demographic balance of the participants, as well as the number of solutions
    reached with overwhelming support.  These statistics will be available
    through a web page on the platform and will be updated in real-time. 
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "Neighborhoods.com is a platform for engaging geographically local communities. This differs because this is not just talk, we support structured discussions, in small diverse groups in order to lead people through a process of finding solutions that unite them \r\n\r\nCountable.us is a platform that supports national politics and is now reaching into local politics by providing a mechanism where cities such as . SF can vote and give feedback on the issues before city council.  We provide similar features but also allow people to bring up and build consensus on their own issues and we measure participation to make sure it is balance and we support video clip based participation as well as text based. \r\n\r\nCivicEagle is a platform that is designed to engage people in finding consensus on issues and runs on the iOS platform. We are a web app which makes us available on virtually all platforms from the start.\r\n"

    The primary developer for Synaccord has been Francois Vespa whom we’ve been
    working with for a year. He would be the primary collaborator we work with

We will be seeking other funding, running crowd funding campaigns, and we have a revenue side that is based on advertising and fees from crowdfunding for actions that people agree on. \r\n"
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Budget:\r\nWebsite and UI Visual Design, Branding: $20,000\r\nApplication Enhancements: $30,000\r\nServer Hosting: $3000 (250/month * 12 months)\r\nSocial Media Advertising:  $12,000 ($1000/month * 12 months)\r\nEvent Hosting: $10,000\r\nCommunity Evangelism: $15,000\r\nUnforeseen: $10,000 (10%)\r\n"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "We are designed to scale! This new technology for engaging people in structured discussion in small diverse groups is designed to facilitate the participation of millions of people. The platform is built on hosted servers, Node.js and MongoDB which means increasing participation is a simple matter of turning on more servers. Our marketing though social media scales with each new person we bring on. \r\n\r\nAs this succeeds we will reach out to more neighborhoods and cities, building up the participation  to entire states, and of course the national government. Later, the world. \r\n"

    answer: "Synaccord is building the platform that engages people in finding the solutions that unite us. Unlike other online forms, Synaccord provides structured discussions by text or video clip in small diverse groups that are fair, balanced, and civil. The deliberation and voting process democratically distills the many thousands of ideas into a small, high-quality, representative set that can easily be considered by a neighborhood or city council. We make democratic participation scalable. \r\n\r\nFor this project we will build on the platform we have developed that asks “What are the most important issues in the US” (see the 1 minute demo at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-P5xMvOZ0Y). The platform allows discussions to be structured, and the depth and headings of the structure can be configured.  LA’s Great Streets Project needs this kind of application, and we would also work with city and neighborhood council members to put other specific meeting topics with broad appeal.\r\nNeighborhood Councils will be able to increase their participation, effectively, because people will be able to engage at the time of their convenience, using the device that they are comfortable with. It will be effective because online participation also fairly distills the contributions in to a small, high-quality, and representative set that can be reviewed by the neighborhood council during their meetings.\r\n\r\nThe project will enhance government responsiveness because Residents of LA will be able to get together and find their most important issues, uncover the underlying problems, and create the solutions that unite them and make their support visible to their government in terms that are most meaningful to it – the number of registered voters for and against it. By seeing majority support on issues, elected representative can more confidently act on them. \r\n\r\nVoting rates by race will increase because we measure and market to achieve to balanced participation compared to census data and we drive people to register to vote. When there is an under represented segment we will increase market spending in that demographic in order to achieve balance. When people register online they are asked to register to vote or to verify their registration. (but it is not required.  It is also possible for Citizens of other countries whom are residents of LA to register and participate).\r\n\r\nThis is a new form of civic social media that people will be able to connect through."

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      The major barrier is the one government is facing at all levels –
      participation.  We will reach out to participants through both online and
      in-person programs.  Online we will reach out to people through social
      media using targeted ads based on LA location and demographic.  In person
      we will also reach out to people through talks and demonstrations at
      neighborhood council meetings, and other events.

    answer: >-
      We will evaluate our work by the growth in participation, and the
      demographic balance of the participants, as well as the number of
      solutions reached with overwhelming support.  These statistics will be
      available through a web page on the platform and will be updated in
      real-time.

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or

    answer: "Neighborhoods.com is a platform for engaging geographically local communities. This differs because this is not just talk, we support structured discussions, in small diverse groups in order to lead people through a process of finding solutions that unite them \r\n\r\nCountable.us is a platform that supports national politics and is now reaching into local politics by providing a mechanism where cities such as . SF can vote and give feedback on the issues before city council.  We provide similar features but also allow people to bring up and build consensus on their own issues and we measure participation to make sure it is balance and we support video clip based participation as well as text based. \r\n\r\nCivicEagle is a platform that is designed to engage people in finding consensus on issues and runs on the iOS platform. We are a web app which makes us available on virtually all platforms from the start.\r\n"

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "We are designed to scale! This new technology for engaging people in structured discussion in small diverse groups is designed to facilitate the participation of millions of people. The platform is built on hosted servers, Node.js and MongoDB which means increasing participation is a simple matter of turning on more servers. Our marketing though social media scales with each new person we bring on. \r\n\r\nAs this succeeds we will reach out to more neighborhoods and cities, building up the participation  to entire states, and of course the national government. Later, the world. \r\n"
