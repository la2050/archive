Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "When approaching our work, we strategically follow a model of ongoing: planning-implementation-evaluation-decision making.  Our criteria for evaluation is rooted in two questions: 1) Has our strategy engaged, empowered, and educated both new and existing low-income community leaders?; and 2) Has our strategy led to policy or practices change that strengthens human rights and equitably distributes resources among all stakeholders, with direct benefits to low-income people of color?\r\n\r\nWe will supplement this general evaluation approach with community surveys that will help inform our market and nutrition education choices before we launch. Out of these survey participants, we will create a community team of 10-12 residents who are participating in our project and that we will regularly convene to track their purchasing, engagement in nutritional programming, and overall health and wellness outcomes.\r\n"
