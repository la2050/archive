  Located in the Skid Row community, but serving low-income communities of color
  across Downtown and South LA, the LA CAN Justice and Wellness Center will
  focus on making Los Angeles a healthy place to live for extremely low-income
  and homeless residents, as well as others, through expanded services for
  housing stability and homelessness prevention and increased access to healthy
  food through a seed-to-market community garden, produce market and
  micro-enterprise center.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Homeless and extremely-low income residents in Skid Row and South LA face some
  of the most serious and entrenched health problems facing Angelenos, including
  lack of safe, affordable housing, limited access to fresh, healthy food, and
  disproportionately high rates of food-related and chronic diseases. By
  connecting these underserved communities of color with healthy food growing,
  food access and education, job training, housing stability programming and
  homelessness prevention, the LA CAN Justice and Wellness Center will help make
  LA the healthiest place to live. 
   
   In May 2014, LA CAN purchased a 5,000 square foot warehouse located in Skid Row as our new organizational headquarters. We are renovating the full space and transforming the building into a Justice and Wellness Center that will feature a healthy food access micro-enterprise project. For the past year and half, LA CAN has been operating a weekly pop-up produce market in the Pueblo del Rio public housing community in South LA. The Center expands on this successful and innovative model and will feature a rooftop community garden, a micro-enterprise training space focused on gardening and food retail skills, a community kitchen for nutrition education and food demonstrations, and a pop-up produce market that will provide organic and local produce to the community at below-market prices and with EBT (Food Stamp) access. Furthermore, by incorporating our rooftop garden herbs, vegetables, and fruit into our produce market, we will not only be making Skid Row a healthy food access point, but a source as well. 
   
   Part-time employees, hired from the homeless and extremely low-income constituency in our community, will staff the market and provide outreach and nutrition education. Initially the market will operate weekly in the courtyard in front of our building. This will allow the market to also serve as an entry point for our housing stability and homelessness prevention programming, which includes know your rights training and education, housing and homelessness policy advocacy, and legal services. Additionally, the eventual expansion of our market to other areas in the community, such as public parks, high-foot traffic areas, and social service provider locations, will further meet our goals of eliminating barriers to healthy food access and directly connecting residents to all of our health and wellness programming.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  We will be bringing fresh fruits and vegetables to a community where such a
  direct source has not existed. Thus, one challenge will be building the market
  and developing an active and engaged customer base. However, with 15 years of
  experience in community engagement, we are confident that our existing
  relationships with residents, expertise in resident engagement and outreach,
  and existing community garden programming and networks will allow us to
  quickly build a base of customers. We can then begin connecting community
  residents with fresh produce, nutritional education, job training, housing
  advocacy, and legal support.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  When approaching our work, we strategically follow a model of ongoing:
  planning-implementation-evaluation-decision making. Our criteria for
  evaluation is rooted in two questions: 1) Has our strategy engaged, empowered,
  and educated both new and existing low-income community leaders?; and 2) Has
  our strategy led to policy or practices change that strengthens human rights
  and equitably distributes resources among all stakeholders, with direct
  benefits to low-income people of color?
   
   We will supplement this general evaluation approach with community surveys that will help inform our market and nutrition education choices before we launch. Out of these survey participants, we will create a community team of 10-12 residents who are participating in our project and that we will regularly convene to track their purchasing, engagement in nutritional programming, and overall health and wellness outcomes.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There are many organizations doing complementary work in Skid Row, including
  affordable housing developers, homeless service providers, health and mental
  health care providers, and others. However, there is no other similar project
  in the Skid Row community and, in fact, there are no other organizations
  focused on changing the food access environment or creating resident-led
  projects and advocacy campaigns. An overwhelming need for shelter or housing,
  primary health care, mental health services, and other resources, as well as
  decades of disinvestment by government agencies, has left Skid Row
  experiencing a continual state of crisis. Yet, despite the enormous
  challenges, in recent years housed and unhoused residents have been taking
  leadership and initiative to improve their community. The proposed project is
  a result of that initiative and innovation of residents to create
  community-led solutions to the problems they face. 
   
   The unique aspects of the project include: 1) the project is planned, led and implemented by homeless and low-income residents whose skills and talents are generally overlooked; 2) utilizing micro-enterprise as a means of providing much needed healthy food to an extremely low-income community and building skills for a population that has been disconnected or excluded from mainstream employment; and 3) combining much needed improvements to the built environment with direct goods and services that are needed will lead to tangible community improvements not often experienced within Skid Row.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  We will work with a number of organizations as a means of outreaching to
  community residents, identifying potential participants in programming, and as
  sites for our market when it goes mobile. These include, but are not limited
  to, Downtown Women’s Center, Skid Row Housing Trust, the Los Angeles Catholic
  Worker, Homeless Health Care Los Angeles, Lamp Community, and Los Angeles
  Poverty Department. However, this aspect of the work is part of ongoing
  working relationships between our organizations and thus we will not be
  utilizing funded partners for this specific project.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  The total annual budget to implement the healthy food access components of the
  Skid Row Justice and Wellness Center is $175,000. We will cover the additional
  costs with other grant funding and individual donations, of which
  approximately 50 percent has already been secured.

How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  The LA 2050 Challenge grant will help LA CAN fully implement all of the
  healthy food access aspects of our new Skid Row Justice and Wellness Center,
  which will allow us to build upon the successful pop-up market LA CAN operates
  in the Pueblo del Rio community of South Los Angeles. This market has
  successfully created a new and sustainable source of fresh produce in an
  extremely low-income community, provided local employment opportunities, and
  distributes 0.6 tons of produce each month. Our project also builds on our
  streetscape garden at our Skid Row location, which has more than 20 active
  residents maintaining it, harvesting food grown, and providing it to the
  community through food demonstrations and meals at community meetings. 
   
   We are fully confident that the support we receive from LA 2050 will allow us to continue to expand this proven model for creating a healthy LA. Once operational, we envision building other community gardens and incorporating produce grown in these spaces into our market, expanding the locations and days we are able to operate the market, and sharing this model with other organizations throughout Los Angeles. 
   
   We know our model for increasing the health of poor communities of color through community education, gardening, healthy food access, and micro-enterprise works. With the help of LA 2050, we can continue to help make LA the healthiest place to live.
