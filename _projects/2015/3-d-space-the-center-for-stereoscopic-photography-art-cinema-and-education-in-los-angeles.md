Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: "Thanks to recent advances in digital technologies, there has been a renewed enthusiasm for all things 3-D. From record-breaking box office returns of 3-D movies to the new public interest in virtual reality, 3-D is back in the spotlight. \r\n \r\nBut most people aren't aware that stereoscopic imaging has a very rich history that dates back to the 19th century. We want to create a center to celebrate the work of the many talented artists, photographers and filmmakers who have used the medium of 3-D as their creative tool, and to educate the public on the art and science of stereography, from it's analog beginnings in the 1830s to the immersive digital realms of the future.\r\n\r\nOur goals include:\r\n \r\n- A Museum of permanent collections on display to educate about the history of 3-D art and science.\r\n\r\n- A Gallery of curated exhibits by recent and current 3-D content creators.\r\n\r\n- A Theater to screen 3-D films and other related cinematic works, and to host lectures and presentations.\r\n\r\n- A Library of 3-D books, movies, and other media.\r\n\r\n- A Classroom devoted to teaching the techniques and methods of 3-D image creation through classes and workshops for the public, including special outreach and educational programs for youth and seniors.\r\n\r\nResearch has shown that students who study STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) become better problem solvers, innovators, inventors and logical thinkers. Studies also show that Students who study the arts are more likely to be academic achievers with strong skills in creativity and innovation, critical thinking and problem solving, and communication and collaboration. Arts specific education is on the decline, but arts connected to STEM (STEAM) through mutually-reinforcing objectives deepens learning in both areas.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the use of stereoscopic 3-D in the classroom has repeatedly proven to provide markedly higher rates of comprehension and retention of information by students, yet 3-D is not widely understood or implemented by educators or industries.\r\n\r\nOur initiative will provide a contextual and factual foundation for an increase in the creation and use of 3-D content by the Los Angeles population. This knowledge will benefit the growing numbers of LA residents who will pursue careers in the numerous fields that are rapidly implementing 3-D imagery, including entertainment, medicine, design, and education."
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Our work will be directly evaluated by the public who engage in our activities. The people who attend our classes, workshops and presentations will be given the opportunity to provide feedback that will be used to shape future programs.\r\n\r\nThe many works and media created by our students will be exhibited in various public venues including art galleries, film festivals, and online, where the Los Angeles community at large will be able to see, experience, and comment.\r\n\r\nOur internal evaluation will be based on measuring levels of continuing engagement with the public, growth of class and workshop sizes, attendance numbers at our events, and public demand for increased activities"
