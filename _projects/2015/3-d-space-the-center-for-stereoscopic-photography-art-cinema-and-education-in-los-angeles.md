  In 2016, 3-D SPACE will implement an ongoing program of public presentations,
  classes and workshops in stereoscopic 3-D content creation, from 3-D
  photography and filmmaking to immersive virtual reality. These programs will
  include outreach to LA's underserved communities, and also specialized
  educational initiatives for LA's creative youth and senior populations.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Thanks to recent advances in digital technologies, there has been a renewed
  enthusiasm for all things 3-D. From record-breaking box office returns of 3-D
  movies to the new public interest in virtual reality, 3-D is back in the
  spotlight. 
    
   But most people aren't aware that stereoscopic imaging has a very rich history that dates back to the 19th century. We want to create a center to celebrate the work of the many talented artists, photographers and filmmakers who have used the medium of 3-D as their creative tool, and to educate the public on the art and science of stereography, from it's analog beginnings in the 1830s to the immersive digital realms of the future.
   
   Our goals include:
    
   - A Museum of permanent collections on display to educate about the history of 3-D art and science.
   
   - A Gallery of curated exhibits by recent and current 3-D content creators.
   
   - A Theater to screen 3-D films and other related cinematic works, and to host lectures and presentations.
   
   - A Library of 3-D books, movies, and other media.
   
   - A Classroom devoted to teaching the techniques and methods of 3-D image creation through classes and workshops for the public, including special outreach and educational programs for youth and seniors.
   
   Research has shown that students who study STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) become better problem solvers, innovators, inventors and logical thinkers. Studies also show that Students who study the arts are more likely to be academic achievers with strong skills in creativity and innovation, critical thinking and problem solving, and communication and collaboration. Arts specific education is on the decline, but arts connected to STEM (STEAM) through mutually-reinforcing objectives deepens learning in both areas.
   
   Additionally, the use of stereoscopic 3-D in the classroom has repeatedly proven to provide markedly higher rates of comprehension and retention of information by students, yet 3-D is not widely understood or implemented by educators or industries.
   
   Our initiative will provide a contextual and factual foundation for an increase in the creation and use of 3-D content by the Los Angeles population. This knowledge will benefit the growing numbers of LA residents who will pursue careers in the numerous fields that are rapidly implementing 3-D imagery, including entertainment, medicine, design, and education.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  We are currently an organization without our own facility. We need to raise
  the funds to purchase a building to house our center. We have located a
  building for sale in the NoHo Arts District of Los Angeles that would be a
  perfect location for 3-D SPACE - The building has a theater, gallery, museum
  display areas, a classroom, reading room, and lots of additional space. USC
  has already donated to us a 40-foot silver screen which would make our 3-D
  theater and classroom possible. Now we have the daunting task of raising the
  funds to purchase this building, while also meeting our operating budget to
  allow the organization to function and carry out our mission and projects.
  While we are currently engaged in fundraising for our venue purchase, we have
  been offering programs throughout 2015 through partnerships and
  co-presentations with other organizations that have provided theater and
  teaching spaces. We will continue to build these relationships with other LA
  based nonprofits in 2016.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Our work will be directly evaluated by the public who engage in our
  activities. The people who attend our classes, workshops and presentations
  will be given the opportunity to provide feedback that will be used to shape
  future programs.
   
   The many works and media created by our students will be exhibited in various public venues including art galleries, film festivals, and online, where the Los Angeles community at large will be able to see, experience, and comment.
   
   Our internal evaluation will be based on measuring levels of continuing engagement with the public, growth of class and workshop sizes, attendance numbers at our events, and public demand for increased activities
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  The LA 3-D Club, founded in 1955, is the most active membership-based
  organization in the country for 3-D enthusiasts. Their monthly meetings allow
  3-D image makers to share photos and videos, learn techniques, and socialize
  with other 3-D fans.
   
   The focus of 3-D SPACE is to increase engagement between these enthusiast communities, working professionals, and the public. 3-D SPACE founder Eric Kurland has over ten years of experience in connecting the public to the 3-D community. His work as the Director of the Annual LA 3-D Movie Festival and five years as the President of the LA 3-D Club, as well as his professional stereoscopic work in the entertainment industry (including 3-D Director for the Grammy nominated OK Go music video ALL IS NOT LOST, and Lead Stereographer for the Oscar nominated animated short MAGGIE SIMPSON IN THE LONGEST DAYCARE) puts 3-D SPACE in the position to be able to bring all aspects of the 3-D world together, from the fans, to the independent artists, to the professionals working in the entertainment industry.
    
   The 3-D SPACE Board of Directors is comprised of a team with strong backgrounds in the arts, non-profits and museums, education, and of course 3-D. We have also assembled a fantastic group of advisors to help round out our knowledge, and provide access to resources and information that will help us to become a vital and exciting organization.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  There are many potential collaborators throughout the Los Angeles arts and
  education sectors, including the Columbia Memorial Space Center in Downey,
  California, LA Filmforum, the Velaslavasay Panorama, ScareLA, the Echo Park
  Film Center, Captured Aural Phantasty Theater, Monsterpalooza, Heritage Square
  Museum, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and the LA 3-D Club,
  as well as other arts and science organizations, museums, galleries,
  libraries, and schools.
   
   However, 3-D SPACE is the singular applicant for this grant. Funds will be directed into the budget of the program of presentations, classes and workshops described in this proposal, and will not be disbursed to any partners.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  Costs specific to the 2016 program in this proposal can be estimated at
  $100,000 and can be offset through tuition fees for the presentations, classes
  and workshops. We will also seek corporate sponsors and donors to underwrite
  and subsidize the tuition fees.
   
   Additional costs for 3-D SPACE's general operation will be covered through sustaining membership subscriptions, corporate donors and sponsorships, and additional foundation and government grants.
   
   Funds will also be raised through specific targeted capital campaigns for the eventual acquisition and maintenance of a suitable permanent facility for our center (museum, gallery, classroom, theater).
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  $10,000 - computer hardware (10 computer stations at $1,000/each)
    $6,000 - computer software
   $10,000 - photo and video equipment (cameras, lenses, tripods, etc.)
   $50,000 - staff compensation (administrative staff, teaching staff, support staff)
   $10,000 - facilities and classroom rentals
    $4,000 - promotion, advertising, outreach
   $10,000 - contingency for regular and ongoing operational expenses
   _____________
   $100,000
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  The proposed plan can be scaled to include increased frequency and
  availability of presentations, classes and workshops citywide and countywide
  in order to provide creative opportunities to larger portions of the
  community. Specific topics and techniques can be expanded upon and programs
  can be individually tailored to meet the needs of specific populations. Our
  programs will also be able to supplement a broader STEAM curriculum in
  partnership with other arts and science organizations and local school
  districts and colleges.

    answer: "Thanks to recent advances in digital technologies, there has been a renewed enthusiasm for all things 3-D. From record-breaking box office returns of 3-D movies to the new public interest in virtual reality, 3-D is back in the spotlight. \r\n \r\nBut most people aren't aware that stereoscopic imaging has a very rich history that dates back to the 19th century. We want to create a center to celebrate the work of the many talented artists, photographers and filmmakers who have used the medium of 3-D as their creative tool, and to educate the public on the art and science of stereography, from it's analog beginnings in the 1830s to the immersive digital realms of the future.\r\n\r\nOur goals include:\r\n \r\n- A Museum of permanent collections on display to educate about the history of 3-D art and science.\r\n\r\n- A Gallery of curated exhibits by recent and current 3-D content creators.\r\n\r\n- A Theater to screen 3-D films and other related cinematic works, and to host lectures and presentations.\r\n\r\n- A Library of 3-D books, movies, and other media.\r\n\r\n- A Classroom devoted to teaching the techniques and methods of 3-D image creation through classes and workshops for the public, including special outreach and educational programs for youth and seniors.\r\n\r\nResearch has shown that students who study STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) become better problem solvers, innovators, inventors and logical thinkers. Studies also show that Students who study the arts are more likely to be academic achievers with strong skills in creativity and innovation, critical thinking and problem solving, and communication and collaboration. Arts specific education is on the decline, but arts connected to STEM (STEAM) through mutually-reinforcing objectives deepens learning in both areas.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the use of stereoscopic 3-D in the classroom has repeatedly proven to provide markedly higher rates of comprehension and retention of information by students, yet 3-D is not widely understood or implemented by educators or industries.\r\n\r\nOur initiative will provide a contextual and factual foundation for an increase in the creation and use of 3-D content by the Los Angeles population. This knowledge will benefit the growing numbers of LA residents who will pursue careers in the numerous fields that are rapidly implementing 3-D imagery, including entertainment, medicine, design, and education."

      We are currently an organization without our own facility. We need to
      raise the funds to purchase a building to house our center. We have
      located a building for sale in the NoHo Arts District of Los Angeles that
      would be a perfect location for 3-D SPACE - The building has a theater,
      gallery, museum display areas, a classroom, reading room, and lots of
      additional space. USC has already donated to us a 40-foot silver screen
      which would make our 3-D theater and classroom possible. Now we have the
      daunting task of raising the funds to purchase this building, while also
      meeting our operating budget to allow the organization to function and
      carry out our mission and projects. While we are currently engaged in
      fundraising for our venue purchase, we have been offering programs
      throughout 2015 through partnerships and co-presentations with other
      organizations that have provided theater and teaching spaces. We will
      continue to build these relationships with other LA based nonprofits in
      2016.

    answer: "Our work will be directly evaluated by the public who engage in our activities. The people who attend our classes, workshops and presentations will be given the opportunity to provide feedback that will be used to shape future programs.\r\n\r\nThe many works and media created by our students will be exhibited in various public venues including art galleries, film festivals, and online, where the Los Angeles community at large will be able to see, experience, and comment.\r\n\r\nOur internal evaluation will be based on measuring levels of continuing engagement with the public, growth of class and workshop sizes, attendance numbers at our events, and public demand for increased activities"

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "The LA 3-D Club, founded in 1955, is the most active membership-based organization in the country for 3-D enthusiasts. Their monthly meetings allow 3-D image makers to share photos and videos, learn techniques, and socialize with other 3-D fans.\r\n\r\nThe focus of 3-D SPACE is to increase engagement between these enthusiast communities, working professionals, and the public. 3-D SPACE founder Eric Kurland has over ten years of experience in connecting the public to the 3-D community. His work as the Director of the Annual LA 3-D Movie Festival and five years as the President of the LA 3-D Club, as well as his professional stereoscopic work in the entertainment industry (including 3-D Director for the Grammy nominated OK Go music video ALL IS NOT LOST, and Lead Stereographer for the Oscar nominated animated short MAGGIE SIMPSON IN THE LONGEST DAYCARE) puts 3-D SPACE in the position to be able to bring all aspects of the 3-D world together, from the fans, to the independent artists, to the professionals working in the entertainment industry.\r\n \r\nThe 3-D SPACE Board of Directors is comprised of a team with strong backgrounds in the arts, non-profits and museums, education, and of course 3-D. We have also assembled a fantastic group of advisors to help round out our knowledge, and provide access to resources and information that will help us to become a vital and exciting organization."

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Costs specific to the 2016 program in this proposal can be estimated at $100,000 and can be offset through tuition fees for the presentations, classes and workshops. We will also seek corporate sponsors and donors to underwrite and subsidize the tuition fees.\r\n\r\nAdditional costs for 3-D SPACE's general operation will  be covered through sustaining membership subscriptions, corporate donors and sponsorships, and additional foundation and government grants.\r\n\r\nFunds will also be raised through specific targeted capital campaigns for the eventual acquisition and maintenance of a suitable permanent facility for our center (museum, gallery, classroom, theater)."
