project_summary: >-
  JSA will partner with Alliance College-Ready Public Schools to provide a civic
  leadership program that prepares low-income students to become engaged
  citizens and successful students into and through college. This proposal will
  create six new JSA chapters at Alliance schools, which are uniquely suited to
  host the organization because of 1) their mission to empower LA’s underserved
  students for college and career success, and 2) their focus on student-led
  project-based learning.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  For over a decade, Alliance has proven that exceptional can become the rule
  for public schools. Committed to increasing access to a high-quality, college
  preparatory education for Los Angeles’ most vulnerable communities, Alliance
  educates almost 12,000 students (94% low-income and 99% Latino or
  African-American). The results have been dramatic-91% of students graduate
  high school in four years and 95% are accepted to college. The challenge faced
  by Alliance students though, similar to other low-income students of color
  across the nation, is persisting through and graduating from college. By
  expanding the JSA footprint to six new Alliance high schools, we can help the
  network address this challenge. JSA’s unique student-led programming builds
  the advocacy, leadership, resilience, academic and social skills that will
  prepare Alliance’s students for future success. 
   
   The partnership will bring JSA’s three-pronged model to six new schools:
   
   1) School-sponsored extracurricular clubs that meet weekly to plan candidate forums, political fairs, debates, voter registration drives, and community service projects. 
   
   2) Overnight conventions and 1-day regional conferences that bring together students from across Southern California, with student-led debate and a Congressional simulation.
   
   3) 3-4 week Summer School academic programs offering a college-level curriculum.
   
   To drive expansion, we will hire a Fellow to train students and teachers to offer JSA in Alliance schools, we will subsidize the participation of Alliance students in regional events so that they can become leaders and liaisons to their home campuses, and we will host an Alliance forum at City Hall where students can meet civic leaders and discuss and debate issues identified by students. 
   
   Alliance students will also develop a cross-school activism project. Designed by participating students, it will focus on youth issues in the 2016 elections, increasing voter turnout city-wide, or creating safer, cleaner communities. 
   
   These activities are well-suited for incorporation into the Alliance model. Alliance believes that interdisciplinary real-world projects are essential, and that high expectations become self-fulfilling. JSA’s activities incorporate leading civic and political thinkers and doers as well as issues ripped from the headlines, and they assume the students not only can but must take the lead.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  A challenge we anticipate is the need to help parents and students understand
  what JSA is and what it does for a student, and what their roles are in
  participation. This is always a challenge for JSA in expansion, and it is
  compounded in working with Alliance because of language barriers and other
  factors common to students from marginalized communities. 
   
   A person-to-person approach is an important tool for addressing this challenge. We will hire a Chapter Development Fellow who is a JSA alum and current college student or recent graduate. The Fellow will work directly with students and families, answering their questions, guiding them through the forms and other processes that are a part of participation, and connecting them to currently participating students who can vouch for the impact that the program can make on a student’s life. The Fellow will also make presentations on campuses and train teachers on how to support students in developing their JSA on their campuses.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: |-
  Over the grant period, we intend to track the following outcomes:
   1. Reach, as measured by the number of students participating in each JSA chapter and in network-wide events.
   2. Impact on each student, as measured by self-reported changes in key skills such as communication, research and analysis, and leadership capacity.
   3. Impact on school-wide culture, as measured by the number of events that extend beyond the chapter.
   4. Impact of the Alliance partnership on JSA work, as measured by Alliance students obtaining leadership positions within the JSA Southern California state.
   
   In the longer-term, we intend to further clarify impact by comparing indicators such as academic outcomes, matriculation rates, and college completion rates for JSA-participating students with non-participating students, and by comparing JSA-participating Alliance schools with Alliance schools that are not participating.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  JSA is one of several major U.S.-based civic education organizations,
  including Mikva Challenge and Generation Citizen (though JSA is the most
  active of these in Southern California). The primary difference between JSA
  and its peers is that it is student-run and student-led, with high schoolers
  developing the programming that takes place on their home campuses, as well as
  coordinating the set of conferences that bring students together regionally.
  Professional staff mentor, support, and guide the students, but ultimately the
  organization belongs to students and reflects their priorities. The
  student-led nature of the work is core to what JSA does—it creates
  opportunities to not only learn about but substantively practice leadership,
  it reflects the organization’s democratic principles, and it is the mechanism
  by which much of the skills development that prepares students for college
  occurs.
   
   Alliance College-Ready Public Schools is the largest charter network in L.A., but it does have many peers, including KIPP, Aspire, and Green Dot. What sets Alliance apart is our success at scale and sustainable expansion of our schools to serve increasing numbers of students every year. We are also on the leading edge of innovation, using technology as a tool to increase academic rigor, personalize instruction, and build student ownership of learning. Alliance is uniquely suited for this partnership because of the emphasis that its schools place on extended project-based learning with real world implications. Founding and running a JSA chapter is a year-long endeavor, requiring continued collaboration, and debates, speakers, and other programming are tied directly to the issues of the day. Nothing about JSA is theoretical—it is a practical exercise in peer engagement, planning, research, and analysis.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Alliance College-Ready Public Schools is JSA’s partner. The two organizations
  have been creating a partnership over the course of the past three years, and
  this project represents its next logical development. JSA would be the primary
  grantee, and would provide Alliance with $40,500 in chapter development fund
  ($6,750 per school at six schools) for use according to a personalized
  strategy developed by each school’s principal and teachers, with input from
  JSA staff.
   
   JSA is a critical partner to Alliance because program offerings reflect best practices in preparing low-income students, like those served by Alliance, for college. In Redefining College Readiness, David T. Conley presents the assets that these students must develop to thrive in college, many of which are essential elements of the JSA experience. These include:
   
   1. Ability to work with a group on an assignment that extends over a period of time: Student-run and student-led is the founding principle of JSA, requiring deep and ongoing collaboration. 
   2. Reasoning, argumentation, proof, and analysis: JSA debate challenges students to back up opinions through rigorous evidence, and students are forced to evaluate the credibility of sources and perspectives.
   3. Intellectual openness: Students in JSA are exposed to civil and respectful arguments from across the political spectrum. 
   4. Research: Debate rewards careful preparation—it requires an understanding not only of the facts that support your own arguments, but also of the facts that support opposing arguments. 
   5. Contextual skills and awareness/“college knowledge”: Participants in Summer School spend three to four weeks on the campus of an elite university gaining exposure to the college lifestyle of independence and high academic expectations.
   6. “The ability to interact with (people) who come from different backgrounds and hold points of view different from the student’s”: JSA expands students' networks and treats diverse students as equally important.
   
   In addition to increasing college readiness, JSA activities sync with the need to meet Common Core, particularly related to language arts. According to the Common Core State Standards Initiative, “The (Common Core) reading standards focus on students’ ability to read carefully and grasp information, arguments, ideas, and details based on evidence in the text.” The JSA model of learning and debating about the issues of the day fits firmly into this description.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': 'We anticipate the project will cost $100,000.'
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  Chapter Development Fellow: $25/hour x 15 hours per week x 40 weeks = $15,000
   
   School Chapter Development Fund: 6 schools x $6,750 = $40,500
   
   Regional Conferences: 6 schools x 50 students per school x $115 in room and food subsidies total over three events = $34,500
   
   City Hall Event: $10,000 
   
   Total: $100,000
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  College success and persistence is one of biggest challenges facing schools
  serving students from low-income backgrounds. Though college acceptance and
  attendance rates are increasing dramatically among these students, less than
  10% of low-income students actually complete a degree.
   
   The JSA-Alliance partnership addresses this need. As discussed in the Redefining College Readiness report, the issues around college persistence are rarely academic—Alliance and its peers have developed a model that gives students the in-class skills they need, as reflected in increasing graduation rates and test scores. What these schools need from JSA is a partner in helping their students develop resilience, social capital, self-advocacy, and other factors that come from practicing leadership.
   
   JSA currently operates in 10 Alliance schools, reaching 500 participating students. In the coming year, we will expand JSA to six new Alliance high schools and increase student participation by 300 students. As part of the design process, JSA chapters will ensure participation among all grade levels (9-12) to ensure the systems and infrastructure built for the program in the first year are carried on by students in subsequent years. The partnership will also develop a prototype for effective and rapid expansion of the JSA model into all all 17 Alliance high schools which will engage up to 35000 low-income students. As the partnership is formalized and evaluation shows its impact, we can explore partnerships with the other major charter networks and with school districts (like JSA’s partnership with Compton Unified School District) that would allow us to scale up further. 
   
   Because each Alliance principal has wide discretion in terms of how to use the School Chapter Development Fund on their campuses, we will have a variety of expansion models to compare in terms of ROI, and we can turn the most effective models into curriculum that we share with other schools.
   
   JSA currently reaches 10,000 students across the country, but Alliance-type partnerships offer an opportunity to dramatically increase this number.

    answer: "For over a decade, Alliance has proven that exceptional can become the rule for public schools. Committed to increasing access to a high-quality, college preparatory education for Los Angeles’ most vulnerable communities, Alliance educates almost 12,000 students (94% low-income and 99% Latino or African-American). The results have been dramatic-91% of students graduate high school in four years and 95% are accepted to college. The challenge faced by Alliance students though, similar to other low-income students of color across the nation, is persisting through and graduating from college. By expanding the JSA footprint to six new Alliance high schools, we can help the network address this challenge. JSA’s unique student-led programming builds the advocacy, leadership, resilience, academic and social skills that will prepare Alliance’s students for future success. \r\n\r\nThe partnership will bring JSA’s three-pronged model to six new schools:\r\n\r\n1) School-sponsored extracurricular clubs that meet weekly to plan candidate forums, political fairs, debates, voter registration drives, and community service projects. \r\n\r\n2) Overnight conventions and 1-day regional conferences that bring together students from across Southern California, with student-led debate and a Congressional simulation.\r\n\r\n3) 3-4 week Summer School academic programs offering a college-level curriculum.\r\n\r\nTo drive expansion, we will hire a Fellow to train students and teachers to offer JSA in Alliance schools, we will subsidize the participation of Alliance students in regional events so that they can become leaders and liaisons to their home campuses, and we will host an Alliance forum at City Hall where students can meet civic leaders and discuss and debate issues identified by students. \r\n\r\nAlliance students will also develop a cross-school activism project. Designed by participating students, it will focus on youth issues in the 2016 elections, increasing voter turnout city-wide, or creating safer, cleaner communities. \r\n\r\nThese activities are well-suited for incorporation into the Alliance model. Alliance believes that interdisciplinary real-world projects are essential, and that high expectations become self-fulfilling. JSA’s activities incorporate leading civic and political thinkers and doers as well as issues ripped from the headlines, and they assume the students not only can but must take the lead."

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "A challenge we anticipate is the need to help parents and students understand what JSA is and what it does for a student, and what their roles are in participation. This is always a challenge for JSA in expansion, and it is compounded in working with Alliance because of language barriers and other factors common to students from marginalized communities. \r\n\r\nA person-to-person approach is an important tool for addressing this challenge. We will hire a Chapter Development Fellow who is a JSA alum and current college student or recent graduate. The Fellow will work directly with students and families, answering their questions, guiding them through the forms and other processes that are a part of participation, and connecting them to currently participating students who can vouch for the impact that the program can make on a student’s life. The Fellow will also make presentations on campuses and train teachers on how to support students in developing their JSA on their campuses."

    answer: "Over the grant period, we intend to track the following outcomes:\r\n1. Reach, as measured by the number of students participating in each JSA chapter and in network-wide events.\r\n2. Impact on each student, as measured by self-reported changes in key skills such as communication, research and analysis, and leadership capacity.\r\n3. Impact on school-wide culture, as measured by the number of events that extend beyond the chapter.\r\n4. Impact of the Alliance partnership on JSA work, as measured by Alliance students obtaining leadership positions within the JSA Southern California state.\r\n\r\nIn the longer-term, we intend to further clarify impact by comparing indicators such as academic outcomes, matriculation rates, and college completion rates for JSA-participating students with non-participating students, and by comparing JSA-participating Alliance schools with Alliance schools that are not participating. \r\n"

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "JSA is one of several major U.S.-based civic education organizations, including Mikva Challenge and Generation Citizen (though JSA is the most active of these in Southern California). The primary difference between JSA and its peers is that it is student-run and student-led, with high schoolers developing the programming that takes place on their home campuses, as well as coordinating the set of conferences that bring students together regionally. Professional staff mentor, support, and guide the students, but ultimately the organization belongs to students and reflects their priorities. The student-led nature of the work is core to what JSA does—it creates opportunities to not only learn about but substantively practice leadership, it reflects the organization’s democratic principles, and it is the mechanism by which much of the skills development that prepares students for college occurs.\r\n\r\nAlliance College-Ready Public Schools is the largest charter network in L.A., but it does have many peers, including KIPP, Aspire, and Green Dot.  What sets Alliance apart is our success at scale and sustainable expansion of our schools to serve increasing numbers of students every year. We are also on the leading edge of innovation, using technology as a tool to increase academic rigor, personalize instruction, and build student ownership of learning. Alliance is uniquely suited for this partnership because of the emphasis that its schools place on extended project-based learning with real world implications. Founding and running a JSA chapter is a year-long endeavor, requiring continued collaboration, and debates, speakers, and other programming are tied directly to the issues of the day. Nothing about JSA is theoretical—it is a practical exercise in peer engagement, planning, research, and analysis.\r\n"

      Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on
      this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner
      receive?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Alliance College-Ready Public Schools is JSA’s partner. The two organizations have been creating a partnership over the course of the past three years, and this project represents its next logical development. JSA would be the primary grantee, and would provide Alliance with $40,500 in chapter development fund ($6,750 per school at six schools) for use according to a personalized strategy developed by each school’s principal and teachers, with input from JSA staff.\r\n\r\nJSA is a critical partner to Alliance because program offerings reflect best practices in preparing low-income students, like those served by Alliance, for college. In Redefining College Readiness, David T. Conley presents the assets that these students must develop to thrive in college, many of which are essential elements of the JSA experience. These include:\r\n\r\n1. Ability to work with a group on an assignment that extends over a period of time: Student-run and student-led is the founding principle of JSA, requiring deep and ongoing collaboration. \r\n2. Reasoning, argumentation, proof, and analysis: JSA debate challenges students to back up opinions through rigorous evidence, and students are forced to evaluate the credibility of sources and perspectives.\r\n3. Intellectual openness: Students in JSA are exposed to civil and respectful arguments from across the political spectrum. \r\n4. Research: Debate rewards careful preparation—it requires an understanding not only of the facts that support your own arguments, but also of the facts that support opposing arguments. \r\n5. Contextual skills and awareness/“college knowledge”: Participants in Summer School spend three to four weeks on the campus of an elite university gaining exposure to the college lifestyle of independence and high academic expectations.\r\n6.  “The ability to interact with (people) who come from different backgrounds and hold points of view different from the student’s”: JSA expands students' networks and treats diverse students as equally important.\r\n\r\nIn addition to increasing college readiness, JSA activities sync with the need to meet Common Core, particularly related to language arts. According to the Common Core State Standards Initiative, “The (Common Core) reading standards focus on students’ ability to read carefully and grasp information, arguments, ideas, and details based on evidence in the text.” The JSA model of learning and debating about the issues of the day fits firmly into this description."

    answer: "College success and persistence is one of biggest challenges facing schools serving students from low-income backgrounds. Though college acceptance and attendance rates are increasing dramatically among these students, less than 10% of low-income students actually complete a degree.\r\n\r\nThe JSA-Alliance partnership addresses this need. As discussed in the Redefining College Readiness report, the issues around college persistence are rarely academic—Alliance and its peers have developed a model that gives students the in-class skills they need, as reflected in increasing graduation rates and test scores. What these schools need from JSA is a partner in helping their students develop resilience, social capital, self-advocacy, and other factors that come from practicing leadership.\r\n\r\nJSA currently operates in 10 Alliance schools, reaching 500 participating students.  In the coming year, we will expand JSA to six new Alliance high schools and increase student participation by 300 students.  As part of the design process, JSA chapters will ensure participation among all grade levels (9-12) to ensure the systems and infrastructure built for the program in the first year are carried on by students in subsequent years.  The partnership will also develop a prototype for effective and rapid expansion of the JSA model into all all 17 Alliance high schools which will engage up to 35000 low-income students. As the partnership is formalized and evaluation shows its impact, we can explore partnerships with the other major charter networks and with school districts (like JSA’s partnership with Compton Unified School District) that would allow us to scale up further. \r\n\r\nBecause each Alliance principal has wide discretion in terms of how to use the School Chapter Development Fund on their campuses, we will have a variety of expansion models to compare in terms of ROI, and we can turn the most effective models into curriculum that we share with other schools.\r\n\r\nJSA currently reaches 10,000 students across the country, but Alliance-type partnerships offer an opportunity to dramatically increase this number."
