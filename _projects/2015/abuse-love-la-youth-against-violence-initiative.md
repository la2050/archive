Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: >-
  Jenesse Center will make LA the best place to learn through our targeted
  violence prevention model that has the potential to change the life trajectory
  of at-risk youth in Los Angeles County by: 1) Increasing students’
  understanding of the dynamics and warning signs of abuse through culturally
  responsive workshops and trainings; 2) Increasing youth engagement in violence
  prevention programming; 3) Making it safer to access their school campuses; 4)
  Decreasing prevalence of teen dating and community violence among youth; 5)
  Improving community engagement and accountability; and 6) Creating a peer
  leadership training module that can be replicated in other schools and youth
  programs.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Jenesse Center’s structured evaluation system consists of a paper-and-pencil
  pre-learning survey composed of a hybrid of standardized instruments that
  utilizes the original lines of questioning developed by CCRN to ascertain
  youths’ perceptions about violence, bullying, dating/partner violence, and
  violence in the home before participating in the violence prevention education
  workshops. To date, approximately 641 Los Angeles area youth have completed
  the survey. Following the workshops, Jenesse distributes a post-learning
  survey that captures youths’ perceptions of violence and measures their
  developing understanding of the material. This evaluation system provides
  accurate statistical evidence and data that our program is achieving desired
  outcomes in equipping youth with the knowledge, skills, and awareness to
  address violence in their everyday lives.
