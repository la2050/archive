  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: >-
    Jenesse Center will make LA the best place to learn through our targeted
    violence prevention model that has the potential to change the life
    trajectory of at-risk youth in Los Angeles County by: 1) Increasing
    students’ understanding of the dynamics and warning signs of abuse through
    culturally responsive workshops and trainings; 2) Increasing youth
    engagement in violence prevention programming; 3) Making it safer to access
    their school campuses; 4) Decreasing prevalence of teen dating and community
    violence among youth; 5) Improving community engagement and accountability;
    and 6) Creating a peer leadership training module that can be replicated in
    other schools and youth programs.

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    A major challenge/barrier that we anticipate is the natural reluctance of
    youth and the community at large to discuss domestic violence. Community
    support is critical to the project’s long term success. Our strategy for
    overcoming this barrier is to continue to increase our profile and expand
    our network by sharing the evaluation results and lessons learned with
    community members, CBOs, government officials, and public as well as private
    stakeholders. We want to show that the project produces tangible results in
    decreasing violence among youth and the community and consequently has a
    significant impact on how youth in 2050 interact with each other, their
    community, and the world.  
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    Jenesse Center’s structured evaluation system consists of a paper-and-pencil
    pre-learning survey composed of a hybrid of standardized instruments that
    utilizes the original lines of questioning developed by CCRN to ascertain
    youths’ perceptions about violence, bullying, dating/partner violence, and
    violence in the home before participating in the violence prevention
    education workshops. To date, approximately 641 Los Angeles area youth have
    completed the survey. Following the workshops, Jenesse distributes a
    post-learning survey that captures youths’ perceptions of violence and
    measures their developing understanding of the material. This evaluation
    system provides accurate statistical evidence and data that our program is
    achieving desired outcomes in equipping youth with the knowledge, skills,
    and awareness to address violence in their everyday lives.
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    While other organizations in Los Angeles that work with at-risk youth,
    Jenesse Center was the only organization in California to be awarded a grant
    in 2013 by the Department of Justice, Office on Violence Against Women, to
    do prevention work with youth around issues of domestic violence and healthy
    relationships because we are uniquely situated to reframe conversations and
    strategies around violence. Not only does the majority of our staff live in
    this community, and understand its complexities and challenges, but the
    relationships that we have built over the last 35 years allows us to pool
    resources in South Los Angeles to provide significant, meaningful, and
    culturally relevant programs and services that have the potential to
    transform entire communities. 
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    Jenesse has a track record of successful collaboration that speaks volumes
    about the organization’s ability to motivate and maintain strong
    partnerships.  CCRN has shown great success at Locke and Jordan High
    Schools. For the purposes of this grant, we will continue to collaborate
    with our (CCRN) Memorandum of Understanding Partners which include: Watts
    Healthcare Corporation, Green Dot Public Schools (Locke and Jordan High
    Schools), South Central Training Consortium, and the Los Angeles Police
    Department.  Funds from LA2050 will not be used to fund the CCRN
    collaborative partners.
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': "The existing program has a yearly budget of $300,000; Jenesse will seek funding from government grants, foundations, corporations and private individuals to cover the additional costs of the program. Funding from LA2050 would be used to sustain and expand existing curriculum-based workshops being implemented by the CCRN. To date, the CCRN project has educated more than 3,000 Los Angeles youth ages 13-18 (and their parents) who are exposed to violence. \r\n"

  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: ' Jenesse plans to scale the success of the proposal through the number of youth (and parents) served, the number of hours of technical assistance offered, and the workshop outcomes. Before implementing our current workshops, we administered a Youth and Partner Perception Survey to ascertain the need.  The survey results were analyzed and interpreted by independent contractors Gary Bess Associates and confirmed that violence is a prevailing problem for the Los Angeles youth surveyed.  We also plan to administer a new survey to existing participants to show the effectiveness of the workshop and identify areas for improvement.  Gary Bess Associates will continue to evaluate all data and track program outcomes. Jenesse has already successfully implemented this model. In year 2 of the program we reached over 3,000 South Los Angeles youth, over 500 parents, and more than 100 service providers in 6 months through our violence prevention, intervention and outreach services. It is our intention to use the second survey results as a blue print to enhance and expand existing services, resources and technical assistance to at least 3,000 more youth, parents and partners. We also intend to have a model that can be replicated in other Los Angeles area schools and beyond. '

      Jenesse Center will make LA the best place to learn through our targeted
      violence prevention model that has the potential to change the life
      trajectory of at-risk youth in Los Angeles County by: 1) Increasing
      students’ understanding of the dynamics and warning signs of abuse through
      culturally responsive workshops and trainings; 2) Increasing youth
      engagement in violence prevention programming; 3) Making it safer to
      access their school campuses; 4) Decreasing prevalence of teen dating and
      community violence among youth; 5) Improving community engagement and
      accountability; and 6) Creating a peer leadership training module that can
      be replicated in other schools and youth programs.

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      A major challenge/barrier that we anticipate is the natural reluctance of
      youth and the community at large to discuss domestic violence. Community
      support is critical to the project’s long term success. Our strategy for
      overcoming this barrier is to continue to increase our profile and expand
      our network by sharing the evaluation results and lessons learned with
      community members, CBOs, government officials, and public as well as
      private stakeholders. We want to show that the project produces tangible
      results in decreasing violence among youth and the community and
      consequently has a significant impact on how youth in 2050 interact with
      each other, their community, and the world.  
  - name: Please explain how you will evaluate your work.
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      Jenesse Center’s structured evaluation system consists of a
      paper-and-pencil pre-learning survey composed of a hybrid of standardized
      instruments that utilizes the original lines of questioning developed by
      CCRN to ascertain youths’ perceptions about violence, bullying,
      dating/partner violence, and violence in the home before participating in
      the violence prevention education workshops. To date, approximately 641
      Los Angeles area youth have completed the survey. Following the workshops,
      Jenesse distributes a post-learning survey that captures youths’
      perceptions of violence and measures their developing understanding of the
      material. This evaluation system provides accurate statistical evidence
      and data that our program is achieving desired outcomes in equipping youth
      with the knowledge, skills, and awareness to address violence in their
      everyday lives.

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      While other organizations in Los Angeles that work with at-risk youth,
      Jenesse Center was the only organization in California to be awarded a
      grant in 2013 by the Department of Justice, Office on Violence Against
      Women, to do prevention work with youth around issues of domestic violence
      and healthy relationships because we are uniquely situated to reframe
      conversations and strategies around violence. Not only does the majority
      of our staff live in this community, and understand its complexities and
      challenges, but the relationships that we have built over the last 35
      years allows us to pool resources in South Los Angeles to provide
      significant, meaningful, and culturally relevant programs and services
      that have the potential to transform entire communities.

      Schools. For the purposes of this grant, we will continue to collaborate
      with our (CCRN) Memorandum of Understanding Partners which include: Watts
      Healthcare Corporation, Green Dot Public Schools (Locke and Jordan High
      Schools), South Central Training Consortium, and the Los Angeles Police

Funding from LA2050 would be used to sustain and expand existing curriculum-based workshops being implemented by the CCRN. To date, the CCRN project has educated more than 3,000 Los Angeles youth ages 13-18 (and their parents) who are exposed to violence. \r\n"

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: ' Jenesse plans to scale the success of the proposal through the number of youth (and parents) served, the number of hours of technical assistance offered, and the workshop outcomes. Before implementing our current workshops, we administered a Youth and Partner Perception Survey to ascertain the need.  The survey results were analyzed and interpreted by independent contractors Gary Bess Associates and confirmed that violence is a prevailing problem for the Los Angeles youth surveyed.  We also plan to administer a new survey to existing participants to show the effectiveness of the workshop and identify areas for improvement.  Gary Bess Associates will continue to evaluate all data and track program outcomes. Jenesse has already successfully implemented this model. In year 2 of the program we reached over 3,000 South Los Angeles youth, over 500 parents, and more than 100 service providers in 6 months through our violence prevention, intervention and outreach services. It is our intention to use the second survey results as a blue print to enhance and expand existing services, resources and technical assistance to at least 3,000 more youth, parents and partners. We also intend to have a model that can be replicated in other Los Angeles area schools and beyond. '
