  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: >-
    Jenesse Center will make LA the best place to learn through our targeted
    violence prevention model that has the potential to change the life
    trajectory of at-risk youth in Los Angeles County by: 1) Increasing
    students’ understanding of the dynamics and warning signs of abuse through
    culturally responsive workshops and trainings; 2) Increasing youth
    engagement in violence prevention programming; 3) Making it safer to access
    their school campuses; 4) Decreasing prevalence of teen dating and community
    violence among youth; 5) Improving community engagement and accountability;
    and 6) Creating a peer leadership training module that can be replicated in
    other schools and youth programs.

  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    Jenesse Center’s structured evaluation system consists of a paper-and-pencil
    pre-learning survey composed of a hybrid of standardized instruments that
    utilizes the original lines of questioning developed by CCRN to ascertain
    youths’ perceptions about violence, bullying, dating/partner violence, and
    violence in the home before participating in the violence prevention
    education workshops. To date, approximately 641 Los Angeles area youth have
    completed the survey. Following the workshops, Jenesse distributes a
    post-learning survey that captures youths’ perceptions of violence and
    measures their developing understanding of the material. This evaluation
    system provides accurate statistical evidence and data that our program is
    achieving desired outcomes in equipping youth with the knowledge, skills,
    and awareness to address violence in their everyday lives.

Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  A major challenge/barrier that we anticipate is the natural reluctance of
  youth and the community at large to discuss domestic violence. Community
  support is critical to the project’s long term success. Our strategy for
  overcoming this barrier is to continue to increase our profile and expand our
  network by sharing the evaluation results and lessons learned with community
  members, CBOs, government officials, and public as well as private
  stakeholders. We want to show that the project produces tangible results in
  decreasing violence among youth and the community and consequently has a
  significant impact on how youth in 2050 interact with each other, their
  community, and the world.

Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  While other organizations in Los Angeles that work with at-risk youth, Jenesse
  Center was the only organization in California to be awarded a grant in 2013
  by the Department of Justice, Office on Violence Against Women, to do
  prevention work with youth around issues of domestic violence and healthy
  relationships because we are uniquely situated to reframe conversations and
  strategies around violence. Not only does the majority of our staff live in
  this community, and understand its complexities and challenges, but the
  relationships that we have built over the last 35 years allows us to pool
  resources in South Los Angeles to provide significant, meaningful, and
  culturally relevant programs and services that have the potential to transform
  entire communities.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Jenesse has a track record of successful collaboration that speaks volumes
  about the organization’s ability to motivate and maintain strong partnerships.
  CCRN has shown great success at Locke and Jordan High Schools. For the
  purposes of this grant, we will continue to collaborate with our (CCRN)
  Memorandum of Understanding Partners which include: Watts Healthcare
  Corporation, Green Dot Public Schools (Locke and Jordan High Schools), South
  Central Training Consortium, and the Los Angeles Police Department. Funds from
  LA2050 will not be used to fund the CCRN collaborative partners.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Jenesse plans to scale the success of the proposal through the number of youth
  (and parents) served, the number of hours of technical assistance offered, and
  the workshop outcomes. Before implementing our current workshops, we
  administered a Youth and Partner Perception Survey to ascertain the need. The
  survey results were analyzed and interpreted by independent contractors Gary
  Bess Associates and confirmed that violence is a prevailing problem for the
  Los Angeles youth surveyed. We also plan to administer a new survey to
  existing participants to show the effectiveness of the workshop and identify
  areas for improvement. Gary Bess Associates will continue to evaluate all data
  and track program outcomes. Jenesse has already successfully implemented this
  model. In year 2 of the program we reached over 3,000 South Los Angeles youth,
  over 500 parents, and more than 100 service providers in 6 months through our
  violence prevention, intervention and outreach services. It is our intention
  to use the second survey results as a blue print to enhance and expand
  existing services, resources and technical assistance to at least 3,000 more
  youth, parents and partners. We also intend to have a model that can be
  replicated in other Los Angeles area schools and beyond.
