  NFTE Greater LA proposes to expand our program enrollment to reach additional
  youth in the Los Angeles community. We also propose to build a pathway and
  continuum of support between our current program offerings: Exploring Careers
  (middle school), Startup Tech (middle school app development program),
  Entrepreneurship (high school), Startup Summer (alumni accelerator) and Alumni
  Programming that addresses the NFTE alumni ongoing needs for support in their
  business, career and education goals.

  Entrepreneurial thinking and behavior are crucial skills for success in the
  21st Century. We live in a world that looks fundamentally different than ever
  before – with economies evolving faster and more fluidly than in the past. One
  in three employers say they are looking for entrepreneurial experience in
  their potential hires. To be successful in today's workforce, youth need to
  know how to recognize opportunity, take initiative, solve difficult problems,
  and remain resilient and confident in the face of challenges. NFTE Greater LA
  is working to equip our youth with entrepreneurial skills that will benefit
  them for a lifetime. Funds from the LA2050 Challenge will enable us to expand
  our program enrollment and build a pathway for students to progress through
  NFTE’s program offerings.
   
   Exploring Careers: Exploring Careers is a curriculum targeting middle school and early high school students. It provides youth with an opportunity to learn about the variety of industries in which they may wish to pursue a career. Students gain a foundation in entrepreneurship and develop a business concept in their desired industry area. Students pitch their business ideas in a science fair-type format to an audience of peers, family and the school and business communities. NFTE has a second textbook and accompanying training and program materials to support the Exploring Careers classes.
   Entrepreneurship: Teachers draw upon our 11th edition textbook, Entrepreneurship: Owning Your Future to teach entrepreneurship concepts. Along with the textbook, The NFTE program includes experiential activities that connect these concepts to “real world” situations. For example, during the Wholesale Field Trip, students are given $25 to purchase products from the LA Fashion District to resell at a school selling event. This activity helps students practice negotiation skills, calculate their breakeven point, market their products and deliver great customer service. Activities like these occur throughout the class, keeping students engaged and excited through hands on learning. Throughout the class, students research and write a business plan (both a PowerPoint as well as a narrative form business plan.) At the close of the course, students compete in a series of business plan competitions that begin in the classroom and proceed to the national level.
   
   Startup Summer enrolls 15 advanced NFTE grads annually to seed and launch.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  We are seeking the most effective internal partners within Los Angeles Unified
  School District to assist us in expanding our programs throughout middle and
  high schools that offer business programs. With many competing priorities and
  changes in leadership, we are continuing to seek the right advocates to
  advance our goals of expansion within LA Unified. At the same time, we
  continue to grow our presence in the Greater Los Angeles region through
  referrals from current teachers and principals who place a high value on our
  program. We are also continuing to build traction with smaller districts and
  local charter school organizations to advance our goal of growing our reach.
   We will also undertake a strategic communications effort to address school administrators and decision-makers within our target market, elevating awareness of our program successes and enlisting additional partners in our work.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  The NFTE Program Team uses Salesforce to monitor completion of our core units
  of learning and our key experiential activities.
   To measure our impact, we use:
   * Pre-Post Testing: Schools implement our standard pre- and post- test survey to capture short-term outcomes of entrepreneurship education related to the 'entrepreneurial mindset'. These surveys assess NFTE's impact on students' career ready skills.
   *Periodic Knowledge Assessments: NFTE students take part in a Diagnostic Assessment at the start of NFTE, and a Summative Assessment at the close. They also may take four unit assessments throughout the course to track their knowledge gains. These tools are analyzed by NFTE's Research Team and enable us to pinpoint areas in need of further focus.
   Outputs:
   1. 2,300 students served
   2. 90% of students will complete business plans in 2015-2016
   3. 90% of students will demonstrate a 15% increase in business knowledge
   4. 80% of teachers will fulfill their Teacher Objectives Contract
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  NFTE works alongside Junior Achievement, Project ECHO and Academy of Business
  Leadership. All of our organizations empower youth through financial literacy
  and business leadership, but the differences between NFTE and these
  organizations are:
   1) We specifically focus on low-income youth.
   2) We have an award-winning textbook aligned to local and national educational standards, and require that our students receive a minimum of 65 hours of instruction in entrepreneurship.
   3) The NFTE program is taught by experienced educators, who receive additional support from our cadre of volunteers.
   4) In LAUSD, Hawthorne and Downey School Districts, NFTE has been approved by the UC system as a G elective class, so students can receive UC college credits while in high school.
   4) In 2002, NFTE received the Golden Lamp Award, the highest honor in educational publishing, by the Association of Educational Publishers. In 2010, our 11th edition textbook was the winner of the AEP's Distinguished Achievement Award for best mathematics curriculum for grades 9-12.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Should we be selected, NFTE will continue to engage our school partners,
  community organizations and university partners in expanding our work. NFTE
  will receive and manage the grant funds to achieve our programmatic goals.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  NFTE expects to spend approximately $633,000 on our direct program expenses in
  FY16. We are implementing a Development Plan which will guide our fundraising
  from a diverse mix of corporations, foundations and individuals to meet or
  exceed our goal in FY16. Our student enrollment and our revenue have grown
  steadily over the last five years, and we look to continue on that path to
  bring the NFTE program to greater numbers of youth.

How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  In FY16 we plan to enact our first-ever Strategic Communications Plan for NFTE
  Greater Los Angeles. Through these efforts, we will engage with our
  stakeholders and outreach to new audiences (including educational, business
  and philanthropic leaders) to engage them in our goals for growth.
   NFTE Greater LA engages in measured growth that allows us to keep pace with the financial requirements of our student enrollment. Each new school that adopts our program makes a financial contribution toward teacher training, professional development and student curriculum costs. Our 2014-2015 programs were funded through a diverse mix of support from corporations (46 percent), foundations (38 percent), individuals (14 percent) and earned income (3 percent). We plan to continue building on our strong base of support, with over 46 percent of our FY15 revenue generated by our local Advisory Board's personal donations and referrals, and 10 percent raised through efforts of our Young Executive Council.
