  Chronic low achievement in math has been a major barrier that has prevented
  Los Angeles from being considered the best place to learn. Struggling students
  need an effective math fluency system to build the foundation they need to
  succeed in higher level math, and teachers need expert training to implement
  effective math instruction. Ironbox Education will fill both of these needs
  for multiple schools in Los Angeles County by using a proven math fluency
  system designed by Dr. Randy Palisoc.

  Ironbox Education was founded by Dr. Randy Palisoc, a renowned LA educator who
  is known for making math easy. Dr. Palisoc has been featured as a math
  education speaker, and a school he founded in South LA was named the #1 Urban
  Elementary School in America in 2013. It was also the first elementary school
  in South LA to ever win the National Blue Ribbon Award, which is the highest
  honor an American public school can earn.
   
   However, even though the elementary school that Dr. Palisoc founded was the first in South LA to ever win such a prestigious award, Dr. Palisoc believes that it shouldn't be the only one. All schools in LA should be great places to learn, not just a few of them.
   
   That's why Dr. Palisoc founded Ironbox Education in 2014 in order to focus on designing math fluency curriculum for schools and providing professional development for teachers. Through Ironbox Education, Dr. Palisoc has taken the lessons that have already made a difference for thousands of students and is now helping other schools in LA and around the country.
   
   Through this grant, Ironbox Education will take this effective math fluency system and will start bringing it to scale throughout Los Angeles, thereby making LA the best place to learn.
   
   When looking at the kindergarten through college pipeline, the foundation for math must be built early in elementary and middle school. Students who struggle in math in high school and who need remedial classes in college are the same ones who never built a strong foundation when they were younger.
   
   Therefore, Ironbox Education will identify middle schools and the elementary schools that feed into them to implement a coordinated math fluency system that will yield long-term benefits. Students will be provided with Ironbox Education's materials, and teachers and parents will be provided with training to develop their expertise in building math fluency.
   
   By building math fluency, which is often overlooked in schools, students will become better problem solvers, which will lead to a rise in Academic Performance Index scores. When students feel more successful and confident, then suspension, expulsion, and truancy rates will go down (Dream Metric). When these students reach high school, their math proficiency will increase, and graduation rates will rise. Those who enter college will better be able to complete their programs on time.
   
   As leverage, the schools in this grant will become models for other schools to replicate.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  One barrier is limited school funding. Schools with tight budgets are often in
  survival mode instead of long-term planning mode. As a result, they may be
  reluctant to try a new system, even if they have an urgent math fluency need
  and even if a system exists that addresses that need.
   
   This grant eliminates that financial barrier, giving schools the courage they need to pilot this needed system. Once they see results, they will be able to focus on the benefits of the system, which far outweigh the costs. This will encourage others to do the same.
   
   A second barrier is implementation. Educational researchers have shown that schools get results only when there is deep implementation. To reach deep implementation, schools will sign a commitment agreement. They will commit to providing the following: informational meetings with teachers and parents to get buy in; time for training teachers and parents; time in the daily schedule for students to use the system; ongoing support visits.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Educational researchers explain that assessments are necessary in order to
  improve instruction and learning. The lessons in this math fluency system
  build sequentially upon each other, and each lesson serves as an assessment
  that needs to be successfully completed before going on to the next lesson.
   
   To evaluate ongoing implementation, schools will track classroom-level data on the number of students who successfully complete each lesson and each unit. This will help make sure that the school and its students are progressing on schedule. 
   
   Additionally, pre-tests and post-tests will be given to see how much students have improved academically over time.
   
   To evaluate teacher and parent expertise, surveys will be conducted after in-person trainings are held. Participants will be asked about what they learned and what support they need. 
   
   Statewide and districtwide assessments will also be used to measure academic growth.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There have long been other organizations that have provided classroom
  materials and teacher training for schools, but too many students in LA
  continue to struggle specifically with math fluency. As a result, these
  students struggle with problem solving as well. 
   
   Ironbox Education specifically addresses this need of building greater math fluency in students.
   
   What makes Ironbox Education's math fluency system unique is that it was created not by a publisher, but by an experienced LA educator with a highly-successful track record. This math fluency system was designed by Dr. Randy Palisoc, a founder of a five-time national award winning school in LA. Dr. Palisoc is known for making math easy.
   
   This proposal seeks to help other schools implement proven strategies in order to help them reach high levels of success as well. This unique proposal is about replicating success throughout Los Angeles.
   
   The in-person teacher trainings and parent workshops are unique as well because they will be personally led by Dr. Palisoc, the actual designer of the math fluency system. This means that teachers and parents will learn directly from the designer. 
   
   As a result, teachers and parents will become math fluency experts themselves, and they will better be able to help their students and their children. To provide ongoing support, teachers and parents will have online access to Dr. Palisoc's lesson-by-lesson demo videos, thereby taking the guesswork out of how to deliver a lesson.
   
   Teachers who have already participated in Ironbox Education's professional development have responded enthusiastically. Some of their feedback include the following:
   
   "Fluency doesn't have to be pulling teeth! I feel privileged that we were trained in this method."
   
   "I learned that you don't have to use traditional methods to teach math. You can use the Easy Breezy methods to get all students to be successful in math."
   
   "I learned how to model using the Step 1 and Step 3 strategies, which were much more efficient ways to add and subtract. I have been working far too hard!"
   
   "Mind blown in a good way!"
   
   "Math isn't a problem. Math is Easy Breezy."
   
   "My biggest takeaway is that this is truly a different way of thinking/teaching/learning rather than a variation of the same old thing."
   
   "I was robbed growing up! These strategies are helpful to everyday life!"
   
   "I wish I knew about this when I was learning math. It would have helped me build a strong foundation."
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  The schools that will be a part of this project are yet to be identified.
  However, it is anticipated that at least some of the schools will be in
  metropolitan Los Angeles. 
   
   Dr. Palisoc started his education career as a classroom teacher in LA, and the award-winning school that he founded is located within the city's boundaries. As a result Dr. Palisoc already has experience partnering with and working with the education community in LA.
   
   The schools in this project will not receive grant funds directly, but they will receive classroom materials, training, and ongoing support paid for by the grant funds.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  It will cost $100,000 to provide the classroom materials, training, and
  ongoing support described in this project.
   
   The project will serve four elementary schools of 500 students each (2,000 elementary school students total) and two middle schools of 1,000 students each (2,000 middle school students total). In all, a total of 4,000 elementary and middle school students will benefit. These figures will be adjusted once the actual partner schools are finalized.
   
   If additional costs are incurred, Ironbox Education will further substantially discount the materials and services so that partner schools can more easily cover the difference that is not paid for by the grant.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  $40,000 for classroom materials for four 500-seat elementary schools
   
   $42,000 for classroom materials for two 1,000-seat middle schools
   
   $12,000 for elementary school training and ongoing support
   
   $6,000 for middle school training and ongoing support
   
   GRAND TOTAL = $100,000 to benefit 4,000 students in six schools
   
   More importantly, these six schools will serve as a model for other schools, and they will demonstrate the tremendous value of building math fluency in students.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  As mentioned earlier, this proposal is about taking a unique math fluency
  system that has proven to be successful in Los Angeles and starting to bring
  it to scale throughout LA, thereby making LA the best place to learn. 
   
   What is most important about this proposal is not just that six lead schools will initially benefit from this grant. The important part is that these six schools will serve as models for building math fluency that many other schools will then feel comfortable following. 
   
   That is the true value of this grant – it creates proof points and raises student expectations for all of Los Angeles.
   
   All the classroom materials, teacher trainings, and parent workshops described in this proposal have already been designed and created, so it is a turnkey solution ready for immediate use.
   
   Once more schools see the value of building math fluency and start to adopt the system, additional staff will be hired to assist with marketing, fulfillment, training, on-campus support, and administrative tasks.
