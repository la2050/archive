title: BlacklistLA Moves Toward The Future
project_summary: "Every Monday night at 10:00 PM, hundreds of Angelenos gather for a 3-mile run through the streets of LA. The location of the run varies; what remains the same is a diverse group of runners sharing their fitness goals, appreciating the unsung beauty of our city’s street art, and developing a deeper connection to each other and our neighborhoods. \r\n\r\nThis proposal aims to turn the powerful connecting force of the BlacklistLA Monday run into a more frequent occurrence by expanding its offerings."

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "We’ll be the first to admit that we’ve got a big crush on this city. Whether catching the sunrise in Chinatown, exploring the trails of Griffith Park, stopping at the LACMA lights for a selfie, or meandering through the canals of Venice, we’ve been going on running dates with Los Angeles for the past several years. Rain or shine, moonlight or darkness, we always show up with a desire to connect the people of LA a bit more. \r\n\r\nWe Angelenos spend too much time in our cars, on our phones, at our desks and disconnected from each other. Breaking these habits can be tough. But, BlacklistLA is encouraging a rapidly growing community of residents to do so though its runs. Whether it’s the Monday night run to a featured piece of street art, the weekday “Metro Run” that involves us hopping on the subway, or the Saturday morning run when we explore different neighborhoods, BlacklistLA is changing the way Angelenos engage with the city and each other. The innovative approach BlacklistLA is taking to build community has caught the eye of Runner’s World magazine, the LA Times, Los Angeles Magazine and the Mayor’s Office. And with nearly 13,000 followers on Instagram, Angelenos clearly want more. \r\n\r\nTo build on this momentum, BlacklistLA is seeking to expand the number of opportunities residents have to connect. We envision a Los Angeles where Angelenos are linked to one another through sport, the alternative forms of transportation they take, and the shared appreciation they have for the city’s diversity. To get there, in 2016 Blacklist seeks to:  \r\n\r\n(1) Offer more runs throughout the city by aligning with Mayor Garcetti’s Great Streets Initiative. The Mayor’s Office has selected one street in each of the 15 council districts to receive improvements to make them more pedestrian-friendly. By tapping into the City’s initiative, BlacklistLA will bring Angelenos together to experience LA’s Great Streets. \r\n(2) Foster deeper connections between Angelenos who are working toward a shared race goal. BlacklistLA will be creating training groups for the Happy Birthday LA 5k, LA Chinatown Firecracker 10K, Hollywood Half Marathon and Los Angeles Marathon. \r\n(3) Expand BlacklistLA’s Happy Birthday LA 5K. Last month, BlacklistLA held its inaugural Happy Birthday LA 5K to celebrate the City’s 234th. The race attracted nearly 500 runners to the start line at Olvera Street, the City’s birthplace. With support from LA 2050, BlacklistLA hopes to attract 1000 to next year's race. "

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "The only barrier we anticipate is the hefty price tag associated with the Happy Birthday LA 5K. While many of the costs are covered by registration fees and sponsorships, the city permits for street closures in the downtown area amounted to $20,000. We are hopeful that our relationship with the Mayor’s Office will yield a waiver of such fees. If that does not occur, we have already started to seek support to have this cost underwritten. \r\n\r\nBlacklistLA’s tremendous achievements have been fueled by the volunteer energies of a committed group of individuals. While the organization has done an outstanding job of developing a constant supply of volunteers who serve as pacers, safety marshals, and brand promoters, it is clear that dedicated staff would allow BlacklistLA to take its vision to the next level. If for any reason, BlacklistLA weren’t able to garner the support needed to hire staff, the organization has created a sustainable approach to maintain its current offerings. \r\n"
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "The success of our work will be measured by our ability to make progress toward our expected outcomes. Included below are our two desired outcomes: \r\n(1) More Angelenos will be connected through BlacklistLA (BLA) offerings.\r\nNumber of Angelenos who attend BLA runs, number of repeat runners, number of runners in BLA training groups for targeted races, number of runners who participate in BLA's 5k, diversity of communities of BLA runners, presence of BLA community members at races and number of Angelenos who follow BLA’s social media.\r\n\r\n(2) More Angelenos will experience alternative forms of transportation and different neighborhoods of L.A. \r\nNumber of Angelenos who are exposed to and take public transit at least once per month. Number of Angelenos who report that BLA has exposed them to a new neighborhood\r\n\r\nWe will be tracking these numbers and data points throughout the year. All of the data will be the basic information used for any midcourse corrections that need to be made. \r\n"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "\r\nThere are numerous running groups in LA that are doing a great job at getting people outdoors – LA Leggers, The Nike Run Club, Rundalay, Boyle Heights Bridgerunners, just to name a few. While our missions are complementary, BlacklistLA brings the unique approach of integrating street art, alternative transportation and a love for LA and civic life to the table. \r\n\r\nOutside of the running community, Ciclavia is the perhaps doing the most complementary work to the mission and vision of BlacklistLA. We have learned from their approach to creating opportunities for Angelenos to connect, get outdoors and use alternative means of transportation. And we look forward to the opportunity of working more closely with Ciclavia in the years to come once we have dedicated staff to cement those partnerships. "
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "To make this idea a reality, several key collaborators and partners will be involved in our work: \r\nBlacklistLA Steering Committee and Volunteers:  Strategic Guidance - $0\r\nLA Chinatown Firecracker Run Committee:  Fiscal Sponsorship - $0\r\nMayor’s Office: Alignment with Great Streets Urban Renewal Program $0 \r\n"
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    The total cost of the initiative is approximately double of what we are
    seeking from LA2050 - $200,000. However, this additional amount will be
    covered through in-kind donations, volunteer time, and sponsorships. We have
    runners who have offered to volunteer their time to execute the runs; we
    have videographers and a webmaster who have committed to furthering the
    brand; and we have colleagues in the public art and transportation realms
    who advise us on strategic areas to visit in the city. We will also continue
    to pursue foundation funding for our efforts. 
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Executive Director- $40,000\r\nBlacklistLA Run and Training Group Supplies - $15,000\r\nVolunteer Appreciation Event - $5000\r\nHappy Birthday LA 5K - $25,000\r\nAdministrative Costs - $15,000\r\nTotal: $100,000\r\n"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "As a growing movement of Angelenos, BlacklistLA always has scaling at the front of our mind. We believe that a one-year, $100,000  investment in BlacklistLA will allow the organization to effectively keep pace with the high demand, as well as determine how to promote future growth. We believe that our scalability lies in our ability to offer more runs throughout the city, as well as our ability to connect people in-person and online. \r\n"
