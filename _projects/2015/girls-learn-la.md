  Recognizing the research that shows that an all-girls school has a significant
  impact on the academic achievement of young women, GALA will provide a
  rigorous college preparatory education with a STEM based curriculum. Our
  proposal is for a collaborative work Maker Space, which will provide a more
  flexible learning environment where the girls can apply their collaborative,
  academic and technology skills to building projects.
Please specify below: 'GALA Academy, on the campus of LA High School, Los Angeles, Ca'
category: learn
'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Los Angeles GALA graduates will graduate college-ready in the fields of STEM,
  taking with them core values of academic excellence, ethical leadership and a
  sense of self and community. In LAUSD, the female population is under served
  in math, science, technology and the development of a strong independent
  voice. GALA will seek to address these issues within a single-sex environment
  and as the first all-girls public school, will serve as a research and
  development site for effective urban schools and transfer success practice to
  the larger LAUSD co-educational context. 
   
   Most inner city girls have never used tools to make hand-on projects. A Maker Space at our school will be a collaborative workshop where girls gain practical hands-on experiences with new technologies and innovative processes to design and build projects. A Maker Space can provide a flexible environment where learning is made physical by applying science, technology, math and creativity to solve problems and build things. Who in this group will be the next inventor, problem solver, or technology innovator? Who in this group will figure out answers to solve LA's problems of drought, homelessness, or earthquakes? 
   
   GALA will be opening this Fall 2016 with grades 6 and 9, with approximately 100 students per grade level. GALA will add a grade level each year until it reaches 6th-12th (a SPAN school). Starting with the Spring Board, College Board pre-AP curriculum in middle school, students will gain the necessary prerequisite skills to be successful in rigorous AP sequence in high school, enabling students to be selected into highly selective colleges. Through hand-on projects created in the Maker Space, GALA students will gain valuable experiences needed to understand real-life engineering and scientific applications, while applying what they learned to practice. Through their advisories and a designated college counselor, students will begin planning their college pathway in middle school. Teachers will incorporate college awareness and application process through advisories in high school. At the end, you will have a well-rounded Los Angeles high school graduate ready to excel in STEM fields.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  The biggest barrier any new school with a specialized STEM-based program will
  encounter, is lack of funding. Because equipment, machines and tools costs
  money--we recognize that we must fund-raise or seek donations from outside
  sources to overcome this barrier. Currently we are reaching out to
  organizations to partner with and help develop our programs.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Our qualitative evaluation will be in the projects the girls will design, the
  competitions they enter, and the learning that will take place in the
  collaborative maker space. The quantitative evaluation will come through the
  increased amount of girls graduating and attending colleges, and majoring in
  STEM careers like engineering, mathematics and science.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  GALA is the first all-girls public high school opening in California. There
  are some all-girls pubic schools in New York and Texas who we have modeled,
  but we are the first one in the state. It is a unique approach backed-up by
  data showing that girls perform better and graduate at higher rates when in an
  all-girl environment. We are also unique in that we are approaching educating
  the whole child in more than academics, building social and emotional skills,
  as well as providing a highly rigorous academic program.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Wiz Girls is helping us with providing "Coding" training, no cost. We also
  have partnerships with STEM Pilot, Campus Steps, and Mt. St. Mary's, all
  no-cost partnerships.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 â€“ how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  The Maker Space we have budgeted for is $100, 000. If there are any additional
  costs, the school will fund raise or seek partnerships with organizations or
  companies who could help raise the money to cover overages.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-

How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  We hope to build three to four other girls schools in Los Angeles in the next
  few years. We hope that the Maker Space STEM model can be used at any LAUSD
  school focused on a STEM curriculum. This type of work space will bring in
  educators and professionals to conduct workshops and demonstrations to enhance
  the curriculum.
