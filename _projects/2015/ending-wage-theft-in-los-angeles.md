title: Ending Wage Theft in Los Angeles
project_summary: >-
  We seek to increase the resilience of low wage workers and their industries in
  LA by improving the enforcement of basic labor protections. We will design and
  pilot a wage theft prevention tool to help predict when and where wage theft
  occurs, so that City officials may wisely allocate resources to protect
  workers’ wages, and responsible employers from unfair competition. We will
  also produce industry case studies, to identify and learn from employers who
  create quality employment.

  'DESCRIBE IN GREATER DETAIL HOW YOU WILL MAKE LA THE HEALTHIEST PLACE TO LIVE: ': "Each week, 30% of Angelenos in low-wage industries make less than minimum wage. 80% who work overtime aren’t paid for it; another 80% work through breaks. All told, wage theft siphons $26.2 million weekly from low-wage workers and the economy. Lost tax revenue robs the state of some $153 million annually, and local government of some $16 million.\r\n\r\nThe cost of wage theft isn’t just economic; it affects the health and well-being of communities. Each year, workers lose 12.5%--$2,070--from take-home pay of $16,500. This perpetuates poor housing and food insecurity. It exacerbates existing conditions like hypertension, diabetes, anxiety, ulcers, and depression. Workers struggle for additional hours to make up for lost wages, diminishing time for children, education, or self-care. \r\n\r\nEnforcement is impossible in a climate of fear, yet Angelenos attempting to enforce their rights face a 50% chance of retaliation. This climate of lawlessness gives a competitive advantage to businesses who cheat. Employers who want to do the right thing can’t compete.\r\n\r\nLA City and County voted to address economic inequality and stagnant wages by increasing the minimum wage. But without enforcement, as minimum wages increase, so will wage theft. New wage enforcement offices will need tools to handle the volume of violations when the new wage takes effect.\r\n\r\nWe propose a prototype to help identify the characteristics of 1) businesses in high-wage-theft industries that beat the odds to create good, healthy workplaces and 2) those who commit the most egregious violations. The prototype can inform policy to assist good actors and more effectively target businesses who bring our City down. It offers refined understanding of when and where wage theft occurs--as well as when and where businesses rise above. In a climate where retaliation is endemic, this promises a more inclusive process, helping identify violations where plaintiffs are afraid to come forward. We will share our prototype and convene conversations with the city, data scientists, and community groups. We will conduct case studies in high-risk industries to identify distinguishing factors between “high road” employers and employers with exceeding numbers of wage-theft complaints. \r\n\r\nThis partnership between KIWA; UCLA Labor Center; and Princeton researchers including the CEO of Department of Better Technology unites decades of on-the ground knowledge with employment policy expertise and data-driven analytical capacity."

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "Access to data is the primary obstacle. Historical wage theft data is needed to train the model to predict the type of firms likely to stand out as the best and worst actors. These data must be paired with other firm-level characteristics such as tax-record information, density of surrounding competitors, and industry characteristics. \r\n\r\nRegarding both qualitative and quantitative data, KIWA has 23 years assisting workers to submit wage claims, a deep knowledge of conditions in low-income communities, and strong ties to other community organizations. In California, wage-theft complaints have been handled by the State Labor Commission. At KIWA, we have strong ties with the Commissioner. She has shared data with us in the past and we are confident that she will be enthusiastic about this project and work with us on these requests. This grant will dedicate resources to enable systematic data collection and bring on board competent, comprehensive data and policy analysis."
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Our evaluation will answer three questions:\r\n\r\nDoes this save time?\r\n\r\nDoes this accurately predict violators and high road employers? \r\n\r\nDoes this help community based organizations and wage enforcement agencies allocate resources more effectively?\r\n\r\nThese questions will be measured through qualitative interviews with wage enforcement officials and community organizations, as well as with quantitative results from the prediction model. "
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "Fifteen organizations comprise the steering committee of the Los Angeles Coalition against Wage Theft, who are dedicated to building awareness of basic labor rights addressing wage and hour violations in specific communities. For example, the Garment Worker Center resolves claims for garment workers; the Restaurant Opportunity Center for restaurant workers; and the CLEAN CarWash Campaign for carwash workers.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is the first known attempt (in Los Angeles or elsewhere) to use machine learning and new data science techniques to help predict when and where wage theft occurs."
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "For this project, KIWA is partnering with the UCLA Labor Center as well as researchers and technologists from Princeton University. UCLA Labor Labor is a leading research and education center for worker justice, and will support the identification of existing data and relevant researcher. Tia Koonse, Legal and Policy Researcher Manager, and Veronica Wilson, Partnerships Director, will lead this effort the Labor Center. \r\n\r\nData science and software development will be led by Josh Goldstein and Alex Bollfrass. Josh is CEO of the Department of Better Technology, a company dedicated to making great software to help governments and non-profits serve their communities. He is also a PhD candidate at Princeton, where he works on data-driven public service delivery. He has consulted for Google and the World Bank. Alex is a Ph.D. candidate at Princeton University’s Woodrow Wilson School of International Affairs. His research is on a wide variety of policy topics and emphasizes the application of unique data sources to complex problems, including intelligence assessments of nuclear weapons programs and the implications of changes in climate for human conflict. \r\n\r\nKIWA - $31K\r\nUCLA Labor Center - $12K\r\nPrinceton researchers (as consultants to KIWA) - $57K"
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': The pilot will cost $100K.
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Project Management ($26K) Develop contextual understanding of the determinants of wage theft, the current process of business auditing, and available data sets.\r\n\r\nData and Software Data Development ($57K) Develop the model in Python or R programming languages and develop web application using Ruby on Rails, Javascript, HTML and CSS\r\n\r\nLabor Law & Policy Analysis ($12K) Apply expertise in wage theft policy development in Los Angeles and Statewide. Work with City and State authorities to implement the new software in day to day wage theft prevention activities and measure effectiveness. \r\nMarketing and Travel ($5K) Share lessons with the broader data science and labor rights communities through blog posts and presentations."
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    After completion of a successful pilot, Phase 2 will focus on replication
    and scale at both a city, state and national level. Since the code will be
    open source, this project will become a repository for other communities
    seeking to implement their own wage theft prevention tools. We will also
    continue to encourage city and state officials to use data-driven techniques
    where they help to contribute to more workers receiving the wages they are
    owned. Finally, we may seek additional grant funding to support further
    development and deployment of the wage theft prediction tool.
