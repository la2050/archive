title: Ending Wage Theft in Los Angeles
project_summary: >-
  We seek to increase the resilience of low wage workers and their industries in
  LA by improving the enforcement of basic labor protections. We will design and
  pilot a wage theft prevention tool to help predict when and where wage theft
  occurs, so that City officials may wisely allocate resources to protect
  workers’ wages, and responsible employers from unfair competition. We will
  also produce industry case studies, to identify and learn from employers who
  create quality employment.
