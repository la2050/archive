  'DESCRIBE IN GREATER DETAIL HOW YOU WILL MAKE LA THE HEALTHIEST PLACE TO LIVE: ': "Climate Ready Roofs is developing a replicable model that demonstrates how our city can become more resilient – even thrive – despite a warmer future. With LA 2050’s help, we will re-roof, eight unique single-family homes in the Los Angeles area with cool roofing shingles, and then install solar electric systems on those roofs. \r\n\r\nThe three groups that comprise Climate Ready Roofs serve unique roles in this project which delivers on the promise of clean renewable power and climate resilience to disadvantaged communities.\r\n\r\nClimate Resolve will use its relationships with manufacturers to procure roofing materials and further work with local and state agencies to win new cool roof policies throughout the county and state.\r\n\r\nGRID Alternatives is the state administrator of the California Public Utilities Commission’s Single-Family Affordable Solar Housing Program, the nation’s first low-income solar program. These funds, along with other donations allow their staff to find clients who qualify for a solar electric system at little to no cost. Although GRID assists hundreds of families annually, approximately 50% cannot receive a solar electric system because of the condition of their roof.\r\n\r\nHabitat for Humanity has 25 years of experience working in partnership with low-income homeowners living in greater Los Angeles. More specifically, in the eight years it has offered a Home Repair program, Habitat LA has provided more than 230 low income homeowners with health and safety related repairs, with roof replacements being one of the most frequently provided services. \r\n\r\nCool roofs are made with materials that naturally reflect sunlight; sending solar waves harmlessly back into the atmosphere. While most standard roofs absorb the sun’s radiant energy into the building—transferring it as heat—cool roofs reflect much of the sunlight to keep buildings cooler, increasing comfort for occupants and reducing the risk of heat-related illness. Because cool roofs are an energy saving technology, there will not need to be as many solar panels installed, since less energy will be required to power the home. This provides an opportunity for a greater number of homeowners to receive solar arrays.\r\n\r\nClimate Ready Roofs delivers on the need for environmental equity. It doesn’t just create the roadmap; it helps build the road to a cleaner more equitable future. \r\n"

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "Our primary barrier is making cool roofs just as cool and attractive as solar power. Everyone knows solar, but few people know about cool roofs. \r\n\r\nWhat the public doesn’t know, and needs to learn, is that cool roofs have an esteemed history. Historically, the White Towns of Andalusia in Spain paint their homes bright white to shed the sun’s radiation. Today, in the United States, cool roofs are being made by leading manufacturers, there’s a cool roof industry association and even a cool roof rating council that independently evaluates the effectiveness of roofing material. (Over one thousand products qualify.)\r\n\r\nIt’s important to note that climate change, as its own phenomenon, will also increasingly drive the public to adopt cool roofs. Given the past year of extreme heat in Los Angeles, and the upward trend predicted by climate scientists – a 3-5°F increase by 2050 – we see the public seeking out cooling technologies in the future.\r\n\r\nThis is where Climate Ready Roofs steps in. \r\n"
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    We will use a variety of measures to evaluate the success of the Climate
    Ready Roofs projects. To track any changes in energy usage, we will collect
    and analyze 6 months of pre and post electric usage on each of the 6
    families we serve. Second, each of the eight families will be required to
    complete a post-installation survey asking about the quality of work, level
    of satisfaction with the application and assessment process, any changes in
    behavior that would affect their energy usage post-install, the
    professionalism of the staff, and whether their experience met, exceeded or
    did not meet their expectations. Third, we will evaluate the success of our
    education and advocacy efforts by the progress we make towards inspiring the
    County of Los Angeles to adopt a cool roof ordinance. We believe these are
    not only achievable goals but the stepping stones to a comprehensive
    revitalization of underserved communities in Los Angeles and potentially
    throughout the state and the nation. 
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    The short answer is no. Climate Ready Roofs is a first of its kind program.
    Bridging climate mitigation and resilience has rarely been attempted, let
    alone in low-income neighborhoods most in need. It is projected that, by
    mid-century, Los Angeles will be 3-5° F warmer, and the number of extreme
    heat days will double. Climate Resolve is the only organization in Los
    Angeles working to alter the infrastructure of the region to cool down
    neighborhoods in the face of a warming climate. Couple that with Grid
    Alternatives’ experience bringing together community partners, volunteers
    and job trainees on over 950 roofs over eight years to implement solar power
    and energy efficiency for low-income families at no cost and Habitat LA’s
    unique network of community partners, donors and volunteers built over the
    last 25 years to help low-income homeowners restore and maintain their homes
    through its Home Repair Program, and there is simply no other project like
    Climate Ready Roofs.
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "What makes this project so unique isn’t just the energy savings for low-income homeowners or the cooling and improved air quality of the surrounding neighborhoods, but the first-of-its-kind partnership that has developed between three organizations, each with a proven track record of success in creating a more livable, healthier and more equitable city. Climate Resolve has partnered with Grid Alternatives Greater Los Angeles and Habitat for Humanity of Greater Los Angeles. \r\n\r\nGrid Alternatives Greater Los Angeles: GLA is a non-profit solar company that provides solar electric systems to low-income families at no cost.  The solar arrays are installed using community volunteers and individuals seeking job training for the solar industry.  GLA’s vision is a successful transition to clean, renewable energy that includes all people.  Solar represents a solution to climate change that can be adopted now to reduce carbon emissions.\r\n\r\nHabitat for Humanity of Greater Los Angeles: Habitat LA has been providing housing solutions to low income families in greater Los Angeles since 1990. The largest affiliate west of the Mississippi, Habitat LA has built, renovated and repaired over 600 homes in the greater Los Angeles area and has helped build over 400 homes internationally. A commitment to the environment and sustainable building practices has been a core component of Habitat’s work for over a decade. Since 2008, Habitat LA has built more than 50 homes that have achieved Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification, with 41 of those homes receiving Silver certification or higher\r\n"
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    Climate Resolve, GLA and Habitat LA have already come together to place a
    Climate Ready Roof pilot project for a low-income homeowner in South Los
    Angeles.  Because there is already a model of how this project will work we
    have experience budgeting for a greater number of homes. Based on this
    initial project and our history of roof replacement and solar installations,
    we are confident that we can complete a minimum of eight projects with the
    $100,000 grant.

  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "We see this initial project as highly scalable. This is a unique program that helps low-income people be part of the clean energy revolution.\r\n\r\nClimate Ready Roofs is an effective, even obvious, way for the State of California to meet its ambitious goal of cutting electricity use in half in existing buildings by the year 2030. As such, we anticipate California looking to proven models on how buildings can dramatically reduce energy and provide other benefits, such as aiding resilience to warmer temperatures.\r\n\r\nLA 2050’s support of Climate Ready Roofs would develop the model. The scale-up could be funded by either the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund or via utility rates.\r\n\r\nThe Climate Ready Roofs model is exciting because it provides so many benefits at a low cost. If scaled-up, the cost of labor will remain low. There are 49 Habitat for Humanity affiliates in California and more than 1,400 throughout the United States. In addition, there are 7 GRID Alternatives affiliates in California and 10 throughout the country.   Moreover, the cost of photovoltaic modules is at an all-time low and is expected to come down further. Funding from the PUC will continue to help pay for low income families to receive solar power through at least 2021. Last, the cost of cool roofs will remain low, thanks to LA City’s aforementioned incentive program, which we hope to expand to the county level. Because Investor Owned Utilities (IOU) need to reach 10% reduction in projected load targets via energy efficiency by 2020, utilities have been given permission to pass these costs on to ratepayers – therefore, we can anticipate more support from IOUs. Indeed, if new countywide mandates on cool roofs take hold, similar to what’s in place in the city of LA, the sheer volume of new “cool” roofing materials would help drive down the price.\r\n"
