title: Climate Ready Roofs
project_summary: >-
  California’s climate is changing and it’s vital that the people of Los Angeles
  are prepared. Three local organizations – Habitat for Humanity Greater Los
  Angeles, Grid Alternatives Greater Los Angeles and Climate Resolve – have
  joined forces to help low-income Angelenos become climate ready by placing
  solar panels on newly laid cool roofs. With your help, this innovative LA
  program can become a model for the nation.

Where will you be working?:
  - County of Los Angeles
  - City of Los Angeles
How do you plan to use these resources to make change?:
  - Engage residents and stakeholders
  - Implement a pilot or new project
  - Expand a pilot or a program
  - Advocate with policymakers and leaders
How will your proposal improve the following “Live” metrics?:
  - Exposure to air toxins
  - Number of households below the self-sufficiency index
  - Housing affordability
  - Rates of homelessness
  - Percentage of LA communities that are resilient (Dream Metric)
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We will use a variety of measures to evaluate the success of the Climate Ready
  Roofs projects. To track any changes in energy usage, we will collect and
  analyze 6 months of pre and post electric usage on each of the 6 families we
  serve. Second, each of the eight families will be required to complete a
  post-installation survey asking about the quality of work, level of
  satisfaction with the application and assessment process, any changes in
  behavior that would affect their energy usage post-install, the
  professionalism of the staff, and whether their experience met, exceeded or
  did not meet their expectations. Third, we will evaluate the success of our
  education and advocacy efforts by the progress we make towards inspiring the
  County of Los Angeles to adopt a cool roof ordinance. We believe these are not
  only achievable goals but the stepping stones to a comprehensive
  revitalization of underserved communities in Los Angeles and potentially
  throughout the state and the nation. 
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
  - Money (financial capital)
  - Volunteers/staff (human capital)
  - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
  - 'Infrastructure (building/space/vehicles, etc.)'
  - Education/training
  - 'Technical infrastructure (computers, etc.)'
  - Community outreach
  - Network/relationship support
