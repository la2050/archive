  'DESCRIBE IN GREATER DETAIL HOW YOU WILL MAKE LA THE HEALTHIEST PLACE TO LIVE: ': "ARC’s Support Network is made up of more than 225 formerly incarcerated members who commit to living crime-free, gang-free, and drug-free; enrolling in school or working; and being of service to the community and the ARC Network.\r\n\r\nThrough this network, members reduce association with negative influences that can lead to criminal behavior and instead build healthy relationships with positive peers. The Coalition serves as a source of motivation and empowerment for members, who witness peers working hard to beat the odds and see the opportunities that result from that effort.\r\n\r\nWhile ARC matches members with adult mentors, it also offers members critical peer support from individuals who have been incarcerated and understand the challenges they are facing. The support they receive from one another is authentic, relevant, and effective. The recidivism rate of ARC members is less than five percent.\r\n\r\nRecognizing this, ARC recently developed a pre-release mentorship program to incarcerated youth in three Los Angeles County juvenile facilities: the Barry J. Nidorf Juvenile Hall, which houses youth charged as adults, and the Scott and Scudder Juvenile Camps for girls. ARC partnered with the Los Angeles County Probation Department to develop this program, which brings 10 formerly incarcerated members inside facilities on a weekly basis to serve as peer mentors to 110 incarcerated youth.\r\n\r\nTo make LA the healthiest place to live for all of its residents, ARC will develop a scalable model to expand its pre-release mentorship program to additional juvenile facilities in LA, including Eastlake and Los Padrinos Juvenile Halls, and additional probation camps. ARC will develop a program curriculum, training materials for staff and mentors, an implementation manual and recommendations and best practices documents to promote program replication. \r\n\r\nARC will train 20 additional formerly incarcerated members to serve as peer mentors to prepare for expanding the program to two new locations and to enhance the pilot year of the program by providing more individualized support.\r\n\r\nUpon release, participants will receive re-entry support through ARC’s Membership Services which include post-release mentoring, case management, education assistance, internships, employment opportunities, support meetings, and housing opportunities."

    To prepare for expanding its pre-release mentorship program in two
    additional juvenile halls, ARC will focus in the pilot year on developing a
    clear process with the Los Angeles County Probation Department for training
    mentors and ARC staff on facility regulations, and on handling potential
    issues such as mental health or medical crises. ARC will work closely with
    Probation to ensure buy-in from staff and administration, and to develop
    replicable procedures around all aspects of the Program, from bringing
    supplies and program materials into facilities to managing potential
    conflicts and issues. ARC will enhance its current Membership Services
    framework to include more robust case management. Reentry services offered
    through this enhanced model will continue to focus on the core components of
    ARC’s current model, emphasizing educational enrollment and success,
    workforce preparation, employment opportunity and the development of
    positive social networks through mentorship and the Network
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "ARC will utilize its partnerships with the Los Angeles County Probation Department and the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) to support data collection on program participants, as well as to gather additional information and statistics around Los Angeles County’s incarcerated population and its demographics.\r\n\r\nARC’s Membership Services Director will oversee data collection, in close collaboration with ARC Case Managers and participating peer mentors. Data will be recorded in individual participant files and tracked through ARC’s secure member database. ARC will track the following performance measures: number of youth enrolled in services, number of youth exhibiting change in behavioral violations, substance abuse, gang activity and mental health, recidivism and reentry outcomes and probation violations, second and post-secondary education enrollment, job training and placement and connection to trauma-therapy and/or substance abuse treatment.\r\n"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "ARC’s pre-release mentorship program is unprecedented in the history of Los Angeles County Probation. This program offers incarcerated youth the opportunity to learn from and engage with peers who have experienced incarceration firsthand. Furthermore, mentors have also received support and services through ARC’s Membership Services and can best explain the benefits and value of the ARC Support Network.  \r\n\r\nARC partner organization InsideOUT Writers (IOW) currently offers a pre-release creative writing program in the Barry J. Nidorf Juvenile Hall led by volunteer teachers. These writing programs promote positive peer interaction among incarcerated youth and provide a safe space for creativity and growth.\r\n\r\nIOW also offers an alumni program that provides case management to identify and address short and long term goals of formerly incarcerated alumni, post-release mentorship opportunities with adult volunteers to foster positively and healthy relationships, and life skills programming, including alumni writing circles. \r\n\r\nARC sees IOW’s pre-release creative writing classes as complimentary to ARC’s mentorship program, and IOW’s post-release reentry services as directly aligned with ARC’s service offerings and intends to collaborate with IOW to enhance this program.

  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "To complete enhancements of ARC’s case management model, ARC will collaborate with Leaders in Community Alternatives, or an equally distinguished community-based services provider.\r\n\r\nTo enhance recruitment and matching elements of its post-release mentorship services, ARC will partner with the Los Angeles Federation of Labor, the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, Warner Brothers Pictures, Paramount Pictures, Sony Pictures, two local law firms and various other community leaders and organizations to recruit additional mentors who work in careers that are of particular interest to current ARC members.\r\n\r\nFinally, to enhance the pre-release mentorship program curriculum and post-release reentry services, and to recruit and refer mentorship program participants and new members, ARC will partner with InsideOUT Writers."
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    ARC estimates that developing a scalable model and expanding the pre-release
    mentorship program to an additional two juvenile facilities by 2017 will
    cost approximately $100,000. Funding will be used to provide stipends and
    travel for additional mentors, to hire consultants to oversee expansion and
    evaluation of the pilot program and to develop program materials and guides.
    Funding will also be used to work with a partner organization to enhance
    ARC’s current case management model in order to prepare to serve additional
    members as participants in the pre-release mentorship program are released.
