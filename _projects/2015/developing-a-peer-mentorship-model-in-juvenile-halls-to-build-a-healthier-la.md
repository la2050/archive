project_summary: >-
  To make Los Angeles a healthier place to live for some of the city’s most
  vulnerable young people, ARC will expand and enhance its unique mentorship
  program for incarcerated youth by training additional formerly incarcerated
  members to serve as peer mentors, and developing a scalable model that can be
  replicated in additional juvenile facilities in the next three years.
Please specify below: 'Barry J. Nidorf Juvenile Hall, Camps Scott and Scudder'
category: live
'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  ARC’s Support Network is made up of more than 225 formerly incarcerated
  members who commit to living crime-free, gang-free, and drug-free; enrolling
  in school or working; and being of service to the community and the ARC
  Network.
   
   Through this network, members reduce association with negative influences that can lead to criminal behavior and instead build healthy relationships with positive peers. The Coalition serves as a source of motivation and empowerment for members, who witness peers working hard to beat the odds and see the opportunities that result from that effort.
   
   While ARC matches members with adult mentors, it also offers members critical peer support from individuals who have been incarcerated and understand the challenges they are facing. The support they receive from one another is authentic, relevant, and effective. The recidivism rate of ARC members is less than five percent.
   
   Recognizing this, ARC recently developed a pre-release mentorship program to incarcerated youth in three Los Angeles County juvenile facilities: the Barry J. Nidorf Juvenile Hall, which houses youth charged as adults, and the Scott and Scudder Juvenile Camps for girls. ARC partnered with the Los Angeles County Probation Department to develop this program, which brings 10 formerly incarcerated members inside facilities on a weekly basis to serve as peer mentors to 110 incarcerated youth.
   
   To make LA the healthiest place to live for all of its residents, ARC will develop a scalable model to expand its pre-release mentorship program to additional juvenile facilities in LA, including Eastlake and Los Padrinos Juvenile Halls, and additional probation camps. ARC will develop a program curriculum, training materials for staff and mentors, an implementation manual and recommendations and best practices documents to promote program replication. 
   
   ARC will train 20 additional formerly incarcerated members to serve as peer mentors to prepare for expanding the program to two new locations and to enhance the pilot year of the program by providing more individualized support.
   
   Upon release, participants will receive re-entry support through ARC’s Membership Services which include post-release mentoring, case management, education assistance, internships, employment opportunities, support meetings, and housing opportunities.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  To prepare for expanding its pre-release mentorship program in two additional
  juvenile halls, ARC will focus in the pilot year on developing a clear process
  with the Los Angeles County Probation Department for training mentors and ARC
  staff on facility regulations, and on handling potential issues such as mental
  health or medical crises. ARC will work closely with Probation to ensure
  buy-in from staff and administration, and to develop replicable procedures
  around all aspects of the Program, from bringing supplies and program
  materials into facilities to managing potential conflicts and issues. ARC will
  enhance its current Membership Services framework to include more robust case
  management. Reentry services offered through this enhanced model will continue
  to focus on the core components of ARC’s current model, emphasizing
  educational enrollment and success, workforce preparation, employment
  opportunity and the development of positive social networks through mentorship
  and the Network
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  ARC will utilize its partnerships with the Los Angeles County Probation
  Department and the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation
  (CDCR) to support data collection on program participants, as well as to
  gather additional information and statistics around Los Angeles County’s
  incarcerated population and its demographics.
   
   ARC’s Membership Services Director will oversee data collection, in close collaboration with ARC Case Managers and participating peer mentors. Data will be recorded in individual participant files and tracked through ARC’s secure member database. ARC will track the following performance measures: number of youth enrolled in services, number of youth exhibiting change in behavioral violations, substance abuse, gang activity and mental health, recidivism and reentry outcomes and probation violations, second and post-secondary education enrollment, job training and placement and connection to trauma-therapy and/or substance abuse treatment.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  ARC’s pre-release mentorship program is unprecedented in the history of Los
  Angeles County Probation. This program offers incarcerated youth the
  opportunity to learn from and engage with peers who have experienced
  incarceration firsthand. Furthermore, mentors have also received support and
  services through ARC’s Membership Services and can best explain the benefits
  and value of the ARC Support Network. 
   
   ARC partner organization InsideOUT Writers (IOW) currently offers a pre-release creative writing program in the Barry J. Nidorf Juvenile Hall led by volunteer teachers. These writing programs promote positive peer interaction among incarcerated youth and provide a safe space for creativity and growth.
   
   IOW also offers an alumni program that provides case management to identify and address short and long term goals of formerly incarcerated alumni, post-release mentorship opportunities with adult volunteers to foster positively and healthy relationships, and life skills programming, including alumni writing circles. 
   
   ARC sees IOW’s pre-release creative writing classes as complimentary to ARC’s mentorship program, and IOW’s post-release reentry services as directly aligned with ARC’s service offerings and intends to collaborate with IOW to enhance this program.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  To complete enhancements of ARC’s case management model, ARC will collaborate
  with Leaders in Community Alternatives, or an equally distinguished
  community-based services provider.
   
   To enhance recruitment and matching elements of its post-release mentorship services, ARC will partner with the Los Angeles Federation of Labor, the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, Warner Brothers Pictures, Paramount Pictures, Sony Pictures, two local law firms and various other community leaders and organizations to recruit additional mentors who work in careers that are of particular interest to current ARC members.
   
   Finally, to enhance the pre-release mentorship program curriculum and post-release reentry services, and to recruit and refer mentorship program participants and new members, ARC will partner with InsideOUT Writers.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  ARC estimates that developing a scalable model and expanding the pre-release
  mentorship program to an additional two juvenile facilities by 2017 will cost
  approximately $100,000. Funding will be used to provide stipends and travel
  for additional mentors, to hire consultants to oversee expansion and
  evaluation of the pilot program and to develop program materials and guides.
  Funding will also be used to work with a partner organization to enhance ARC’s
  current case management model in order to prepare to serve additional members
  as participants in the pre-release mentorship program are released.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  BUDGET
   Mentors/Facilitators $24,000
   Training/Administration $20,000
   Supplies/Materials $19,000
   Consultants  $10,000
   Transportation  $10,000
   Reentry Services/Case Management $17,000 
   Total  $100,000
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  With this funding, ARC will focus on creating a structured, managed and
  tracked pre-release mentorship program, and developing a model that can be
  taken into additional juvenile facilities over the next three to five years. 
   
   ARC will utilize its membership of 225 successful formerly incarcerated individuals to recruit and train additional peer mentors.
   
   ARC will utilize its close relationship with Chief Probation Officer Jerry Powers and Director of the Division of Juvenile Justice Michael Minor to facilitate access into new facilities with a specific focus on implementing the program at Eastlake and Los Padrinos Juvenile Halls and additional Probation Camps.
   
   Eventually, once the model is developed and has been implemented successfully at Probation facilities, ARC will look to expand the program to three State Division of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) facilities through a partnership with the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.
   
   Because program participants will be served by ARC’s current Support Network upon release, a large focus of planning for expanding the program will concentrate on enhancing ARC's current Membership Services framework through the development of more robust case management services. ARC will enhance programming around supporting cognitive and behavioral issues, as well as providing additional support for trauma and substance abuse.

    answer: "ARC’s Support Network is made up of more than 225 formerly incarcerated members who commit to living crime-free, gang-free, and drug-free; enrolling in school or working; and being of service to the community and the ARC Network.\r\n\r\nThrough this network, members reduce association with negative influences that can lead to criminal behavior and instead build healthy relationships with positive peers. The Coalition serves as a source of motivation and empowerment for members, who witness peers working hard to beat the odds and see the opportunities that result from that effort.\r\n\r\nWhile ARC matches members with adult mentors, it also offers members critical peer support from individuals who have been incarcerated and understand the challenges they are facing. The support they receive from one another is authentic, relevant, and effective. The recidivism rate of ARC members is less than five percent.\r\n\r\nRecognizing this, ARC recently developed a pre-release mentorship program to incarcerated youth in three Los Angeles County juvenile facilities: the Barry J. Nidorf Juvenile Hall, which houses youth charged as adults, and the Scott and Scudder Juvenile Camps for girls. ARC partnered with the Los Angeles County Probation Department to develop this program, which brings 10 formerly incarcerated members inside facilities on a weekly basis to serve as peer mentors to 110 incarcerated youth.\r\n\r\nTo make LA the healthiest place to live for all of its residents, ARC will develop a scalable model to expand its pre-release mentorship program to additional juvenile facilities in LA, including Eastlake and Los Padrinos Juvenile Halls, and additional probation camps. ARC will develop a program curriculum, training materials for staff and mentors, an implementation manual and recommendations and best practices documents to promote program replication. \r\n\r\nARC will train 20 additional formerly incarcerated members to serve as peer mentors to prepare for expanding the program to two new locations and to enhance the pilot year of the program by providing more individualized support.\r\n\r\nUpon release, participants will receive re-entry support through ARC’s Membership Services which include post-release mentoring, case management, education assistance, internships, employment opportunities, support meetings, and housing opportunities."

    answer: >-
      To prepare for expanding its pre-release mentorship program in two
      additional juvenile halls, ARC will focus in the pilot year on developing
      a clear process with the Los Angeles County Probation Department for
      training mentors and ARC staff on facility regulations, and on handling
      potential issues such as mental health or medical crises. ARC will work
      closely with Probation to ensure buy-in from staff and administration, and
      to develop replicable procedures around all aspects of the Program, from
      bringing supplies and program materials into facilities to managing
      potential conflicts and issues. ARC will enhance its current Membership
      Services framework to include more robust case management. Reentry
      services offered through this enhanced model will continue to focus on the
      core components of ARC’s current model, emphasizing educational enrollment
      and success, workforce preparation, employment opportunity and the
      development of positive social networks through mentorship and the Network

    answer: "ARC will utilize its partnerships with the Los Angeles County Probation Department and the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) to support data collection on program participants, as well as to gather additional information and statistics around Los Angeles County’s incarcerated population and its demographics.\r\n\r\nARC’s Membership Services Director will oversee data collection, in close collaboration with ARC Case Managers and participating peer mentors. Data will be recorded in individual participant files and tracked through ARC’s secure member database. ARC will track the following performance measures: number of youth enrolled in services, number of youth exhibiting change in behavioral violations, substance abuse, gang activity and mental health, recidivism and reentry outcomes and probation violations, second and post-secondary education enrollment, job training and placement and connection to trauma-therapy and/or substance abuse treatment.\r\n"

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "ARC’s pre-release mentorship program is unprecedented in the history of Los Angeles County Probation. This program offers incarcerated youth the opportunity to learn from and engage with peers who have experienced incarceration firsthand. Furthermore, mentors have also received support and services through ARC’s Membership Services and can best explain the benefits and value of the ARC Support Network.  \r\n\r\nARC partner organization InsideOUT Writers (IOW) currently offers a pre-release creative writing program in the Barry J. Nidorf Juvenile Hall led by volunteer teachers. These writing programs promote positive peer interaction among incarcerated youth and provide a safe space for creativity and growth.\r\n\r\nIOW also offers an alumni program that provides case management to identify and address short and long term goals of formerly incarcerated alumni, post-release mentorship opportunities with adult volunteers to foster positively and healthy relationships, and life skills programming, including alumni writing circles. \r\n\r\nARC sees IOW’s pre-release creative writing classes as complimentary to ARC’s mentorship program, and IOW’s post-release reentry services as directly aligned with ARC’s service offerings and intends to collaborate with IOW to enhance this program.

      ARC estimates that developing a scalable model and expanding the
      pre-release mentorship program to an additional two juvenile facilities by
      2017 will cost approximately $100,000. Funding will be used to provide
      stipends and travel for additional mentors, to hire consultants to oversee
      expansion and evaluation of the pilot program and to develop program
      materials and guides. Funding will also be used to work with a partner

    answer: "With this funding, ARC will focus on creating a structured, managed and tracked pre-release mentorship program, and developing a model that can be taken into additional juvenile facilities over the next three to five years. \r\n\r\nARC will utilize its membership of 225 successful formerly incarcerated individuals to recruit and train additional peer mentors.\r\n\r\nARC will utilize its close relationship with Chief Probation Officer Jerry Powers and Director of the Division of Juvenile Justice Michael Minor to facilitate access into new facilities with a specific focus on implementing the program at Eastlake and Los Padrinos Juvenile Halls and additional Probation Camps.\r\n\r\nEventually, once the model is developed and has been implemented successfully at Probation facilities, ARC will look to expand the program to three State Division of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) facilities through a partnership with the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.\r\n\r\nBecause program participants will be served by ARC’s current Support Network upon release, a large focus of planning for expanding the program will concentrate on enhancing ARC's current Membership Services framework through the development of more robust case management services. ARC will enhance programming around supporting cognitive and behavioral issues, as well as providing additional support for trauma and substance abuse.\r\n"
