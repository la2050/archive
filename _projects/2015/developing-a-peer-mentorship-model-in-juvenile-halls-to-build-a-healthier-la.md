title: Developing a Peer Mentorship Model in Juvenile Halls to Build a Healthier LA
project_summary: >-
  To make Los Angeles a healthier place to live for some of the city’s most
  vulnerable young people, ARC will expand and enhance its unique mentorship
  program for incarcerated youth by training additional formerly incarcerated
  members to serve as peer mentors, and developing a scalable model that can be
  replicated in additional juvenile facilities in the next three years.

Where will you be working?:
  - 'Barry J. Nidorf Juvenile Hall, Camps Scott and Scudder'
How do you plan to use these resources to make change?:
  - Expand a pilot or a program
How will your proposal improve the following “Live” metrics?:
  - Number of households below the self-sufficiency index
  - Rates of homelessness
  - Rates of mental illness
  - Prevalence of adverse childhood experiences (Dream Metric)
  - Percentage of LA communities that are resilient (Dream Metric)
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "ARC will utilize its partnerships with the Los Angeles County Probation Department and the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) to support data collection on program participants, as well as to gather additional information and statistics around Los Angeles County’s incarcerated population and its demographics.\r\n\r\nARC’s Membership Services Director will oversee data collection, in close collaboration with ARC Case Managers and participating peer mentors. Data will be recorded in individual participant files and tracked through ARC’s secure member database. ARC will track the following performance measures: number of youth enrolled in services, number of youth exhibiting change in behavioral violations, substance abuse, gang activity and mental health, recidivism and reentry outcomes and probation violations, second and post-secondary education enrollment, job training and placement and connection to trauma-therapy and/or substance abuse treatment.\r\n"
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
  - Money (financial capital)
  - Volunteers/staff (human capital)
  - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
  - 'Infrastructure (building/space/vehicles, etc.)'
