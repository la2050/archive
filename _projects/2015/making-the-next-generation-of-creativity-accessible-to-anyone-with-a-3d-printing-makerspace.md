title: >-
  Making the next generation of creativity accessible to anyone with a 3D
  Printing Makerspace!
project_summary: >-
  We'd like to build a 3D Printing makerspace & showroom so people can learn
  about 3D Printing, purchase 3D Printers, & use them as a service for
  customizable goods.  We'd hold live workshops for anyone curious about 3D
  Printing & new technologies, & give people tangible experiences with these
  products.  The makerspace will also allow people to use 3D Printers without
  buying them so they can experience the technology without making a big
  investment, but can buy a printer if from our showrooom.

  'In one sentence, please describe what your organization does': >-
    EEZITEC is an eCommerce platform & ecosystem where people can discover &
    learn about 3D printing, purchase 3D printers, 3D scanners, & 3D printed
    models.

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: "LA will be the best place to create because it is in the intersection of a growing movement between media (Hollywood) & technology (DTLA & Silicon Beach). LA is very unique in the sense that no other city in the world is able to mesh digital content media & technology into a something synergistic & unlike any other before. \r\n\r\nAt its core, content media is the information & experiences directed towards an end-user or audience. At its core, technology means doing something better than ever before. Both content media & technology require creation & LA has all the right qualities in creating synergistic opportunities for its residents. We can personally attest to this as founders of EEZITEC have backgrounds in high-tech & digital media content creation!\r\n\r\nWe would like to create opportunities for artists, designers, & engineers by leveraging 3D printing technologies that can benefit all sides of the equation. Most recently, we completed a project with UCLA & their adaptive sports program where we were tasked to create rapid prototypes of replaceable footplates for the adaptive sports wheelchairs. We did this in the shortest deadline possible of only 3 days. Within 3 days, we measured dimensions, analyzed tolerances,  & created a working prototype that was unveiled at UCLA's Angel City games. This would've been impossible through traditional manufacturing when traditional lead times require much longer times. \r\n\r\nBy enabling people of diverse backgrounds to create, we're giving them the freedom to inspire others to do the same. The technological advancements in 3D printing also continue to improve at an exponential rate. \r\n\r\nWith a makerspace, we'll provide a place for people to create, network, and learn.  A place where they can bring their imaginations to life with 3D Printing.  Any ideas they have for a physical product, they can create a prototype or working model through 3D Printing.  By using 3D Printing, people will be able to create whatever they'd like in a tangible form, making it a perfect technology for creative endeavors.  "

  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    We evaluate our work primarily through the number of inquiries we get & how
    much of that translate into 3D printer sales & consulting projects.  We will
    put a heavy focus on customer service and make sure that we ask our
    customers on how we can improve to make their 3D Printing experience
    enjoyable.  We will have surveys and polls for our customers to answer so we
    can get a better sense on how we could improve.  Also, we will make sure
    that our friends and colleagues in the 3D Printing industry are also giving
    us input on our Makerspace, so we can ensure that we provide the best
    education and products.
