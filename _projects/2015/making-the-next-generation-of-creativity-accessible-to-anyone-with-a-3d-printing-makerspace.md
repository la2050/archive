project_summary: >-
  We'd like to build a 3D Printing makerspace & showroom so people can learn
  about 3D Printing, purchase 3D Printers, & use them as a service for
  customizable goods.  We'd hold live workshops for anyone curious about 3D
  Printing & new technologies, & give people tangible experiences with these
  products.  The makerspace will also allow people to use 3D Printers without
  buying them so they can experience the technology without making a big
  investment, but can buy a printer if from our showrooom.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  LA will be the best place to create because it is in the intersection of a
  growing movement between media (Hollywood) & technology (DTLA & Silicon
  Beach). LA is very unique in the sense that no other city in the world is able
  to mesh digital content media & technology into a something synergistic &
  unlike any other before. 
   
   At its core, content media is the information & experiences directed towards an end-user or audience. At its core, technology means doing something better than ever before. Both content media & technology require creation & LA has all the right qualities in creating synergistic opportunities for its residents. We can personally attest to this as founders of EEZITEC have backgrounds in high-tech & digital media content creation!
   
   We would like to create opportunities for artists, designers, & engineers by leveraging 3D printing technologies that can benefit all sides of the equation. Most recently, we completed a project with UCLA & their adaptive sports program where we were tasked to create rapid prototypes of replaceable footplates for the adaptive sports wheelchairs. We did this in the shortest deadline possible of only 3 days. Within 3 days, we measured dimensions, analyzed tolerances, & created a working prototype that was unveiled at UCLA's Angel City games. This would've been impossible through traditional manufacturing when traditional lead times require much longer times. 
   
   By enabling people of diverse backgrounds to create, we're giving them the freedom to inspire others to do the same. The technological advancements in 3D printing also continue to improve at an exponential rate. 
   
   With a makerspace, we'll provide a place for people to create, network, and learn. A place where they can bring their imaginations to life with 3D Printing. Any ideas they have for a physical product, they can create a prototype or working model through 3D Printing. By using 3D Printing, people will be able to create whatever they'd like in a tangible form, making it a perfect technology for creative endeavors.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  One major challenge that we anticipate is not growing fast enough. We're
  currently bootstrapped & we continue to grow but we can't afford to stagnate
  or slow down anytime soon. Though, being aware of this has always put us on
  our toes & we continue to achieve goals we've set for ourselves.
   
   We're a scrappy bunch of individuals making a profound fundamental impact. Our spirits are indomitable considering we've gone through personal & professional barriers that's shaped us for the better.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We evaluate our work primarily through the number of inquiries we get & how
  much of that translate into 3D printer sales & consulting projects. We will
  put a heavy focus on customer service and make sure that we ask our customers
  on how we can improve to make their 3D Printing experience enjoyable. We will
  have surveys and polls for our customers to answer so we can get a better
  sense on how we could improve. Also, we will make sure that our friends and
  colleagues in the 3D Printing industry are also giving us input on our
  Makerspace, so we can ensure that we provide the best education and products.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There are a few mom & pop shops that's started in 3D printing. We know some of
  the local ones here in LA & they're complementary to our line of business. For
  example, Cokreeate focuses on 3D scanning, while LA3-D works primarily with
  students. EEZITEC is friends with both Cokreeate & LA3-D. There is LA
  Makerspace but it doesn't offer products for sale nor services for people who
  want to customize 3D Prints.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  No, we are not working with any partners outside of Eezitec. The grant money
  will be utilized by the founders & team members of Eezitec in expanding our 3D
  printing efforts across LA so the $100k will solely go to Eezitec's Makerspace
  to make sure it operates at its peak potential.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  We believe a Makerspace would cost $250k, which would go towards rent,
  products, employees, marketing, & additional overhead costs. With that being
  said, we're bootstrapped & gritty & we're not picky with the prize money. As a
  media-eCommerce tech company in LA, we can do a lot with $100,000. It is
  enough to help us achieve our goals 10x. We appreciate what we can get & have
  been firm believers in turning something small into something bigger than
  ourselves. 
   
   For additional costs, we would find ways to increase sales on our eCommerce platform to re-invest into the Makerspace, as well as find ways to increase other revenue streams such as customizable 3D Printing jobs & other 3D Printing related services.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
  The split will go as follows -- 25%: Operational Growth; 37.5%: Company
  Growth; 37.5%: Growth hack Marketing.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  EEZITEC is a media-eCommerce technology company in LA & we will be growing our
  efforts here in our home base. Being a technology company gives us a
  competitive advantage where digital content & products are deployed online
  through EEZITEC.com. As previously mentioned, we're capital efficient, have
  low burn rates, & we're more than 120% confident that the $100,000 grant will
  be utilized effectively in continually making LA the best place to create.
  This time, through 3D printing!

  - name: Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "LA will be the best place to create because it is in the intersection of a growing movement between media (Hollywood) & technology (DTLA & Silicon Beach). LA is very unique in the sense that no other city in the world is able to mesh digital content media & technology into a something synergistic & unlike any other before. \r\n\r\nAt its core, content media is the information & experiences directed towards an end-user or audience. At its core, technology means doing something better than ever before. Both content media & technology require creation & LA has all the right qualities in creating synergistic opportunities for its residents. We can personally attest to this as founders of EEZITEC have backgrounds in high-tech & digital media content creation!\r\n\r\nWe would like to create opportunities for artists, designers, & engineers by leveraging 3D printing technologies that can benefit all sides of the equation. Most recently, we completed a project with UCLA & their adaptive sports program where we were tasked to create rapid prototypes of replaceable footplates for the adaptive sports wheelchairs. We did this in the shortest deadline possible of only 3 days. Within 3 days, we measured dimensions, analyzed tolerances,  & created a working prototype that was unveiled at UCLA's Angel City games. This would've been impossible through traditional manufacturing when traditional lead times require much longer times. \r\n\r\nBy enabling people of diverse backgrounds to create, we're giving them the freedom to inspire others to do the same. The technological advancements in 3D printing also continue to improve at an exponential rate. \r\n\r\nWith a makerspace, we'll provide a place for people to create, network, and learn.  A place where they can bring their imaginations to life with 3D Printing.  Any ideas they have for a physical product, they can create a prototype or working model through 3D Printing.  By using 3D Printing, people will be able to create whatever they'd like in a tangible form, making it a perfect technology for creative endeavors.  "

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "One major challenge that we anticipate is not growing fast enough. We're currently bootstrapped & we continue to grow but we can't afford to stagnate or slow down anytime soon. Though, being aware of this has always put us on our toes & we continue to achieve goals we've set for ourselves.\r\n\r\nWe're a scrappy bunch of individuals making a profound fundamental impact. Our spirits are indomitable considering we've gone through personal & professional barriers that's shaped us for the better. \r\n"
  - name: Please explain how you will evaluate your work.
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      We evaluate our work primarily through the number of inquiries we get &
      how much of that translate into 3D printer sales & consulting projects. 
      We will put a heavy focus on customer service and make sure that we ask
      our customers on how we can improve to make their 3D Printing experience
      enjoyable.  We will have surveys and polls for our customers to answer so
      we can get a better sense on how we could improve.  Also, we will make
      sure that our friends and colleagues in the 3D Printing industry are also
      giving us input on our Makerspace, so we can ensure that we provide the
      best education and products.

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      There are a few mom & pop shops that's started in 3D printing. We know
      some of the local ones here in LA & they're complementary to our line of
      business. For example, Cokreeate focuses on 3D scanning, while LA3-D works
      primarily with students. EEZITEC is friends with both Cokreeate & LA3-D. 
      There is LA Makerspace but it doesn't offer products for sale nor services
      for people who want to customize 3D Prints.

      receive?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      No, we are not working with any partners outside of Eezitec.  The grant
      money will be utilized by the founders & team members of Eezitec in
      expanding our 3D printing efforts across LA so the $100k will solely go to
      Eezitec's Makerspace to make sure it operates at its peak potential.

      How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you
      cover the additional costs?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "We believe a Makerspace would cost $250k, which would go towards rent, products, employees, marketing, & additional overhead costs.  With that being said, we're bootstrapped & gritty & we're not picky with the prize money. As a media-eCommerce tech company in LA, we can do a lot with $100,000. It is enough to help us achieve our goals 10x. We appreciate what we can get & have been firm believers in turning something small into something bigger than ourselves. \r\n\r\nFor additional costs, we would find ways to increase sales on our eCommerce platform to re-invest into the Makerspace, as well as find ways to increase other revenue streams such as customizable 3D Printing jobs & other 3D Printing related services."
