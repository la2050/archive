project_summary: >-
  Free Lots Angeles (FLA), a project of six organizations, works with
  communities to transform vacant lots into health-promoting neighborhood
  resources such as community gardens, parks, and mobility hubs. FLA organizes
  “pop-ups” on vacant lots and helps change City policy to allow for Angelenos
  to access city-owned vacant land in their neighborhoods, especially in places
  where there are not enough places to PLAY.
