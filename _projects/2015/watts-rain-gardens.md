  The Watts Rain Gardens project is a multi-benefit environmental and
  revitalization project that will create 10000 sq ft of pervious surface that
  will not only capture stormwater before it enters the ocean and provide much
  needed tree shade, but will create beautiful green parkways in Watts.

  The Watts Rain Gardens project is a multi-benefit environmental and
  revitalization project that will create 10000 sq ft of pervious surface that
  will not only capture stormwater before it enters the ocean and provide much
  needed tree shade in a low-income neighborhood, but will help create an
  attractive, green parkway in in Watts. Currently the site is comprised of
  blighted parkways on 103rd and Kalima Streets in park-poor Watts. The project
  will feature over 500 native plants, 25 trees and over 10000 sq ft of rain
  garden catchment system along 4 blocks in Watts. 
   
   The Watts Rain Gardens is a multibenefit project that will not create immediate change in the visual character of the neighborhood, but combined with other efforts on 103rd, will be a catalyst for change with a measureable impact on the environment. 
   
   It is difficult, even discouraging, to walk down the street when the parkways are full of debris, old couches, shopping carts and other similar items. These items commonly pepper urban, low income neighborhoods. FLTS does not see it as a matter of self destruction, but of one of long term disinvestment. At some point, when a community feels left on the fringes, a collective consciousness begins to take over. One of neglect and disillusionment. And the built environment has a great impact on one’s psyche. Watts has one of the lowest greenspace ratios in the City of Los Angeles and the County. 
   
   Now imagine, if we took the time to invest in the community, engage community around creating tangible, immediate change in their neighborhoods; discussing collectively the impacts of creating even the slightest bit of greenspace in communities that are parkpoor, tree-less, and without any type of greenspace. And on top of creating additional greenspace, the project also would help the environment by capturing stormwater and proving a much needed tree canopy. The Watts Rain Gardens will do just that. It will create swift, cost effective gardens along parkways that will capture rain water, filter it to the water table below, increasing local water supplies AND simultaneously improve the visual character of the neighborhood, with the community, not for them.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  When we work with low income communities of color, the most difficult piece is
  building trust. 
   Many times people felt their communities were abandoned and left to fend for themselves. Long term disinvestment creates fear and distrust in individuals and it is challenging to build a working relationship with community members at first. 
   How we approach this challenge is to invest time in this community. Time to listen, to interact and build a working relationship. FLTS prides itself in investing the needed time, sometimes one-on-one time with community members to empower them to create change in their neighborhoods. Creating authentic community engagement strategies like these are absolutely necessary to build relationships in the communities we work in. 
   Another way we build trust is to authentically engage community members in the projects we work on. This means community members provide their ideas, their input and most importantly their time to invest in their community.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Socially, we believe that removing blight cause by neglected parkways and
  subsequently revitalizing them through greening will essentially pave the way
  for more change in the neighborhood. Baseline surveys will be conducted with
  residents who live directly adjacent and students who utilizes sidewalks and
  walkways. Surveys will capture attitudes towards the built environment in
  their neighborhood and feelings around current conditions of the blighted
  parkways. 
   From an environmental perspective, FLTS is committed to ensure our projects not only look good, but make an actual impact in the community. From an environmental perspective, we take baseline assessments of existing conditions. For this project we will measure tree shade, gallons of storm water runoff and flora and fauna conditions. Post construction, we will measure sq. ft. of shade canopy created, number of stormwater captured and numbers of new insect and animal species.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There are several organizations who build greenspaces – parks, gardens,
  parkways – in the Los Angeles area. Our proposal is not innovative in that we
  are not the first group to build rain gardens on parkways. However, what makes
  our proposal unique is our unwavering commitment to build these projects WITH
  the community to ensure their investment in the spaces but most importantly
  empower them. In addition, it is our position that investing in the urban
  natural environment - particularly investing in greening projects - in
  disadvantaged communities is as impactful as constructing new buildings, or
  new retail developments. These types of development projects are absolutely
  necessary in revitalizing a community however investing in tree canopies,
  raingardens, parks, and general greenspace projects are as important in order
  to create healthy, sustainable, livable communities for all.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  The project is a collaboration between FLTS, students at Jordan High School in
  Watts, Office of Councilman Joe Buscaino and the City of Los Angeles Bureau of
  Street Services. 
   This collaborative project will be a model project to be implemented by other organizations and residents who wish to do their part to help in water conservation and climate change. Students from Jordan High School will work collaboratively with From Lot to Spot to actively engage the community in design workshops that will demonstrate the the importance of the project and how they can implement it in their own homes or parkways. The Bureau of Street Services will work with FLTS to approve and provide guidance in adhering to their “Residential Parkway Landscape” Program to ensure we are adhering to the most environmental standards. FLTS has completed several rain garden projects in the last two years and this project will be a continuation of our work to create beautiful and sustainable rain gardens in communities that lack greenspace.
   
   David Starr Jordan High School students will receive a stipend between $240-$400 for their work in design workshops and community outreach.
