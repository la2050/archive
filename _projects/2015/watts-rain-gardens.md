  'DESCRIBE IN GREATER DETAIL HOW YOU WILL MAKE LA THE HEALTHIEST PLACE TO LIVE: ': "The Watts Rain Gardens project is a multi-benefit environmental and revitalization project that will create 10000 sq ft of pervious surface that will not only capture stormwater before it enters the ocean and provide much needed tree shade in a low-income neighborhood, but will help create an attractive, green parkway in in Watts.  Currently the site is comprised of blighted parkways on 103rd and Kalima Streets in park-poor Watts.  The project will feature over 500 native plants, 25 trees and over 10000 sq ft of rain garden catchment system along 4 blocks in Watts. \r\n\r\nThe Watts Rain Gardens is a multibenefit project that will not create immediate change in the visual character of the neighborhood, but combined with other efforts on 103rd, will be a catalyst for change with a measureable impact on the environment. \r\n\r\nIt is difficult, even discouraging, to walk down the street when the parkways are full of debris, old couches, shopping carts and other similar items.  These items commonly pepper urban, low income neighborhoods.   FLTS does not see it as a matter of self destruction, but of  one of long term disinvestment. At some point, when a community feels left on the fringes, a collective consciousness begins to take over.  One of neglect and disillusionment. And the built environment has a great impact on one’s psyche.  Watts has one of the lowest greenspace ratios in the City of Los Angeles and the County. \r\n\r\nNow imagine, if we took the time to invest in the community, engage community around creating tangible, immediate change in their neighborhoods; discussing collectively the impacts of creating even the slightest bit of greenspace in communities that are parkpoor, tree-less, and without any type of greenspace.  And on top of creating additional greenspace, the project also would help the environment by capturing stormwater and proving a much needed tree canopy.  The Watts Rain Gardens will do just that.  It will create swift, cost effective gardens along parkways that will capture rain water, filter it to the water table below, increasing local water supplies AND simultaneously improve the visual character of the neighborhood, with the community, not for them. \r\n"

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "When we work with low income communities of color, the most difficult piece is building trust. \r\nMany times people felt their communities were abandoned and left to fend for themselves.  Long term disinvestment creates fear and distrust in individuals and it is challenging to build a working relationship with community members at first.   \r\nHow we approach this challenge is to invest time in this community. Time to listen, to interact and build a working relationship.  FLTS prides itself in investing the needed time, sometimes one-on-one time with community members to empower them to create change in their neighborhoods.  Creating authentic community engagement strategies like these are absolutely necessary to build relationships in the communities we work in.  \r\nAnother way we build trust is to authentically engage community members in the projects we work on.  This means community members provide their ideas, their input and most importantly their time to invest in their community. "
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Socially, we believe that removing blight cause by neglected parkways and subsequently revitalizing them through greening will essentially pave the way for more change in the neighborhood. Baseline surveys will be conducted with residents who live directly adjacent and students who utilizes sidewalks and walkways.  Surveys will capture attitudes towards the built environment in their neighborhood and feelings around current conditions of the blighted parkways. \r\nFrom an environmental perspective, FLTS is committed to ensure our projects not only look good, but make an actual impact in the community.  From an environmental perspective, we take baseline assessments of existing conditions. For this project we will measure tree shade, gallons of storm water runoff and flora and fauna conditions.  Post construction, we will measure sq. ft. of shade canopy created, number of stormwater captured and numbers of new insect and animal species. \r\n"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    There are several organizations who build greenspaces – parks, gardens,
    parkways – in the Los Angeles area.  Our proposal is not innovative in that
    we are not the first group to build rain gardens on parkways.  However, what
    makes our proposal unique is our unwavering commitment to build these
    projects WITH the community to ensure their investment in the spaces but
    most importantly empower them.   In addition, it is our position that
    investing in the urban natural environment - particularly investing in
    greening projects - in disadvantaged communities is as impactful as
    constructing new buildings, or new retail developments.  These types of
    development projects are absolutely necessary in revitalizing a community
    however investing in tree canopies, raingardens, parks, and general
    greenspace projects are as important in order to create healthy,
    sustainable, livable communities for all. 
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "The project is a collaboration between FLTS, students at Jordan High School in Watts, Office of Councilman Joe Buscaino and the City of Los Angeles Bureau of Street Services. \r\nThis collaborative project will be a model project to be implemented by other organizations and residents who wish to do their part to help in water conservation and climate change.  Students from Jordan High School will work collaboratively with From Lot to Spot to actively engage the community in design workshops that will demonstrate the the importance of the project and how they can implement it in their own homes or parkways.  The Bureau of Street Services will work with FLTS to approve and provide guidance in adhering to their “Residential Parkway Landscape” Program to ensure we are adhering to the most environmental standards.   FLTS has completed several rain garden projects in the last two years and this project will be a continuation of our work to create beautiful and sustainable rain gardens in communities that lack greenspace.\r\n\r\nDavid Starr Jordan High School students will receive a stipend between $240-$400 for their work in design workshops and community outreach. \r\n"
