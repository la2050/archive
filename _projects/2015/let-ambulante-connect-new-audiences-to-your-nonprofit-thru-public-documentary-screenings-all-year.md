    The past two editions of our community driven, month long documentary tour
    has proven our experiment of intervening public spaces with documentary
    storytelling is a signficant and unique way to capture the interest of a
    general public who were not actively seeking, or expecting to be interested
    in the vast number of social justice, music culture and creative issues and
    genres documentaries offer.  At all of our outdoor events passersby stumbled
    upon us and sat down and became involved in the subject at hand by asking a
    question, giving us their email.  This kind of informal access point is
    crucial for nonprofits to significantly expand awareness outside their
    already dedicated base.  By including people who are left out of the
    conversation the conversations are elevated and civic participation in the
    subject is exponentially increased.  Our events connect people to share one
    communal experience, people from very different classes, age and
    orientations.  Since we work with over 40 partners our scalability is where
    our full potential can be unleashed.

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    The biggest challenge I've faced when persuading funders and sponsors on
    paper - people who have not been out to experience the impact, is that
    Ambulante is not a film festival, and therefore should not be limited to
    funding because of this erroneous category description.  Ambulante is a
    community enrichment program that is key for economic growth and educational
    opportunities, and creates lifetime intangible impact on people it touches. 
    So while funding is our number one challenge to keep Ambulante thriving, I'm
    proud to say when it comes to the caliber and extraordinary access to
    PROGRAMMING, we stand alone. From the ability to program innovative work
    that debuts in fancy festivals like Cannes and Sundance, to selectinglocal
    short films made by youth right here in LA,which we screen through our
    submissions call, our curatorial voice and programming expertise is by far
    our biggest strength which I therefore feel imperative to share with our
    network of nonprofits who lack programming.
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    Our evaluations will come directly from our community partners.  We solicit
    feedback from audiences and filmmakers and have developed a specific form
    for our partners asking them to candidly rate our communication and
    production skills. It is a comprehensive page long inquiry on "What worked
    well, what did not work and how we may improve for next collaboration". 
    Feedback from audiences, filmmakers and partners is gathered and talked
    about on a scheduled day long staff retreat wrap day so that we can also
    share overheard comments not documented.  The benefit of Ambulante's
    amorphous quality is that the feedback informs our perpetual iteration. 
    Each time we do another screening we have the opportunity of learning from
    hundreds of distinct locations and when we go back to the same communities
    we have the feedback that is specific to that neighborhood.  Our goal would
    be to have an overall positive evaluation of the contribution we bring and
    how we fulfill our deliverables.
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    There is no other organization that I know of that offers this level of
    specialized documentary program in public spaces on wheels so that it can
    travel directly to under served neighborhoods using as deep of a level of
    local community collaboration.  We are unique in every sense.  We do not use
    the typical festivals' imperialistic, or inserted approach of choosing a
    random film and expecting an obvious demographic to be interested let alone
    come to an an anchor venue and pay for admission.  While it may look like a
    pop up festival in that we pop up in different communities every single
    night during the tour, that night is preceded by at least five community
    meetings with local partners to gauge interest, do collective outreach, and
    add other creative elements to the experience.
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    We have a list of nonprofit partners who we have worked with on more than
    two events now, who we would like to continue to work with year round to
    sustain their own activities and fundraising. This grant will allow us to
    offset their costs that they put into the work of promoting our joint
    screenings.  They include From Lot to Spot, East LA Community Corporation,
    SRO Housing Corportation, Casa Libre, and Legacy LA.  It depends on the
    scale of each event but yes we are prepared to absorb a certain amount of
    costs corresponding to their labor in fulfilling our collaborative efforts
    of raising awareness for each event and being onsite at the screenings to
    promote our partnerships.
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    by working withour 40 plus filmmakers and providing each of them access to
    our projection and program
