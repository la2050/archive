project_summary: >-
  Ambulante's annual community tour has been so successful there is a demand
  from our nonprofit partners for our projection and curatorial expertise. With
  this grant two of our most experienced staff members can be compensated during
  off-season to: field partnership requests and organize support at the scale we
  can successfully deliver, including;operation and use of our outdoor
  projection system, leveraging our industry contacts to secure films and
  negotiate lower screening fees, cross promotion.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  The past two editions of our community driven, month long documentary tour has
  proven our experiment of intervening public spaces with documentary
  storytelling is a signficant and unique way to capture the interest of a
  general public who were not actively seeking, or expecting to be interested in
  the vast number of social justice, music culture and creative issues and
  genres documentaries offer. At all of our outdoor events passersby stumbled
  upon us and sat down and became involved in the subject at hand by asking a
  question, giving us their email. This kind of informal access point is crucial
  for nonprofits to significantly expand awareness outside their already
  dedicated base. By including people who are left out of the conversation the
  conversations are elevated and civic participation in the subject is
  exponentially increased. Our events connect people to share one communal
  experience, people from very different classes, age and orientations. Since we
  work with over 40 partners our scalability is where our full potential can be
  unleashed.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  The biggest challenge I've faced when persuading funders and sponsors on paper
  - people who have not been out to experience the impact, is that Ambulante is
  not a film festival, and therefore should not be limited to funding because of
  this erroneous category description. Ambulante is a community enrichment
  program that is key for economic growth and educational opportunities, and
  creates lifetime intangible impact on people it touches. So while funding is
  our number one challenge to keep Ambulante thriving, I'm proud to say when it
  comes to the caliber and extraordinary access to PROGRAMMING, we stand alone.
  From the ability to program innovative work that debuts in fancy festivals
  like Cannes and Sundance, to selectinglocal short films made by youth right
  here in LA,which we screen through our submissions call, our curatorial voice
  and programming expertise is by far our biggest strength which I therefore
  feel imperative to share with our network of nonprofits who lack programming.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Our evaluations will come directly from our community partners. We solicit
  feedback from audiences and filmmakers and have developed a specific form for
  our partners asking them to candidly rate our communication and production
  skills. It is a comprehensive page long inquiry on "What worked well, what did
  not work and how we may improve for next collaboration". Feedback from
  audiences, filmmakers and partners is gathered and talked about on a scheduled
  day long staff retreat wrap day so that we can also share overheard comments
  not documented. The benefit of Ambulante's amorphous quality is that the
  feedback informs our perpetual iteration. Each time we do another screening we
  have the opportunity of learning from hundreds of distinct locations and when
  we go back to the same communities we have the feedback that is specific to
  that neighborhood. Our goal would be to have an overall positive evaluation of
  the contribution we bring and how we fulfill our deliverables.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There is no other organization that I know of that offers this level of
  specialized documentary program in public spaces on wheels so that it can
  travel directly to under served neighborhoods using as deep of a level of
  local community collaboration. We are unique in every sense. We do not use the
  typical festivals' imperialistic, or inserted approach of choosing a random
  film and expecting an obvious demographic to be interested let alone come to
  an an anchor venue and pay for admission. While it may look like a pop up
  festival in that we pop up in different communities every single night during
  the tour, that night is preceded by at least five community meetings with
  local partners to gauge interest, do collective outreach, and add other
  creative elements to the experience.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  We have a list of nonprofit partners who we have worked with on more than two
  events now, who we would like to continue to work with year round to sustain
  their own activities and fundraising. This grant will allow us to offset their
  costs that they put into the work of promoting our joint screenings. They
  include From Lot to Spot, East LA Community Corporation, SRO Housing
  Corportation, Casa Libre, and Legacy LA. It depends on the scale of each event
  but yes we are prepared to absorb a certain amount of costs corresponding to
  their labor in fulfilling our collaborative efforts of raising awareness for
  each event and being onsite at the screenings to promote our partnerships.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 â€“ how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  This grant is earmarked for our production and activities off-season and we
  have budgeted accordingly to ensure at least 10 successful hands on events
  reaching at least 1500 people, plus 10 co-presentations which won't require as
  much of our hands on labor but a significant investment of time in social
  media and contacts.
