Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: >-
  The past two editions of our community driven, month long documentary tour has
  proven our experiment of intervening public spaces with documentary
  storytelling is a signficant and unique way to capture the interest of a
  general public who were not actively seeking, or expecting to be interested in
  the vast number of social justice, music culture and creative issues and
  genres documentaries offer.  At all of our outdoor events passersby stumbled
  upon us and sat down and became involved in the subject at hand by asking a
  question, giving us their email.  This kind of informal access point is
  crucial for nonprofits to significantly expand awareness outside their already
  dedicated base.  By including people who are left out of the conversation the
  conversations are elevated and civic participation in the subject is
  exponentially increased.  Our events connect people to share one communal
  experience, people from very different classes, age and orientations.  Since
  we work with over 40 partners our scalability is where our full potential can
  be unleashed.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Our evaluations will come directly from our community partners.  We solicit
  feedback from audiences and filmmakers and have developed a specific form for
  our partners asking them to candidly rate our communication and production
  skills. It is a comprehensive page long inquiry on "What worked well, what did
  not work and how we may improve for next collaboration".  Feedback from
  audiences, filmmakers and partners is gathered and talked about on a scheduled
  day long staff retreat wrap day so that we can also share overheard comments
  not documented.  The benefit of Ambulante's amorphous quality is that the
  feedback informs our perpetual iteration.  Each time we do another screening
  we have the opportunity of learning from hundreds of distinct locations and
  when we go back to the same communities we have the feedback that is specific
  to that neighborhood.  Our goal would be to have an overall positive
  evaluation of the contribution we bring and how we fulfill our deliverables.
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
  - Money (financial capital)
  - Volunteers/staff (human capital)
