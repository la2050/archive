title: The Edible Apartment
project_summary: >-
  We will oversee the creation of 15 new Edible Apartments around the city of
  Los Angeles.  We will meet with building owners and residents to do a needs
  assessment; determine land and resource availability and, from those findings,
  create a site-specific design for each site location. This network of Edible
  Apartments will provide access to healthy eating and community for those who
  do not live in a single family residence, but still want to take ownership of
  their health and community.
