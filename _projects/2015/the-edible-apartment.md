project_summary: >-
  We will oversee the creation of 15 new Edible Apartments around the city of
  Los Angeles. We will meet with building owners and residents to do a needs
  assessment; determine land and resource availability and, from those findings,
  create a site-specific design for each site location. This network of Edible
  Apartments will provide access to healthy eating and community for those who
  do not live in a single family residence, but still want to take ownership of
  their health and community.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Los Angeles residents who cannot afford our increasing cost of land should not
  be prohibited from taking ownership of their health and diet through growing
  their own food. Edible gardens provide organic produce, a sense of community,
  beauty, increase property values and provide an emotional and psychological
  benefits. Touching the soil has tangible benefits, as does being a part of a
  community and the building of a garden which creates a sense of hope and
  optimism for the future.
   
   While community gardens are a great model, not all LA residents have access to these kinds of properties, either because of proximity or expense. The two most prohibitive reasons why people don't grow their own food are: 1. Access to land. 2. How to do it.
   
   I will make LA the healthiest place to live by installing 15 new "Edible Apartments" around our City of Angeles. I have already piloted and proven the process here at my own apartment building in Mid-City Los Angeles.
   
   The Edible Apartment has transformed the quality of life for residents, created a sense of community, improved the property value and imbued a sense of curiosity and presence for the surrounding community.
   
   How do I know this? Because I have experienced it and documented it first hand. Strangers have knocked on my door to tell me that the garden has inspired them and made them go home and plant some tomatoes. I have met people outside of Los Angeles and told them about my project only to hear them say, "Oh my goodness, that's YOUR project?...I saw it on the way to LACMA when I was visiting LA - it's amazing!!" 
   
   We are holding classes here, community gatherings, informal TEA parties and garden tours. People are inspired, curious and want to learn how to do it for themselves. I've received national and international letters from people asking if I'd travel to help them at their own apartment building to create a similar project, or, at the very least, do videos on how they can do it themselves.
   
   The Edible Apartment was dead grass just four months ago. Now it is a thriving organic oasis right in the middle of apartment buildings and offices. It's the definition of health in a myriad of ways.
   
   As with so many other areas, Los Angeles will be an model to other cities around the world for what is possible in terms of creative and pro-active ways to take charge of our health, environment, community and sense of place, 'even for' those who don't own their own homes.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  One challenge will be maintenance, which will be overcome with the
  implementation of a Green Team.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  I have already evaluated my work with my pilot project here in Mid-City Los
  Angeles. It is thriving and the residents, community and apartment building
  owner are all thrilled with the outcome. They are calling me the Mensch of
  Miracle Mile (that means good person).
   
   I will evaluate future Edible Apartments with photo documentation from start to finish and interviews of residents; property owners and managers; and community members.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  This is unique in that I am interested solely in apartment buildings. Those
  who cannot afford a large parcel of land outside the city or a single-family
  home inside the city can still grown their own food right outside their front
  door. It's absolutely possible. I have already proven it can be done with
  little expense and great success, as shown on my website:
  www.TheEdibleApartment.com
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': N/A
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 â€“ how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  We will not go over the 100,000 budget, and will likely come under budget. How
  do I know this? I have already installed and documented the expense of doing
  one Edible Apartment so I know what is realistic in terms of budget, timing,
  materials, maintenance and re-planting.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  15 new Edible Apartment Gardens at $6,500 each:
   $1,000 - Demolition 
   $2,500 - New Materials (soil, compost, seeds, vegetables, seating area)
   $1,000 - Design fees
   $1,000 - Installation Crew (most work will be done by residents)
   $1,000 - Maintenance and materials for seasonal re-planting for one year
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  I have already proven the success of this project by my pilot model project. I
  will document each new Edible Apartment from start to finish in terms of
  photography, videos, written documentation and feedback from residents,
  building owners, community members and civic leaders.
