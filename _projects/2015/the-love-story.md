  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "One in every 12 young adults, 15- to 24-years-old, have made a suicide plan at some point. One-in-a-half out of every 100 students have actually attempted it and nearly half of those never told anyone. Ninety percent of people who have committed suicide were depressed and withdrawn, and love loss is one of the leading causes of depression and isolation. \r\n\r\nOur organization is committed to suicide prevention by providing connection through the power of storytelling. Our multimedia production company, The Love Story Media, Inc. produces content and publishes quarterly documentary journals. \r\n\r\nThese digital and printed \"documentary journals\" is a collection of journal entries from our writers' interview experiences and the videos covering interviews.  Most importantly, the documentary journals provide blank pages for customers to journal their experiences of letting go so they may discover their own experiences and find the courage to reach out and share.\r\n\r\nThe documentary journal is produced for people who have loved and lost, of people who have loved and lost, by people who have loved and lost. Since college students are one of the highest young adults at risk after a love loss, our digital and print copies will be distributed among colleges bookstores throughout Los Angeles. Thirty-three percent of those proceeds will fund the workshops of our non-profit arm, The Love Story, Inc.\r\n\r\nOur non-profit arm, The Love Story, will provide online and in-person workshops. By emphasizing our values on courage, compassion and contribution, we encourage our students to learn the craft of story, apply it as a personal catharsis, and publish their work to our community as a contribution. \r\n\r\nOnce our Angelinos will start writing in The Love Story journals, we will invite them to engage their experiences with others on our online community by sharing parts of their journal entries and viewing other submissions. They also have the opportunity to workshop their journal entries through our online and in-person workshops that sharpens their writing craft. Ten percent of the profits from our curriculum and workshops will also provide scholarships to those in need. \r\n"

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "One challenge that we will face would be finding instructors who have a dual background in storytelling and in mental health. However, doing preliminary searches, we have already found quite a few who are passionate and qualified to integrate the craft of storytelling with the art of letting go. \r\n\r\nAnother challenge would be to maintain the integrity, privacy and anonymity of those who share their story of love and loss through our website,  keeping it troll- and bully-free. To prevent this, we will create a membership login system where we can track our users and clearly outline our anti-bully and anti-trolling policy. We reserve the right to exclude anybody who violates this policy. We have a no tolerance policy and set high standards to ensure a safe, understanding, and healthy environment for people to process their loss and share themselves without judgement."
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "We will measure the success of our educational impact by the number of online and live workshop registrations. \r\n\r\nWe will measure the success of the social impact from our stories by our online metrics such as mailing lists, unique monthly visitors on Google Analytics, and open, click-through, bounce and retention rates. \r\n\r\nWe will measure the success of social connection based on our digital and printed documentary journal sales, the number of production applications, and the number journal entries submitted by our customers. We will also measure connection through social shares, likes, comments, and followers on Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, and Twitter.  "
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "Our first type of competitors are local writing workshops like Writing Workshops LA and LA Writer's Group who cater to clients interested in publishing novels, short stories and poems. Other similar competitors are colleges that provide courses on similar crafts. The Love Story’s curriculum hybridizes the craft of writing, photography, and filmmaking with the art of letting go. \r\n\r\nAnother type of competitor would be other non-profit organizations like the Trevor Project and college counselors who offer intervention in the areas of depression and suicide. People who go through these programs have the context of being the “patient” or “sufferer” who needs “help” and through our organization, people have the context of being the “student” or “storyteller,” who serves as a contributing voice to our community. \r\n\r\nLast, our other digital competitors are websites like PostSecret and Whisper, who have an online community that consistently posts and consumes their content.  These websites are one liners on postcards or texted memes. We provide the long-form version of letting go. "

    The Love Story is basing its business model after Homeboy Industries. The
    first social enterprise partner is The Love Story, Inc., a multimedia
    company that produces these documentary interviews to be published in
    digital and printed journals.  77% of the grant will be allocated to The
    Love Story Media, Inc. and 33% will be allocated towards The Love Story. 
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': "The first third of the grant will be allocated to building the online program for narrative journal writing and journalism. We will look for outside grants to expand the program to documentary filmmaking and photojournalism. Our goal is to reach 1,000 registrations within the first year. \r\n\r\nThe second third of the grant will be to expand the production by investing in equipment and  hire professional writing and film editors who oversee and guide the students who produce the content. We also want to invest in the producer will will scout for artists willing to get interviewed and matching it with the right student producer. \r\n \r\nThe last third will be used to produce the documentary journal of the stories we’ve already covered. Our goal is to publish 51,000 issues of the documentary journals that we can distribute throughout college bookstores and online. We have partnered up with Bookbaby who will be handling all the distribution and will only produce inventory as they are ordered. This grant will cover the first 2,300 journals. \r\n\r\nTo launch the full program in its entirety it would cost $1,500,000: The Love Story Media, Inc. will need a 1,000,000 initial investment and The Love Story will need a 500k investment. We will be seeking angel investors for the production and documentary journals and we will continue to seek grant funding from private foundations and crowdfund for the educational programs. "
