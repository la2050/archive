  Get On The Bus would like to expand our pilot Camp Suzanne restorative justice
  summer camp program for children and their incarcerated parents taking place
  inside prison walls. This weeklong camp was successfully piloted during the
  summer of 2015 for 12 children and their mothers at the Federal Correctional
  Institution-Dublin Facility. Our goal is to offer the camp to a greater number
  of children and add a much-needed art therapy component.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Get On The Bus CREATES a Los Angeles that fosters inclusivity and diversity
  through opportunities for children of the incarcerated. Through no fault of
  their own, the children we serve, often called “the silent victims of crime,”
  enter into a lifetime of challenges once their parents are incarcerated.
  Through healing opportunities like Camp Suzanne, we help build a better LA by
  caring for the children that need it most, while also contributing to better
  post-release outcomes and lower rates of recidivism for their incarcerated
  parents. 
   
   
   Today, there are more children in the United States who have an incarcerated parent than are diagnosed with autism or juvenile diabetes. Sadly, over 60% of mothers and fathers are sentenced to prisons more than 100 miles away from their families. In California, 60% of all female inmates are from Southern California, but a majority of women inmates are in prisons in Northern California, including the Central California Women's Facility in Chowchilla and Folsom Women’s Facility. Support from our organization goes far beyond transportation, allowing for truly transformative moments of healing between parent and child and impacting systematic change by CREATING a community of support for these children. Because our programs are built on community organizing and volunteers, our work extends an opportunity for all LA residents to help CREATE a brighter future for these “silent victims” and, as a result, a better future for LA through successful family reunification after incarceration. 
   
   A five-year study conducted by the Minnesota Department of Corrections found that offenders who were visited in prison were significantly less likely to return to prison, with a 13% decrease in felony reconvictions and a 25% decrease in re-incarceration on technical violations. The study also found that visits from family members, mentors and friends have the highest impact on lowering the recidivism rate, and that the more visits prisoners received, the lower their chance of re-offending after release. Investing in family relationships may be the best investment our society can make in CREATING a better Los Angeles by directly lowering post release crime rates and reforming the correctional system.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  One of the obstacles involved in hosting a prison camp are the logistics and
  clearance to run a successful camp within the prisons. We continue to overcome
  this challenge through ongoing relationships with the prisons staff. After
  launching the first successful camp at the Federal Correction
  Institution-Dublin Facility this past summer, we are confident that we will
  continue to gain support of our in-prison programming and even expand our
  effort to more prisons. Another challenge is the emotional support that the
  children campers require after such a unification experience with their
  parents due to years of separation. Our plan to increase support for the
  emotional “unpacking” involves adding greater levels of on-site child therapy
  and partnering with local universities to integrate art-therapy.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Get On The Bus will measure the impact of Camp Suzanne quantitatively and
  qualitatively. Our quantitative data will include: Number of Children Served;
  Number of Mothers and Fathers participating; Number of Guardians
  participating; Number of Buses and Bus Teams; and Number of Volunteers.
  Qualitatively, we survey children, guardians, mothers and Local Area Teams to
  assess our strengths and weaknesses so that we can improve the program every
  year with analysis of the surveys.
   
   We recently completed an extensive evaluation report titled "Examining the Impact of Re-Uniting Incarcerated Women with their Children." The 3 year report, funded by The California Endowment, was conducted by the Lloyd Society and led by Project Director Nina Messina, a UCLA evaluation expert working on correctional justice issues. We are utilizing this evaluation to improve the structure of Get On The Bus and will continue to work with the Lloyd Society in evaluating program progress and overall impact.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Get On The Bus and Camp Suzanne are the only programs of their kind, for
  female inmates, in California. Camp Suzanne will be modeled after the highly
  successful Camp Hope prison summer camp, offered by the nonprofit organization
  Hope’s House in Washington DC. The 15 year-old Camp Hope summer program
  operates in 11 federal prisons in Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, the
  District of Colombia and West Virginia and serves over 900 children of
  incarcerated parents. Activist and Hope House founder, Carol Fennelly, has
  shared some of Camp Hope’s program and assessment methods as a starting
  framework for Camp Suzanne.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  GOTB partners with 40 different faith communities, hundreds of volunteers and
  12 prisons throughout the state of California. Our relentless effort to serve
  children of the incarcerated requires ongoing collaboration with other
  restorative justice organizations to strengthen our collective efforts to
  serve all those affected by crime and the criminal justice system. We
  currently collaborate with Healing Hearts, Restoring Hope (HHRH) and look
  forward to expanding our efforts with HHRH and other agencies to share
  organizational experience and identify areas of programmatic intersection that
  could strengthen our individual missions. In expanding Camp Suzanne, GOTB will
  partner with local universities to provide expertise and graduate school
  interns as art therapists. The grant will be fully utilized by CRJW to expand
  Camp Suzanne.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  The cost will be $100,000 to expand the program this summer. Future expansion
  will be covered by community fundraising efforts and additional grant funding.
  As a grassroots organization, Get On The Bus raises 80% of its program funds
  from community events. We also just received a three year for program
  expansion strategizing and strategic planning.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  Camp Suzanne
   Prison Camp Staff: $60,000
   Food, Lodging & Transportation: $20,000
   Art Therapy: $15,000
   Curriculum Materials: $5,000
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: |-
  Success will be measured by achieving the following outcomes: 
   1) Participating children will have the opportunity to strengthen their parental bonds, helping to alleviate their fears and uncertainties around their parent's absence.
   2) Parents receiving a visit are 13-25% less likely to re-offend following re-entry (longitudinal studies in Minnesota and Florida document decreased recidivism rates as a result of even one visit from a family member, mentor or clergy).
   3) Volunteers and the general public will have a greater appreciation for the plight of children with a parent in prison and may be more receptive to restorative justice-based reforms.
   4) Camp Suzanne’s successful pilot implementation will grow to impact the lives of a greater number of children and their incarcerated parents through program expansion.
