title: Creating Brighter Futures through Second Chances
project_summary: >-
  Second Chances Leadership Program builds and develops the self-confidence,
  life & leadership skills of youth through: Education, Financial Literacy,
  Leadership, Social Justice/Advocacy and Health. This is accomplished through
  interactive learning, in-class discussions, presentations/panels, workshops
  and exploratory field-trips (domestically & internationally). Our student
  ambassadors take what they’ve learned and teach our younger youth
  (middle/elementary students) about effective leadership.

  Foundation for Second Chances (FFSC) serves youth in grades K-12 in
  communities plagued with crime, gang violence, extreme poverty, and low
  academic performance. FFSC recruits and receives referrals for youth from
  schools, community based organizations, libraries, DCFS and neighborhoods
  located in Service Planning Area 6. Students from SPA 6 face a number of
  economic, environmental, and social challenges that have a direct impact on
  their wellbeing. Within SPA 6 there is a strong prevalence of foster care,
  gang-related activity, juvenile delinquency, and youth victimization. These
  issues create profound instability in our families and communities, fueling
  high school drop, unemployment, and immense incarceration rates. As a result,
  this continues to make it nearly impossible for our youth to meet their basic
  needs, reinforcing the vicious cycle of poverty and suffering in the way of
  their success. FFSC wants to break that cycle by empowering children labeled
  as “disadvantaged” or “at-risk” to become leaders for themselves, their peers
  and their community. SCLP believes in every student’s capability to succeed
  when given access to all the necessary tools. SCLP consists of 5 modules that
  are 8 weeks in length. The modules expands our youth knowledge base by
  providing significant exposure to real-life work experiences, hands-on
  activities that challenge their decision making process, intense
  cross-cultural and intergenerational volunteer projects both locally and
  abroad. The components of SCLP are: Education, Financial Literacy, Leadership
  (includes Civic and Service Learning), Social Justice/Advocacy and Health. The
  objectives for SCLP: Assist students in developing specific skills needed for
  effective leadership, high graduation school and career paths; Provide
  students with a process for examining pertinent issues facing their
  communities and knowledge of those issues how to make change; Increase
  students understanding of and appreciation for cultural diversity; Provide
  opportunities for students to apply the knowledge and skills learned through
  meaningful community service; Students become ambassadors of their own
  learning so they can better educate and teach their peers and community (train
  the trainer). This allows them to personally develop through SCLP and have
  access to tools and resources that not only helps students to apply to
  college, but also prepares them to succeed in life. Upon completion students
  receive a certificate and have a graduation.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "We use quantitative & qualitative evaluation strategies to evaluate our youth’s work in addition to conducting intake surveys & doing case management on each student that enters our program. Each youth receives SMART(specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, timely) goals to make sure that they are meeting their benchmarks for staying on task, being held accountable for their duties & are able to articulate what they are learning. Through our collaborative & strategic partnerships we are able to engage community leaders, stakeholders and clients to help us identify our success and any gaps. In order to evaluate SCLP we survey our students as well as their parents and teachers. A series of in depth surveys allow for us to evaluate the progress of our students in a holistic manner. Our Evaluation Strategies include several tools:\r\nLeadership Program Student Survey; Teacher/Staff Referral Form\r\nGeneral School Functioning Assessments; Academic Achievement Assessments;Community Surveys"
