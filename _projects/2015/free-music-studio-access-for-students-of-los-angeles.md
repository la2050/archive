  ESR wishes to play a part of Boyle Heights' musical history, and by opening
  it's doors for an after school program, we will continue the flow of great
  musicianship coming out of the neighborhood. This would be a first of it's
  kind opportunity for the youth of LA to have sound-proofed studios to practice
  in at full volume, state of the art music equipment at their disposal, and a
  safe creative environment in which to practice music and let their ideas flow.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  We live in the entertainment capitol, with the music industry based in Los
  Angeles. With gentrification happening at an alarming rate in DTLA, there are
  closures of music rehearsal studios and rental rooms going up in price. I
  decided to build a rehearsal space in Boyle Heights where there was none, and
  plan to open our doors for students to use the facility for free with grant
  money. 
   
   Being a musician has allowed me to travel the world, record records, sell music to film and TV, and has given me a purpose to share my vision and ideas. I want to be an example to the young people here in LA to show them that anything is possible with practice and discipline. And by giving them a space to do this in a neighborhood like Boyle Heights will surely foster some incredible ideas. 
   Findings indicate that music study uniquely enhances higher brain functions required for reading, mathematics, chess, science, and engineering. If I can be a small but positive change to give back to my community, this would be it. I know from experience that having a creative outlet is so important in keeping kids off the streets and out of trouble. Most kids just need a chance, some guidance and discipline. Music can give them that and so much more.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  The only barrier I see for an after school program is that we would have to
  have a licensed adult teacher on site during program hours. One of our
  investors is a teacher and musician himself and could possibly fill this roll.
  We also plan to have security during business hours.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Adventures in the arts and music expand who we are as human beings. It is part
  of our spiritual advancement in the ways we communicate - through melody,
  rhythms and lyrics- breaking down barriers, and allowing us to experience true
  happiness. 
   Research also shows that music can relieve stress, lower blood pressure, and help relieve pain. 
   
   We will evaluate our work through the musical advancement of the youth that utilize this program. With the youth bands that form at ESR, we would showcase a live performance at an all ages venue in Boyle Heights so they would be able to have the experience of playing live in front of an audience.
   
   More musicians make a better environment. Art makes a better city and ultimately a better world.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  School of Rock is a nation wide organization with a similar idea but offers
  lessons. What is unique about Eastside Rehearsal is that we offer youth a
  space to create for those who are already interested and practicing music in a
  lower income neighborhood. Many of the kids in Boyle Heights don't have the
  money or resources to pursue musical studies. With grant money, we would open
  our studios for free to those interested in furthering their musical
  creativity. Most of the hourly rental spaces in LA are located in higher
  income areas like Atwater Village, Echo Park, and Eagle Rock. ESR will be run
  by bilingual musicians catering to many of the students here that have English
  as their second language.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  The partners at Eastside Rehearsal are Meg and Tony Aguilar, and Eddie Rivas.
  The $100,000 would go directly to the business in buying equipment and
  allowing our doors to be open to students after school for 2 hours everyday
  for 2 school years, as well as the teacher/overseer salary.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 â€“ how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  The Aguilars have invested $27,000 of their own money to secure the warehouse
  and start the build of Eastside Rehearsal. They've taken out a loan of another
  $20,000 on their house, and had their friend Eddie Rivas contribute another
  $20,000 to finish the project. We are in the midst of building out the
  warehouse space now and hope to be open in October. The $100,000 grant would
  help secure the equipment needed and ensure that the business would be up and
  running with out going further in to debt. The money spent so far went in to
  renting the property, contractor and building permits, electrical, air
  conditioning and sound proofing the studio spaces.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  5 drumsets=$2,500
   10 additional drum cymbals=$2,500 
   5 extra kick pedals=$500
   5 guitar amplifiers=$4,700
   4 guitar cabinets=$4,000
   5 bass amplifiers=$3,700
   4 bass cabinets=$1,600
   4 PA systems=$3,700
   2 back up amplifiers=$2,000
   10 microphones= $1,000 
   20 xlr cables=$600
   10 speaker stands=$600
   equipment total=$27,400
   
   room rental is $15/hr for 2 hours/day for the students, times 5 rooms = 
   $150/day times 180 days for 2 school years = $27,000 x2 years= $54,000
   
   salary for teacher to oversee the students = $10,800 x2 years=$21,600
   
   equipment $27,400
   5 rooms for students for 2 school years $54,000
   teacher salary $21,600
   Total= $103,000
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  The success of our proposal would look like our practice rooms filled with
  students every day after school, practicing their instruments, forming bands,
  participating in live performances at our studio and around Los Angeles. We
  will surely form relationships with these kids and hope to inspire them with a
  supportive environment to create and eventually take their ideas around the
  world like we have.
