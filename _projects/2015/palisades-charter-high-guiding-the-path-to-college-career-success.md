  The Career Services Center will provide students with the tools needed for
  success in college and the workforce by establishing a model career services

  classroom, and brings community and business resources onto campus.  Through
  the use of advanced technology, and business community and local government
  resources, the program will allow students from the City of LA to compete with
  students from all over the world.

Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "Palisades Charter High School (PCHS) represents a microcosm of Los Angeles, serving students from over 100 zip codes across the city. Los Angeles is one of the most economically vibrant areas of the country, and students have the potential to work in a wide range of fields. Despite this, students are unprepared for planning a  career path.  Colleges lament that students do not have defined goals, and employers report that young people lack skills.  PCHS will expand opportunities by launching a robust Career Services Program that exploits the potential opportunities in our thriving City for our student population.  \r\nExisting non-school based programs are fragmented and are challenged in trying to engage students.  With busy schedules and transportation challenges, students need access to information on campus. Incorporating career planning into the curriculum is the best way to engage youth.   We believe this program will be impact the larger community by connecting students to the workforce across the City.  \r\nWe will make LA the best place to learn by taking the following actions:   \r\n1)   Spring Workforce Fair – Event that brings local businesses and other organizations on campus to offer employment and internships, as well as educational workshops on workforce readiness skills.   \r\n2)    Internship, Job, and Mentorship Placement – Placements through the Workforce Fair, and a web-based portal of other job, internship or mentor opportunities.  \r\n 3)  Coordination with Academic Curriculum - Integration into the classroom curriculum, starting in the 9th grade through completion of an Interest Profiler in freshman English classes, and a writing component on career choices. Using the interest profiler, academic and college counselors will share guidance on educational paths to careers.\r\n 4)  Career Exploration and Counseling - Opportunities to learn about careers through presentations by professionals in various fields. Help with employment coaching, resume writing, interview practice, and job search skills.  \r\n5) Student Outreach - Use of student groups such as Village Nation, Black Student Union, Fuerza Unida and Latino Student Union to ensure reaching a wide range of students. \r\nWe are inspired to level the playing field for all students across Los Angeles. Our hope is that, through establishing an innovative Career Services Center at one of LA’s largest public high schools, this model  can be replicated for all high school students across the city."
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "The PCHS Career Center will be evaluated in year one through measurements of use and access. Indicators will include:\r\n \r\n# Freshmen who complete career profiles by May (2015-16 academic year);\r\n# Freshmen who complete career profiles by December (2016-17 academic year);\r\nAttendance at the Workforce Fair and job skills sessions;\r\n# Students placed into internships and jobs;\r\nAttendance at career panels;\r\nReports from Pali Career & College software programs\r\n \r\nTo ensure widespread access, we will also track the number of unique students who have accessed any single service.\r\n \r\nWe intend for this program to be self-sustained after the initiation grant. We will seek an academic partner to conduct a longitudinal study to provide more robust outcome information on student career achievement. We believe that the students will be gaining skills that will serve them long after they graduate from high school. "
