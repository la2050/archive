  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "Palisades Charter High School (PCHS) represents a microcosm of Los Angeles, serving students from over 100 zip codes across the city. Los Angeles is one of the most economically vibrant areas of the country, and students have the potential to work in a wide range of fields. Despite this, students are unprepared for planning a  career path.  Colleges lament that students do not have defined goals, and employers report that young people lack skills.  PCHS will expand opportunities by launching a robust Career Services Program that exploits the potential opportunities in our thriving City for our student population.  \r\nExisting non-school based programs are fragmented and are challenged in trying to engage students.  With busy schedules and transportation challenges, students need access to information on campus. Incorporating career planning into the curriculum is the best way to engage youth.   We believe this program will be impact the larger community by connecting students to the workforce across the City.  \r\nWe will make LA the best place to learn by taking the following actions:   \r\n1)   Spring Workforce Fair – Event that brings local businesses and other organizations on campus to offer employment and internships, as well as educational workshops on workforce readiness skills.   \r\n2)    Internship, Job, and Mentorship Placement – Placements through the Workforce Fair, and a web-based portal of other job, internship or mentor opportunities.  \r\n 3)  Coordination with Academic Curriculum - Integration into the classroom curriculum, starting in the 9th grade through completion of an Interest Profiler in freshman English classes, and a writing component on career choices. Using the interest profiler, academic and college counselors will share guidance on educational paths to careers.\r\n 4)  Career Exploration and Counseling - Opportunities to learn about careers through presentations by professionals in various fields. Help with employment coaching, resume writing, interview practice, and job search skills.  \r\n5) Student Outreach - Use of student groups such as Village Nation, Black Student Union, Fuerza Unida and Latino Student Union to ensure reaching a wide range of students. \r\nWe are inspired to level the playing field for all students across Los Angeles. Our hope is that, through establishing an innovative Career Services Center at one of LA’s largest public high schools, this model  can be replicated for all high school students across the city."

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "The challenge is to educate parents that it is important to begin exposure to careers in high school to support future decisions regarding college or other higher education.  \r\nA career services program will lead to broader exposure to career paths which will impact future college choices.  This active communication design plan implements the following:\r\n•\tWorkshop to explain necessity of module completion to  successful personal future choices\r\n•\tImpact report from College and Academic Counselors and Faculty\r\n•\tCareer Counseling Innovative Student-Centric Center - Place for technology use and mock interview sessions\r\n•\tCommunications Plan to Publish our Successes (via Social Media & Direct outreach to stakeholders groups\r\n\r\nA second, related challenge is to enlist the wide support of  the broader community and making it easily accessible to students.  This is addressed with dedicated staff and development of online resources.\r\n"
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "The PCHS Career Center will be evaluated in year one through measurements of use and access. Indicators will include:\r\n \r\n# Freshmen who complete career profiles by May (2015-16 academic year);\r\n# Freshmen who complete career profiles by December (2016-17 academic year);\r\nAttendance at the Workforce Fair and job skills sessions;\r\n# Students placed into internships and jobs;\r\nAttendance at career panels;\r\nReports from Pali Career & College software programs\r\n \r\nTo ensure widespread access, we will also track the number of unique students who have accessed any single service.\r\n \r\nWe intend for this program to be self-sustained after the initiation grant. We will seek an academic partner to conduct a longitudinal study to provide more robust outcome information on student career achievement. We believe that the students will be gaining skills that will serve them long after they graduate from high school. "
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "Our research complement organizations are public high schools with similarly diverse and large student populations.  We did not find any comprehensive career services program.  Instead, they appear to be non-functioning, or a small component of a more robust college program.  \r\n      \r\nEl Camino High School - links to college and career center information with many “click through” links directly to Pierce College and Valley College.

Reference to Santa Monica College’s website \r\nand Career Services Central.  \r\nUniversity High School - No established program; piloting alumni support for career services.  \r\nVenice High School - partners with local businesses; uses “First Break - LAUSD” list for job opportunities.  Limited career services program.  \r\n        \r\nThe PCHS unique modular program would be solely devoted to career services through educational workshops, workforce fairs, a web-based portal of vast and meaningful employment and internship listings established specifically for high school students, and a physical site that is innovative in design to welcome students and community partners.  In addition to similar High School Career Centers, student job and internship placement, and networking opportunities will have high priority in the career services center and will be made possible through extensive networking with local organizations and businesses by our Career Consultant.  Students will gain an understanding of where and how their job or internship fits within the career clusters used by the CA department of education, community colleges, universities, and labor agencies.  We hope to build a model program that can be replicated by other high schools across LA for further development.  \r\n"
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "    \r\nPCHS will build on our existing relationships with local businesses, local community organizations and civic leadership to develop our project.  We enjoy a highly productive and engaging relationship with all of these groups and have received widespread support for the project already.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, PCHS will be working directly with local business leaders for job placement during the school year and holiday breaks.  These include businesses in the following key industries:  retail, healthcare, entertainment, technology and the sciences.  \r\n\r\nWe will be working with the following community organizations on our project:  Pacific Palisades Branch of the LA County Library, Pacific Palisades Womens’ Club; the Optimist Club; and the American Legion.  All of these organizations are long-time supporters of PCHS and will be able to offer their resources to expand the program.  \r\n\r\nOur Alumni Network, local Chamber of Commerce, Palisades Charter Complex Leadership, and the YMCA (Pacific Palisades Branch) will be working in collaboration with PCHS to socialize the program rapidly so that it can spread across the entire city.  The Project does not provide for the sharing of any funds directly with any of these  organizations; however, the purpose of the Project is wholly consistent with the mission of our collaborators, which will ensure a successful engagement. \r\n"
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': "$100,000\r\n\r\nEstablish a web-based portal for employment, internship, and networking opportunities. Employers, local organizations, and local government agencies will post opportunities to website tailored for PCHS.  Students can search opportunities, and post resumes & portfolios for employers.  Students may schedule interviews for jobs, internships, and develop a network of career professionals.  In addition, the existing software program used for college counseling will be upgraded to include a curriculum course component to tie in PCHS’ curriculum to the student’s college & career choice.\r\n\r\nPurchase five Macbooks, a laser printer, and related supplies to provide students with access to the web-based portal, and other electronic research tools in the Career Services Center. Students can conduct research for jobs and work on resumes and cover letters in a welcoming center that fosters learning.    \r\n\r\nEngage a Career/Workforce Consultant (part-time) with responsibility for all of the following: networking and establishing viable sites for employment, internships, and mentoring across the City; providing administrative support for work with community organizations; and communicating with the Career Services Center Director about status of program and feedback on necessary improvements.  25 hours/week – 12pm-5pm/daily for 10 months.  \r\n\r\nRenovate the Career Services Center to make it an innovative space for students to expand their vision beyond the classroom studies, and a comfortable space for corporate partners.  Purchase durable and modern furniture; install whiteboard walls to enable brainstorm sessions.\r\n\r\nEngage a Professional Workforce Consultant to launch the program through a workforce fair on campus which brings local government, community service agencies, local businesses and corporate employers on campus.  Develop a communication plan for workforce fair to ensure \r\nmaximum student attendance and engagement.  Corporate contacts from the workforce fair will be entered into web-based portal for ongoing use.

  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "At PCHS, the proposed Career Services Program will meet the demands of the current and future student body at the high school.  We believe increasing demand is a mark of success and will be met with the infrastructure built into the educational curriculum and implementation of the proposed technology programs.\r\n\r\nOn a broader scale, it is the goal that the PCHS Career Service Center becomes the role model for other Los Angeles based high schools and local industries.  We feel that this collaborative approach, presented in a manner which is age appropriate to high school students, can be easily replicated and beneficial to all involved stakeholders.  The incorporation of career planning skills into high school curriculum is something that can be shared with the greater Los Angeles community to the benefit of all Los Angeles public high school students.  \r\n\r\nThe project success will be scaled across the City of Los Angeles at other high schools through sharing our best practices for software applications, communications with students, parents and employers, and educational tools to prepare students for exposure to the workforce.  At PCHS we are committed to a high quality public education experience and the vision of the high school campus as a center for learning inside and outside the classroom.  As such, we will be sharing our learned expertise, to replicate the program at other public high schools. We believe that this program can be established economically elsewhere.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to have the students, parents and counselors work as a team to guide our students towards becoming college and career ready by utilizing the tools provided to them with the goal of embracing their own future with knowledge and confidence.\r\n    "

We feel that this collaborative approach, presented in a manner which is age appropriate to high school students, can be easily replicated and beneficial to all involved stakeholders. The incorporation of career planning skills into high school curriculum is something that can be shared with the greater Los Angeles community to the benefit of all Los Angeles public high school students. 
   
   The project success will be scaled across the City of Los Angeles at other high schools through sharing our best practices for software applications, communications with students, parents and employers, and educational tools to prepare students for exposure to the workforce. At PCHS we are committed to a high quality public education experience and the vision of the high school campus as a center for learning inside and outside the classroom. As such, we will be sharing our learned expertise, to replicate the program at other public high schools. We believe that this program can be established economically elsewhere.
   
   Our goal is to have the students, parents and counselors work as a team to guide our students towards becoming college and career ready by utilizing the tools provided to them with the goal of embracing their own future with knowledge and confidence.
