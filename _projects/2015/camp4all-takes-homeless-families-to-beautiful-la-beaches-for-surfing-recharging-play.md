  The CLF's Camp4All Program takes homeless families out of their shelter
  environment in LA to the natural beauty of LA's beaches-teaching them to surf,
  allowing them to rest and recharge- and hang out with their families in a
  beautiful SoCal environment. Camp4All shows that LA loves to play in the most
  innovative, fun way possible.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  The Children’s Lifesaving Foundation’s Camp4All Summer Enrichment Program for
  homeless and at-risk youth will provide over 550 homeless, shelter-bound and
  at-risk children, teens and their parents from the L.A. county the unique
  experience of retreating to the beautiful beaches of Southern California-and
  learning to surf! Camp4All addresses the great need of homeless and at-risk
  children and teens and families living in LA-county-based shelters and
  transitional housing facilities to truly enjoy the feeling of being a child
  again- spending summer days at beautiful Zuma Beach in Malibu, CA, and
  experiencing a sense of relief, genuine emotional refreshment and feeling of
  renewed possibility- a truly invigorating and renewed sense of hope for the
  future. Families are also invited to attend- allowing for a truly incredible
  bonding experience, a “staycation” right in their own backyards! PLAY, in
  essence, is utilized as a means of connecting with their very best selves.
  This program was our very first program, and holds very special significance
  to us, as our three other program platforms grew out of the needs our original
  at-risk and homeless campers and initial homeless families through Camp4All.
  We have amazing Surf instructors who can actually get participants to stand up
  on the surfboard by the end of the day, have a great picnic lunch on the
  beach, and thoroughly enjoy the playground that is their own backyard in LA.
  In addition, we will have two overnight camps for the families and teens in
  our Vita Network- (which are families we have moved from homeless shelters
  and/or helped transform their lives through financial aid and domestic
  assistance.) Camp4All helps make LA the best place to play by showing its most
  at-risk citizens that ALL of LA is available to them- and can help change
  their lives in the process.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Challenges include, mainly, being able to accommodate a growing waiting list
  of future participants, This grant will also us to serve 500 more additional
  “campers” next year.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  In the pas, we have evaluated this program both in-house and through the
  different participating agencies themselves. Metrics will include: Increase in
  self confidence, overcoming fear of the ocean/water, likelihood of returning
  with their family for a day outing and probability of picking up surfing again
  after the participants leave Camp4All.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  As far as we know, the Children’s Lifesaving Foundation is one of the only
  NPO’s offering a recreational camp program to this very specific homeless
  population, and more specifically, focuses on the idea of refreshment and
  enrichment through play- through learning to surf. There are other great
  agencies that offer camps to at-risk youth, but CLF is targeting homeless
  families living as a unit on shelters, by far the most at-risk population in
  LA county, and one of the most under-served.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  The agencies we offer Camp4All to are never charged a dime to participate, and
  we have been offering this highly reputable program since the summer of 1993.
  The Children’s Lifesaving Foundation offers Camp4All to shelters and agencies
  such as: Homeboy Industries, LA Mission, Union Rescue Mission, Covenant House,
  My Friend’s Place, Para Los Ninos, LA’s BEST, Urban Compass, and many
  others-all located in LA county.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  Our current budget is $245,000, and we have funders who will help cover and
  match this grant from LA2050 this season.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  Nutrition/Meals: $22,500
   Parking/Transportation/Bus & Van Rentals
    $26,000
   Counselor Fees: $22,000
   Surfing Equipment: $ 8,000 
   Insurance/Facility Rentals/
   Beach Reservation Fees $ 7,500
   Overnight Camp Expenses: $14,000
   TOTAL: $100,000
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  The CLF plans to scale this Camp4All Program, both by leveraging our social
  media through this LA2050 grant, as well as use these new funds as an
  opportunity to serve 500 more ADDITIONAL homeless participants. It would also
  be amazing to replicate it in Ventura County as well, eventually, and to also
  add more camps during the Spring season.
