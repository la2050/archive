Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to play.: >-
  The Children’s Lifesaving Foundation’s Camp4All Summer Enrichment Program for
  homeless and at-risk youth will provide over 550 homeless, shelter-bound and
  at-risk children, teens and their parents from the L.A. county the unique
  experience of retreating to the beautiful beaches of Southern California-and
  learning to surf!  Camp4All addresses the great need of homeless and at-risk
  children and teens and families living in LA-county-based shelters and
  transitional housing facilities to truly enjoy the feeling of being a child
  again- spending summer days at beautiful Zuma Beach in Malibu, CA, and
  experiencing a sense of relief, genuine emotional refreshment and feeling of
  renewed possibility- a truly invigorating and renewed sense of hope for the
  future. Families are also invited to attend- allowing for a truly incredible
  bonding experience, a “staycation” right in their own backyards!  PLAY, in
  essence, is utilized as a means of connecting with their very best selves.
  This program was our very first program, and holds very special significance
  to us, as our three other program platforms grew out of the needs our original
  at-risk and homeless campers and initial homeless families through Camp4All.
  We have amazing Surf instructors who can actually get participants to stand up
  on the surfboard by the end of the day, have a great picnic lunch on the
  beach, and thoroughly enjoy the playground that is their own backyard in LA.
  In addition, we will have two overnight camps for the families and teens in
  our Vita Network- (which are families we have moved from homeless shelters
  and/or helped transform their lives through financial aid and domestic
  assistance.) Camp4All helps make LA the best place to play by showing its most
  at-risk citizens that ALL of LA is available to them- and can help change
  their lives in the process. 
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  In the pas, we have evaluated this program both in-house and through the
  different participating agencies themselves.  Metrics will include: Increase
  in self confidence, overcoming fear of the ocean/water, likelihood of
  returning with their family for a day outing and probability of picking up
  surfing again after the participants leave Camp4All. 
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
  - Money (financial capital)
  - Volunteers/staff (human capital)
  - Community outreach
  - Network/relationship support
