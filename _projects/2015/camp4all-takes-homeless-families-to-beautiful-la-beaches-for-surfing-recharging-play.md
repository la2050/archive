    The Children’s Lifesaving Foundation’s Camp4All Summer Enrichment Program
    for homeless and at-risk youth will provide over 550 homeless, shelter-bound
    and at-risk children, teens and their parents from the L.A. county the
    unique experience of retreating to the beautiful beaches of Southern
    California-and learning to surf!  Camp4All addresses the great need of
    homeless and at-risk children and teens and families living in
    LA-county-based shelters and transitional housing facilities to truly enjoy
    the feeling of being a child again- spending summer days at beautiful Zuma
    Beach in Malibu, CA, and experiencing a sense of relief, genuine emotional
    refreshment and feeling of renewed possibility- a truly invigorating and
    renewed sense of hope for the future. Families are also invited to attend-
    allowing for a truly incredible bonding experience, a “staycation” right in
    their own backyards!  PLAY, in essence, is utilized as a means of connecting
    with their very best selves. This program was our very first program, and
    holds very special significance to us, as our three other program platforms
    grew out of the needs our original at-risk and homeless campers and initial
    homeless families through Camp4All. We have amazing Surf instructors who can
    actually get participants to stand up on the surfboard by the end of the
    day, have a great picnic lunch on the beach, and thoroughly enjoy the
    playground that is their own backyard in LA. In addition, we will have two
    overnight camps for the families and teens in our Vita Network- (which are
    families we have moved from homeless shelters and/or helped transform their
    lives through financial aid and domestic assistance.) Camp4All helps make LA
    the best place to play by showing its most at-risk citizens that ALL of LA
    is available to them- and can help change their lives in the process.

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    Challenges include, mainly, being able to accommodate a growing waiting list
    of future participants, This grant will also us to serve 500 more additional
    “campers” next year.
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    In the pas, we have evaluated this program both in-house and through the
    different participating agencies themselves.  Metrics will include: Increase
    in self confidence, overcoming fear of the ocean/water, likelihood of
    returning with their family for a day outing and probability of picking up
    surfing again after the participants leave Camp4All. 
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    As far as we know, the Children’s Lifesaving Foundation is one of the only
    NPO’s offering a recreational camp program to this very specific homeless
    population, and more specifically, focuses on the idea of refreshment and
    enrichment through play- through learning to surf. There are other great
    agencies that offer camps to at-risk youth, but CLF is targeting homeless
    families living as a unit on shelters, by far the most at-risk population in
    LA county, and one of the most under-served. 
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    The agencies we offer Camp4All to are never charged a dime to participate, 
    and we have been offering this highly reputable program since the summer of
    1993. The Children’s Lifesaving Foundation offers Camp4All to shelters and
    agencies such as: Homeboy Industries, LA Mission, Union Rescue Mission, 
    Covenant House, My Friend’s Place, Para Los Ninos, LA’s BEST, Urban Compass,
    and  many others-all located in LA county. 
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    Our current budget is $245,000, and we have funders who will help cover and
    match this grant from LA2050 this season. 
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Nutrition/Meals:              $22,500\r\nParking/Transportation/Bus & Van Rentals\r\n                                               $26,000\r\nCounselor Fees:                   $22,000\r\nSurfing Equipment:              $ 8,000 \r\nInsurance/Facility Rentals/\r\nBeach Reservation Fees      $ 7,500\r\nOvernight Camp Expenses: $14,000\r\nTOTAL:                                   $100,000\r\n"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "The CLF plans to scale this Camp4All Program, both by leveraging our social media through this LA2050 grant, as well as use these new funds as an opportunity to serve 500 more ADDITIONAL homeless participants. It would also be amazing to replicate it in Ventura County as well, eventually, and to also add more camps during the Spring season.\r\n"
