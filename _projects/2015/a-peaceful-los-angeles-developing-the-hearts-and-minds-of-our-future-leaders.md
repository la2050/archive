  In order to fulfill our mission, Citizens of the World seeks to construct a
  rich, comprehensive social-emotional learning (SEL) program, as we believe
  self-regulation and social connection are essential components of every
  child’s development. Including SEL in everyday instruction allows for deeper,
  longer-term learning to occur. Ultimately, we envision that students who have
  built strong social-emotional competencies will become better citizens of our
  complex, diverse, and ever-changing world.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  As one of the largest, most diverse cities in the world, Los Angeles has
  endured significant inter-group conflict and civil unrest. Furthermore, our
  city's schools have struggled to prepare students for academic and societal
  success. CWC LA intends to make Los Angeles a better place to learn, connect,
  and live by cultivating social-emotional health in our students and by
  training our next generation of citizens to work together productively. 
   
   CWC believes social-emotional learning to be as integral to an excellent education as traditional academic subjects and, moreover, views it as necessary for the world in which we live. SEL involves both learning about oneself, in the form of self-awareness and self-management, and others, in the form of social awareness, empathy, compassion and collaboration. 
   
   CWC's model focuses on two broad aspects of social-emotional learning: 1) comprehension and 2) execution. Social-emotional comprehension pertains to the mental processes involved in encoding, interpreting, and reasoning about social and emotional information, and in controlling one’s thoughts and emotions. Examples include emotion recognition, perspective taking, social problem solving, and self-control. Social-emotional execution involves the behaviors expressed in social interactions that are designed to achieve social goals. These pro-social behaviors include the formation of friendships and social connections, and the reduction/resolution of social conflicts. 
   
   Social-emotional learning is highly consequential with positive impacts seen across behavioral, academic, mental health and social domains. According to a meta-analysis of school-based SEL programs conducted by Durlak, et all (2011), SEL programs “significantly improve students’ skills, attitudes, and behaviors”. In fact, strong SEL leads to better academic outcomes, relationships, participation in school, mental health and behavioral outcomes, and social acceptance. 
   
   Already, CWC LA's schools have experienced these benefits firsthand. As we expand our region's SEL program across our three diverse schools, we anticipate we will help move the needle on key education metrics for Los Angeles including: test scores, school safety, high school graduation, truancy, suspensions/expulsions, and ultimately college completion rates. We will also impact our students beyond school, with positive effects in resilience, mental health, social connection, safety and embracing diversity.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  While some skepticism remains among the general public about the value of
  "soft skills" such as mindfulness and emotional regulation, there is mounting
  empirical and anecdotal evidence that SEL works—across sectors as varied as
  business and medicine. 
   
   As a data-driven organization, Citizens of the World Los Angeles, seeks to better evaluate the real impact of our SEL program on students. Given the relatively new nature of this work, SEL assessments for schools are still limited in quantity, quality, and usability. Further, many existing assessments are not fully aligned with our unique SEL model and the targeted outcomes for students ("self," "together," "world"). 
   
   To overcome these challenges, CWC LA and our national CWC support network will continue to work with researchers on developing additional, more customized SEL assessment tools. For example, we are participating in a pilot program with an external provider to develop SEL assessments for grades four and up.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  CWC LA evaluates our work across three core program elements: academic
  excellence, diversity, and community. SEL is imbedded in each of these
  elements and helps us drive toward general mission fulfillment. Therefore, we
  will look at comprehensive measures such as academic achievement and diverse
  stakeholder engagement when we contemplate the effectiveness of SEL.
   
   CWC LA will evaluate our SEL program with focused measures as well. Our assessment tools will assess mastery of SEL concepts such as emotion recognition, perspective taking, social problem solving, delay of gratification and frustration tolerance. We will utilize student input to create social network maps that will help teachers understand and facilitate social connections in the classrooms. Teachers will also observe SEL execution and student behavior using standardized scoring rubrics. Finally, we will seek formal and qualitative parent and principal feedback about our students' social-emotional learning and behaviors.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Many individuals and institutions are beginning to use mindfulness to improve
  productivity and happiness. A number of other schools, including private
  schools, are also starting to include SEL in their instruction.
   
   We believe CWC's approach is unique in that SEL is explicitly part of our philosophical foundation and is deeply embedded across our schools' curriculum. We truly believe that academic and social educations are dependent upon each other, and that student performance is heightened by the immersion of SEL into the core instruction. Where others may include it, CWC embeds it. 
   
   SEL is interwoven with our pillars of diversity, community and academic excellence to uniquely prepare students to improve our complex society. At CWC LA, our high-performing schools reflect the diverse communities we serve. Approximately 50% of our students are individuals of color while approximately 40% of our students qualify for free/reduced lunch. Our collective student body speaks more than 19 languages. 
   
   CWC LA’s talented principals and teachers create safe learning environments where students can master social-emotional skills and learn how to engage respectfully and productively with fellow students, forming meaningful relationships that transcend cultural divides. We believe this learning environment will allow our students to achieve better academic results and will provide a powerful advantage in life. In turn, our graduates will be uniquely positioned to serve as positive influences and bridge-builders as they go on to work and live in diverse neighborhoods throughout Los Angeles and the world. 
   
   Recently, we developed a set of CWC-specific graduate dispositions that touch on the dimensions of self, together, and world. Internally, our graduates will work to become self-aware, "response-able," confident, efficacious, agile, and courageous. In relation to others, CWC graduates will strive to be culturally competent, curious, empathetic, and compassionate. Within the world at large, our graduates will aim to be global, scholarly, systems thinkers. 
   
   Pioneering a deeply ingrained SEL model in a highly diverse public school setting, CWC LA is eager to collaborate with other like-minded schools and organizations interested in the SEL field. A recent LA Times profile of our students' mindfulness work may help illustrate some of the ways in which our classrooms operate uniquely. http://articles.latimes.com/2014/feb/28/health/la-he-kids-meditate-20140301
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  CWC LA is an independently operated, locally based organization that is
  fortunate to be part of the greater Citizens of the World Charter Schools
  (CWCS) national network. CWC LA also has “sister schools” in New York City,
  where CWC New York currently operates two elementary schools in Brooklyn. CWC
  Kansas City will open two Midtown schools in fall 2016.
   
   While each region of schools operates according to the unique needs of its communities, all CWC schools share a deep-seated commitment to social-emotional learning. Our national network, CWCS, is leading the way by forging partnerships with prominent researchers, nonprofit organizations and universities, and assessment providers working in the SEL field. At the regional and school levels, we are excited to share best practices and to begin the important work of codifying our SEL programs. Each school also has its own unique community partners who work with the schools to provide enrichment opportunities and/or lead voluntary mindfulness groups. For example, several Citizens of the World Mar Vista parents have been instrumental in engaging the school’s family community in their own parent-led mindfulness workshops. Filmmakers Julie Bayer Salzman and Josh Salzman created a short film entitled “Just Breathe” (https://youtu.be/RVA2N6tX2cg) after being inspired by their son’s SEL program at CWC.
   
   Going forward, CWC LA would like to expand our partnerships in the assessment and professional development arenas, amplifying our impact by closely tying assessments to both effective instructional practices and our own educational objectives. We are also seeking new collaborators who want to understand the latest research, share best practices, and help strengthen SEL programming for children across Los Angeles and the country. 
    
   If selected, CWC LA does not have any formal partners who would be sharing these particular grant funds.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  We anticipate that the expansion and deepening of our SEL program will cost us
  approximately $300,000 in the 2015-16 school year. These costs include the
  expenses outlined in our detailed budget: leadership time from school
  administrators; additional time from SEL Coordinators at each school site; and
  services provided by the CWC Los Angeles region and national network (note
  that none of the grant funds will be spent to reimburse for these
  regional/national facilitation services).
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
  Our budget for $100,000 is outlined below and includes the following line
  items:
   • A percentage of salary for each of our site’s SEL Coordinator or equivalent position. Percentages range from 5-15% depending on the site for a total cost of $27,018.
   • Consultants to help develop an advisory curriculum focused on SEL for our new 6th grade program for a cost of $2,500.
   • Teacher time to collaborate and be trained on how to implement and assess SEL practices. These sessions would be led by administrators, partners from CWC’s national organization, and other site-based staff such as the SEL Coordinators. Total time allocated is approximately 10% of professional development time during the school year for a total cost of $65,114.
   • Costs for assessments and instructional materials to implement SEL, assuming approximately $4 per student for a total cost of $5,368.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  CWC LA is a growing region of schools in Los Angeles and an affiliate of a
  growing national network (with new CWC schools continuing to open in other
  cities across the country). This affords CWC LA some unique opportunities to
  leverage early SEL investments by expanding the program and by readily
  disseminating best practices. As the founding region of CWC, the Los Angeles
  region is leading the work nationally for CWC and will be able to expand our
  program both within our Los Angeles schools but also nationally to our New
  York and Kansas City regions.
   
   CWC LA's initial professional development costs are one of the program's most expensive components, but once techniques and culture are established at a given school, the SEL program can be easily maintained and built upon. Other early-stage programmatic costs include codification of the model and the purchasing and customization of instructional materials/assessments. 
   
   Overall, CWC LA's SEL program has established a strong foundation upon which to grow. Once our SEL program is fully built out, we anticipate it will be sustainable on public funding. 
   
   Again, we are excited about opportunities to expand our commitment to social-emotional learning, and we are eager to collaborate with any like-minded organizations or individuals to make Los Angeles a better place to learn, live and connect.
