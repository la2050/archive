Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: >-
  LA has all the attributes necessary for economic success in this globally
  connected, innovation-intensive 21st Century. But LA’s regional economy is
  transitioning at an accelerated pace away from low-tech production towards an
  Information-Age economy characterized by innovation-oriented industries, where
  even manufacturing is becoming less labor-intensive, and more
  technology-driven. This transition presents us with a new set and scale of
  challenges that require us, as a region, to “fill in” the gaps by making
  smarter investments in early and lifelong education and retraining; by
  developing forward looking infrastructure systems and physical spaces; by
  inspiring a new generation of civic and social stewards; and by strengthening
  our innovation capacities and global connectedness. Once implemented, LA’s
  next Strategic Plan for Economic Development will interlink the region’s
  economic, physical and networking assets, and fill in the gaps in a way that
  unconditionally bridges us to the Information Age.
