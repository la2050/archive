  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: >-
    LA has all the attributes necessary for economic success in this globally
    connected, innovation-intensive 21st Century. But LA’s regional economy is
    transitioning at an accelerated pace away from low-tech production towards
    an Information-Age economy characterized by innovation-oriented industries,
    where even manufacturing is becoming less labor-intensive, and more
    technology-driven. This transition presents us with a new set and scale of
    challenges that require us, as a region, to “fill in” the gaps by making
    smarter investments in early and lifelong education and retraining; by
    developing forward looking infrastructure systems and physical spaces; by
    inspiring a new generation of civic and social stewards; and by
    strengthening our innovation capacities and global connectedness. Once
    implemented, LA’s next Strategic Plan for Economic Development will
    interlink the region’s economic, physical and networking assets, and fill in
    the gaps in a way that unconditionally bridges us to the Information Age.

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    Like most public benefit, non-profit corporations, our biggest barrier and
    challenge continues to be inadequate resources (e.g., human, financial
    and/or otherwise). Because we operate in an environment characterized by
    resource scarcity, this requires us to generate economies of scale and
    resource leveragability by connecting and linking with other organizations.
    As such, we are not only developing the 2016-2020 LA County Strategic Plan
    for Economic Development through a very public, consensus-driven process,
    with input from hundreds of stakeholders from the business, labor,
    education, philanthropic, environmental, social justice and faith-based
    communities, but the plan’s final strategies will be operationalized,
    championed and catalyzed with the help of myriad organizations and entities
    assuming responsibility and accountability over their successful
    implementation. 
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "At the end of the implementation program, we expect to have increased standards of living for all the residents of Los Angeles by making progress on the following:\r\n1. Increased employment rates \r\n2. Concentration of manufacturing, Foreign Direct Investment in Los Angeles \r\n3. Increased Equity, Equality, and Prosperity for LA County residents \r\n4. Attraction of more high growth start-ups and Increased Venture capital investment\r\n5. Cultivation of cultural and global economic “soft power”\r\n6. Increased Human Capital and Strategic Workforce Development through training, educational attainment, and Community Development\r\n"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "As the County of Los Angeles’s designated economic development corporation for over 34 years, the LAEDC is the far and away the best positioned to lead the implementation of the second countywide Strategic Plan for Economic Development. Only the LAEDC has successfully undertaken and led such a comprehensive and public-facing initiative.\r\nUnlike other plans, the Strategic Plan is unique in that it is analytically-based, publicly-developed, targeted and dynamic. In particular:\r\n\r\n1.The Strategic Plan is founded on economic research and applied analyses, both quantitative and qualitative, including regional economic forecasting, a statistically significant survey of over 1,000 businesses operating in LA County, analyses of our key traded industries (including future trends in labor markets and occupational growth), and a best practices scan to identify and catalog the world’s most successful economic and industry cluster development approaches.   \r\n2.Rather than developing the Strategic Plan unilaterally and then asking the public to accept it after the fact, the LAEDC convened, probed and queried a countywide cohort of civic stewards to identify the strategies and objectives necessary to achieve our shared aspirational economic development goals. \r\n3.Unlike many plans, the 2016-2020 Strategic Plan has a recognized and universally accepted forbearer from which to measure. Beginning where we left off with the first five-year LA County Strategic Plan for Economic Development (2010-2014), we are able to set baselines for where LA County currently stands in its economic trajectory, build on the previous plan’s success to determine what opportunities for improvement should be pursued, and target initiatives towards those opportunities. \r\n4.Unlike other organizations, the LAEDC’s unique position allows us to test our assumptions with local and regional stakeholders, and customize our approaches to fit our distinctive LA County environment. What’s more, our broad connections to a panoply of stakeholder communities place us in a unique position to drive change, course correct, if necessary, and make positive, meaningful and sustainable impact across our region. \r\n\r\nThe execution plan for the Strategic Plan will be guided by the speed of the economic transition in which we currently find ourselves, the intractability of the current slate of challenges we face, and the potential to use our region’s inimitable built in assets to affect marked change on these challenges."
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "Our partners, collaborators and champions include civic stewards from across the County and its 88 cities. After all, this isn’t the “LAEDC’s” strategic plan, but the “Los Angeles County Strategic Plan for Economic Development.” While the countless civic stewards, who will be instrumental to fulfilling the plan’s goals, will not directly receive grant monies, they will be actively and intimately involved in our facilitative and implementation efforts to inform, coordinate, connect, act and execute the strategies contained in the “four corners” of the Strategic Plan for Economic Development.\r\n\r\nBy engaging so many stakeholder organizations in the development process, we have fueled a sense of shared “ownership” amongst those who participated and instilled “collective will”, as to what “we” – as business, labor, government, nonprofit, and education leaders – can do to play a role in the implementation of the plan, and thereby change Los Angeles – our home – for the economic, civic, health and social advancement of all its residents.\r\n\r\nThe most important advances in LA County in terms of economic development will percolate as a result of public, private and nonprofit driving forces. With these grant dollars, the LAEDC will continue to build the infrastructure needed to align and activate our region’s network, physical and economic forces in a way that increases our shared prosperity and thus standard of living in all our communities.\r\n"
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': "The costs of fully implementing a five-year regional strategic plan of this scale fall well beyond the limits of $100,000.  Even the development of the plan (including research and analysis) cost over $1M, for which we received generous support from the Morgan Family Foundation ($80,000) and JPMorgan Chase Global Philanthropy ($300,000), along with a good deal of in-kind support from the LAEDC. \r\n\r\nWith this particular grant, we will ramp up the internal structure needed to oversee the plan’s full implementation. This will include: \r\n\r\n- Conducting landscape and gap analyses in all seven aspirational goals to discern what assets we have at our disposal, where the gaps lie (e.g., capital, physical spaces, policy, talent, etc.) and how to begin to fill those gaps; \r\n- Identifying responsible parties and convening “champions” to lead the implementation of the separate goals, objectives and strategies within the plan;\r\n- Marketing and promoting the plan, primarily through social media; ensuring its continued adoption by LA’s 88 cities, community leaders and others; and publicizing the region’s progress on implementing the plan’s strategies and “moving the needle” on our key metrics of success.\r\n\r\nWhile the LAEDC relies heavily on its strategic partners, members and other joint collaborations, the Strategic Plan’s successful implementation depends on engaging, inspiring and activating a broad swath of stakeholders from across LA County’s different sectors and communities.\r\n"
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Landscape and Gap Analyses [LAEDC In-Kind]\r\n-Innovation and Entrepreneurial Assets \r\n- Talent and Workforce Development\r\n- Physical Space Assets \r\n- Access to Capital Assets \r\n“Ramp- Up” on Marketing and Engagement Communications \r\n- Strategic Plan Website Development & Web Content Creation [$10,000]\r\n- Social Media Strategy & Targeted Execution  [$15,000]\r\n- Collateral Materials (Describes action plan, implementation guide, metrics definition [$10,000] \r\n- Annual Progress Updates on 60 metrics [$10,000]\r\nBring Together Implementation Champions\r\n- Design & Distribute Engagement Materials [$15,000]\r\n- Engage/ Dialog with Target \"Responsible Parties\" [$20,000]\r\n- Hosting Forums /Events to Facilitate Action Plan Design & Assign Roles  [$20,000]\r\n"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "The Los Angeles County Strategic Plan for Economic Development is a comprehensive, regional plan whose purpose is to increase standards of living through economic growth and future prosperity for all residents throughout the County and its 88 cities. It has been curated with meticulous attention to detail as well as with big-picture, long-term goals setting. The success of the Strategic Plan will be influenced in part by the civic stewardship of our region’s stakeholders, by the region’s continued upward economic trajectory, by the commitment of our public, private, and nonprofit partners, and by the ability of the LAEDC to facilitate these groups to pursue regional prosperity using the Strategic Plan as a guide. \r\n\r\nFollowing its adoption by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, the plan will be poised for large-scale implementation. It will become the responsibility of not only those who have been engaged in the conception, creation, development, and adoption of the Plan, but a broader community of LA-based stakeholders to become its guardians, owners and champions for implementation. \r\n\r\nThe LAEDC’s role as the facilitative body will be the impetus for making these far-reaching strategic connections, for providing coordinating information and services, and for ensuring that the Plan’s tenets are relevant to all the County’s communities and groups, from severely economic distressed communities to Fortune 500 companies and from the long-term unemployed to our most successful entrepreneurs. \r\n"

      LA has all the attributes necessary for economic success in this globally
      connected, innovation-intensive 21st Century. But LA’s regional economy is
      transitioning at an accelerated pace away from low-tech production towards
      an Information-Age economy characterized by innovation-oriented
      industries, where even manufacturing is becoming less labor-intensive, and
      more technology-driven. This transition presents us with a new set and
      scale of challenges that require us, as a region, to “fill in” the gaps by
      making smarter investments in early and lifelong education and retraining;
      by developing forward looking infrastructure systems and physical spaces;
      by inspiring a new generation of civic and social stewards; and by
      strengthening our innovation capacities and global connectedness. Once
      implemented, LA’s next Strategic Plan for Economic Development will
      interlink the region’s economic, physical and networking assets, and fill
      in the gaps in a way that unconditionally bridges us to the Information
      Age.

      Like most public benefit, non-profit corporations, our biggest barrier and
      challenge continues to be inadequate resources (e.g., human, financial
      and/or otherwise). Because we operate in an environment characterized by
      resource scarcity, this requires us to generate economies of scale and
      resource leveragability by connecting and linking with other
      organizations. As such, we are not only developing the 2016-2020 LA County
      Strategic Plan for Economic Development through a very public,
      consensus-driven process, with input from hundreds of stakeholders from
      the business, labor, education, philanthropic, environmental, social
      justice and faith-based communities, but the plan’s final strategies will
      be operationalized, championed and catalyzed with the help of myriad
      organizations and entities assuming responsibility and accountability over
      their successful implementation.

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "As the County of Los Angeles’s designated economic development corporation for over 34 years, the LAEDC is the far and away the best positioned to lead the implementation of the second countywide Strategic Plan for Economic Development. Only the LAEDC has successfully undertaken and led such a comprehensive and public-facing initiative.\r\nUnlike other plans, the Strategic Plan is unique in that it is analytically-based, publicly-developed, targeted and dynamic. In particular:\r\n\r\n1.The Strategic Plan is founded on economic research and applied analyses, both quantitative and qualitative, including regional economic forecasting, a statistically significant survey of over 1,000 businesses operating in LA County, analyses of our key traded industries (including future trends in labor markets and occupational growth), and a best practices scan to identify and catalog the world’s most successful economic and industry cluster development approaches.   \r\n2.Rather than developing the Strategic Plan unilaterally and then asking the public to accept it after the fact, the LAEDC convened, probed and queried a countywide cohort of civic stewards to identify the strategies and objectives necessary to achieve our shared aspirational economic development goals. \r\n3.Unlike many plans, the 2016-2020 Strategic Plan has a recognized and universally accepted forbearer from which to measure. Beginning where we left off with the first five-year LA County Strategic Plan for Economic Development (2010-2014), we are able to set baselines for where LA County currently stands in its economic trajectory, build on the previous plan’s success to determine what opportunities for improvement should be pursued, and target initiatives towards those opportunities. \r\n4.Unlike other organizations, the LAEDC’s unique position allows us to test our assumptions with local and regional stakeholders, and customize our approaches to fit our distinctive LA County environment. What’s more, our broad connections to a panoply of stakeholder communities place us in a unique position to drive change, course correct, if necessary, and make positive, meaningful and sustainable impact across our region. \r\n\r\nThe execution plan for the Strategic Plan will be guided by the speed of the economic transition in which we currently find ourselves, the intractability of the current slate of challenges we face, and the potential to use our region’s inimitable built in assets to affect marked change on these challenges."

      Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on
      this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner
      receive?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Our partners, collaborators and champions include civic stewards from across the County and its 88 cities. After all, this isn’t the “LAEDC’s” strategic plan, but the “Los Angeles County Strategic Plan for Economic Development.” While the countless civic stewards, who will be instrumental to fulfilling the plan’s goals, will not directly receive grant monies, they will be actively and intimately involved in our facilitative and implementation efforts to inform, coordinate, connect, act and execute the strategies contained in the “four corners” of the Strategic Plan for Economic Development.\r\n\r\nBy engaging so many stakeholder organizations in the development process, we have fueled a sense of shared “ownership” amongst those who participated and instilled “collective will”, as to what “we” – as business, labor, government, nonprofit, and education leaders – can do to play a role in the implementation of the plan, and thereby change Los Angeles – our home – for the economic, civic, health and social advancement of all its residents.\r\n\r\nThe most important advances in LA County in terms of economic development will percolate as a result of public, private and nonprofit driving forces. With these grant dollars, the LAEDC will continue to build the infrastructure needed to align and activate our region’s network, physical and economic forces in a way that increases our shared prosperity and thus standard of living in all our communities.\r\n"

      How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you
      cover the additional costs?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "The costs of fully implementing a five-year regional strategic plan of this scale fall well beyond the limits of $100,000.  Even the development of the plan (including research and analysis) cost over $1M, for which we received generous support from the Morgan Family Foundation ($80,000) and JPMorgan Chase Global Philanthropy ($300,000), along with a good deal of in-kind support from the LAEDC. \r\n\r\nWith this particular grant, we will ramp up the internal structure needed to oversee the plan’s full implementation. This will include: \r\n\r\n- Conducting landscape and gap analyses in all seven aspirational goals to discern what assets we have at our disposal, where the gaps lie (e.g., capital, physical spaces, policy, talent, etc.) and how to begin to fill those gaps; \r\n- Identifying responsible parties and convening “champions” to lead the implementation of the separate goals, objectives and strategies within the plan;\r\n- Marketing and promoting the plan, primarily through social media; ensuring its continued adoption by LA’s 88 cities, community leaders and others; and publicizing the region’s progress on implementing the plan’s strategies and “moving the needle” on our key metrics of success.\r\n\r\nWhile the LAEDC relies heavily on its strategic partners, members and other joint collaborations, the Strategic Plan’s successful implementation depends on engaging, inspiring and activating a broad swath of stakeholders from across LA County’s different sectors and communities.\r\n"

    answer: "The Los Angeles County Strategic Plan for Economic Development is a comprehensive, regional plan whose purpose is to increase standards of living through economic growth and future prosperity for all residents throughout the County and its 88 cities. It has been curated with meticulous attention to detail as well as with big-picture, long-term goals setting. The success of the Strategic Plan will be influenced in part by the civic stewardship of our region’s stakeholders, by the region’s continued upward economic trajectory, by the commitment of our public, private, and nonprofit partners, and by the ability of the LAEDC to facilitate these groups to pursue regional prosperity using the Strategic Plan as a guide. \r\n\r\nFollowing its adoption by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, the plan will be poised for large-scale implementation. It will become the responsibility of not only those who have been engaged in the conception, creation, development, and adoption of the Plan, but a broader community of LA-based stakeholders to become its guardians, owners and champions for implementation. \r\n\r\nThe LAEDC’s role as the facilitative body will be the impetus for making these far-reaching strategic connections, for providing coordinating information and services, and for ensuring that the Plan’s tenets are relevant to all the County’s communities and groups, from severely economic distressed communities to Fortune 500 companies and from the long-term unemployed to our most successful entrepreneurs. \r\n"
