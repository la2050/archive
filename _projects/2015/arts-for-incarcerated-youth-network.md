    serve them, and create a powerful resource for the creative economy in Los
    Angeles.
  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: "AIYN is using arts as a foundational strategy to transform our young people into healthy adults who are assets to the creative economy of Los Angeles. \r\n \r\nThe positive impact of arts education on youth currently or formerly involved in the juvenile justice system is well documented in numerous studies. According to a National Governors Association Center for Best Practices study, the arts contribute to lower recidivism rates, increased self-esteem, the acquisition of job skills, and the development of creative thinking, problem solving, and communication skills among high-risk and at-risk youth. Participants in youth arts programs exhibit reduced delinquent behavior and fewer new court referrals than their non-participating peers.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we are gathering an increasing body of evidence that the arts are a uniquely powerful tool in helping youth understand, articulate, and process trauma.  This has led AIYN to refer to integrated, experiential arts education as a “healing-informed practice.”  Arts programming also has been proven to strengthen essential 21st Century learning skills of creativity, collaboration, communication, and critical thinking, and enables and encourages youth to access creative economy jobs. \r\n\r\nIn addition to providing programming to youth, a core component of our work is engaging Probation as a partner: AIYN seeks to provide hands-on training for Probation staff in the camps, halls, and community transition. This ongoing professional support serves to integrate arts as a key strategy with youth within the culture of Probation itself.\r\n\r\nAIYN has established partnerships with LA County Probation, and LA County Arts Commission.  AIYN has successfully completed two hands-on professional development trainings for Probation staff, as well as the Freedom Schools project (providing arts programming in the afternoon as part of Children's Defense Funds' Freedom Schools program in 6 LA County Detention camps) in partnership with Probation and the Arts Commission.  All parties confirmed the evaluation findings -- that this is a successful, transformative partnership.  \r\n\r\nAIYN is poised to become a powerful vehicle for partnership among community agencies, and between community agencies and public partners.  With support, AIYN can become a champion for the arts as a violence prevention tool in practice, policy, and systems culture, as well as an effective strategy to strengthen LA's creative economy.\r\n"

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  LA is one of the most diverse cities in the world with over 40 languages
  spoken. Many communities, however, remain somewhat isolated, either in what is
  culturally familiar to them, what is accessible to them in terms of
  transportation, or based on any number of demographic factors. Our vision is
  to partner with neighborhood councils, local organizations, local colleges,
  and corporate human resources departments, to connect people to everything
  that is Los Angeles. We want people to experience the texture and various
  aspects of the city so that they can have a deeper connection, to walk away
  from these events having learned something new and calling LA “my city.” My
  Bucket List LA will incorporate volunteerism, local restaurants, events, and
  cultural/historical activities, while facilitating social connection across
  professional, racial, ethnic, and socio-economic lines. We will tap into the
  existing cultural richness and natural diversity of our city to help expand
  participants’ overall experience as Angelenos. We believe the structure of
  these events would provide exposure to social issues, more awareness and
  understanding of those issues, and further civic engagement.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  One major barrier or challenge will be bridging the gap between simply
  participating in the event, as opposed to connecting, forming long lasting
  relationships and establishing continued participation in the community. Our
  name itself includes the structural aim of our project: Bucket List. The
  fundamental idea of a bucket list is repeated interaction, crossing off more
  that you’ve seen and done. In attending multiple events through My Bucket List
  LA, people will come, volunteer, play, eat, and ultimately connect with
  familiar faces, while exploring new pockets of the city.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We plan to evaluate with feedback from participating individuals and
  organizations. Surveys and feedback will provide us with concrete information
  to improve our programs and ways to move forward with growth.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  There are several organizations who work on pieces of our project, including
  LA Works (Volunteer), Meet Up (Social), and Eventbrite (Social, Cultural,
  Historical). Our approach is unique because it’s the integration and curation
  of all these aspects, while targeting particular populations and groups for
  these interactions. The bucket list is a goal-oriented project that creates
  incentive for participants to remain engaged over the long term.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  We will partner with neighborhood councils and the organizations we set up
  volunteer events with. Our goal includes learning about the organizations,
  their missions, people they serve, and their place in the overall community of
  LA. If awarded the grant, funds would be budgeted to maximize the impact of
  the program. Seeking additional funds from partner organizations will allow us
  to leverage LA2050 funding to maximize the reach of the program.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  By tapping into the existing network of volunteer events, restaurants and
  activities around Los Angeles, scaling up will require strong partnerships. We
  would partner with large corporations for large scale promotion, awareness,
  and sponsorships for employees or events. We would also partner with volunteer
  organizations and non-profits to build strong relationships for future,
  continued and potentially regular volunteerism or events. We would need to
  create a marketing plan to utilize social media, other digital and viral modes
  of promotion, establish city wide awareness and any other Public Relations
  need. Additionally, if scaling up, we would need an operational team or
  administrative staff to plan and execute the events. With continued growth we
  would build a platform to track the events, a bucket list app that includes
  social sharing as we continue to trek through the digital and social media
  world. It would be incredible to then see a project like this grow into other
  cities.
