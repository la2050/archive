  Facing History will engage its LA Partnership Schools Network in a year-long
  journey to create compassionate school communities and build a stronger, more
  empathetic LA. The network includes 17 diverse public middle and high schools
  that infuse Facing History content across grade levels and disciplines to
  increase students’ ability to relate history to their own lives; heighten
  their understanding of the origins of bigotry and hatred; and engage them in
  creating change in their communities.
