  Ambassador Bird is the international symbol of peace -- the dove -- reimagined
  as a hero for children and families. The character teaches diversity and
  teamwork through international cultural awareness. By using the character at
  community events, educational programs, and through tourism marketing, Los
  Angeles will have a mascot that encourages people to connect with neighbors
  and visitors by sharing personal stories, learning about different cultures,
  and making friends.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Ambassador Bird is a kawaii ("adorable" in Japanese) character that represents
  the best of LA -- culture, diversity, fun, creativity, and love. Using the
  character for: 1) personal appearances encourages families to attend cultural
  and civic events, 2) educational programs empowers kids to participate in the
  life of their city, and 3) tourism marketing gives Los Angeles a friendly,
  diverse face. The character embodies the worldly, big city nature of L.A.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  The hard work will be to coordinate the use of character throughout the city's
  diverse community programs, which will be accomplished by partnering with the
  city's current marketing coordinators (both public and private) for a
  consistent campaign. When the mascot makes his personal appearance debut at a
  big event, we will have to be ready with press information, licensed
  merchandise, and follow-up. The mascot belongs to the people of L.A., so we
  will have to be both generous and strict in our usage guidelines.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We will: 1) count the number of people visiting events where the mascot
  appears, 2) track merchandise sales, 3) follow press mentions.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  All professional sports teams know the value (and profitability) of mascots.
  Ambassador Bird would be the first for a major American city. The character
  builds on the international "name recognition" of the bird of peace.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Yvette Helin Studios -- the country's premier puppet and costume builder for
  Broadway and Theme Parks. Approximately $30,000 for a custom kevlar-molded
  costume (which has superior durability). GR Print -- Los Angeles printer of
  stickers and promotional materials. Approximately $5000.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 â€“ how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  $100,000. As Los Angeles is the entertainment capital of the world, we intend
  to seek donations of talent and material (costumes from the Disney costume
  shop, for example) to support this project.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
  Costume: $30,000 - includes design, molds (for future replacements),
  administrative expenses. Souvenir stickers: $5000 - includes design of one
  L.A.-themed sticker. E-commerce (to sell licensed merchandise): $15,000 -
  includes design of merchandise and one website. Other design and
  administration: $50,000 - includes professional mascot actor, personal
  appearance coordinator, management.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Once one mascot costume is made and a personal appearance schedule is set, it
  is simple to create multiple costumes (due to the kevlar process) and
  coordinate through one office. If merchandise sales are successful, the
  project will be self-funding.
