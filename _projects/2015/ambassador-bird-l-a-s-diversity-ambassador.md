  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    The hard work will be to coordinate the use of character throughout the
    city's diverse community programs, which will be accomplished by partnering
    with the city's current marketing coordinators (both public and private) for
    a consistent campaign.  When the mascot makes his personal appearance debut
    at a big event, we will have to be ready with press information, licensed
    merchandise, and follow-up.  The mascot belongs to the people of L.A., so we
    will have to be both generous and strict in our usage guidelines. 
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    We will: 1) count the number of people visiting events where the mascot
    appears, 2) track merchandise sales, 3) follow press mentions.  
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    All professional sports teams know the value (and profitability) of
    mascots.  Ambassador Bird would be the first for a major American city.  The
    character builds on the international "name recognition" of the bird of
    peace. 
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    Yvette Helin Studios -- the country's premier puppet and costume builder for
    Broadway and Theme Parks.  Approximately $30,000 for a custom kevlar-molded
    costume (which has superior durability).  GR Print -- Los Angeles printer of
    stickers and promotional materials.  Approximately $5000.  
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    $100,000.  As Los Angeles is the entertainment capital of the world, we
    intend to seek donations of talent and material (costumes from the Disney
    costume shop, for example) to support this project. 
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
    Costume: $30,000 - includes design, molds (for future replacements),
    administrative expenses.  Souvenir stickers: $5000 - includes design of one
    L.A.-themed sticker.  E-commerce (to sell licensed merchandise): $15,000 -
    includes design of merchandise and one website.  Other design and
    administration: $50,000 - includes professional mascot actor, personal
    appearance coordinator, management.  
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    Once one mascot costume is made and a personal appearance schedule is set,
    it is simple to create multiple costumes (due to the kevlar process) and
    coordinate through one office.  If merchandise sales are successful, the
    project will be self-funding.

      The hard work will be to coordinate the use of character throughout the
      city's diverse community programs, which will be accomplished by
      partnering with the city's current marketing coordinators (both public and
      private) for a consistent campaign.  When the mascot makes his personal
      appearance debut at a big event, we will have to be ready with press
      information, licensed merchandise, and follow-up.  The mascot belongs to
      the people of L.A., so we will have to be both generous and strict in our
      usage guidelines.

      All professional sports teams know the value (and profitability) of
      mascots.  Ambassador Bird would be the first for a major American city. 
      The character builds on the international "name recognition" of the bird
      of peace.

      Once one mascot costume is made and a personal appearance schedule is set,
      it is simple to create multiple costumes (due to the kevlar process) and
      coordinate through one office.  If merchandise sales are successful, the
      project will be self-funding.
