Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  The hard work will be to coordinate the use of character throughout the city's
  diverse community programs, which will be accomplished by partnering with the
  city's current marketing coordinators (both public and private) for a
  consistent campaign. When the mascot makes his personal appearance debut at a
  big event, we will have to be ready with press information, licensed
  merchandise, and follow-up. The mascot belongs to the people of L.A., so we
  will have to be both generous and strict in our usage guidelines.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We will: 1) count the number of people visiting events where the mascot
  appears, 2) track merchandise sales, 3) follow press mentions.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  All professional sports teams know the value (and profitability) of mascots.
  Ambassador Bird would be the first for a major American city. The character
  builds on the international "name recognition" of the bird of peace.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Yvette Helin Studios -- the country's premier puppet and costume builder for
  Broadway and Theme Parks. Approximately $30,000 for a custom kevlar-molded
  costume (which has superior durability). GR Print -- Los Angeles printer of
  stickers and promotional materials. Approximately $5000.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Once one mascot costume is made and a personal appearance schedule is set, it
  is simple to create multiple costumes (due to the kevlar process) and
  coordinate through one office. If merchandise sales are successful, the
  project will be self-funding.
