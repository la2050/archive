  The Healthy Streams for Angelenos project as an important first step to make
  important linkages between human health, resource management, and water
  quality science. The goal of the Healthy Streams for Angelenos project is to
  provide resource managers with the information they need to accurately assess
  the public health risks associated with stream-based recreation when known
  water quality safety standards are exceeded. This information will be
  developed into a public awareness campaign.

  This project will focus on the positive health impacts of water-based
  recreation, and the negative impacts pollution can have on streams and human
  health in the San Gabriel Mountains. 
   
   Currently, there are disturbing equity and social justice issues in the way we monitor and respond to water quality issues of southern California’s streams. Water quality at southern California beaches is
   regularly monitored and communicated in high profile Beach Report Cards, but only a few studies have been conducted on the water quality of freshwater streams in the San Gabriel Mountains,
   where many low income and under-served residents of Los Angeles County recreate. Little is known about these health-related consequences compared to the wealth of knowledge accumulated about beaches and surfer health.
   
   Our program will potentially serve over three million people who visit the San Gabriel Mountains every year to swim in the area’s streams. The San Gabriel Mountains comprise 70% of Los Angeles County’s open space and provide 35% of the region’s drinking water. This region includes some of the most heavily visited public lands in the United States: more than three million people visit the San Gabriel Mountains every year to hike, fish, swim, and to simply enjoy the remarkable natural beauty of this National Forest. In October 2014, President Obama designated 346,177 acres in the San Gabriel Mountains as a National Monument: as a result, the already popular San Gabriel Mountains are set to receive even more visitors in the future.
   
   Education and awareness of the public on sources of environmental risk from water-based recreation will empower residents with the ability to protect themselves, their families and their communities. The project will also serve the community by training local area youth to serve as “watershed rangers” for the San Gabriel Mountains, working to educate visitors, community members, and peers about the value of outdoor recreation and stream health, and how to minimize impacts to water quality while also avoiding exposure to potentially harmful pollution.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  A consensus-driven process is difficult to achieve, especially as it concerns
  human health impacts. Development of an effective public awareness campaign
  related to stream-based recreation and how this information will be served up
  to the public will not be an easy task. It will take directed and intensive
  planning and development of a well-thought out work plan. This work plan must
  be developed with the multiple entities involved in the issue to be effective
  and workable. 
   
   The Council for Watershed Health cannot do this alone. We recognize that the beast way to move froward is to bring together a diverse coalition of stakeholders to develop a well-coordinated approach for how to develop a public awareness campaign for stream-based recreation. The Council is uniquely poised to facilitate this process and bring all parties to the table to begin the discussion of how we can accomplish this together.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We know that fecal bacteria levels at popular freshwater swimming sites are
  elevated, especially during the summer months, and particularly on holiday
  weekends. The sampling and analytical methods used, however, do not allow for
  confirmation of potential sources of contamination. Therefore, additional
  information is required before making recommendations as to best management
  practices to reduce bacterial contamination at popular swim sites. We will
  evaluate our work in the following ways:
   
   1) Use of survey results to improve decision making in regards to best management practices for human health and stream-based recreation, 2) address the source of contamination in streams via monitoring and source tracking studies; 3) strengthen inter-agency partnerships via engagement meetings and collective input; 4) establishing a data exchange network or awareness mechanism to allow better public access to stream water quality data to make informed decisions.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  California’s beach water quality monitoring program is the most rigorous in
  the nation. When water-quality standards are exceeded, officials are required
  to take action to protect swimmers by either closing the beach or positing
  warning signs that notify the public of possible health risks from water
  contact. Heal the Bay, a non-profit organization also based in Los Angeles,
  has spearheaded this effort.
   
    However, there are very few analogous checks in place for fresh water swim sites, especially for streams that receive high levels of recreation involving human body contact. The Los Angeles Dept. of Public Health regularly monitors the water quality in public swimming pools and recreational lakes, but not in wadeable streamson public lands that are frequented by the public for water-based recreation. 
   
   The most unique aspect of this program is the formation of novel partnerships to develop workable solutions to a complex management issue. The overall goal is to improve both human and watershed health, focusing on the positive health aspects of water-based recreation, as well as the negative impacts of pollution on streams and human health. 
   
   Novel forms of engagement and collaboration with disparate entities are key to the project’s overall success and have not been attempted on this level before. Through this program, we will bring together a diverse group of organizations to achieve common goals.
   
   Our approach is further unique in that: 1) there is no water quality awareness program currently in place for southern California’s recreational streams, and 2) water quality is an issue that extends beyond jurisdiction and demographics and requires an effective communication strategy informed by research, agency, and community input.
   
   We are confident the results of this program will characterize a new dimension of performance relative to similar programs in southern California because, unlike other groups, we holistically focus on all the beneficial uses the (environmental, economic, and social) of southern California’s watersheds. In addition, we are a nonpartisan organization staffed by leading experts in the water science field who are routinely sought by regional collaborative groups to assume a leadership role within them, assuring that: a diverse group of stakeholders integrate their efforts; best practice policies are followed; and results are effectively communicated to the public.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  This grant award will be used mainly to fund development of a diverse working
  and planning group. We intend to engage and collaborate with a diverse number
  of organizations on this initiative, including the cities of Los Angeles and
  Burbank, Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, LA County Sanitation
  Districts, United States Forest Service, Council of Mexican Federations,
  Conservation Authority, Amigos de los Rios, the Rivers and Mountains
  Conservancy, and Friends of the Angeles.
   
   The Los Angeles and San Gabriel River Watershed Monitoring Programs are on-going, collaborative efforts intended to assess the health of these Watersheds from a regional perspective. The motivation for these programs comes from the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board, with monitoring a mandated activity for the Cities of Los Angeles and Burbank, as well as the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts, to improve coordination and integration of monitoring efforts to increase awareness of watershed scale issues. Among the main concerns are water quality conditions and trends and safety for swimming/fishing. 
   
   The Environmental Health Division of Los Angeles Dept. of Public Health has a vision for a healthy and sustainable environment for all residents of LA County. One of their mandates is to educate the public on sources of environmental risk so they are empowered to protect themselves.
   
   The U.S. Forest Service's Forest Land Management Plan (LMP) for the Angeles National Forest recognizes the important role that the Forest plays in the education, outreach and development of stewardship within urban communities. The LMP recognizes that the rapidly increasing population of southern California, and identifies that the resulting effects on the natural environment is one of the main regional challenges facing the Forest Service. Therefore, a resulting goal of the LMP is to improve watershed conditions through cooperative management. The LMP also recognizes the need to offer a wide range of high quality, environmentally sustainable developed recreation opportunities suitable for the culturally diverse visitor population, while minimizing visitor conflicts and detrimental effects to natural resources. 
   
   Council of Mexican Federations (COFEM) promotes the advancement of the Latino Community in North America through public policy advocacy, community organizing, leadership and organizational development, educational and cultural programs.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  This project is envisioned in three Phases: Phase I is scoping of the issue
  and workgroup engagement; Phase II is comprised of studies that link stream
  health to human health (epidemiological studies); and Phase III is making the
  changes (communications and awareness campaign). 
   
   The total cost for full implementation of all phases, especially Phase II, is beyond the 100k supplied by LA2050. The LA2050 grant funding will provide important seed funding for this effort. The 100k from the LA2050 grant will be used for the planning and development of a communication plan related to this effort. We are working with other funding groups such as the California Endowment, the water Conservation Authority, and the Rivers and Mountains Conservancy to fund other aspects of this work. In-king match from the Los Angels Dept of Public Health is also being sought to fund other aspects of this work.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  The 100k from the LA2050 grant will be used to complete two primary tasks:
   
   1. $41,300: Analysis of previously collected water quality samples that will provide baseline data analysis for bacterial source identification. This will involve collaboration with research laboratories to conduct the analysis.
   
   2. $58,700: Working with public health and land management partners. This will be used to assemble the project partner workgroup/technical advisory committee and conduct meetings. As the facilitating organization, Council for Watershed Health will convene these meeting and host a series of workshops for the participating agencies that will be involved.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  We plan to scale the success of this program in a number of ways, via
  effective phasing a measuring success at each phase and via small-scale
  demonstrations.
   
   This project is envisioned in three Phases: Phase I is scoping of the issue and workgroup engagement; Phase II is comprised of studies that link stream health to human health (epidemiological studies); and Phase III is making the changes (communications and awareness campaign). The 100k from the LA2050 grant will be used to develop the planning and communication piece of this effort. The success of the planning piece is critical to developing an effective communication and awareness campaign for stream-based water recreation activities. This efforts must have the full support of land mangers, public health agencies, and the public at large, The outcomes derived at Phase I will dictate the direction of the subsequent phases.
   
   Based on outcomes from the planning, this program will first be piloted at a small number of known swim sites in the LA River Watershed to develop a process for how this can be done at a larger regional scale. Over time, as success is measured, the program can be scaled up to include a larger portion of the LA River watershed, then the San Gabriel River Watershed, and eventually, the entire San Gabriel Mountains National Monument. We will start small and grow the program over time. 
   
   As an organization, the Council for Watershed Health values results based on applied research and analysis that inform policy change and lead to a more sustainable southern California region from the perspective of water quality and quantity management. Our program is unique in that it addresses diverse themes such as urban stormwater, watershed coordination, watershed monitoring, and the promotion of sustainable landscapes. Having access to multiple lines of information increases our ability to integrate various sectors and effectively carry out our core mission. This includes providing leadership, guidance, and assistance to other agencies and organizations to affect sound watershed planning and management, promoting better coordination and integration of watershed monitoring while measuring and tracking progress towards achieving healthier watersheds for humans and fostering a more sustainable regional landscape ethic for Los Angeles.
