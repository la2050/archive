title: Healthy Streams for Angelenos
project_summary: >-
  The Healthy Streams for Angelenos project as an important first step to make
  important linkages between human health, resource management, and water
  quality science. The goal of the Healthy Streams for Angelenos project is to
  provide resource managers with the information they need to accurately assess
  the public health risks associated with stream-based recreation when known
  water quality safety standards are exceeded. This information will be
  developed into a public awareness campaign.

Where will you be working?:
  - Central LA
  - San Gabriel Valley
  - City of Los Angeles
How do you plan to use these resources to make change?:
  - Conduct research
  - Expand a pilot or a program
  - Advocate with policymakers and leaders
How will your proposal improve the following “Live” metrics?:
  - Obesity rates
  - Acres and miles of polluted waterways
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "We know that fecal bacteria levels at popular freshwater swimming sites are elevated, especially during the summer months, and particularly on holiday weekends. The sampling and analytical methods used, however, do not allow for confirmation of potential sources of contamination. Therefore, additional information is required before making recommendations as to best management practices to reduce bacterial contamination at popular swim sites. We will evaluate our work in the following ways:\r\n\r\n1) Use of survey results to improve decision making in regards to best management practices for human health and stream-based recreation, 2) address the source of contamination in streams via monitoring and source tracking studies; 3) strengthen inter-agency partnerships via engagement meetings and collective input; 4) establishing a data exchange network or awareness mechanism to allow better public access to stream water quality data to make informed decisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
  - Money (financial capital)
  - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
  - Network/relationship support
