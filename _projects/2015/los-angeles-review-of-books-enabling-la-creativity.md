  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: "LA has a growing creative community in all the arts. Every week, a new publishing venture launches, a new theater space or new gallery opens, and every day many thousands of us work on a novel or screenplay or song, paint or sculpt, do new media arts, design a building, a dress, or a stage set, or begin filming. But not all of these projects find their audience, locally, nationally, or internationally, and not all can sustain careers over time. \r\n\r\nWhat LARB can do is help build the audience base for LA’s creative activity, bring news and understanding and appreciation of these projects to our hundreds of thousands of readers across the country and elsewhere—10% of our readers are in CA, 60% in the rest of the country, and 30% overseas—and many are editors, critics, curators, and grantmakers around the globe. By helping create the local, national, and international audience for LA’s artists, we help them put food on their tables and enable their practice, help them pay the rent and create again. For writers and publishers to sell books, artists to sell work and performers tickets and recordings, they need to come to the attention of galleries, distributors, tastemakers, and the press. Reviews like LARB are an important part of that artistic ecology, especially here, since NY reviews have overwhelmingly focused on writers and artists from the East Coast. \r\n\r\nLARB is one of the country’s most successful attempts to decentralize and diversify the artistic and literary conversation; we publish more diverse writers and review more diverse artists; and the more attention our LA artists receive, the more support they can receive, and the more sustainable their practice can be. In addition, since most of the people who do critical writing are themselves artists, in hiring them to write for us, we are helping to support each of them directly as well, in a small way, by paying them for their writing, writing that itself brings them to the attention of a global audience. If a sculptor carves a tree in the woods and no one sees it, her art has not fulfilled its promise; LARB’s soft power can foster and help sustain new arts establishments and creative industries, increase the visibility of women and minority artists, increase recruiting and retention rates for local higher education institutions, allow graduates to stay here rather than move to NY, and elevate the global influence of LA’s artistic achievements, making LA an even better place to create.

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    The main challenge is making sure we are finding the full range of artistic
    activity in the city, in every nook and cranny, and identifying the best,
    most diverse group of critics to present it to our readers. We have, of
    course, been doing a good deal of this already. But the challenge will be to
    identify more artists and groups and critics than we have so far, and make
    sure that our coverage is truly representative, with critical perspectives
    that are diverse enough to fully appreciate the range of artistry in the
    city. We are very confident that with this grant’s help, we can do just
    that. The grant will help by making available funds to pay critics to write
    for us, funding for additional editorial staff, funding to provide new,
    innovative platforms for communities of writers and artists to reach wider
    national and international audiences, and funding to continue our outreach
    to individuals and communities throughout the city and county.
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    We have already been successful in launching and helping sustain the careers
    of many young LA writers, artists, and critics, and have tracked that
    success. We collect detailed data on our website’s readership, and we can
    tell how many people read each of the pieces we publish, and can cross
    reference that to where the readers are located. We also have records of the
    writers who have contributed to LARB so far, where they reside, their race,
    ethnicity, gender, and other identifications, and we have the same data
    about the writers and artists they review, write essays about, and
    interview. This grant will help us identify a broader number of
    writer-critics and have them comment and introduce audiences to a broader
    swath of LA artists from even more diverse communities. We can track the
    dissemination of that information across social media networks, in other
    online conversations, and in the legacy media by measuring increased links,
    citations, mentions, and other media attention.
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "There are other organizations—NY Review of Books, London Review of Books, TLS, BookForum, Harpers, The Atlantic—that do work similar to ours, but they rarely attend to LA-based artists and writers, they have  older and less diverse contributors and readers, and all have a determined East Coast/Atlantic focus and bias. \r\n\r\nThere are local magazines like the new CARLA that focus on LA’s fine arts scene, or PEN USA’s Rattling Wall and Red Hen Press’s LA Review that focus on literature, but they do not have as broad an audience in the city as LARB does, or as much reach beyond LA.  LA Weekly, LA Magazine, and LA Times have all cut back their cultural coverage over the last decade in response to the digital disruption of print publishing and the resulting decline of advertising and subscription revenues. We see all these publications as complimentary rather than competitors, as we are all participants in the same cultural conversation, but we are the only serious LA cultural publication that has built a sizable national and international audience (a third of a million unique readers a month, more than BookForum, London Review of Books, or TLS, for instance) devoted to the full range of culture and the arts; LARB covers philosophy and film, comics and poetry, fiction and politics, painting and performance, science writing and TV. \r\n\r\nWhat is unique in our approach for this project is our deep penetration of all LA’s diverse artistic and literary cultures combined with our national and global reach—the size of our national and international audience of readers specifically interested in creative work, an audience that includes curators, publishers, agents, gallery owners and many others who have the power to enable artistic careers. \r\n\r\nWhat is also unique about LARB is our proven dedication to bringing new artists, writers, and commentators into the cultural conversation; we use many first-time critics and work with them closely to bring their work up to the highest professional standards, and have helped launch many journalistic careers. This project will help us do much more of that. We also hope that it will help us identify groups of critics and artists who we can help develop additional LARB Channels—affiliated websites with editorial autonomy like those we now publish (including Avidly, Marginalia, Voluble, The Offing) and those in development that represent LA’s Persian, Middle Eastern, North African, Asian, Latino, and other literary and artistic communities."
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "Our primary collaborators will include the many writers and critics of LA, established, emerging, and just getting started. Some of them will have written for us before, but many of them we will identify as part of this project. Many of these will be well established, some established in their own communities but not yet with access to national and international publications, and for some younger writers this might be their very first publication. The total number of these collaborators will be somewhat less than 365, since some may write for us (or conduct interviews, or make short films or podcasts) more than once. But there will be hundreds of new collaborators in any case. Each will receive payment for their work.\r\n\r\nWe also will collaborate with a number of existing organizations. We cooperate with PEN USA, with whom we share some board members, and with 826LA. We cooperate with LA Public Library and other area libraries, and will be reaching out to more branches. We work with UCR, UCLA, UCI, USC, CSULA, Emerson College LA, Loyola Marymount, and St. Mary’s College, and will be reaching out to more colleges and universities as part of this project. We have partnered with many local independent bookstores and art galleries and will continue to expand that network. We will be reaching out to community arts centers and other community centers throughout the city and county as part of this project to tap into artistic communities that we haven’t partnered with yet. We have partnered with LiveTalksLA and Literary Death Match and with local book publishers. We have worked with LA Magazine and Flaunt and the LA Times. We work with book festivals and reading series. We have worked with KCRW and are now broadcasting our half-hour radio show at KPFK and other Pacifica stations. We have partnered with filmmaker Kurt Olerud to produce a feature documentary on LA literature. All of these networks we will continue to grow.\r\n\r\nWe employ a number of graphic design and web design firms in LA, and we pointedly do all our printing in Los Angeles to support that infrastructure. Since everyone who works at LARB also has an artistic life, and since the grantwriters and development consultants we hire specialize in nonprofit arts work, I think that it is safe to say that except for our paper clips and rent and utility payments, 100% of our budget gets reinvested in the creative economy of LA. 100% of this grant will be."
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    We have become very aware, over our four years of operation, how every piece
    of work we publish helps leverage the next. We began LARB with nothing but a
    handful of volunteers and a single donor. That first year we still managed
    to publish 300 pieces, attract another couple dozen donors and a steadily
    growing number of readers. The next year we doubled the number of pieces,
    doubled our income, and doubled our readership again. We now publish 1500
    pieces a year and have a budget of $750,000. We are still ahead of
    ourselves—that is, we are still relying on volunteer labor, and still not
    paying enough to compete with the better-funded reviews. But by completing
    this project, we know that the increased coverage and increased visibility
    it will bring us will translate, once more, into increased readership and
    increased income. Each year we come closer to our goal of true
    sustainability, which necessarily includes better compensation for writers
    and editors. We understand this as a process of scalability, that every
    grant, every donation grows our ability to reach that goal. The knowledge
    that we are already outperforming well-established, well-funded outlets is
    extremely encouraging. And we are doing so while maintaining our commitment
    to full diversity, and maintaining our fundamental integrity as a collective
    of public service-minded people dedicated to the common good. That people
    are stepping up to support that is even more encouraging. This grant will
    help us grow, help LA’s creative class survive the disruption being
    experienced in so many creative industries, and help LA continue to
    establish itself as the most significant artistic and literary capital of
    this century. That is to say, we see our scalability completely entwined
    with LA’s—if we continue to grow, so will LA publishing; if LA’s new media
    companies continue to grow, so will we. Since we have active interns and
    volunteers from many area schools, and many from here and elsewhere have
    been through our summer training program, we are helping to build the
    editorial cadre of the future, away from the entrenched hierarchies of New
    York. As we help support the diversity of LA’s literary landscape, we help
    diversify the conversation nationally, as well. We believe that helping to
    make LA a great place to create helps the world become a better place, and
    that is why, finally, we do what we do.
