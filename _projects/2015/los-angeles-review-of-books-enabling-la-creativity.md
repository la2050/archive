  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: "LA has a growing creative community in all the arts. Every week, a new publishing venture launches, a new theater space or new gallery opens, and every day many thousands of us work on a novel or screenplay or song, paint or sculpt, do new media arts, design a building, a dress, or a stage set, or begin filming. But not all of these projects find their audience, locally, nationally, or internationally, and not all can sustain careers over time. \r\n\r\nWhat LARB can do is help build the audience base for LA’s creative activity, bring news and understanding and appreciation of these projects to our hundreds of thousands of readers across the country and elsewhere—10% of our readers are in CA, 60% in the rest of the country, and 30% overseas—and many are editors, critics, curators, and grantmakers around the globe. By helping create the local, national, and international audience for LA’s artists, we help them put food on their tables and enable their practice, help them pay the rent and create again. For writers and publishers to sell books, artists to sell work and performers tickets and recordings, they need to come to the attention of galleries, distributors, tastemakers, and the press. Reviews like LARB are an important part of that artistic ecology, especially here, since NY reviews have overwhelmingly focused on writers and artists from the East Coast. \r\n\r\nLARB is one of the country’s most successful attempts to decentralize and diversify the artistic and literary conversation; we publish more diverse writers and review more diverse artists; and the more attention our LA artists receive, the more support they can receive, and the more sustainable their practice can be. In addition, since most of the people who do critical writing are themselves artists, in hiring them to write for us, we are helping to support each of them directly as well, in a small way, by paying them for their writing, writing that itself brings them to the attention of a global audience. If a sculptor carves a tree in the woods and no one sees it, her art has not fulfilled its promise; LARB’s soft power can foster and help sustain new arts establishments and creative industries, increase the visibility of women and minority artists, increase recruiting and retention rates for local higher education institutions, allow graduates to stay here rather than move to NY, and elevate the global influence of LA’s artistic achievements, making LA an even better place to create.

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    The main challenge is making sure we are finding the full range of artistic
    activity in the city, in every nook and cranny, and identifying the best,
    most diverse group of critics to present it to our readers. We have, of
    course, been doing a good deal of this already. But the challenge will be to
    identify more artists and groups and critics than we have so far, and make
    sure that our coverage is truly representative, with critical perspectives
    that are diverse enough to fully appreciate the range of artistry in the
    city. We are very confident that with this grant’s help, we can do just
    that. The grant will help by making available funds to pay critics to write
    for us, funding for additional editorial staff, funding to provide new,
    innovative platforms for communities of writers and artists to reach wider
    national and international audiences, and funding to continue our outreach
    to individuals and communities throughout the city and county.
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    We have already been successful in launching and helping sustain the careers
    of many young LA writers, artists, and critics, and have tracked that
    success. We collect detailed data on our website’s readership, and we can
    tell how many people read each of the pieces we publish, and can cross
    reference that to where the readers are located. We also have records of the
    writers who have contributed to LARB so far, where they reside, their race,
    ethnicity, gender, and other identifications, and we have the same data
    about the writers and artists they review, write essays about, and
    interview. This grant will help us identify a broader number of
    writer-critics and have them comment and introduce audiences to a broader
    swath of LA artists from even more diverse communities. We can track the
    dissemination of that information across social media networks, in other
    online conversations, and in the legacy media by measuring increased links,
    citations, mentions, and other media attention.
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "There are other organizations—NY Review of Books, London Review of Books, TLS, BookForum, Harpers, The Atlantic—that do work similar to ours, but they rarely attend to LA-based artists and writers, they have  older and less diverse contributors and readers, and all have a determined East Coast/Atlantic focus and bias. \r\n\r\nThere are local magazines like the new CARLA that focus on LA’s fine arts scene, or PEN USA’s Rattling Wall and Red Hen Press’s LA Review that focus on literature, but they do not have as broad an audience in the city as LARB does, or as much reach beyond LA.  LA Weekly, LA Magazine, and LA Times have all cut back their cultural coverage over the last decade in response to the digital disruption of print publishing and the resulting decline of advertising and subscription revenues. We see all these publications as complimentary rather than competitors, as we are all participants in the same cultural conversation, but we are the only serious LA cultural publication that has built a sizable national and international audience (a third of a million unique readers a month, more than BookForum, London Review of Books, or TLS, for instance) devoted to the full range of culture and the arts; LARB covers philosophy and film, comics and poetry, fiction and politics, painting and performance, science writing and TV. \r\n\r\nWhat is unique in our approach for this project is our deep penetration of all LA’s diverse artistic and literary cultures combined with our national and global reach—the size of our national and international audience of readers specifically interested in creative work, an audience that includes curators, publishers, agents, gallery owners and many others who have the power to enable artistic careers. \r\n\r\nWhat is also unique about LARB is our proven dedication to bringing new artists, writers, and commentators into the cultural conversation; we use many first-time critics and work with them closely to bring their work up to the highest professional standards, and have helped launch many journalistic careers. This project will help us do much more of that. We also hope that it will help us identify groups of critics and artists who we can help develop additional LARB Channels—affiliated websites with editorial autonomy like those we now publish (including Avidly, Marginalia, Voluble, The Offing) and those in development that represent LA’s Persian, Middle Eastern, North African, Asian, Latino, and other literary and artistic communities."
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "Our primary collaborators will include the many writers and critics of LA, established, emerging, and just getting started. Some of them will have written for us before, but many of them we will identify as part of this project. Many of these will be well established, some established in their own communities but not yet with access to national and international publications, and for some younger writers this might be their very first publication. The total number of these collaborators will be somewhat less than 365, since some may write for us (or conduct interviews, or make short films or podcasts) more than once. But there will be hundreds of new collaborators in any case. Each will receive payment for their work.\r\n\r\nWe also will collaborate with a number of existing organizations. We cooperate with PEN USA, with whom we share some board members, and with 826LA. We cooperate with LA Public Library and other area libraries, and will be reaching out to more branches. We work with UCR, UCLA, UCI, USC, CSULA, Emerson College LA, Loyola Marymount, and St. Mary’s College, and will be reaching out to more colleges and universities as part of this project. We have partnered with many local independent bookstores and art galleries and will continue to expand that network. We will be reaching out to community arts centers and other community centers throughout the city and county as part of this project to tap into artistic communities that we haven’t partnered with yet. We have partnered with LiveTalksLA and Literary Death Match and with local book publishers. We have worked with LA Magazine and Flaunt and the LA Times. We work with book festivals and reading series. We have worked with KCRW and are now broadcasting our half-hour radio show at KPFK and other Pacifica stations. We have partnered with filmmaker Kurt Olerud to produce a feature documentary on LA literature. All of these networks we will continue to grow.\r\n\r\nWe employ a number of graphic design and web design firms in LA, and we pointedly do all our printing in Los Angeles to support that infrastructure. Since everyone who works at LARB also has an artistic life, and since the grantwriters and development consultants we hire specialize in nonprofit arts work, I think that it is safe to say that except for our paper clips and rent and utility payments, 100% of our budget gets reinvested in the creative economy of LA. 100% of this grant will be."
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': "Our current FY budget is $750,000, and with the LA2050 grant that would expand to $850,000. The other $750,000 comes from board donations (45%), other individual donors and family foundations (15%), our membership program (15%), institutional and corporate underwriting and advertising sales (10%), grants (5%), events (5%), and other income (5%). We also rely on volunteer workers (our editor-in-chief, for instance, and many of our writers and editors volunteer their labor). Other serious magazines of literary and cultural commentary have budgets many times the size of ours—Harper’s receives a $4,000,000 grant each year from the MacArthur family, The New Republic has had a $3,000,000 grant each year, and nobody knows how many millions the Newhouse family gives to keep The New Yorker afloat above and beyond their subscription and advertising income. The New York Review of Books was established with help from several New York family fortunes and has a legacy advertising base estimated at some $10 million a year. \r\n\r\nLARB, which is and will always be free to all readers, is still at the seed money stage of its development, and every dollar we spend accomplishes three basic goals: (1) it helps promote the best our culture has to offer, (2) it helps support artists and writers, and (3) it helps broaden LARB’s reach and influence, which in turn expands our ability to attract advertising, grants, and individual members and donors. \r\n\r\nThis $100,000 grant will help us directly, in our coming year, and will help us indirectly by broadening our funding base for the future. This particular project, concentrating on LA artists and writers, is only part of what we consider our full responsibility in the service of world culture, but we could easily expand it to many times the size this grant will enable, and as our funding continues to grow (we are increasing at a rate of over 50% a year, and we will continue working hard to grow at a rate at least that magnitude), we can continue to do more in the service of LA culture, continue to help sustain and promote LA artists and writers, and continue helping make LA the best place in the world to create. The budget that follows details a total of $202,850 for this project, $100,000 from LA2050,and the rest from the sources outlined above."
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "The $100,000 will be used to help pay contributors, to pay the people (editors, AV staff, IT staff, social media marketing staff, support staff) who make the publishing of their work possible and help it effectively reach the largest possible audience, and to develop whatever new channels and platforms that might be required to present this work.\r\n\r\n(1)\tPaying contributors. We are guaranteeing a piece per day for a year by or about a Los Angeles artist or writer. 350 of these will be prose pieces. We will pay between $100 and $200 to each writer of those reviews or essays, or, in the case of interviews, to the interviewer. We will use $35,000 of the funding for this. An additional $17,500 will come from other LARB contributors.\r\n(2)\tPaying primary editors. With a combination of volunteer and paid labor, primary editing costs approximately $150 a piece; primary editors identify the work to be reviewed or artist to be interviewed, identify the critic or interviewer, and work with the contributor to ready the piece for publication. This accounts for $52,500 of the total budget.\r\n(3)\tPaying other staff. It costs us approximately $30 a piece to copyedit and fact check each piece with a combination of paid and volunteer labor, $60 a piece to post the piece, promote it on social media and to aggregation sites, and otherwise market the piece. This comes to $10,950 and $21,900.\r\n(4)\t35 of the pieces will be short films or podcasts, at an average cost of $1000; total: $35,000.\r\n(5)\tWe hope that developing these pieces will result in the creation of at least three new affiliate sites (for instance, an LA African Diaspora culture website, an LA Young Readers website) at the cost of $10,000 per website; total: $30,000\r\n\r\n\r\nContributors: \t\t$52,500\r\nEditorial: \t\t  52,500\r\nCopyedit: \t \t  10,950\r\nPost and promote: \t  21,900\r\nFilm and podcast:\t\t  35,000\r\nNew channels: \t\t  30,000\r\n\r\n\tTOTAL:                       \t$202,850\r\n \r\n$100,000 of these funds will come from LA2050, and $102,850 from our members, contributors, and other revenue streams.\r\n"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    We have become very aware, over our four years of operation, how every piece
    of work we publish helps leverage the next. We began LARB with nothing but a
    handful of volunteers and a single donor. That first year we still managed
    to publish 300 pieces, attract another couple dozen donors and a steadily
    growing number of readers. The next year we doubled the number of pieces,
    doubled our income, and doubled our readership again. We now publish 1500
    pieces a year and have a budget of $750,000. We are still ahead of
    ourselves—that is, we are still relying on volunteer labor, and still not
    paying enough to compete with the better-funded reviews. But by completing
    this project, we know that the increased coverage and increased visibility
    it will bring us will translate, once more, into increased readership and
    increased income. Each year we come closer to our goal of true
    sustainability, which necessarily includes better compensation for writers
    and editors. We understand this as a process of scalability, that every
    grant, every donation grows our ability to reach that goal. The knowledge
    that we are already outperforming well-established, well-funded outlets is
    extremely encouraging. And we are doing so while maintaining our commitment
    to full diversity, and maintaining our fundamental integrity as a collective
    of public service-minded people dedicated to the common good. That people
    are stepping up to support that is even more encouraging. This grant will
    help us grow, help LA’s creative class survive the disruption being
    experienced in so many creative industries, and help LA continue to
    establish itself as the most significant artistic and literary capital of
    this century. That is to say, we see our scalability completely entwined
    with LA’s—if we continue to grow, so will LA publishing; if LA’s new media
    companies continue to grow, so will we. Since we have active interns and
    volunteers from many area schools, and many from here and elsewhere have
    been through our summer training program, we are helping to build the
    editorial cadre of the future, away from the entrenched hierarchies of New
    York. As we help support the diversity of LA’s literary landscape, we help
    diversify the conversation nationally, as well. We believe that helping to
    make LA a great place to create helps the world become a better place, and
    that is why, finally, we do what we do.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  LA has a growing creative community in all the arts. Every week, a new
  publishing venture launches, a new theater space or new gallery opens, and
  every day many thousands of us work on a novel or screenplay or song, paint or
  sculpt, do new media arts, design a building, a dress, or a stage set, or
  begin filming. But not all of these projects find their audience, locally,
  nationally, or internationally, and not all can sustain careers over time. 
   
   What LARB can do is help build the audience base for LA’s creative activity, bring news and understanding and appreciation of these projects to our hundreds of thousands of readers across the country and elsewhere—10% of our readers are in CA, 60% in the rest of the country, and 30% overseas—and many are editors, critics, curators, and grantmakers around the globe. By helping create the local, national, and international audience for LA’s artists, we help them put food on their tables and enable their practice, help them pay the rent and create again. For writers and publishers to sell books, artists to sell work and performers tickets and recordings, they need to come to the attention of galleries, distributors, tastemakers, and the press. Reviews like LARB are an important part of that artistic ecology, especially here, since NY reviews have overwhelmingly focused on writers and artists from the East Coast. 
   
   LARB is one of the country’s most successful attempts to decentralize and diversify the artistic and literary conversation; we publish more diverse writers and review more diverse artists; and the more attention our LA artists receive, the more support they can receive, and the more sustainable their practice can be. In addition, since most of the people who do critical writing are themselves artists, in hiring them to write for us, we are helping to support each of them directly as well, in a small way, by paying them for their writing, writing that itself brings them to the attention of a global audience. If a sculptor carves a tree in the woods and no one sees it, her art has not fulfilled its promise; LARB’s soft power can foster and help sustain new arts establishments and creative industries, increase the visibility of women and minority artists, increase recruiting and retention rates for local higher education institutions, allow graduates to stay here rather than move to NY, and elevate the global influence of LA’s artistic achievements, making LA an even better place to create.

'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Our primary collaborators will include the many writers and critics of LA,
  established, emerging, and just getting started. Some of them will have
  written for us before, but many of them we will identify as part of this
  project. Many of these will be well established, some established in their own
  communities but not yet with access to national and international
  publications, and for some younger writers this might be their very first
  publication. The total number of these collaborators will be somewhat less
  than 365, since some may write for us (or conduct interviews, or make short
  films or podcasts) more than once. But there will be hundreds of new
  collaborators in any case. Each will receive payment for their work.
   
   We also will collaborate with a number of existing organizations. We cooperate with PEN USA, with whom we share some board members, and with 826LA. We cooperate with LA Public Library and other area libraries, and will be reaching out to more branches. We work with UCR, UCLA, UCI, USC, CSULA, Emerson College LA, Loyola Marymount, and St. Mary’s College, and will be reaching out to more colleges and universities as part of this project. We have partnered with many local independent bookstores and art galleries and will continue to expand that network. We will be reaching out to community arts centers and other community centers throughout the city and county as part of this project to tap into artistic communities that we haven’t partnered with yet. We have partnered with LiveTalksLA and Literary Death Match and with local book publishers. We have worked with LA Magazine and Flaunt and the LA Times. We work with book festivals and reading series. We have worked with KCRW and are now broadcasting our half-hour radio show at KPFK and other Pacifica stations. We have partnered with filmmaker Kurt Olerud to produce a feature documentary on LA literature. All of these networks we will continue to grow.
   
   We employ a number of graphic design and web design firms in LA, and we pointedly do all our printing in Los Angeles to support that infrastructure. Since everyone who works at LARB also has an artistic life, and since the grantwriters and development consultants we hire specialize in nonprofit arts work, I think that it is safe to say that except for our paper clips and rent and utility payments, 100% of our budget gets reinvested in the creative economy of LA. 100% of this grant will be.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  Our current FY budget is $750,000, and with the LA2050 grant that would expand
  to $850,000. The other $750,000 comes from board donations (45%), other
  individual donors and family foundations (15%), our membership program (15%),
  institutional and corporate underwriting and advertising sales (10%), grants
  (5%), events (5%), and other income (5%). We also rely on volunteer workers
  (our editor-in-chief, for instance, and many of our writers and editors
  volunteer their labor). Other serious magazines of literary and cultural
  commentary have budgets many times the size of ours—Harper’s receives a
  $4,000,000 grant each year from the MacArthur family, The New Republic has had
  a $3,000,000 grant each year, and nobody knows how many millions the Newhouse
  family gives to keep The New Yorker afloat above and beyond their subscription
  and advertising income. The New York Review of Books was established with help
  from several New York family fortunes and has a legacy advertising base
  estimated at some $10 million a year. 
   
   LARB, which is and will always be free to all readers, is still at the seed money stage of its development, and every dollar we spend accomplishes three basic goals: (1) it helps promote the best our culture has to offer, (2) it helps support artists and writers, and (3) it helps broaden LARB’s reach and influence, which in turn expands our ability to attract advertising, grants, and individual members and donors. 
   
   This $100,000 grant will help us directly, in our coming year, and will help us indirectly by broadening our funding base for the future. This particular project, concentrating on LA artists and writers, is only part of what we consider our full responsibility in the service of world culture, but we could easily expand it to many times the size this grant will enable, and as our funding continues to grow (we are increasing at a rate of over 50% a year, and we will continue working hard to grow at a rate at least that magnitude), we can continue to do more in the service of LA culture, continue to help sustain and promote LA artists and writers, and continue helping make LA the best place in the world to create. The budget that follows details a total of $202,850 for this project, $100,000 from LA2050,and the rest from the sources outlined above.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
  The $100,000 will be used to help pay contributors, to pay the people
  (editors, AV staff, IT staff, social media marketing staff, support staff) who
  make the publishing of their work possible and help it effectively reach the
  largest possible audience, and to develop whatever new channels and platforms
  that might be required to present this work.
   
   (1) Paying contributors. We are guaranteeing a piece per day for a year by or about a Los Angeles artist or writer. 350 of these will be prose pieces. We will pay between $100 and $200 to each writer of those reviews or essays, or, in the case of interviews, to the interviewer. We will use $35,000 of the funding for this. An additional $17,500 will come from other LARB contributors.
   (2) Paying primary editors. With a combination of volunteer and paid labor, primary editing costs approximately $150 a piece; primary editors identify the work to be reviewed or artist to be interviewed, identify the critic or interviewer, and work with the contributor to ready the piece for publication. This accounts for $52,500 of the total budget.
   (3) Paying other staff. It costs us approximately $30 a piece to copyedit and fact check each piece with a combination of paid and volunteer labor, $60 a piece to post the piece, promote it on social media and to aggregation sites, and otherwise market the piece. This comes to $10,950 and $21,900.
   (4) 35 of the pieces will be short films or podcasts, at an average cost of $1000; total: $35,000.
   (5) We hope that developing these pieces will result in the creation of at least three new affiliate sites (for instance, an LA African Diaspora culture website, an LA Young Readers website) at the cost of $10,000 per website; total: $30,000

How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  We have become very aware, over our four years of operation, how every piece
  of work we publish helps leverage the next. We began LARB with nothing but a
  handful of volunteers and a single donor. That first year we still managed to
  publish 300 pieces, attract another couple dozen donors and a steadily growing
  number of readers. The next year we doubled the number of pieces, doubled our
  income, and doubled our readership again. We now publish 1500 pieces a year
  and have a budget of $750,000. We are still ahead of ourselves—that is, we are
  still relying on volunteer labor, and still not paying enough to compete with
  the better-funded reviews. But by completing this project, we know that the
  increased coverage and increased visibility it will bring us will translate,
  once more, into increased readership and increased income. Each year we come
  closer to our goal of true sustainability, which necessarily includes better
  compensation for writers and editors. We understand this as a process of
  scalability, that every grant, every donation grows our ability to reach that
  goal. The knowledge that we are already outperforming well-established,
  well-funded outlets is extremely encouraging. And we are doing so while
  maintaining our commitment to full diversity, and maintaining our fundamental
  integrity as a collective of public service-minded people dedicated to the
  common good. That people are stepping up to support that is even more
  encouraging. This grant will help us grow, help LA’s creative class survive
  the disruption being experienced in so many creative industries, and help LA
  continue to establish itself as the most significant artistic and literary
  capital of this century. That is to say, we see our scalability completely
  entwined with LA’s—if we continue to grow, so will LA publishing; if LA’s new
  media companies continue to grow, so will we. Since we have active interns and
  volunteers from many area schools, and many from here and elsewhere have been
  through our summer training program, we are helping to build the editorial
  cadre of the future, away from the entrenched hierarchies of New York. As we
  help support the diversity of LA’s literary landscape, we help diversify the
  conversation nationally, as well. We believe that helping to make LA a great
  place to create helps the world become a better place, and that is why,
  finally, we do what we do.
