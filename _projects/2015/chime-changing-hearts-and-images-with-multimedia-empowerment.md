  CHIME levels the playing field by ensuring that students excel as productive
  world citizens through a futuristic oriented program characterized by dynamic
  academic curriculum, excellence in teaching/learning & the optimal use of
  technology. We foster a positive environment for students to discover and
  express their creative voice by bringing the imagination of young minds to
  life through media. CHIME also emphasizes lifelong learning through our
  benchmark ACT (Attitude, Commitment, Teamwork).

Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to play.: "St. Augustine made a strong case for “Image.”  He said, “We are all created in the ‘Imago Dei,’ Image of God.” The image of under-served and underprivileged communities is basically demonic.  These mostly negative images promote poor self-esteem, lack of self worth and little motivation to achieve. CHIME’s Multimedia Multiplied Program is designed to flip the script by training, equipping and empowering youth living within these communities to create their own images. \r\n\r\nCHIME is the tool, which will create an Economic ripple effect and forge the youth accessibility to skills and opportunities not readily available to them – tools that will render an outlet creating jobs and career opportunities.  Even beyond employment, we hope to provide students with the knowledge and skills to start their own companies and be their own boss!\r\n\r\nCHIME, a Multimedia Multiplied Program, initially began seven years ago with two K-8 schools within Los Angeles Unified School District. It did not, at the time, receive much support – teaching such complicated technology and technique to 3rd, 4th, 5th graders, even kindergarteners, did not seem plausible to most. The after school Program succeeded – students are thriving, learning and growing – and it is now offered in over 146 schools in LAUSD. The films they are creating cover a wide range of subject matters – bullying, the environment the latest news, etc. Additionally, Heart and Soul works with troubled teenagers; and, through this Program, they learn new skills, and find a productive and alternative outlet for their voice. A constructive and encouraging atmosphere combined with proper training and guidance will render an environment conducive to young minds discovering their potential and voice.\r\n\r\nCHIME has been implemented in Detroit, MI – a strong city who is fighting (and winning) to rebuild itself. We collaborated with The Multicultural Youth Leadership Event (MYLE) to train their staff and youth in multimedia equipment and technology. MYLE is part of a larger group, The ELCA Youth Gathering, and their event in 2015 will be 40,000 youths strong. The team we built was an integral part of filming and interviewing this event!\r\n\r\nLos Angeles is a multicultural haven; and CHIME will bridge the gap between the distinct cultures to create a conduit in which youth, from ten diverse parts of LA, can learn from and connect with each other – as a result, create, work, play and live together."
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "At the end of Program, there will be a culmination event, in which the completed work of all students will be shared with parents, peers, educators and community. In addition their work will be featured on local media, Heart & Soul’s website, social media and You Tube. Each student will also take home a copy of the work they’ve created.\r\n\r\nEveryone – staff, board, teachers, parents & students – will evaluate the CHIUME in addition to reaping the rewards. We will promote the Program by broadcasting on local media (cable access), the internet and other outlets. New positive images… New stories told… New economic and educational empowerment. The results will be captured on video, audio recorded, & print, writing and photography.\r\n\r\nThe students will gain a new understanding of themselves and each other and will be more conscientious leaders of tomorrow, thus benefiting their community and our City. We can compare what we have done in multimedia for the under-served to any organization in US."
