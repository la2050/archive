  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to play.: "St. Augustine made a strong case for “Image.”  He said, “We are all created in the ‘Imago Dei,’ Image of God.” The image of under-served and underprivileged communities is basically demonic.  These mostly negative images promote poor self-esteem, lack of self worth and little motivation to achieve. CHIME’s Multimedia Multiplied Program is designed to flip the script by training, equipping and empowering youth living within these communities to create their own images. \r\n\r\nCHIME is the tool, which will create an Economic ripple effect and forge the youth accessibility to skills and opportunities not readily available to them – tools that will render an outlet creating jobs and career opportunities.  Even beyond employment, we hope to provide students with the knowledge and skills to start their own companies and be their own boss!\r\n\r\nCHIME, a Multimedia Multiplied Program, initially began seven years ago with two K-8 schools within Los Angeles Unified School District. It did not, at the time, receive much support – teaching such complicated technology and technique to 3rd, 4th, 5th graders, even kindergarteners, did not seem plausible to most. The after school Program succeeded – students are thriving, learning and growing – and it is now offered in over 146 schools in LAUSD. The films they are creating cover a wide range of subject matters – bullying, the environment the latest news, etc. Additionally, Heart and Soul works with troubled teenagers; and, through this Program, they learn new skills, and find a productive and alternative outlet for their voice. A constructive and encouraging atmosphere combined with proper training and guidance will render an environment conducive to young minds discovering their potential and voice.\r\n\r\nCHIME has been implemented in Detroit, MI – a strong city who is fighting (and winning) to rebuild itself. We collaborated with The Multicultural Youth Leadership Event (MYLE) to train their staff and youth in multimedia equipment and technology. MYLE is part of a larger group, The ELCA Youth Gathering, and their event in 2015 will be 40,000 youths strong. The team we built was an integral part of filming and interviewing this event!\r\n\r\nLos Angeles is a multicultural haven; and CHIME will bridge the gap between the distinct cultures to create a conduit in which youth, from ten diverse parts of LA, can learn from and connect with each other – as a result, create, work, play and live together."

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "Los Angeles is a world famous city know for its golden coast, fair climate, Beverly Hills, Hollywood and the city in which dreams come true. But the reality is opportunities are not evenly and fairly offered to everyone equally. The image of under-served communities, as perpetrated by the media, is mostly negative focusing on poverty, crimes and gangs. CHIME is specifically designed to tackle these images. Everybody – the media, politicians, educators and pundits – seems to have an opinion. We at Heart & Soul Design Communications Center have an opinion as well – the youth have a voice and it needs to be heard.\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest challenges of our society is stereotyping. A child, a youth, should not be labeled and their opportunities should not be hindered to live up or down to a stereotype. The leaders of tomorrow must learn to live, understand, work and play together now. There is no better method to attain tolerance than to interact and work together."
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "At the end of Program, there will be a culmination event, in which the completed work of all students will be shared with parents, peers, educators and community. In addition their work will be featured on local media, Heart & Soul’s website, social media and You Tube. Each student will also take home a copy of the work they’ve created.\r\n\r\nEveryone – staff, board, teachers, parents & students – will evaluate the CHIUME in addition to reaping the rewards. We will promote the Program by broadcasting on local media (cable access), the internet and other outlets. New positive images… New stories told… New economic and educational empowerment. The results will be captured on video, audio recorded, & print, writing and photography.\r\n\r\nThe students will gain a new understanding of themselves and each other and will be more conscientious leaders of tomorrow, thus benefiting their community and our City. We can compare what we have done in multimedia for the under-served to any organization in US."
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "Although there are other organizations which provide multimedia training for youth, their program is either not affordable for students in under-served communities and/or it is not as thorough and cohesive as Heart and Soul’s CHIME Program.\r\n\r\nHAS has over 35 years experience working with youth, including collaborating with and providing Los Angeles Unified School District (through their Youth Development Program), Inglewood Unified School District multimedia programs and technology, UCLA, USC, Children’s Defense Fund, etc. Earlier this year, CHIME was successfully implemented in Detroit – a diverse and distinct city with a rich history – a city that has faced and continues to face challenges. Heart & Soul coaches have built studios from Los Angeles, CA to Brooklyn, NY.\r\n\r\nThe 21st Century is a rapidly growing technology based society. Students of today who will become citizens of tomorrow will need to be technologically literate to successfully enter the information age. Our multimedia staff teaches the latest multimedia technology tools through lessons and hands-on experience. Students learn a variety of communication methods from qualified instructors who work in the media industry, offering each pupil the opportunity to work with a professional mentor. The instructors for each multimedia program teach students how to develop their creative writing, presentation & storytelling skills; to visualize and execute their creative concepts; and develop appropriate work ethic in a team dynamic. But, our most valuable lesson is ACT – Attitude, Commitment and Teamwork.  This benchmark is the foundation of our program.  If students can learn to ACT right, they will be successful in any field they choose in life.\r\n\r\nHeart and Soul’s intent is to inspire constructive conversation among local teens throughout the city. The Canadian philosopher Marshall McLuhan’s revolutionary insights changed the way everyone thought about media, technology and communications. McLuhan’s phrase “global village” highlighted his observation that an electronic nervous system (the media) was integrating the planet. Heart & Soul believes that the voices of youth in underprivileged and under-served communities are not part of this global community due to lack of funding and available technology. We want to rectify this problem and bring the youth in our community into the 21st century technology. Our uniquely innovative program is designed to empower, position and give wings to the youth."
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "Heart and Soul has decades of experience working and collaborating with schools, non-profit organizations and communities at large.\r\n\r\nIf chosen, we will select a total of ten K through 8th grade schools – one school in each of the following areas: Compton, Lynwood, Gardena, Inglewood, Hawthorne, El Segundo, Venice, Lennox, Carson and Long Beach. CHIME After School Program will take place at each school, from 3 to 6 pm, twelve weeks per semester (total of twenty-four weeks). Twenty students, per school, can participate. They will be required to work on projects individually, collectively as a school and, through distance learning, with students at other schools. The goal of working with the students in other schools directly is to create opportunities for them to interact with and learn from each other. Periodically, they will work on their group projects from our studio space in Inglewood.\r\n\r\nThere are no prerequisites, but each youth needs to make a commitment to the Program and be enrolled in one of the selected schools. Furthermore, the principal and one teacher from each school will be involved as well. Lastly, we will involve the parents of each student. In short, we will collaborate with the community!\r\n\r\nThe young people in this program will come from all sections of life, especially under-served communities. Every young person has a need to feel included, needed, productive and valued, in order to feel life is worthwhile – the more diverse, the better!"
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    Heart and Soul has extensive knowledge of and experience in creating and
    implementing after school programs. The CHIME Program, as proposed and
    outlined above, will cost $100,000.
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "CHIME Project Budget:\r\n\r\n$12,000 – Director\r\n$  6,000 – Teacher\r\n$  6,000 – Teacher\r\n$  6,000 – Teacher\r\n$  4,000 – Mentor\r\n$  4,000 – Mentor\r\n$  4,000 – Mentor\r\n$  8,000 – Consultant & Professional Fees\r\n$  6,000 – Insurance\r\n$  1,200 – Travel/Field Trip\r\n$24,000 – Equipment\r\n$  6,000 – Software\r\n$  3,000 – Supplies\r\n$  1,400 – Printing & Copying\r\n$     880 – Telephone\r\n$     520 – Postage & Delivery\r\n$  7,000 – Facility & Utilities\r\n\r\n$100,000\tTOTAL"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    The culmination event at the end of CHIME will showcase the success of our
    students before the community – the success will be evident by the student’s
    work individually and collectively through interaction and collaboration
    with other youths in the program. The success will be determined by the
    community – students, parents, school representatives and the public. We
    have seen the success of this Program and are confident it will grow on its
    own merit.
