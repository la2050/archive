project_summary: >-
  We seek to establish a solar-powered water conservation and urban vertical
  community farm pilot project and job training program at Union Church in
  downtown Little Tokyo.  In partnership with LA Urban Farms, we will install 20
  vertical garden tower planters at Union Church.  We will also train job-ready,
  former Skidrow residents of Union Rescue Missions’ Job Development Program and
  Little Tokyo residents in the maintenance of the tower gardens and in growing
  profitable herbs and vegetables. 
Please specify below: >-
  Union Church L.A. in Little Tokyo, 2 blocks from Skidrow; Central LA, LA

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  As water and land are limited by the drought and increasing urban density, it
  has become difficult to find access to both healthy, sustainable, and
  affordable organic food and green spaces. Such access benefits the
  physiological and psychological well-being of our communities. Recognizing the
  benefits of community urban farms, our plan is to work within dense urban
  spaces to establish solar-powered, sustainable, community-based urban farms
  using a new water-wise conservation strategy in downtown Los Angeles without
  having to invest in real estate. We thus work with the urban environment as it
  presents itself to us. 
   
   The Tower Garden System is soil-less and uses 90% less water compared to soil based farming through its vertical aeroponic design. Plants thrive with purified pH controlled water and micro nutrients, providing a “beyond organic” farming technique. In partnership with LA Urban Farms, Union Church L.A., and Union Rescue Mission, GIVE plans to install twenty vertical tower planters on the South side of Union Church (see layout), located two blocks from Skid Row. 
   
   In an effort to help homeless individuals secure needed jobs and provide fulfilling and healthy physical activities for seniors living in Little Tokyo, GIVE will train local seniors and job-ready former Skidrow residents through Union Rescue Missions’ Job Development Program in the maintenance and care of the Tower Gardens. While the project is focused on outreaching to former Skidrow residents and seniors, the program and space will be open to all Little Tokyo residents to benefit community life and health of the whole neighborhood. 
   
   In the first year, the sustainable, organic food grown will be donated to Union Rescue Mission and other homeless shelters, as well as the students and their families who grew them. The long-term goal is to train and develop an urban farmers market network where urban farmers will be able to receive micro-loans to start their own businesses, and sell their produce at local farmers markets and to restaurants.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  One of the major barriers we expect is a lack of awareness and interest in
  farming in urban spaces, as well as the appeal of eating plant based meals as
  a way of health and wellness. To counter this challenge while our site is
  being prepared for the garden towers, our GIVE team and volunteers will focus
  on outreach and education in the neighborhood by hosting a harvest festival,
  passing out flyers and talking to neighbors, and hosting workshops for our
  neighborhood on the benefits of a plant-based diet and a urban community farm.
  Further, our six-week long trainings will include education on nutrition,
  health, and wellness.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We will evaluate the success of our program based on how many urban farmers we
  graduate from our 6-week course and how many students are able to secure jobs
  after they graduate.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Our partner, the LA Urban Farms (www.laurbanfarms.com) program is promoting
  urban farms in schools, restaurants, and homes. Our unique goal is to bring
  this creative, sustainable farming practice to urban communities who have
  little or no access to green and growing spaces to provide urban residents
  access to urban farming and low-cost, fresh, organic produce. Furthermore, we
  will expand our program to include training in the growing and maintenance of
  Tower Gardens, outreaching in particular to job-ready, former Skid Row
  residents. Finally, our long-term goal is to create a local urban farmers’
  market network to encourage sustainable farming in urban spaces.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Union Church LA will be providing the farm/garden space, offices,
  administrative support, classroom space, and an immediate volunteer base. The
  outdoor farm space will be an in-kind donation. Union Church will be
  compensated for the office space, administrative support, classroom space, and
  garden supervision for $18,000. LA Urban Farms will be compensated for the 4
  6-week trainings at $500/training, with a total cost of $2,000.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': 'The first year, first phase of our project is projected to be $100,000.'

How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  This proposal is a pilot program to establish a sustainable urban community
  farm in downtown Los Angeles. We hope to start new urban community farms in
  other neighborhoods of Los Angeles and provide job training to other
  interested community members. Further, we plan on creating a local farmers
  market network in Los Angeles where urban farmers will be able to start their
  own businesses selling their produce and receive micro-loans to start their
  farms. Finally, other cities have also expressed interest in our pilot program
  and are looking to collaborate and build on our program.

    answer: "As water and land are limited by the drought and increasing urban density, it has become difficult to find access to both healthy, sustainable, and affordable organic food and green spaces.  Such access benefits the physiological and psychological well-being of our communities.  Recognizing the benefits of community urban farms, our plan is to work within dense urban spaces to establish solar-powered, sustainable, community-based urban farms using a new water-wise conservation strategy in downtown Los Angeles without having to invest in real estate.  We thus work with the urban environment as it presents itself to us.  \r\n\r\nThe Tower Garden System is soil-less and uses 90% less water compared to soil based farming through its vertical aeroponic design.  Plants thrive with purified pH controlled water and micro nutrients, providing a “beyond organic” farming technique.  In partnership with LA Urban Farms, Union Church L.A., and Union Rescue Mission, GIVE plans to install twenty vertical tower planters on the South side of Union Church (see layout), located two blocks from Skid Row.  \r\n\r\nIn an effort to help homeless individuals secure needed jobs and provide fulfilling and healthy physical activities for seniors living in Little Tokyo, GIVE will train local seniors and job-ready former Skidrow residents through Union Rescue Missions’ Job Development Program in the maintenance and care of the Tower Gardens.  While the project is focused on outreaching to former Skidrow residents and seniors, the program and space will be open to all Little Tokyo residents to benefit community life and health of the whole neighborhood.  \r\n\r\nIn the first year, the sustainable, organic food grown will be donated to Union Rescue Mission and other homeless shelters, as well as the students and their families who grew them.  The long-term goal is to train and develop an urban farmers market network where urban farmers will be able to receive micro-loans to start their own businesses, and sell their produce at local farmers markets and to restaurants."

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      One of the major barriers we expect is a lack of awareness and interest in
      farming in urban spaces, as well as the appeal of eating plant based meals
      as a way of health and wellness.  To counter this challenge while our site
      is being prepared for the garden towers, our GIVE team and volunteers will
      focus on outreach and education in the neighborhood by hosting a harvest
      festival, passing out flyers and talking to neighbors, and hosting
      workshops for our neighborhood on the benefits of a plant-based diet and a
      urban community farm.   Further, our six-week long trainings will include
      education on nutrition, health, and wellness. 
  - name: Please explain how you will evaluate your work.

      We will evaluate the success of our program based on how many urban
      farmers we graduate from our 6-week course and how many students are able
      to secure jobs after they graduate.

      Our partner, the LA Urban Farms (www.laurbanfarms.com) program is
      promoting urban farms in schools, restaurants, and homes.  Our unique goal
      is to bring this creative, sustainable farming practice to urban
      communities who have little or no access to green and growing spaces to
      provide urban residents access to urban farming and low-cost, fresh,
      organic produce.   Furthermore, we will expand our program to include
      training in the growing and maintenance of Tower Gardens, outreaching in
      particular to job-ready, former Skid Row residents.  Finally, our
      long-term goal is to create a local urban farmers’ market network to
      encourage sustainable farming in urban spaces.

      This proposal is a pilot program to establish a sustainable urban
      community farm in downtown Los Angeles.  We hope to start new urban
      community farms in other neighborhoods of Los Angeles and provide job
      training to other interested community members.  Further, we plan on
      creating a local farmers market network in Los Angeles where urban farmers
      will be able to start their own businesses selling their produce and
      receive micro-loans to start their farms.  Finally, other cities have also
      expressed interest in our pilot program and are looking to collaborate and
      build on our program.
