  'DESCRIBE IN GREATER DETAIL HOW YOU WILL MAKE LA THE HEALTHIEST PLACE TO LIVE: ': "WHY IT'S IMPORTANT: By 2030, roughly 1 billion more people will be living in cities (creating a Buenos Aires-sized city every 3 weeks for the next 15 years). With already strained roadways & population growth in our future, Los Angeles is looking at the very real PROBLEM of transporting even more people across our massive landscape.\r\n\r\nContinuing to look at mobility in LA from a car-centric view poses fiscal & human health costs. According to recent research, congestion’s cost has been estimated at 1.5 to 4% of GDP. Getting people from one part of a city to another efficiently & stress-free has monetary value. \r\n\r\nThere is also a real human health cost. California scientists recently linked chronic exposure to ultra-fine particles found in vehicle exhaust to deaths from heart disease. Individuals living & working within a 10 mile radius of major roadways were most at risk. So the cost of congested roadways isn't limited to our pocketbooks. \r\n\r\nThat being said, as LA's population grows, a truly \"healthy\" future for LA cannot entail building more and wider roadways. We have to take a very serious look at supplying our populace with safe alternative infrastructure to move around the city efficiently.\r\n\r\nATP's ANSWER: ATP has been working steadily since 2010 to educate  & motivate Angelenos to use their alternative travel infrastructure.  To date we have made 11 videos highlighting the enormous health, environmental & community benefits of an ATP lifestyle. We hosted a salon (In Her Shoes) to bring together municipal leadership, law enforcement & commuters to establish a dialogue on how to ensure safe, reliable travel for women. We launch biannual \"Commute CarFree\" initiatives in which individuals volunteer to travel CarFree & share their stories. We serve as a voice with municipal leadership & law enforcement on the need for SAFE & extended alternative travel infrastructure. We network celebrities with ATP related events & organizations to give a global voice to ATP's goals.\r\n\r\nAt ATP, we believe that LA is unique on the global stage because it has an unparalleled potential to effect the vision of what an ideal lifestyle could be. Our media, film & television tales reach even the most remote international villages. With the extraordinary amount of creative talent & financial power in this city, surely we can be at the forefront of what it means to transport Angelenos across our city; and by doing that, we would make LA as great as it has the potential to be."

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "The major challenge in effectively building ATP's vision is infrastructure. We see a future where, as LA grows (projected to grow by 1.7 mil in the next 5 yrs), pedestrian travel, cyclists, cars & public transit hold EQUAL value for those building infrastructure. An expanded, safe city-wide system depends on the approval of LA constituents & business owners. \r\n\r\nThe public & businesses have difficulty supporting infrastructure expansion when there is no statistical evidence that it would improve local lifestyles (financial & community safety). \r\n\r\nAt ATP we believe developing an app would be the key to overcoming this challenge. By creating a database that would provide numerical evidence of improved business & safety in areas that have extended ATP services, we would arm businesses & governments with the data necessary to comfortably justify building those facilities for the betterment of their economies, and for the health & happiness of their citizens. This data would be free."
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "An ATP App would do a majority of the work of self-evaluation. It would serve a few functions; however the ones that would most specifically assess whether ATP is making progress would be:\r\n\r\n1. A community forum (much like WAZE) that would give commuters a chance to highlight problematic spots (unsafe bike routes & hours, lack of connective infrastructure, etc.). We would compile the information & share it with developers & lawmakers in an effort to improve infrastructure.\r\n\r\n2. We would compare shifts in the number of ATP commuters on specific paths to changes in safety & business revenue on ATP thoroughfares. ATP believes there is a positive, direct correlation between ATP infrastructure & community safety and business profit. We would like to arm lawmakers with the statistics that would enable them to work towards a safe and welcoming alternative travel infrastructure for every Angeleno to use. \r\n"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    CicLAvia, LACBC, Metro, LADOT, EMA, FastLA are all examples of excellent
    organizations doing similar work. ATP's scope in comparison, however, is
    more comprehensive. Whereas the organizations listed focus either on
    quarterly ATP related events or on specific elements of ATP travel (for
    instance safety for cyclists), our organization looks at the transit of
    individuals by car-free means as a whole. At the Alternative Travel Project,
    we work toward and look forward to a future Los Angeles in which cyclists,
    pedestrians, public transit users & automobiles all hold EQUAL value for
    infrastructure developers & lawmakers.
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    There will be no partners on the proposed projects. All elements of the
    project will be produced in-house.
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': "In the next year at ATP, we believe our running costs will add up to about $200,000. We raised nearly $100,000 this year (our organization's first fundraiser) through an online auction & believe that a combination of donations, corporate partnerships, and merchandise sales will fulfill any additional costs in the upcoming year.\r\n"
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "$50,000- towards developing the ATP App                      TOT: $50,000\r\n\r\n$10,000 x 4- towards 4 ATP produced videos.                 TOT: $40,000\r\nA. The first one would be a video we would aim to distribute to driver-ed schools. It would emphasize the safety concerns drivers need to be aware of when sharing the road with ATP-ers. \r\nB. The second would be aimed at children commuting to school. This would give children key pointers on how to stay safe when walking, cycling or taking the public transit to school.\r\nC. The third video is focused on Health and ATP lifestyle.\r\nD. And finally the fourth video would be focused on New Tech & the incredible advancements offered for an ATP friendly lifestyle.\r\n\r\n$10,000- towards a Forum                                         TOT: $10,000\r\nbringing developers, engineering students & community leaders to brainstorm together & dialogue about the benefits of bringing ATP infrastructure into new development.\r\n\r\nFINAL TOTAL: $100,000"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    Truthfully, the success of our proposal comes down to locking in a grant.
    Falling short of that, our second tier (but no less meaningful) successes
    would be to educate people about the importance of the concepts proposed by
    ATP & to network with likeminded individuals.
