  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "An ATP App would do a majority of the work of self-evaluation. It would serve a few functions; however the ones that would most specifically assess whether ATP is making progress would be:\r\n\r\n1. A community forum (much like WAZE) that would give commuters a chance to highlight problematic spots (unsafe bike routes & hours, lack of connective infrastructure, etc.). We would compile the information & share it with developers & lawmakers in an effort to improve infrastructure.\r\n\r\n2. We would compare shifts in the number of ATP commuters on specific paths to changes in safety & business revenue on ATP thoroughfares. ATP believes there is a positive, direct correlation between ATP infrastructure & community safety and business profit. We would like to arm lawmakers with the statistics that would enable them to work towards a safe and welcoming alternative travel infrastructure for every Angeleno to use. \r\n"
