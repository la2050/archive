  LA Bioscience Hub, in collaboration with East Los Angeles College (ELAC), will
  create the Biotech Leaders Academy - a new program that introduces East LA’s
  bioscience students to the possibilities of becoming a biotech entrepreneur.
  We will place students into summer internships with LA biotech companies to
  give them valuable hands-on work experience. Students will also attend an
  entrepreneurship academy that introduces them to the opportunities and
  pathways of creating a biotech startup.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  LA Bioscience Hub (LABH) will help make LA the best place to create by
  fostering the next generation of diverse biotech entrepreneurs in our region. 
   
   Biotech is an industry of the future. It steadily expanded in LA County during the recession and continues to outpace many sectors in job growth today. Careers in the bioscience industry tend to pay family-supporting wages, providing an opportunity for low-income communities of color to enter the middle class. Given the sector’s strength in our region, LABH wants to ensure that this industry reflects the diversity and dynamism of Los Angeles. To help achieve this vision and make LA the best place to create, we are launching the Biotech Leaders Academy.
   
   The Biotech Leaders Academy has two key components: (1) an entrepreneurship academy and (2) providing students with paid internships at local biotech firms. 
   
   The entrepreneurship academy will expose students from diverse backgrounds to the spectrum of career pathways available to them after they’ve completed their education. Our academy will equip students with the tools they’ll need to begin a career in biotechnology and empower them to pursue entrepreneurial opportunities. Through the Biotech Leaders Academy, we will cultivate our region’s next generation of local bioscience company founders, CEOs, COOs, and CTOs. We’ll foster entrepreneurship through learning modules that cover a variety of topics, including tech transfer, moving research from the lab to commercialization, securing capital, and building a team for success. Students will meet local entrepreneurs and get connected to local resources to ensure their success here in LA. 
   
   The second component of the Biotech Leaders Academy is our summer internship placement program. LABH will connect students to paid industry internships that provide hands-on work experience in this competitive field. The internship component will be modeled after work study programs, with LABH and participating biotech companies funding student internships jointly. This will ensure meaningful industry engagement and enable a broad spectrum of firms – from first stage startups to major industry leaders – to participate. 
   
   The Biotech Leaders Academy will nurture and expand our region’s entrepreneurial and innovation economy. By creating opportunities for populations that are underrepresented in the biotech industry, we will develop a more inclusive local economy and we will help make LA the best place to create.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  We do not foresee any barriers to the successful implementation of Biotech
  Leaders Academy. However, we do anticipate the need to accommodate students’
  schedules, transportation access, and unique circumstances. We hope that by
  keeping all of our programming during normal business hours on weekdays,
  students will be able to fully participate in the program while still tending
  to outside commitments and responsibilities. To ensure that students are able
  to reach their internship sites and the entrepreneurship courses, we will work
  with students and employers to identify opportunities for work schedule
  adjustments, carpool, and public transit. 
   
   Another challenge we anticipate will be greater demand from students than what can be accommodated with the project budget. We will work to make the program available for as many students as possible without sacrificing quality of the curriculum, company placements, and level of compensation.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  Biotech Leaders Academy aims to 1) introduce students to biotech
  entrepreneurship and inspire them to start their own companies; 2) create
  meaningful, long-term partnerships between academic institutions and local
  biotech companies. 
   
   To measure our success based on the following:
   - Number of students participating in the program and number of student applicants
   - Students’ comfort with the basics skills and areas of entrepreneurship
   - Employer satisfaction with program
   - Percent of employers that are interested in providing internships for future cohorts
   - Percent of internship positions that are extended into the school year
   - Percent of interns that are invited for additional opportunities with their summer employer
   - Number of students who go on to pursue entrepreneurial endeavors
   
   We will the program's survey students, employers, and instructors before, during, and after the program. In addition, we will gather feedback through group and one-on-one discussions.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  While there are several entrepreneurship programs available for young adults,
  there are none that focus on the bioscience industry and target students of
  color. Biotech is a unique field in which to create a company and
  entrepreneurship in this industry looks very different from other sectors. Our
  program recognizes this and provides a specialized set of modules that address
  the industry-specific challenges and aim to inspire and prepare students to
  create companies that address some of our world’s most pressing health
  issues. 
   
   Our internship placement program is also unique in the perspective and opportunity it provides students. Currently our collaborator, the Mathematics, Engineering, and Science Achievement (MESA) program at East Los Angeles College (ELAC) places an average of 30 students into summer research internships with academic and research institutions across LA. These research internships provide exposure to bioscience in an academic setting. The key difference between MESA’s existing program and Biotech Leaders Academy is that our program will provide students the opportunity to intern and connect with the biotech industry where they can work on biopharmaceuticals, medical devices, and therapeutics in a start-up or entrepreneurial environment. Students are eager to have these opportunities and the industry has a growing interest in leveraging their funds to hire ELAC students for summer internships.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  LA Bioscience Hub’s key collaborator will be East Los Angeles College (ELAC).
  We will work closely with its Mathematics, Engineering, and Science
  Achievement (MESA) program. MESA is dedicated to increasing the number of
  students from disadvantaged communities that pursue and earn graduate degrees
  in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). Students in MESA are our
  target students for Biotech Leaders Academy. ELAC will receive approximately
  $11,000 for their role in implementing Biotech Leaders Academy and helping to
  make it a successful program. One of the key roles for ELAC will be MESA’s
  student recruitment and selection of students for our program. As part of this
  process, ELAC will prepare the selected students with two orientations and one
  session on ethics in research (Responsible Conduct of Research). At the end of
  the summer, ELAC will also host a poster-session style event, during which
  students can showcase the work and lessons they’ve learned during their
  summer. Lastly, ELAC will also be the site of the entrepreneurship classes
  that take place throughout the students’ summer.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': 'Biotech Leaders Academy can be launched and fully executed with $100,000.'
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-

How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: |-
  We intend to scale Biotech Leaders Academy in the following ways:
   - Establish stronger partnerships with academic institutions, particularly those with programs dedicated to increasing diversity in STEM, so that more students can connect with industry leaders and internships, and gain valuable biotech entrepreneurship skills. 
   
   - Since we will have an established curriculum for the entrepreneurship academy, we can provide it to colleges and universities that are interested in expanding the program to their campus. 
   
   - We will continue to grow our network of industry partners and foster stronger ties between the colleges and the private sector. Additionally, we will work with industry partners to create opportunities for longer-term internships.
   
   - We will create a more formal network of mentors that is comprised of industry leaders and professionals who host student interns, present during the entrepreneurship academy, or are generally interested in assisting students as they advance in their education.
   
   - Seek additional funding sources to support the internship match and course component.
