title: Engaging Parents to Reduce Truancy Rates
project_summary: >-
  Truancy is defined as a student being absent or tardy by more than 30 minutes
  without a valid excuse on 3 occasions in a school year, and we intend to
  reduce the truancy rate by 10% at our two charter schools that operate in Skid
  Row. We propose a three-pronged collaborative approach to addressing chronic
  absence and truancy: 1) changes in school attendance practices; 2) home
  visitation; and 3) parent engagement and leadership opportunities for our
  enrolled families.

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: "Para Los Niños works to close the achievement gap for children living in poverty through an educational approach that integrates high quality academics, family and mental health supports, and community engagement and leadership opportunities for parents. \r\n\r\nThe majority of children we serve are being raised by single mothers, grandparents or other family members, with an average annual income of $15-20K. The average truancy rate across our two charter schools located in the Skid Row community is 25%. 75% of the children are English language learners; over 90% are Hispanic, 9% are African American, and the rest consist of other ethnic minorities. 14% of families are linguistically isolated, nearly double the rate for Los Angeles County, and 50% of parents of our charter school students report middle school as their highest educational level attained.\r\n\r\nSchool attendance practices will provide parents access to school information on attendance behavior policies, and access to positive reinforcement for attendance behavior efforts. School policies will include: orientations for parents on school policies and expectations for student attendance and on-time arrival; contact people for parents to connect with when there are challenges getting their children to school; student rewards for improved attendance; and use of data to identify who is at risk of poor attendance and then working with the family to develop attendance plans for children missing too much school. \r\n\r\nHome visitation will provide schools access to additional information about a child’s home environment that may be impacting attendance. Home visitation will also help families access a trusted and supportive relationship with a school faculty member.  \r\n\r\nParent engagement opportunities will provide parents access to more accessible and practical spaces to get involved in their children’s education and to learn about the importance of regular school attendance and how truancy can negatively impact their children long-term. Parent leaders will be trained to facilitate peer groups where families share resources and information with one another.\r\n\r\nExpected outcomes for this proposed project will include not only reduced truancy rates at two charter schools in Skid Row, but also the development of a parent leadership network throughout East Los Angeles, South Los Angeles and other areas of Los Angeles where many of our families reside or access resources.

  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "1) School staff and school parents will complete a short questionnaire to inform development of an inventory of root causes of truancy at our schools.\r\n2) We will create action plans collaboratively with school and parent leaders to develop strategies that respond to the identified causes. \r\n3) Parents and school staff will fill out satisfaction questionnaires at the end of the school year, with questions focused on their respective experiences with rolling out and collaborating on the school truancy policies.\r\n4) Parents who receive home visitation will receive pre and post assessments around a series of areas related to family stability, supports from others, and senses of efficacy as parents. \r\n5) Parents in the engagement and leadership groups will complete pre- and post- surveys designed to measure knowledge, attitudinal, and behavioral growth around factors contributing to student truancy. \r\n6) Compare baseline truancy rates with rates after one year of implementing this program."

Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Our students’ parents have great difficulty accessing critically important
  services and experience stressors including unemployment; child abuse and
  neglect; domestic and community violence; food and housing instability; and
  isolation—all contributing to limited opportunities for academic and life
  success. We are committed to addressing those opportunity gaps, driven by the
  belief that education can be the vehicle for reducing inequality and promoting
  social mobility and justice, and challenging the notion that a child’s destiny
  is determined by his/her zip code. Given the already busy and stressful lives
  many of our families live, it is incumbent upon us to create a climate around
  attendance behaviors marked by school and home partnership, recognition that a
  child is part of a whole ecosystem that includes a family and community, and
  an attendance approach that is based on the principle of access.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  1) School staff and school parents will complete a short questionnaire to
  inform development of an inventory of root causes of truancy at our schools.
   2) We will create action plans collaboratively with school and parent leaders to develop strategies that respond to the identified causes. 
   3) Parents and school staff will fill out satisfaction questionnaires at the end of the school year, with questions focused on their respective experiences with rolling out and collaborating on the school truancy policies.
   4) Parents who receive home visitation will receive pre and post assessments around a series of areas related to family stability, supports from others, and senses of efficacy as parents. 
   5) Parents in the engagement and leadership groups will complete pre- and post- surveys designed to measure knowledge, attitudinal, and behavioral growth around factors contributing to student truancy. 
   6) Compare baseline truancy rates with rates after one year of implementing this program.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Schools across Los Angeles are supporting families to reduce truancy and
  improve attendance. Because of the unique needs of the families we serve, we
  propose an integrated service approach to reducing truancy. School staff and
  parents will work together to address the root causes of truancy and support
  families in need.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': Not applicable
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  This proposal will help us build a critical foundation to reducing truancy
  rates across all of our education sites. 
   Beyond our Para Los Ninos education sites, best practices of our approach can be shared with other schools in Los Angeles.
   
   Because Attorney General Kamala D. Harris has made truancy a priority issue since her time as San Francisco’s District Attorney, and the mandate to address pupil engagement is a key state priority that must be included in all Local Control Accountability Plans (LCAPs), we can share our best practices of this approach with schools outside of our Para Los Ninos education sites. The parent engagement and leadership networks that will be developed throughout the neighborhoods where our families live will facilitate broad communication of success stories that can be accessed at other schools in those communities.
