  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: "The Heart of Art Gallery has existed in South/Central LA for four years thanks to the passion and pocketbooks of founders Kenia Gutierrez and Bell Diaz, and donations by our artists. Our mission is to provide a safe space to create. We have seen thousands of artists create, show and perform in our space, yet we are the only space in our part of the city that allows this creativity. \r\n\r\nHeart of Art has exists independently, employing and engaging some of the most marginalized and talented artists in Los Angeles.  The majority of our artists are women and queer people of color, and our venue in South Central Los Angeles provides an oasis of support and opportunity for them to create, highlight their work and cultivate their skills. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this fall our gallery became a target of a series of anti-LGBTQ, anti-woman attacks and has been forced to close our doors for the time being. If anywhere in LA needs funding for art and greater opportunities to create in this city, it’s the threatened queer community of artists in South Central Los Angeles. \r\n \r\nOutside funding would allow us to relocate to a safe space, reopen our doors, and create an even bigger impact on the LA LGBTQIA community. \r\n\r\nOut of our 1 new physical location made possible by this grant, in 2016 we will execute 10 university visit events throughout So.CA, and hold at least 100 gallery community art events, featuring 1,000 NEW pieces of art, created by the over 10,000 women, youth & LGBTQIA artists of LA, all made possible by your generous grant funding of $100,000.\r\n\r\nWhile many galleries look for experience and resumes from a particular class of artists, Heart of Art hosts artists at every level. While art school can be expensive for many artists in our community, we provide a space for shared community learning and exchange of tools and skills. While many artists give up before they begin, we encourage them to keep trying. The testimonials you'll see in our video attest to how challenging it can be to not be able to afford art school or hanging fees, or simply to make art that no one seems to want to see. By inviting experienced, or first time artists to exhibit at a show, or perform, we give every artist a chance, a reason to stay and CREATE in LA, and a reason to keep going. \r\n\r\nWe know from experience that art saves lives, especially for the people in our community, who so often struggle with shame and silence related to mental illness and membership in the LGBTQIA community."

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "At the time of this proposal writing, we are only two days away from closing our Rodeo Rd location forever. On August 29th, at what would turn out to be our last event, our community was attacked. Two men arrived and began intimidating our attendees with homophobic and sexist slurs. Bell and Kenia (owner/founders of HOA), ushered all guests inside, called the LAPD and barricaded the doors. Unfortunately this incident, like others we have experienced, only underlines why a space like this needs to exist.\r\n\r\nWe anticipate this challenge will continue, as we intend to stay in the parts of LA where we are most needed. But our new location will provide our strategy for overcoming these obstacles; by reopening in a location with secure parking for vehicles and bikes, we can be sure that our attendees will be safe. Our risk reduction plan will be in place to create stronger security measures, and we hope to build relationships with local businesses to create a network of safety and support."
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Art is not easy to evaluate. As something that is famous for being subjective and whose quality is left up to the eye of the beholder, we propose a quantitative approach to evaluating our works in Los Angeles in 2016. As stated above, our approach will be to simply count the art: \r\n\r\n1 location, 10 college visits, 100 public events, 1000 new pieces of art made in LA, 10,000 artists encouraged, all from your $100,000.\r\n\r\nWe will keep a public calendar on our website tallying our events, our total artists reached, and new art made. Our incredible network of LA artists is ready for this challenge and our community grows every day with new attendees at events, people we meet through our campus outreach and people who find us through social media and our website. By asking them to participate in our challenge by helping to create 1,000 new individual art works, we will achieve a thriving community with a common purpose, to make LA the best place to create!"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "There really is no place like Heart of Art Gallery in the world, much less in Los Angeles. Although there are many independent galleries, boutiques and state funded LGBTQ organizations in  LA, none offer the specific combination of encouragement, inspiration, healing and creative power that Heart of Art has to offer.\r\n\r\nHeart of Art is something special. The following is a testimonial from one of our artists to this effect:\r\n\r\n\"As an un-art schooled artist trying to make it in LA, I know first hand how daunting it can be to try to find a place to show your work or to perform, and how this can be a difficult place to create.  After two years of sending out hundreds of resumes, applications, inquiries, cold calls and submissions, and receiving nothing positive or no response at all, my spirit was crushed. But one day a friend sent me an article about Heart of Art Gallery on a local LA blog, so I tentatively emailed Bell and Kenia and begged them for a meeting. To my great astonishment, they actually replied to my email, and even invited me to participate in their next show. It may seem trivial to be invited into a creative community, but to me, and to so many others, that invitation changed my life.\"\r\n\r\nHeart of Art is a unique gem of Yes in a landscape of No, and nothing compares to what they give to LA.\r\n\r\nHeart of Art Gallery is alone in what they do for LA. Heart of Art is more than just a gallery. A completely unfiltered, raw space for creatives to express. Heart of Art is a gallery one night, a drag show, the next morning, an art marketing workshop seminar that afternoon, a punk music hip hop venue for dinner, and a slam poetry reading room the next day. It is a place to create, a place to learn or take workshops in both artistic and in self defense skills. Heart of Art is an animal rescue program that seeks to comfort humans who have undergone traumatic and stressful life events with companionship. We are activists against the genocide of our sisters in Juarez, and for the advocacy of our trans siblings everywhere. Heart of Art is a place to confide and trust in others and find reassurance. We are a home for artists of all types, where people can dress and act as they feel most comfortable, without fear of censure. We are a place to create, freely and queerly, and for many in our community, we’re the only space they’ve ever had to feel free."
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    Heart of Art Gallery has no official partners or collaborators on this
    proposal, or in general. Although we are not adverse to working with another
    group, our organization is currently working alone. 100% of the grant
    winnings will be used by the Heart of Art Gallery in 2016 to further our
    mission to provide a safe place to create in LA.
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': "With a budget of $100,000, our proposal has crafted a detailed budget with 2 options for our new gallery location: options to either buy or rent a new home for the gallery. \r\n\r\nLocation Option A, our preferred option to purchase, is just above the winnings at $108,300. Option B, the option to lease, is slightly more conservative and will use exactly the amount of the grant winnings: $100,000. If it turns out that this grant is non-taxable, then Option A will be estimated at $98,000 and Option B estimated at $89,700.\r\n\r\nSince our gallery’s forced closure this September, we are starting over from scratch. Our gofundme campaign is working, and although we are extremely grateful to those who have donated, it seems unlikely we could reopen for long from the amount we have earned there. \r\n\r\nThis generous grant from the LA2050/Goldhirsh Foundation grant committee will provide the funds necessary to reopen at a new location, and we plan on stretching every penny to reach as many artists and make as much art as possible in Los Angeles in 2016, but in the long run, we hope use the funds you've given us to plant seeds that Angeleno Artists may reap for many years to come. \r\n\r\nLos Angeles is our home, and we would like to invest in our city by buying a small part of it. Due to our closure, we already have to find a new location, and this seems the perfect opportunity to turn a tragedy into a mitzvah. There are many commercial real estate options in  LA, with ample private parking, that are within our price range. \r\n\r\nThe options outlined in the budget proposal assume we purchase at $325,000 (Option A), or rent at $4,500 monthly (Option B). Option A is our preferred option. Option A assumes that If we can purchase with a 20% down payment of $65,000, expecting to make a monthly mortgage of $1,750, then the grant we will have received in 2016 will lay down the infrastructure we need to stay open for generations.  \r\n\r\nOur gallery has been operating since 2011 on the donations of artists and art supporters. All of our annual gallery budget goes toward our venue and its related costs. Events, workshops, college visits, and everything else happens through volunteerism in our community, and donations from events.  The small but supplemental income from events and donations will fund the deficit between our Grant and Option A, should Option A come to fruition.  We will continue to seek donations, so that we may spend our resources and time expanding our services to artists."
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Heart Of Art Gallery 2016 LA2050/GOOD Grant Budget:\r\n\r\nAll items are ESTIMATED.\r\n\r\nInitial Winning Fees: $10,300\r\n    Grant Tax at 10.3%:  $10,300\r\n\r\n2016 Business Fees: $3,000\r\n    Conversion from Profit to 501(c)3 Non-Profit: one time fee: $1,500 \r\n    2015 CA Taxes (conversion to non profit will significantly reduce this number in following years): $1,500 \r\n\r\nLocation:\r\n  Option A: Purchase: $95,000\r\n    20% Down Payment:  $65,000\r\n    Monthly $1,750 mortgage: $21,000\r\n    Insurance ($900 biannually): $1,800\r\n    Utilities (DWP/Wifi/ Security: $600 per month):  $7,200\r\n    Example property: 3575 South Jefferson, 90018  http://www.propertyshark.com/mason/Property/16270897/3575-S-Western-Ave-Los-Angeles-CA-90018/\r\n\r\n  Option B:  Lease: $86,700\r\n    Security Deposit/ First Month Move In Fees:  $9,000\r\n    Monthly $4,500 rent:  $54,000\r\n    Insurance ($900 biannually): $1,800\r\n    Utilities (DWP/Wifi/ Security: $600 per month):  $7,200\r\n    Land Improvements/Gallery Rebuild (occurring through the 12 month period):  $14,900\r\n    Example Property:  2020 South Western, 90018  http://www.loopnet.com/Listing/19356153/2020-S-Western-Ave-Los-Angeles-CA/\r\n\r\nOption A: Buy: total: $108,300\r\nOption B: Rent: total: $100,000"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "Our proposal will have a proven success record, given how much we have already done with almost nothing. We look forward to being able to provide our space and our services to the amazing artists of Heart Of Art Gallery. Scaling up will be easy once we have laid the infrastructure made possible by you, the 2016 grant committee.\r\n\r\nEvery year we have existed, we have grown in attendance and frequency of our programs by at least 10% (in some years 25%). This past year we hosted an event almost every other weekend with full attendance at our gallery. We expect to continue this trajectory of growth. \r\n\r\nIf we can budget for 100 creative events in 2016, we will plan for 150 in 2017. Over the next five years we plan to keep the gallery open 24/7 to always be there when our people need safety or a place to create, much like a student union at a university. We will continue to seek more artists until the day Heart of Art stops beating.\r\n\r\nAs part of our scaling model we also intend to seek funding from the television, film, streaming and advertising industries in LA.\r\n\r\nThe challenges to our success will always be the continued marginalization of women and LGBTQIA people in poor neighborhoods, but every year that passes in the US brings a few more freedoms and liberties to our communities that we didn't have before. Heart of Art Gallery can only scale up. We will continue to be activists and march for the causes of women and LGBTQIA people, and our success will be measured in direct relation to how the public treats and views us. It will never will be easy to be a creator in our community, but it will always be worth the effort.\r\n\r\nThank you so much for the opportunity to present ourselves to you, the grant committee. We are forever grateful to you for reading this and considering our submission.\r\n\r\nThank you and good luck to all LA2050 Create submitters!"

  The Heart of Art Gallery has existed in South/Central LA for four years thanks
  to the passion and pocketbooks of founders Kenia Gutierrez and Bell Diaz, and
  donations by our artists. Our mission is to provide a safe space to create. We
  have seen thousands of artists create, show and perform in our space, yet we
  are the only space in our part of the city that allows this creativity. 
   
   Heart of Art has exists independently, employing and engaging some of the most marginalized and talented artists in Los Angeles. The majority of our artists are women and queer people of color, and our venue in South Central Los Angeles provides an oasis of support and opportunity for them to create, highlight their work and cultivate their skills. 
   
   Unfortunately, this fall our gallery became a target of a series of anti-LGBTQ, anti-woman attacks and has been forced to close our doors for the time being. If anywhere in LA needs funding for art and greater opportunities to create in this city, it’s the threatened queer community of artists in South Central Los Angeles. 
    
   Outside funding would allow us to relocate to a safe space, reopen our doors, and create an even bigger impact on the LA LGBTQIA community. 
   
   Out of our 1 new physical location made possible by this grant, in 2016 we will execute 10 university visit events throughout So.CA, and hold at least 100 gallery community art events, featuring 1,000 NEW pieces of art, created by the over 10,000 women, youth & LGBTQIA artists of LA, all made possible by your generous grant funding of $100,000.
   
   While many galleries look for experience and resumes from a particular class of artists, Heart of Art hosts artists at every level. While art school can be expensive for many artists in our community, we provide a space for shared community learning and exchange of tools and skills. While many artists give up before they begin, we encourage them to keep trying. The testimonials you'll see in our video attest to how challenging it can be to not be able to afford art school or hanging fees, or simply to make art that no one seems to want to see. By inviting experienced, or first time artists to exhibit at a show, or perform, we give every artist a chance, a reason to stay and CREATE in LA, and a reason to keep going.

  group, our organization is currently working alone. 100% of the grant winnings
  will be used by the Heart of Art Gallery in 2016 to further our mission to
  provide a safe place to create in LA.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  With a budget of $100,000, our proposal has crafted a detailed budget with 2
  options for our new gallery location: options to either buy or rent a new home
  for the gallery. 
   
   Location Option A, our preferred option to purchase, is just above the winnings at $108,300. Option B, the option to lease, is slightly more conservative and will use exactly the amount of the grant winnings: $100,000. If it turns out that this grant is non-taxable, then Option A will be estimated at $98,000 and Option B estimated at $89,700.
   
   Since our gallery’s forced closure this September, we are starting over from scratch. Our gofundme campaign is working, and although we are extremely grateful to those who have donated, it seems unlikely we could reopen for long from the amount we have earned there. 
   
   This generous grant from the LA2050/Goldhirsh Foundation grant committee will provide the funds necessary to reopen at a new location, and we plan on stretching every penny to reach as many artists and make as much art as possible in Los Angeles in 2016, but in the long run, we hope use the funds you've given us to plant seeds that Angeleno Artists may reap for many years to come. 
   
   Los Angeles is our home, and we would like to invest in our city by buying a small part of it. Due to our closure, we already have to find a new location, and this seems the perfect opportunity to turn a tragedy into a mitzvah. There are many commercial real estate options in LA, with ample private parking, that are within our price range. 
   
   The options outlined in the budget proposal assume we purchase at $325,000 (Option A), or rent at $4,500 monthly (Option B). Option A is our preferred option. Option A assumes that If we can purchase with a 20% down payment of $65,000, expecting to make a monthly mortgage of $1,750, then the grant we will have received in 2016 will lay down the infrastructure we need to stay open for generations. 
   
   Our gallery has been operating since 2011 on the donations of artists and art supporters. All of our annual gallery budget goes toward our venue and its related costs. Events, workshops, college visits, and everything else happens through volunteerism in our community, and donations from events. The small but supplemental income from events and donations will fund the deficit between our Grant and Option A, should Option A come to fruition. We will continue to seek donations, so that we may spend our resources and time expanding our services to artists.

How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Our proposal will have a proven success record, given how much we have already
  done with almost nothing. We look forward to being able to provide our space
  and our services to the amazing artists of Heart Of Art Gallery. Scaling up
  will be easy once we have laid the infrastructure made possible by you, the
  2016 grant committee.
   
   Every year we have existed, we have grown in attendance and frequency of our programs by at least 10% (in some years 25%). This past year we hosted an event almost every other weekend with full attendance at our gallery. We expect to continue this trajectory of growth. 
   
   If we can budget for 100 creative events in 2016, we will plan for 150 in 2017. Over the next five years we plan to keep the gallery open 24/7 to always be there when our people need safety or a place to create, much like a student union at a university. We will continue to seek more artists until the day Heart of Art stops beating.
   
   As part of our scaling model we also intend to seek funding from the television, film, streaming and advertising industries in LA.
   
   The challenges to our success will always be the continued marginalization of women and LGBTQIA people in poor neighborhoods, but every year that passes in the US brings a few more freedoms and liberties to our communities that we didn't have before. Heart of Art Gallery can only scale up. We will continue to be activists and march for the causes of women and LGBTQIA people, and our success will be measured in direct relation to how the public treats and views us. It will never will be easy to be a creator in our community, but it will always be worth the effort.
   
   Thank you so much for the opportunity to present ourselves to you, the grant committee. We are forever grateful to you for reading this and considering our submission.
   
   Thank you and good luck to all LA2050 Create submitters!
