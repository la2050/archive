Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect.: "Los Angeles is a cultural hub for art, music, film, and technological advances. As the city begins to grow, and our lives become more digital, finding true community can be difficult, especially as an artist. \r\n\r\nWith an ever changing industry, musicians and artists alike are becoming more independently driven. The purpose of FEAL.LA is to provide a support network for musicians and creatives to flourish, while fostering community. \r\n\r\nAs we build our program, we will grow to understand what needs for independent artists, and the surrounding community are not being addressed, and how we can create a space that truly houses everything an artists needs to grow.\r\n\r\nMusic and art bring people together, and has the capacity to change lives. FEAL.LA works to give back to those who help us understand what it means to feel. \r\n"
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "FEAL.LA is entering into phase one of a larger vision. \r\n\r\nPHASE ONE: COMMUNITY\r\nPHASE TWO: PLATFORM\r\nPHASE THREE: CREATION\r\nPHASE FOUR: EDUCATION\r\n\r\nIn order to create a sanctuary, first you must find your people.\r\n\r\nIn Phase One, we will build our program from musicians, while pulling in the surrounding community through connection, both physically and digitally. With an already established network of artists, and industry leaders, we will activate experiences that harness collaboration, and build content to share with the world.\r\n\r\nWith this grant, we are able to rent a venue to prototype our vision. As well, as provide us the chance to build a digital platform for artists and the Los Angeles community to connect and grow. \r\n\r\nWe can track our progress based off of the following criteria:\r\n\r\nSpace activated\r\nWebsite creation\r\nTraffic both at events, and on our website\r\nEmail sign-ups through our website to participate in events\r\nGrowth of Social engagement via digital content\r\n\r\n"
