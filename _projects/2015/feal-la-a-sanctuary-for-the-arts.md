'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  Los Angeles is a cultural hub for art, music, film, and technological
  advances. As the city begins to grow, and our lives become more digital,
  finding true community can be difficult, especially as an artist. 
   
   With an ever changing industry, musicians and artists alike are becoming more independently driven. The purpose of FEAL.LA is to provide a support network for musicians and creatives to flourish, while fostering community. 
   
   As we build our program, we will grow to understand what needs for independent artists, and the surrounding community are not being addressed, and how we can create a space that truly houses everything an artists needs to grow.
   
   Music and art bring people together, and has the capacity to change lives. FEAL.LA works to give back to those who help us understand what it means to feel.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Everyday there is something new, and exciting popping up in Los Angeles, and
  everyday there is someone looking to grab our attention. 
   
   As we grow the FEAL.LA program, the major challenge we will see is the initial captivation of the our audience. How will we stand out?
   
   Our approach is personal; FEAL.LA only works when everyone involved benefits. So we thought we would start with small events, including intimate shows, to see how we can create evolving, unique experiences for Los Angeles.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: |-
  FEAL.LA is entering into phase one of a larger vision. 
   
   PHASE ONE: COMMUNITY
   PHASE TWO: PLATFORM
   PHASE THREE: CREATION
   PHASE FOUR: EDUCATION
   
   In order to create a sanctuary, first you must find your people.
   
   In Phase One, we will build our program from musicians, while pulling in the surrounding community through connection, both physically and digitally. With an already established network of artists, and industry leaders, we will activate experiences that harness collaboration, and build content to share with the world.
   
   With this grant, we are able to rent a venue to prototype our vision. As well, as provide us the chance to build a digital platform for artists and the Los Angeles community to connect and grow. 
   
   We can track our progress based off of the following criteria:
   
   Space activated
   Website creation
   Traffic both at events, and on our website
   Email sign-ups through our website to participate in events
   Growth of Social engagement via digital content
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Absolutely, in a way, every venue and recording studio is our competition. We
  see this as an opportunity. 
   
   As an artist embarks on the journey of creative expression, the support around them is vital to their success. FEAL.LA’s goal is to create an interconnected community of artists, businesses, and individuals who want to invest in the future of music. 
   
   Our unique one-stop-shop approach in this collaborative space, allows more freedom and support for the artist to grow, create, and share.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': |-
  As FEAL.LA grows, we invite many partners and collaborators to get involve. 
   
   At the moment, it’s just Jen Jones. She will receive $10,000 of the $100,000.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  For the PHASE ONE build out, the $100,000 will be cover any costs we need. If
  any additional costs come into play, that will personally be supported by our
  CEO, Jen Jones.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  ESTIMATED Projected Costs:
   
   $36,000-40,000- rent for space
   $10,000 - Stipend for staff
   $5,000 - build out of digital platform (website, designer costs, brand assets)

   $2,000 - interior design & office supplies
   $20,000 - equipment for studio and venue build out

How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Once we have nailed down our program, and built a comprehensive plan on what
  it truly is a musician needs in this city to thrive (PHASE TWO), we will begin
  PHASE THREE. 
   
   PHASE THREE is the acquisition of a 30,000 -40,000 sqft space, to create our one-stop-shop. A building that houses everything an artist needs to grow. 
   
   A venue
   Recording studios
   Rehearsal spaces
   Accommodation
   Office space
   
   As well as build out our membership program with the public. Providing a low monthly rate for the community to interact and engage with the artists we are working with.
