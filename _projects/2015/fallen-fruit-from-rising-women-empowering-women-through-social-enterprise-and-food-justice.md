  Fallen Fruit from Rising Women: Empowering women through social enterprise and
  food justice
project_summary: >-
  Picking local fruit that would otherwise go to waste, Crossroads residents and
  Claremont college students produce jams from seasonal fruit and use the
  profits to fund our larger food justice program. We would like to expand our
  program by establishing a co-op model and developing our pilot Social
  Entrepreneurs Academy into two concrete program for Crossroads graduates. The
  programs will help the women build business and financial literacy while
  offering economic opportunities for graduates.

  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Our main outcome is whether a woman completes the six-month program (and does not return to prison). Through Crossroads, we also measure success by monitoring specific benchmarks which include: length of time in our program, completion of program, discharge from parole, obtainment of employment, length of time maintaining employment, and lifestyle changes (new friends, interests, sobriety). We also pay close attention to other milestones which include a woman re-uniting with her family or continuing her education. \r\n\r\nWith the establishment of the co-op and Social Entrepreneurs Academy, we will measure success by the number of Crossroads graduates who choose to opt-in to the co-op, participate in the academy, and obtain outside job opportunities. We will also measure our success by evaluating the continued profitability of Fallen Fruit from Rising Women and its ability to sustain lucrative employment opportunities for co-op members. \r\n"
