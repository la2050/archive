  Fallen Fruit from Rising Women: Empowering women through social enterprise and
  food justice

project_summary: >-
  Picking local fruit that would otherwise go to waste, Crossroads residents and
  Claremont college students produce jams from seasonal fruit and use the
  profits to fund our larger food justice program. We would like to expand our
  program by establishing a co-op model and developing our pilot Social
  Entrepreneurs Academy into two concrete program for Crossroads graduates. The
  programs will help the women build business and financial literacy while
  offering economic opportunities for graduates.
