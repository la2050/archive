  'DESCRIBE IN GREATER DETAIL HOW YOU WILL MAKE LA THE HEALTHIEST PLACE TO LIVE: ': "The number of incarcerated women nationwide has increased almost 650% in the last 30 years; in California alone the women's prison population is almost double what the nationwide women's prison population was in 1970.\r\n\r\nOur project directly benefits the larger community of Los Angeles County by helping women who have been recently released from prison to become healthy and engaged citizens and discourage recidivism. Our collaborative program creates opportunities for Crossroads residents, and with this grant we will create opportunities for Crossroads program graduates.  \r\n\r\nSince 1974, Crossroads has been providing services to women in Los Angeles County recently released from prison. Their primary goal is to empower formerly incarcerated women by teaching new skills and to help them achieve economic self-sufficiency. Crossroads is run by women and for women. In addition, Scripps College is an all women’s college. Empowering women is a core part of the mission of Fallen Fruit from Rising Women. Formerly incarcerated women are a group of homeless women with significant and multi-layered needs. In terms of socioeconomic status, the women who come to Crossroads are generally destitute. In the past five years, almost all of Crossroads residents have served a life sentence. The average length of stay for residents who served a life sentence was 23.4 years. The six-month Residential Program through Crossroads serves about 34 formerly incarcerated women per year. Immediately upon release they are able to participate in Fallen Fruit from Rising Women programs which help the women build job and interpersonal skills. Crossroads graduates continue to work and live in Los Angeles County. Many are able to reunite with family and, as a result of our program, now have significant work experience (even those women who served over 20 years in prison.) With help from this grant, we will expand our services to include more support for the women who have graduated from the residential program. The primary goal of our enterprise is to provide opportunities for formerly incarcerated women. Our enterprise provides valuable job training, acclimates women to society outside of prison, and fosters entrepreneurial thinking. With the development of a co-op model and formal education in entrepreneurship, we are paving the way for those who have been incarcerated to find meaningful employment, create their own opportunities, and see themselves as agents of change.\r\n"
  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
    One challenge will be clearly defining a sustainable and just co-op model.
    Since we will be changing our business model, we will need to iron out the
    details of taking on employees and developing a payment structure. We will
    tackle this challenge by utilizing the resources of the Claremont Colleges.
    looking at other sustainable co-op models. Microfinance and entrepreneurship
    clubs have already expressed interest in working together to develop the
    enterprise.  Additionally, catapulting our production and sales through this
    funding will help us build capacity and enable us to continue to support the
    program with our revenue.
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "Our main outcome is whether a woman completes the six-month program (and does not return to prison). Through Crossroads, we also measure success by monitoring specific benchmarks which include: length of time in our program, completion of program, discharge from parole, obtainment of employment, length of time maintaining employment, and lifestyle changes (new friends, interests, sobriety). We also pay close attention to other milestones which include a woman re-uniting with her family or continuing her education. \r\n\r\nWith the establishment of the co-op and Social Entrepreneurs Academy, we will measure success by the number of Crossroads graduates who choose to opt-in to the co-op, participate in the academy, and obtain outside job opportunities. We will also measure our success by evaluating the continued profitability of Fallen Fruit from Rising Women and its ability to sustain lucrative employment opportunities for co-op members. \r\n"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "There are three organizations currently doing similar work in Los Angeles. \r\n\r\n•\tHomeboy Industries\r\n•\tLA Kitchen\r\n•\tFood Forward\r\n\r\nHomeboy Industries “serves high-risk, formerly gang-involved men and women with a continuum of free services and programs, and operates several social enterprises that serve as job-training sites.” Like Homeboy Industries, our program provide free services and programs for formerly incarcerated individuals and runs a social enterprise that serves as a job training site. However, Homeboy Industries does not provide housing for their participants. Working collaboratively to provide housing is a core part of our mission and one of the keys to our programs success and reduced recidivism rate. Our program focuses on formerly incarcerated women and is women-owned and managed. We have also integrated our program with a higher-education institution by bringing college interns into the social enterprise and making their participation a key component in connecting to the women and building relationships. Our program seeks to provide formerly incarcerated women with an opportunity for ownership and leadership in the enterprise, as well as connection to local students and the broader community. \r\n\r\nLA Kitchen “works directly with local farmers and produce wholesale companies to collect fruits and vegetables that are unsellable due to cosmetic issues or lack of commercial demand. All donated and purchased food will be transformed into healthy meals, snacks, and food products by volunteers, students, and staff at our health-code approved processing hub.” They work with emancipated foster youth and older adults transitioning out of incarceration. Like LA Kitchen, we use food that that would otherwise go to waste, though our fruit is freshly picked and donated from local backyards. Their collaboration between foster youth and older adults transitioning out of incarceration is similar to our collaboration between college students and Crossroads residents; however, we focus much more heavily on education.\r\n\r\nFood Forward “rescues fresh local produce that would otherwise go to waste, connecting this abundance with people in need, and inspiring other to do the same.” Like Food Forward, we rescue fresh local produce. However, we use the produce to develop our social enterprise rather than donate it to local food banks. Our program is also geared to the needs of formerly incarcerated women. "
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "Established in 2010, Fallen Fruit from Rising Women (FFFRW) is an existing collaboration between Crossroads and Scripps College. Crossroads has been collaborating with Scripps College in various capacities for over a decade. The FFFRW collaboration receives institutional support from Scripps College, which includes administrative and managerial support from a full-time staff position, as well as internship credit granted for the student interns.\r\n\r\nIn the past, Crossroads has collaborated with marketing students from the Drucker School of Management. We plan to deepen our collaboration with Drucker through the development of the Entrepreneurs Academy; however, a formal collaboration with Drucker has not yet been established. We have also collaborated with faculty from the Claremont Colleges. Dr. Nancy Neiman Auerbach teaches the Political Economy of Food course, where most of our students interns come from and serves as the creative director of FFFRW. In addition, Kim Drake, a Scripps English professor, taught writing workshops for the Crossroads residents and compiled their stories into a book published in 2013 called “Stinging for their Suppers.” The possibility of connecting with additional resources and accessing expertise from the Claremont College community is significant. \r\n\r\nIn addition, we have active partnerships with the local Claremont community. Community residents generously donate their fresh backyard fruit on a weekly basis to FFFRW to create our jams. We have also established relationships with the Prison Library Project and Uncommon Good.  \r\n\r\nThere are several factors critical to the continued success of these collaborations. First, continued support from Scripps College is key. The collaboration with Scripps College has been institutionalized and made a core part of the curriculum and educational mission of the college. In addition, we rely on community involvement and fruit donations for our jams. Finally, Crossroads has made FFFRW part of their comprehensive program and the core of their food justice initiative.  "
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': "Implementing our project this year will not need more than $100,000. We have outlined a detailed budget below. If additional funds are needed, the profits from our business can be used to cover these unexpected expenses. In the first year of our project, we expect costs to be greater, from establishment of the new components of the program. However, in future years our costs will be drastically reduced. Our co-op program will bring in additional revenue that will make any additional costs manageable. \r\n\r\nTwo of our large expenses are wages for participation in the co-op and transportation. Initially, we would like to provide hourly wages for Crossroads graduates to guarantee income for our participants.   In future years, we will switch to a sweat equity model by providing stipends for completion of the Entrepreneurs Academy and buy-in opportunities for partial co-op ownership. The grant will help us to build capacity and enable our business to be able to support co-op members through a sweat equity model in the future. \r\n\r\nTransportation is a needed expense that will improve our program drastically. Currently, program participants have no reliable method of transportation to get to the kitchen. By having a dedicated vehicle, we can ensure they will be able to participate in the program without having to take on the financial burden of renting Zipcars or other means of transportation, or the instability of public transportation. In addition, we have had to rely on the use of personal vehicles because it is difficult to transport large quantities of fruit and jam through other means. A large van would be a huge help with pickups and deliveries, of both produce and people. An investment in transportation will continue to serve the enterprise for years to come.\r\n "
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Educational Program (Social Entrepreneurs Academy) \r\nStipends for completion of Entrepreneurs Academy - $6,000\r\nHonoraria for instructors and workshop leaders - $6,000\r\nResource library and classroom materials - $2,000\r\nCo-op\r\n\tWages - $13,500\r\nKitchen Rental - $25,000\r\n\tKitchen equipment - $1,000\r\nTransportation, used van - $30,000\r\n\tGas - $2,500\r\n\tInsurance - $6,000 (is $500/month reasonable?)\r\nFood Storage space - $1,000\r\n\tShelving - $300\r\nPermitting and Farmer’s Market Costs – $2,400\r\nAdministrative \r\n\tPrinting and labeling - $1,000\r\n\tWebsite - $500\r\n\tWeb development labor/consulting - $2,000\r\n2 iPads for Business (to accept credit cards and keep track of accounting/financial information) -  $800\r\n\r\nTotal: $100,000\r\n"

  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "Much of the groundwork for our project is already in place. We have an established relationship at Scripps College and a history of successful collaborations with the Claremont College community. We already have student interns signed up for next semester (beginning in January). We also have the support of the Sustainable Entrepreneurship Fellow at Scripps College whose position is designed to help administer and manage the program. \r\n\r\nIn the next 12 months, we will build productive capacity as we grow the enterprise. Expanding production to a second day a week is easily doable with the help from this grant. We will involve both the Crossroads women and students in developing a sustainable and unique business plan that supports our goals of providing employment and career opportunities to formerly incarcerated women. We are in discussions with partners to permanently develop our pilot Social Entrepreneurs Academy and teach classes, and we have already negotiated for educational computer lab space. \r\n\r\nSince our proposed project is focused on Crossroads graduates, we will not be constrained by the demanding schedule of Crossroads residents. Residents are busy attending workshops, counseling, and AA meetings, and their ability to participate in the enterprise is limited by other necessary obligations. Graduates, on the other hand, have adjusted to life outside of prison and have greater time and mental energy to participate in the enterprise.\r\n\r\nWe would also like to include women from other organizations that focus on providing services to formerly incarcerated women, in terms of job training and interpersonal skills, just as Crossroads does. Connecting with additional service oriented organizations, similar to Crossroads will help us reach more women through the Fallen Fruit from Rising Women programs and lead to the creation of greater opportunities for women transitioning back to daily life after years of incarceration. The final phase of our program will reach even more women who have been formerly incarcerated across L.A. County."

    answer: "The number of incarcerated women nationwide has increased almost 650% in the last 30 years; in California alone the women's prison population is almost double what the nationwide women's prison population was in 1970.\r\n\r\nOur project directly benefits the larger community of Los Angeles County by helping women who have been recently released from prison to become healthy and engaged citizens and discourage recidivism. Our collaborative program creates opportunities for Crossroads residents, and with this grant we will create opportunities for Crossroads program graduates.  \r\n\r\nSince 1974, Crossroads has been providing services to women in Los Angeles County recently released from prison. Their primary goal is to empower formerly incarcerated women by teaching new skills and to help them achieve economic self-sufficiency. Crossroads is run by women and for women. In addition, Scripps College is an all women’s college. Empowering women is a core part of the mission of Fallen Fruit from Rising Women. Formerly incarcerated women are a group of homeless women with significant and multi-layered needs. In terms of socioeconomic status, the women who come to Crossroads are generally destitute. In the past five years, almost all of Crossroads residents have served a life sentence. The average length of stay for residents who served a life sentence was 23.4 years. The six-month Residential Program through Crossroads serves about 34 formerly incarcerated women per year. Immediately upon release they are able to participate in Fallen Fruit from Rising Women programs which help the women build job and interpersonal skills. Crossroads graduates continue to work and live in Los Angeles County. Many are able to reunite with family and, as a result of our program, now have significant work experience (even those women who served over 20 years in prison.) With help from this grant, we will expand our services to include more support for the women who have graduated from the residential program. The primary goal of our enterprise is to provide opportunities for formerly incarcerated women. Our enterprise provides valuable job training, acclimates women to society outside of prison, and fosters entrepreneurial thinking. With the development of a co-op model and formal education in entrepreneurship, we are paving the way for those who have been incarcerated to find meaningful employment, create their own opportunities, and see themselves as agents of change.\r\n"

      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      One challenge will be clearly defining a sustainable and just co-op model.
      Since we will be changing our business model, we will need to iron out the
      details of taking on employees and developing a payment structure. We will
      tackle this challenge by utilizing the resources of the Claremont
      Colleges. looking at other sustainable co-op models. Microfinance and
      entrepreneurship clubs have already expressed interest in working together
      to develop the enterprise.  Additionally, catapulting our production and
      sales through this funding will help us build capacity and enable us to
      continue to support the program with our revenue.
  - name: Please explain how you will evaluate your work.
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Our main outcome is whether a woman completes the six-month program (and does not return to prison). Through Crossroads, we also measure success by monitoring specific benchmarks which include: length of time in our program, completion of program, discharge from parole, obtainment of employment, length of time maintaining employment, and lifestyle changes (new friends, interests, sobriety). We also pay close attention to other milestones which include a woman re-uniting with her family or continuing her education. \r\n\r\nWith the establishment of the co-op and Social Entrepreneurs Academy, we will measure success by the number of Crossroads graduates who choose to opt-in to the co-op, participate in the academy, and obtain outside job opportunities. We will also measure our success by evaluating the continued profitability of Fallen Fruit from Rising Women and its ability to sustain lucrative employment opportunities for co-op members. \r\n"

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "There are three organizations currently doing similar work in Los Angeles. \r\n\r\n•\tHomeboy Industries\r\n•\tLA Kitchen\r\n•\tFood Forward\r\n\r\nHomeboy Industries “serves high-risk, formerly gang-involved men and women with a continuum of free services and programs, and operates several social enterprises that serve as job-training sites.” Like Homeboy Industries, our program provide free services and programs for formerly incarcerated individuals and runs a social enterprise that serves as a job training site. However, Homeboy Industries does not provide housing for their participants. Working collaboratively to provide housing is a core part of our mission and one of the keys to our programs success and reduced recidivism rate. Our program focuses on formerly incarcerated women and is women-owned and managed. We have also integrated our program with a higher-education institution by bringing college interns into the social enterprise and making their participation a key component in connecting to the women and building relationships. Our program seeks to provide formerly incarcerated women with an opportunity for ownership and leadership in the enterprise, as well as connection to local students and the broader community. \r\n\r\nLA Kitchen “works directly with local farmers and produce wholesale companies to collect fruits and vegetables that are unsellable due to cosmetic issues or lack of commercial demand. All donated and purchased food will be transformed into healthy meals, snacks, and food products by volunteers, students, and staff at our health-code approved processing hub.” They work with emancipated foster youth and older adults transitioning out of incarceration. Like LA Kitchen, we use food that that would otherwise go to waste, though our fruit is freshly picked and donated from local backyards. Their collaboration between foster youth and older adults transitioning out of incarceration is similar to our collaboration between college students and Crossroads residents; however, we focus much more heavily on education.\r\n\r\nFood Forward “rescues fresh local produce that would otherwise go to waste, connecting this abundance with people in need, and inspiring other to do the same.” Like Food Forward, we rescue fresh local produce. However, we use the produce to develop our social enterprise rather than donate it to local food banks. Our program is also geared to the needs of formerly incarcerated women. "

      Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on
      this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner
      receive?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Established in 2010, Fallen Fruit from Rising Women (FFFRW) is an existing collaboration between Crossroads and Scripps College. Crossroads has been collaborating with Scripps College in various capacities for over a decade. The FFFRW collaboration receives institutional support from Scripps College, which includes administrative and managerial support from a full-time staff position, as well as internship credit granted for the student interns.\r\n\r\nIn the past, Crossroads has collaborated with marketing students from the Drucker School of Management. We plan to deepen our collaboration with Drucker through the development of the Entrepreneurs Academy; however, a formal collaboration with Drucker has not yet been established. We have also collaborated with faculty from the Claremont Colleges. Dr. Nancy Neiman Auerbach teaches the Political Economy of Food course, where most of our students interns come from and serves as the creative director of FFFRW. In addition, Kim Drake, a Scripps English professor, taught writing workshops for the Crossroads residents and compiled their stories into a book published in 2013 called “Stinging for their Suppers.” The possibility of connecting with additional resources and accessing expertise from the Claremont College community is significant. \r\n\r\nIn addition, we have active partnerships with the local Claremont community. Community residents generously donate their fresh backyard fruit on a weekly basis to FFFRW to create our jams. We have also established relationships with the Prison Library Project and Uncommon Good.  \r\n\r\nThere are several factors critical to the continued success of these collaborations. First, continued support from Scripps College is key. The collaboration with Scripps College has been institutionalized and made a core part of the curriculum and educational mission of the college. In addition, we rely on community involvement and fruit donations for our jams. Finally, Crossroads has made FFFRW part of their comprehensive program and the core of their food justice initiative.

      How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you
      cover the additional costs?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Implementing our project this year will not need more than $100,000. We have outlined a detailed budget below. If additional funds are needed, the profits from our business can be used to cover these unexpected expenses. In the first year of our project, we expect costs to be greater, from establishment of the new components of the program. However, in future years our costs will be drastically reduced. Our co-op program will bring in additional revenue that will make any additional costs manageable. \r\n\r\nTwo of our large expenses are wages for participation in the co-op and transportation. Initially, we would like to provide hourly wages for Crossroads graduates to guarantee income for our participants.   In future years, we will switch to a sweat equity model by providing stipends for completion of the Entrepreneurs Academy and buy-in opportunities for partial co-op ownership. The grant will help us to build capacity and enable our business to be able to support co-op members through a sweat equity model in the future. \r\n\r\nTransportation is a needed expense that will improve our program drastically. Currently, program participants have no reliable method of transportation to get to the kitchen. By having a dedicated vehicle, we can ensure they will be able to participate in the program without having to take on the financial burden of renting Zipcars or other means of transportation, or the instability of public transportation. In addition, we have had to rely on the use of personal vehicles because it is difficult to transport large quantities of fruit and jam through other means. A large van would be a huge help with pickups and deliveries, of both produce and people. An investment in transportation will continue to serve the enterprise for years to come.\r\n "

    answer: "Much of the groundwork for our project is already in place. We have an established relationship at Scripps College and a history of successful collaborations with the Claremont College community. We already have student interns signed up for next semester (beginning in January). We also have the support of the Sustainable Entrepreneurship Fellow at Scripps College whose position is designed to help administer and manage the program. \r\n\r\nIn the next 12 months, we will build productive capacity as we grow the enterprise. Expanding production to a second day a week is easily doable with the help from this grant. We will involve both the Crossroads women and students in developing a sustainable and unique business plan that supports our goals of providing employment and career opportunities to formerly incarcerated women. We are in discussions with partners to permanently develop our pilot Social Entrepreneurs Academy and teach classes, and we have already negotiated for educational computer lab space. \r\n\r\nSince our proposed project is focused on Crossroads graduates, we will not be constrained by the demanding schedule of Crossroads residents. Residents are busy attending workshops, counseling, and AA meetings, and their ability to participate in the enterprise is limited by other necessary obligations. Graduates, on the other hand, have adjusted to life outside of prison and have greater time and mental energy to participate in the enterprise.\r\n\r\nWe would also like to include women from other organizations that focus on providing services to formerly incarcerated women, in terms of job training and interpersonal skills, just as Crossroads does. Connecting with additional service oriented organizations, similar to Crossroads will help us reach more women through the Fallen Fruit from Rising Women programs and lead to the creation of greater opportunities for women transitioning back to daily life after years of incarceration. The final phase of our program will reach even more women who have been formerly incarcerated across L.A. County."
