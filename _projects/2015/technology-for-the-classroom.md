  Redeemer Elementary is a small private Christian school located in West LA. To
  enhance student learning and better prepare children for today's tech-savvy
  society, we would like to implement technology in the classroom. We would LOVE
  to have SMART Boards or even something as simple as projectors in every
  classroom. Help us enhance student learning and make the future successful for
  students. Lets make LA the best place to LEARN!

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  At Redeemer Elementary we educate our students academically, socially and
  spiritually. We have passionate teachers who work hard to make learning
  applicable and enjoyable for our students. We believe that by implementing
  technology in the classroom we will not only enhance student learning but we
  will prepare students for the technological-advanced society we live in. Not
  only will technology enhance learning but it will boost student participation
  and will reach all types of learners. We want to grow and transform Redeemer
  into an elite Christian private school for ALL children in the LA area.
  Because Redeemer is a small, affordable, private school our funding is
  limited. With the help of this grant we can help students reach their full
  potential and obtain a successful future. What’s more important than the next
  generation of Los Angeles?
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  As a staff we will work together to ensure we are all educated and able to use
  SMART Boards in every lesson. 
   
   I don't think we will encounter any obstacles but will be over joyed if we receive this learning tool for our students.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We will keep accurate records of student performance after implementing the
  technology in the classroom. It will be interesting to see how student
  participation and test scores are affected from the use of technology.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Los Angeles has an over whelming number of elementary schools, the majority
  being public schools with technology already implemented in the classroom. Our
  situation is unique because we are a small, affordable, private, Christian
  school where funding is very limited. We have encouraged thousands of students
  from all walks of life and provided them with an excellent, fulfilling
  education. We would like to take our school to the next level by implementing
  the technology that so many other schools already have.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  This technology project will benefit the entire Redeemer staff and student
  population. The entire grant will go to Redeemer Elementary to help fund SMART
  Boards for a better education.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  There are a variety of types of SMART Boards ranging from $1,899.00-$9,908.00
  per board. We would purchase the cheaper boards for 9 different classrooms. If
  SMART Boards are unattainable for us to purchase we would purchase ELMO
  Projectors for each classroom. ELMO Projectors cost $719.00 per unit.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': >-
  SMART BOARDS: $9,908.00 per board (we could buy the cheaper ones as well) x 9
  (9 classrooms) = $89,172.00
   
   ELMO Projectors: $719.00 per unit x 9 = $6471.00
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: We plan to scale our success by student achievement and student data analysis.
