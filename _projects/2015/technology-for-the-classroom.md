  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: >-
    At Redeemer Elementary we educate our students academically, socially and
    spiritually. We have passionate teachers who work hard to make learning
    applicable and enjoyable for our students. We believe that by implementing
    technology in the classroom we will not only  enhance student learning but
    we will prepare students for the technological-advanced society we live in. 
    Not only will technology enhance learning but it will boost student
    participation and will reach all types of learners.  We want to grow and
    transform Redeemer into an elite Christian private school for ALL children
    in the LA area.  Because Redeemer is a small, affordable, private school our
    funding is limited.  With the help of this grant we can help students reach
    their full potential and obtain a successful future.  What’s more important
    than the next generation of Los Angeles?

Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  As a staff we will work together to ensure we are all educated and able to use
  SMART Boards in every lesson. 
   
   I don't think we will encounter any obstacles but will be over joyed if we receive this learning tool for our students.

Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Los Angeles has an over whelming number of elementary schools, the majority
  being public schools with technology already implemented in the classroom. Our
  situation is unique because we are a small, affordable, private, Christian
  school where funding is very limited. We have encouraged thousands of students
  from all walks of life and provided them with an excellent, fulfilling
  education. We would like to take our school to the next level by implementing
  the technology that so many other schools already have.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  This technology project will benefit the entire Redeemer staff and student
  population. The entire grant will go to Redeemer Elementary to help fund SMART
  Boards for a better education.
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: We plan to scale our success by student achievement and student data analysis.
