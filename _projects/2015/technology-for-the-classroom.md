Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: >-
  At Redeemer Elementary we educate our students academically, socially and
  spiritually. We have passionate teachers who work hard to make learning
  applicable and enjoyable for our students. We believe that by implementing
  technology in the classroom we will not only  enhance student learning but we
  will prepare students for the technological-advanced society we live in.  Not
  only will technology enhance learning but it will boost student participation
  and will reach all types of learners.  We want to grow and transform Redeemer
  into an elite Christian private school for ALL children in the LA area. 
  Because Redeemer is a small, affordable, private school our funding is
  limited.  With the help of this grant we can help students reach their full
  potential and obtain a successful future.  What’s more important than the next
  generation of Los Angeles?    
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  We will keep accurate records of student performance after implementing the
  technology in the classroom.  It will be interesting to see how student
  participation and test scores are affected from the use of technology.  
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
  - Money (financial capital)
  - 'Technical infrastructure (computers, etc.)'
