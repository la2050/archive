  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to learn.: >-
    At Redeemer Elementary we educate our students academically, socially and
    spiritually. We have passionate teachers who work hard to make learning
    applicable and enjoyable for our students. We believe that by implementing
    technology in the classroom we will not only  enhance student learning but
    we will prepare students for the technological-advanced society we live in. 
    Not only will technology enhance learning but it will boost student
    participation and will reach all types of learners.  We want to grow and
    transform Redeemer into an elite Christian private school for ALL children
    in the LA area.  Because Redeemer is a small, affordable, private school our
    funding is limited.  With the help of this grant we can help students reach
    their full potential and obtain a successful future.  What’s more important
    than the next generation of Los Angeles?

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate.

  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
    We will keep accurate records of student performance after implementing the
    technology in the classroom.  It will be interesting to see how student
    participation and test scores are affected from the use of technology.  
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
    Los Angeles has an over whelming number of elementary schools, the majority
    being public schools with technology already implemented in the classroom.
    Our situation is unique because we are a small, affordable, private,
    Christian school where funding is very limited.  We have encouraged
    thousands of students from all walks of life and provided them with an
    excellent, fulfilling education.  We would like to take our school to the
    next level by implementing the technology that so many other schools already
    have.  
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
    This technology project will benefit the entire Redeemer staff and student
    population.  The entire grant will go to Redeemer Elementary to help fund
    SMART Boards for a better education.
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
    There are a variety of types of SMART Boards ranging from
    $1,899.00-$9,908.00 per board.  We would purchase the cheaper boards for 9
    different classrooms.  If SMART Boards are unattainable for us to purchase
    we would purchase ELMO Projectors for each classroom.  ELMO Projectors cost
    $719.00 per unit.
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "SMART BOARDS: $9,908.00  per board (we could buy the cheaper ones as well) x 9 (9 classrooms) = $89,172.00\r\n\r\nELMO Projectors: $719.00 per unit x 9 = $6471.00 "
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
    We plan to scale our success by student achievement and student data
    analysis.
