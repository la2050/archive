  HFF is looking to test a pop-up theatre venue during the 2016 and 2017
  festivals to explore whether a temporary venue (1) provides the local
  community greater accessibility to the festival; (2) increases the
  participation of performers and producers from lower economic backgrounds by
  providing a subsidized cost for renting space; and (3) acts as a catalyst for
  additional theatrical spaces to grow in the community. 
Please specify below: >-
  One square mile in Hollywood. Borders are La Brea to the west, Western to the
  East, Franklin to the north, and Melrose to the south.

  HFF is looking to test a pop-up theatre venue during the 2016 and 2017
  Festivals to explore whether a temporary venue (1) provides the local
  community greater accessibility to the Festival; (2) increases the
  participation of performers and producers from lower economic backgrounds by
  providing a subsidized cost for renting space; and (3) acts as a catalyst for
  additional theatrical spaces to grow in the community.
   
   The pop-up venue will take currently abandoned space on Hollywood’s Theatre Row and turn it into a vibrant component of Hollywood’s theatrical ecosystem. Hollywood’s Theatre Row is on Santa Monica Boulevard between El Centro Avenue and McCadden Avenue. Having the pop-up venue in this location will help the area remain the theatrical hub for the Festival as some theatres in the area are closing their doors. 
   
   The venue will be managed by HFF and have dedicated show producers. This model will allow for a lower cost per performance to the artist, with preference given to those from underserved groups in the Hollywood community. The pop-up venue will also have high visibility on Theatre Row and in Festival communications, and will be promoted as a potential model that artists can adopt to showcase their art, whether in the Festival or elsewhere. In addition, HFF will publicly share its learnings and best practices of running the pop-up venue, giving artists and other potential pop-up managers a “how-to” guide if they wish to build a pop-up venue of their own.
   
   One of HFF’s goals is to increase its engagement with the local community, especially those from underserved ethnicities and those with lower incomes. Historically, HFF has had a broad array of individuals from different socioeconomic levels participate. Based on a survey of participants in the 2014 Festival, 23% of attendees made less than $25,000 a year and 50% made less than $50,000 a year. The age range of participants is also multi-generational, with 32% under the age of 35, 45% between the ages of 35 to 54, and 23% aged 55 or older.
   
   Moving forward, HFF wants to ensure that the underserved in the Hollywood community become an integral part of the Festival. HFF is already working toward this by leveraging its website and technology platform to provide scholarships and free/subsidized tickets for potential performers and audience members from underserved groups.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  One of the biggest challenges for the pop up venue project is securing a
  location on Theatre Row. At a time where many theatres have closed due to
  economics, landlords are trying to sell their properties for redevelopment for
  the highest possible price. In their eyes, renting out their space for one
  month could be an obstacle to sellnig their property.
   
   HFF has been collaborating with the Hollywood Media District BID for the past few years. The BID is compromised of 220 commercial property owners in the Hollywood area and one of the aims of their organization is to enhance the beautification and commercial desirability of the area. 
   
   In 2015, the two organizations worked together to put together a temporary 'parklet' in Hollywood. It was a successful endeavor and the HFF would use this relationship to locate and rent the best location for the pop up venue project.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  HFF will judge the pop-up venue project’s performance upon it meeting the
  following goals:
   
   (1) To create and manage a pop-up venue for the Hollywood Fringe that will support 25-30 shows at $100 per slot (over 200% lower than market rate) during the June 2016 and June 2017 Festivals
   
   (2) To provide 5-10 venue scholarships to performers or producers from underserved economic and/or ethnic groups 
   
   (3) To show through example how to create viable theatrical pop-up venues, with 1-3 additional pop-up spaces established by individual artists or producers during the June 2017 Fringe Festival
   
   (4) To share the findings and best practices on the Fringe website and with partner organizations, reaching an estimated audience of 20-25,000.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  While there are many theatre companies through out Los Angeles, there is no
  other organization that brings all of them together like the Hollywood Fringe
  Festival. During the month of June, thousands of artists converge on Theatre
  Row to take part in HFF. The sense of community within the performing arts
  that has been cultivated is unique to the city. 
   
   As Ben Moroski, a two time participant states: The Hollywood Fringe Festival creates a vibrant, uncensored space for a community of artists committed to ideals of the artistic process to come together, produced and share their work, try and fail in ways that are nearly impossible elsewhere. It is a breeding ground for new ideas, confident thought, young talent, fresh work, fearless expression. Whatever success I have in my artistic career going forward will always be due, in large part, to the start the Hollywood Fringe Festival gave me. I owe it and its staff a huge debt of gratitude for standing up for the arts, accepting me and the stories I have to tell, and creating a place where anything is possible, if you have the will and guts to put it on a stage.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  Personnel will account for roughly one third of the budget of the project. The
  key individuals will fill the following roles:
   
   Pop-up Producer: Book performers for slots on offer at venue. Will be seasoned Fringe producer with proven track record. Estimated budget: $10,000
   
   Pop-Up General Manager: Oversee selection, contracting, build-out and operation of venue, including locating and contracting space. Will also outfit venue with box office, front of house, seating, staging, lighting, sound, video systems, and provide oversight on operations of venue during installation, technical rehearsals and performances. Dave McKeever, HFF’s Producing Director, will fulfill this role. No budget needed. 
   
   Pop-Up Technical Director: Oversee technical aspects of venue during installation, rehearsal and performance. Will manage installation of seating, staging, lighting, sound and video systems. Will also oversee setup crews, provide training/assistance during technical rehearsals and oversee system operations during performances. Estimated budget: $5,000
   
   Pop-Up Front of House Manager: Run a customer-friendly operation, including box office, seating assistance, ushering, catering and sanitation. Estimated budget: $5,000
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  The popup venue project has been budgeted at $148,000. HFF is currently
  applying for grant funding to cover the additional costs. 
   
   Subsidized rent from the pop up venue should cover $10,000-$15,000 of the additional costs. Any other costs will be covered by the Hollywood Fringe organization's budget.

How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  As part of the proposal, HFF believes that a successful pop up venue in 2016
  will act as a catalyst for an additional 1-3 pop up venues to be established
  by artists or producers in 2017. 
   
   HFF will share findings and best practices with interested parties who wish to establish a pop up venue. Using these tools, producers and artists will be able to help lift up the dwindling theatrical spaces in the Hollywood area and revitalize the area.

    answer: "HFF is looking to test a pop-up theatre venue during the 2016 and 2017 Festivals to explore whether a temporary venue (1) provides the local community greater accessibility to the Festival; (2) increases the participation of performers and producers from lower economic backgrounds by providing a subsidized cost for renting space; and (3) acts as a catalyst for additional theatrical spaces to grow in the community.\r\n\r\nThe pop-up venue will take currently abandoned space on Hollywood’s Theatre Row and turn it into a vibrant component of Hollywood’s theatrical ecosystem.  Hollywood’s Theatre Row is on Santa Monica Boulevard between El Centro Avenue and McCadden Avenue.  Having the pop-up venue in this location will help the area remain the theatrical hub for the Festival as some theatres in the area are closing their doors.  \r\n\r\nThe venue will be managed by HFF and have dedicated show producers.  This model will allow for a lower cost per performance to the artist, with preference given to those from underserved groups in the Hollywood community.  The pop-up venue will also have high visibility on Theatre Row and in Festival communications, and will be promoted as a potential model that artists can adopt to showcase their art, whether in the Festival or elsewhere.  In addition, HFF will publicly share its learnings and best practices of running the pop-up venue, giving artists and other potential pop-up managers a “how-to” guide if they wish to build a pop-up venue of their own.\r\n\r\nOne of HFF’s goals is to increase its engagement with the local community, especially those from underserved ethnicities and those with lower incomes.   Historically, HFF has had a broad array of individuals from different socioeconomic levels participate. Based on a survey of participants in the 2014 Festival, 23% of attendees made less than $25,000 a year and 50% made less than $50,000 a year. The age range of participants is also multi-generational, with 32% under the age of 35, 45% between the ages of 35 to 54, and 23% aged 55 or older.\r\n\r\nMoving forward, HFF wants to ensure that the underserved in the Hollywood community become an integral part of the Festival.  HFF is already working toward this by leveraging its website and technology platform to provide scholarships and free/subsidized tickets for potential performers and audience members from underserved groups.  "
  - name: >-
      Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is
      your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "One of the biggest challenges for the pop up venue project is securing a location on Theatre Row.  At a time where many theatres have closed due to economics, landlords are trying to sell their properties for redevelopment for the highest possible price.  In their eyes, renting out their space for one month could be an obstacle to sellnig their property.\r\n\r\nHFF has been collaborating with the Hollywood Media District BID for the past few years.  The BID is compromised of 220 commercial property owners in the Hollywood area and one of the aims of their organization is to enhance the beautification and commercial desirability of the area.  \r\n\r\nIn 2015, the two organizations worked together to put together a temporary 'parklet' in Hollywood.  It was a successful endeavor and the HFF would use this relationship to locate and rent the best location for the pop up venue project."
  - name: Please explain how you will evaluate your work.
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "HFF will judge the pop-up venue project’s performance upon it meeting the following goals:\r\n\r\n(1) To create and manage a pop-up venue for the Hollywood Fringe that will support 25-30 shows at $100 per slot (over 200% lower than market rate) during the June 2016 and June 2017 Festivals\r\n\r\n(2) To provide 5-10 venue scholarships to performers or producers from underserved economic and/or ethnic groups \r\n\r\n(3) To show through example how to create viable theatrical pop-up venues, with 1-3 additional pop-up spaces established by individual artists or producers during the June 2017 Fringe Festival\r\n\r\n(4) To share the findings and best practices on the Fringe website and with partner organizations, reaching an estimated audience of 20-25,000.\r\n"

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "While there are many theatre companies through out Los Angeles, there is no other organization that brings all of them together like the Hollywood Fringe Festival. During the month of June, thousands of artists converge on Theatre Row to take part in HFF.  The sense of community within the performing arts that has been cultivated is unique to the city.  \r\n\r\nAs Ben Moroski, a two time participant states: The Hollywood Fringe Festival creates a vibrant, uncensored space for a community of artists committed to ideals of the artistic process to come together, produced and share their work, try and fail in ways that are nearly impossible elsewhere. It is a breeding ground for new ideas, confident thought, young talent, fresh work, fearless expression. Whatever success I have in my artistic career going forward will always be due, in large part, to the start the Hollywood Fringe Festival gave me. I owe it and its staff a huge debt of gratitude for standing up for the arts, accepting me and the stories I have to tell, and creating a place where anything is possible, if you have the will and guts to put it on a stage."

    answer: "The popup venue project has been budgeted at  $148,000. HFF is currently applying for grant funding to cover the additional costs.  \r\n\r\nSubsidized rent from the pop up venue should cover $10,000-$15,000 of the additional costs.
