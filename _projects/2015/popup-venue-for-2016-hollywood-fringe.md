title: Popup Venue for 2016 Hollywood Fringe
project_summary: >-
  HFF is looking to test a pop-up theatre venue during the 2016 and 2017
  festivals to explore whether a temporary venue (1) provides the local
  community greater accessibility to the festival; (2) increases the
  participation of performers and producers from lower economic backgrounds by
  providing a subsidized cost for renting space; and (3) acts as a catalyst for
  additional theatrical spaces to grow in the community.

  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: "HFF is looking to test a pop-up theatre venue during the 2016 and 2017 Festivals to explore whether a temporary venue (1) provides the local community greater accessibility to the Festival; (2) increases the participation of performers and producers from lower economic backgrounds by providing a subsidized cost for renting space; and (3) acts as a catalyst for additional theatrical spaces to grow in the community.\r\n\r\nThe pop-up venue will take currently abandoned space on Hollywood’s Theatre Row and turn it into a vibrant component of Hollywood’s theatrical ecosystem.  Hollywood’s Theatre Row is on Santa Monica Boulevard between El Centro Avenue and McCadden Avenue.  Having the pop-up venue in this location will help the area remain the theatrical hub for the Festival as some theatres in the area are closing their doors.  \r\n\r\nThe venue will be managed by HFF and have dedicated show producers.  This model will allow for a lower cost per performance to the artist, with preference given to those from underserved groups in the Hollywood community.  The pop-up venue will also have high visibility on Theatre Row and in Festival communications, and will be promoted as a potential model that artists can adopt to showcase their art, whether in the Festival or elsewhere.  In addition, HFF will publicly share its learnings and best practices of running the pop-up venue, giving artists and other potential pop-up managers a “how-to” guide if they wish to build a pop-up venue of their own.\r\n\r\nOne of HFF’s goals is to increase its engagement with the local community, especially those from underserved ethnicities and those with lower incomes.   Historically, HFF has had a broad array of individuals from different socioeconomic levels participate. Based on a survey of participants in the 2014 Festival, 23% of attendees made less than $25,000 a year and 50% made less than $50,000 a year. The age range of participants is also multi-generational, with 32% under the age of 35, 45% between the ages of 35 to 54, and 23% aged 55 or older.\r\n\r\nMoving forward, HFF wants to ensure that the underserved in the Hollywood community become an integral part of the Festival.  HFF is already working toward this by leveraging its website and technology platform to provide scholarships and free/subsidized tickets for potential performers and audience members from underserved groups.
