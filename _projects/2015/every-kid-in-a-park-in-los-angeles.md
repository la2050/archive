  Every Kid in a Park Los Angeles will provide transportation grants to local
  partners to bring at least 8,000 fourth-grade students from Los Angeles to
  nearby national parks. The project will focus particularly on underserved
  students from federally designated Title I schools. The initiative also
  includes pre- and post-visit educational opportunities. Providing greater
  access to parks and connecting diverse youth to new recreational and
  educational opportunities are major program goals.

'Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to connect:': >-
  The Every Kid in a Park Initiative in Los Angeles will make LA the best place
  to play by providing at least 8,000 fourth graders in Los Angeles with
  meaningful experiences in local national parks. The project will serve local
  students, particularly from federally designated Title I schools. These
  students are often the least likely to have an opportunity to visit national
  parks and benefit from their recreational resources on their own. We believe
  transportation grants are one of the best ways to ensure that underserved kids
  and their families can enjoy recreational and educational activities in our
  national parks.
Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: >-
  Our biggest challenge is likely to be the need for additional private
  philanthropic investment to ensure that transportation grants are available
  for all interested schools and youth service providers. Our strategy for
  overcoming this obstacle is to engage a broad base of investment from local
  foundations, individuals and corporations.
Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: >-
  The National Park Service uses formative and summative evaluation in its
  education and youth programs, and will adaptively manage Every Kid in a Park
  as the initiative gets under way. Every Kid in a Park in Los Angeles will
  benefit from broader evaluation conducted by the NPF and NPS. The evaluation
  strategy will:
   • Identify a baseline of our target audiences (youth, families, and teachers) perceptions, attitudes and use of NPS and its resources; those of overall park audiences; and those of the nation (looking at similar programs and resources for relevant lessons learned). 
   • Inform the decision-making processes of program managers and administrators regarding the development, implementation, adaptation and improvement of the program. 
   • Provide accountability and document the value and results of the program to stakeholders.
Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: >-
  Organizations doing complementary work include the other federal agencies
  collaborating through the Federal Interagency Council on Outdoor Recreation
  (FICOR) that are part of the larger implementation of the Every Kid in a Park
  Initiative. In addition to the National Park Service, the other FICOR agencies
  are the Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Reclamation, National Oceanic and
  Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
  and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
   
   Every Kid in a Park focuses on fourth graders because NPS and other land and water agencies already have fourth-grade programming in place in many locations. Fourth graders have only one teacher at that age, making it easier for teachers to reach the group. Research shows that the earlier a young person connects with the outdoors, the better for their development long term, and children who interact with nature and natural areas before age 11 are more likely to have positive attitudes toward nature and the environment as adults. By targeting fourth graders one year at a time, we will ensure that every child in the U.S. has the opportunity to visit and enjoy their public lands and waters by the time he or she is 11 years old. Research also shows that spending time outdoors is incredibly important to a child’s development, and national parks serve as some of our nation’s most beautiful places for outdoor recreation. They also provide dynamic classrooms and centers for active learning for all ages.
'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': >-
  NPS will build on existing partnerships with organizations across Los Angeles
  and Southern California. These include partnerships with NatureBridge,
  California State Parks, City of Los Angeles, Los Angeles County Parks and
  Recreation, Groundwork Los Angeles, Weingart East Los Angeles YMCA, Santa Ynez
  Band of Chumash, LA Conservation Corps, UCLA and the U.S. Forest Service.
   
   NPS is in an ideal position to expand its collaboration with these groups and others, and their existing strong relationship with the U.S. Forest Service will be particularly helpful in getting young people from East Los Angeles to the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument.
   Specific local partners to receive transportation grants from the National Park Foundation will self identify through the grant application process.
'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': >-
  The total project expenses are estimated at $350,000 in 2015-2016. The
  additional costs will be covered by additional fundraising from foundations,
  individual donors and corporations in Los Angeles. The National Park
  Foundation has secured $220,000 to date from foundations in Los Angeles.
'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': |-
  Experience grants to parks and partners ($10/kid x 8,500kids) = $85,000
   
   Program evaluation and management: $15,000
   
   Total: $100,000
How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: >-
  Every Kid in a Park in Los Angeles launches officially on Thursday, October
  15. The first year of the initiative, coinciding generally with the 2015-2016
  school year, will provide important lessons about what works best as we move
  into the second year of Every Kid in a Park during the 2016-2017 school year.
  We will scale up the initiative as we raise funds to provide additional
  transportation grants.

      available for all interested schools and youth service providers. Our
      strategy for overcoming this obstacle is to engage a broad base of
      investment from local foundations, individuals and corporations.
  - name: Please explain how you will evaluate your work.
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "The National Park Service uses formative and summative evaluation in its education and youth programs, and will adaptively manage Every Kid in a Park as the initiative gets under way. Every Kid in a Park in Los Angeles will benefit from broader evaluation conducted by the NPF and NPS. The evaluation strategy will:\r\n•\tIdentify a baseline of our target audiences (youth, families, and teachers) perceptions, attitudes and use of NPS and its resources; those of overall park audiences; and those of the nation (looking at similar programs and resources for relevant lessons learned). \r\n•\tInform the decision-making processes of program managers and administrators regarding the development, implementation, adaptation and improvement of the program. \r\n•\tProvide accountability and document the value and results of the program to stakeholders.\r\n"

      Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or
      competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Organizations doing complementary work include the other federal agencies collaborating through the Federal Interagency Council on Outdoor Recreation (FICOR) that are part of the larger implementation of the Every Kid in a Park Initiative. In addition to the National Park Service, the other FICOR agencies are the Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Reclamation, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\r\n\r\nEvery Kid in a Park focuses on fourth graders because NPS and other land and water agencies already have fourth-grade programming in place in many locations. Fourth graders have only one teacher at that age, making it easier for teachers to reach the group. Research shows that the earlier a young person connects with the outdoors, the better for their development long term, and children who interact with nature and natural areas before age 11 are more likely to have positive attitudes toward nature and the environment as adults. By targeting fourth graders one year at a time, we will ensure that every child in the U.S. has the opportunity to visit and enjoy their public lands and waters by the time he or she is 11 years old. Research also shows that spending time outdoors is incredibly important to a child’s development, and national parks serve as some of our nation’s most beautiful places for outdoor recreation. They also provide dynamic classrooms and centers for active learning for all ages. \r\n"

      Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on
      this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner
      receive?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "NPS will build on existing partnerships with organizations across Los Angeles and Southern California. These include partnerships with NatureBridge, California State Parks, City of Los Angeles, Los Angeles County Parks and Recreation, Groundwork Los Angeles, Weingart East Los Angeles YMCA, Santa Ynez Band of Chumash, LA Conservation Corps, UCLA and the U.S. Forest Service.\r\n\r\nNPS is in an ideal position to expand its collaboration with these groups and others, and their existing strong relationship with the U.S. Forest Service will be particularly helpful in getting young people from East Los Angeles to the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument.\r\nSpecific local partners to receive transportation grants from the National Park Foundation will self identify through the grant application process.\r\n"

      How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you
      cover the additional costs?
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      The total project expenses are estimated at $350,000 in 2015-2016. The
      additional costs will be covered by additional fundraising from
      foundations, individual donors and corporations in Los Angeles. The
      National Park Foundation has secured $220,000 to date from foundations in
      Los Angeles.

      Every Kid in a Park in Los Angeles launches officially on Thursday,
      October 15. The first year of the initiative, coinciding generally with
      the 2015-2016 school year, will provide important lessons about what works
      best as we move into the second year of Every Kid in a Park during the
      2016-2017 school year. We will scale up the initiative as we raise funds
      to provide additional transportation grants.
