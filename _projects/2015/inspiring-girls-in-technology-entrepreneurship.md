  Describe in greater detail how you will make LA the best place to create.: "Technovation gives girls the opportunity to create mobile apps to solve problems in their community. Through this program young girls will develop their technical and entrepreneurial skills while creating solutions for local communities. In creating local app solutions for local problems, young girls in LA can possibly discover the next big start-up idea. \r\n\r\ngirls get to create cool app ideas through Technovation in the following way:\r\nTeams of middle school and high school girls work together to complete an intensive, 50-hour curriculum. The girls are supported by a teacher (or after-school coordinator) and paired with a mentor who is a female tech professional. The curriculum is open, online and freely accessible to all. Through the program, the girls learn to:\r\n1. Identify a problem in their community: Girls work in teams and identify an idea for a mobile app that will help solve a problem in their community\r\n2. Program an app: Teams develop the actual app using a visual, block-based language called App Inventor (developed by MIT) that requires no prior knowledge of programming.\r\n3. Develop and deliver a pitch: Teams develop a business plan, videotape and submit their app and demo pitches for review.\r\nTen finalist teams are then be chosen and flown out to Silicon Valley to pitch their apps and business plans to potential investors. The winning teams are awarded $20,000 in seed funding to take their app to market.\r\n\r\nThe program will kick-off with a Girls make App Day workshop where all teams will meet with their mentors and attend a workshop focussed on the app Inventor platform. All local teams will have the opportunity to present their app ideas at the Regional Pitch event. the winning team will also have the opportunity to visit San Francisco for the World Pitch event, event if they are not selected in the top 10. \r\n"

  Please list at least one major barrier/challenge you anticipate. What is your strategy for overcoming these obstacles?: "We anticipate two major challenges for this program. We aim to reach to the under-served sections of the community. Convincing parents and students from this community to register for the program may be challenging. We hope to overcome this challenge by involving students from previous Technovation seasons as our spokespersons to share their personal experiences. We hope that personal stories from the same demographic group will inspire the girls to the value of this opportunity.\r\nWe also anticipate the possibility of not finding adequate number of mentors to guide local teams. Since our program is global and many are mentored visually, we hope to connect local teams with mentors from across U.S. and other countries through our platform. "
  Please explain how you will evaluate your work.: "All participants, mentors, teachers and students, are required to submit pre and post-program surveys. Results from these surveys help identify the learning goals of the girls and assess impact of the program on these goals.\r\nAnecdotal evidence gathered through case studies will also help to measure impact. \r\n"
  Are there other organizations doing similar work (whether complementary or competitive)? What is unique about your proposed approach?: "Given the low number of women in tech careers, there are many program focused on programming education to youth. We see organizations working with youth, such as Girls Scouts, Peace Corps, UN Women and UNESCO, as our distribution partners. We work with these organizations to offer Technovation as a potential youth program for their members/target audience. Technovation is the only GLOBAL program for GIRLS that combines problem solving with technical and entrepreneurial skills in one program. \r\nTechnovation is unique in the following ways:\r\n1. It combines technology and entrepreneurship. Our curriculum encourages girls to identify a problem in their community and create an app to solve it. So the girls directly identify and define the problem they are working on. Through our curriculum, girls develop problem solving, public speaking and other essential life skills.\r\n2. The mentoring component allows the girls to connect with role models and develop lifelong relationships. \r\n3. Technovation mentors themselves gain job-related skills of mobile app development, entrepreneurship and leadership.\r\n"
  'Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project. How much of the $100,000 grant award will each partner receive?': "Iridescent aims to work with local schools and organizations to identify the high needs students. A Technovation Regional Ambassador will work with local schools on student outreach. The Regional Ambassador will recruit schools teachers as Technovation coaches, who will help to facilitate team sessions. Professionals from local companies are expected to volunteer time to mentor the girls and walk them through the Technovation curriculum. \r\n\r\nIridescent’s curriculum is free and open, we do not anticipate huge costs in implementing the program. The Regional ambassador will receive a monthly stipend for managing the program on the ground. Teachers and mentors are expected to volunteer their time.  \r\n"
  'How much do you think this will cost? If more than $100,000 – how will you cover the additional costs?': '$100,000'
  'Please include a detailed budget of how you will use $100,000 to implement this project.': "Technovation Budget:\r\n\r\nLA studio space - $25,000\r\nTechnovation Staff time - $15,000\r\nWebsite and platform - $8,000\r\nPR and outreach - $2,000\r\nRegional ambassador stipend - $100,00\r\nEvents- Girls Make app Day and Regional pitch event - $5,000\r\nPrizes for local winners - $7,000\r\nTravel for regional winners to World Pitch event  - $15,000\r\nAdmin costs - $13,000\r\nTotal - $100,000\r\n"
  How do you plan to scale the success of your proposal?: "Technovation is in the process of scaling up. We had app submissions from across 30 plus countries in 2015. For the 2016 season, we are hoping to expand to new countries and scale in existing ones. This grant will allow us to offer the program to more girls in LA area. We will have the resources to support the girls through a Regional Ambassador and largely local mentors, thereby improving the quality of the program.\r\nTechnovation model is easy to replicate and scale. With an online curriculum and option of in-person or virtual mentoring, teachers or students in any part of the world can create teams and participate in the competition.\r\nFor the 2017 cycle, we hope to recruit the participants from the 2016 cycle as student ambassadors to help with outreach and support for future teams. \r\nWe recently launched a platform to involve Technovation Alumnae in scaling the program. SprEdTech, created by Amrita Venkatraman, a Technovation alumnae, is an initiative to encourage girls (grade 6 to grade 12) to develop an early interest in technology. Technovation alumnae are encouraged to become ambassadors through SprEdTech and spread the word about using coding and technology to create innovative products. Ambassadors will recruit and mentor future Technovation teams, lead technology workshops, and much more! \r\n"
