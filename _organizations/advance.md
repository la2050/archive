  ADVANCE is still in its idea stages; however, as mentioned, we have been
  selected as a semi-finalist for the Echoing Green Fellowship, which would fund
  our organization for the next two years. In addition, one of the
  organization's founders has seen how her work as a lawyer and social
  entrepreneur implementing a law firm model identical to ADVANCE's has made
  positive and lasting changes to low and moderate income people navigating the
  justice system in L.A. But her experience has been met with challenges when
  trying to address the needs of a large population. This led her to see
  potential in creating a training program so legal professionals like her can
  help people the law is meant to serve.
