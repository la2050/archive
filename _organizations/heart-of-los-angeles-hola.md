  HOLA’s recent achievements include:
   
   
   
   
   
   - In the last academic year, 324 students participated in intensive art classes in a multi-level class structure that built and advanced with each session. Each quarter, HOLA offered the community 33 free visual art classes and 37 hours of professional art instruction.
   
   
   
   
   
   - HOLA’s Visual Arts students attended 19 field trips to museums, art institutions, art studios and more. HOLA also welcomed a diverse group of more than 36 visiting artists to its campus.
   
   
   
   
   
   - The first year of the Public Art Project culminated in a community-wide event in MacArthur park that brought together more than 2,000 community members.
   
   
   
   
   
   - In 2011, the completely renovated Lafayette Park Community Center reopened, an expansion that helped HOLA significantly increase the number of students served annually. Throughout its nine academic, enrichment and support programs, HOLA served 2,497 students in 2012, an increase of more than 60% from the prior year.
   
   
   
   
   
   - HOLA provided FREE programming six days a week all year long.
   
   
   
   
   
   - At the core of HOLA’s success is a strong team of volunteers. HOLA’s volunteer corps has grown to more than 700, 190 of which donated 10 hours or more in the last year alone. 
   
   
   
   
   
   - The number of HOLA’s youngest students performing at or above grade level increased from 69% to 84%
   
   
   
   
   
   - While area high schools’ graduation rates often fall below 50%, HOLA saw 100% of its seniors graduate from high school and enroll in colleges and universities across the country.
   
   
   
   
   
   - The Alumni and Scholarship Program now supports over 150 alumni enrolled in 75 colleges and universities; of those students who began college in the last three years and participated in the formal Alumni Program, 93% are still enrolled in a two- or four-year institution.
   
   
   
   
   
   - This year, HOLA awarded more than $195,000 in college scholarships to 83 alumni and assisted these students in securing over $1,189,972 in State, Federal and Institutional Funds.
   
   
   
   
   
   - HOLA has consistently facilitated community engagement and helped to beautify and activate the Rampart neighborhood. In 2003, families were too scared to enter into the local park, but since HOLA partnered with LA City Recreation and Parks to bring unprecedented financial and programmatic resources, thousands of families now utilize Lafayette Park on a regular basis.
