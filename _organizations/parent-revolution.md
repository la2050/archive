  LAUSD: Public School Choice
   
   
   
   
   
   In 2009 our first major success was passing LAUSD’s historic Public School Choice resolution. It opened up hundreds of failing and newly constructed campuses for bidding by quality charter school operators, teachers, and other non-profits.
   
   
   
   
   
   We ran a grassroots campaign that generated over 4,000 supportive postcards from parents and then organized 3,000 parents for a rally on the day of the vote. 
   
   
   
   
   
   When we passed LAUSD’s Public School Choice policy we gave birth to the parent empowerment movement.
   
   
   
   
   
   The Parent Trigger Law
   
   
   
   
   
   In January 2010 we passed California’s Parent Trigger law — a concept far more powerful than Public School Choice. The law empowers a majority of parents at failing schools to transform them. 
   
   
   
   
   
   The Parent Trigger law has reframed the public debate on the role organized and empowered parents can play in public school reform. 
   
   
   
   
   
   Compton’s McKinley Elementary School Campaign
   
   
   
   
   
   In December 2010 we helped parents at McKinley Elementary School in Compton, CA become the first to successfully use the Parent Trigger law by submitting signatures of over 61% of their school’s parents. 
   
   
   
   
   
   Parents Union Chapters and Policy Training
   
   
   
   
   
   Parents Union Chapters are dedicated to improving educational outcomes at local schools through organizing and activism. A major project we undertake with each chapter is to provide parents comprehensive education policy training to help them formally evaluate the strengths and weaknesses within their schools. 
   
   
   
   
   
    “Parent Power Express” Bus Tour
   
   
   
   
   
   In September 2011, our “Parent Power Express” bus tour made stops at our Los Angeles area chapters before ending in Sacramento. The tour showcased the incredible, important organizing work Parents Union Chapters are doing to transform their children’s under-performing schools through the Parent Trigger law.
   
   
   It was a hugely successful media campaign that promoted the continued expansion of growing parent empowerment movement. It proved that the work we started in L.A is on the cutting edge of the most dynamic school transformation movements in the country. 
   
   
   Parent Trigger Law Regulations
   
   
   In 2011, we completed a campaign to pass final State Board of Education Parent Trigger law regulations. We mobilized a powerful grassroots movement and generated supportive editorials from almost every major newspaper in California. 
   
   
   Desert Trails Elementary School
   
   
   In January 2012, parents launched the nation’s 2nd Parent Trigger campaign. In January 2013 the Adelanto School Board finally complied with two court orders. This is the first time in the United States a school board voted to approve Parent Trigger implementation. 
   
   
   LAUSD’s 24th Street Elementary School
   
   
   In January the 24th Street Elementary Parents Union Chapter launched the first Parent Trigger campaign at an LAUSD school. 69% of school parents signed the petition. 
   
   
   In February, on a 7- 0 vote, the Board of Education unanimously approved the parents’ petition.
