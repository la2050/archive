org_summary: "LAUSD: Public School Choice\n \n \n \n \n \n In 2009 our first major success was passing LAUSDâ€™s historic Public School Choice resolution. It opened up hundreds of failing and newly constructed campuses for bidding by quality charter school operators, teachers, and other non-profits.\n \n \n \n \n \n We ran a grassroots campaign that generated over 4,000 supportive postcards from parents and then organized 3,000 parents for a rally on the day of the vote. \n \n \n \n \n \n When we passed LAUSDâ€™s Public School Choice policy we gave birth to the parent empowerment movement.\n \n \n \n \n \n The Parent Trigger Law\n \n \n \n \n \n In January 2010 we passed Californiaâ€™s Parent Trigger law â€“ a concept far more powerful than Public School Choice. The law empowers a majority of parents at failing schools to transform them. \n \n \n \n \n \n The Parent Trigger law has reframed the public debate on the role organized and empowered parents can play in public school reform. \n \n \n \n \n \n Comptonâ€™s McKinley Elementary School Campaign\n \n \n \n \n \n In December 2010 we helped parents at McKinley Elementary School in Compton, CA become the first to successfully use the Parent Trigger law by submitting signatures of over 61% of their schoolâ€™s parents. \n \n \n \n \n \n Parents Union Chapters and Policy Training\n \n \n \n \n \n Parents Union Chapters are dedicated to improving educational outcomes at local schools through organizing and activism. A major project we undertake with each chapter is to provide parents comprehensive education policy training to help them formally evaluate the strengths and weaknesses within their schools. \n \n \n \n \n \n  â€œParent Power Expressâ€\x9D Bus Tour\n \n \n \n \n \n In September 2011, our â€œParent Power Expressâ€\x9D bus tour made stops at our Los Angeles area chapters before ending in Sacramento. The tour showcased the incredible, important organizing work Parents Union Chapters are doing to transform their childrenâ€™s under-performing schools through the Parent Trigger law.\n \n \n It was a hugely successful media campaign that promoted the continued expansion of growing parent empowerment movement. It proved that the work we started in L.A is on the cutting edge of the most dynamic school transformation movements in the country. \n \n \n Parent Trigger Law Regulations\n \n \n In 2011, we completed a campaign to pass final State Board of Education Parent Trigger law regulations. We mobilized a powerful grassroots movement and generated supportive editorials from almost every major newspaper in California. \n \n \n Desert Trails Elementary School\n \n \n In January 2012, parents launched the nationâ€™s 2nd Parent Trigger campaign. In January 2013 the Adelanto School Board finally complied with two court orders. This is the first time in the United States a school board voted to approve Parent Trigger implementation. \n \n \n LAUSDâ€™s 24th Street Elementary School\n \n \n In January the 24th Street Elementary Parents Union Chapter launched the first Parent Trigger campaign at an LAUSD school. 69% of school parents signed the petition. \n \n \n In February, on a 7- 0 vote, the Board of Education unanimously approved the parentsâ€™ petition."
