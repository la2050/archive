  We will measure the success of the program by looking at the following:


  Overall understanding of brands and their role in the consumer marketplace: We
  will compare the student's entry video with their exit videos. Observing any
  changes in their perspectives, attitude, understanding of brands and awareness
  of self.


  Market Development:  Based on internal and external feedback, we will evaluate
  students’ growth in brand design and development through the strength of their
  website landing page.  


  Adult participation: Engagement with adult entrepreneurs and founders is a
  fundamental part of the program.  Strong participation rates as well as
  feedback from adult participants will allow us to measure the strength of
  program. 


  Apprenticeships: The program will enable students to identify unique
  internship and apprenticeship opportunities as the students will have
  exclusive access to the business community within the WeWork environment.

  BRANDNEW YOUTH is a 6-week brand development program for male teens of color.
  In response to high levels of consumer marketing towards this specific
  demographic, Brandnew Youth will empower students to develop a healthy and
  sustainable relationship with brands, by teaching them how to create their own
  personal brand. The program will be concentrated on students from low income,
  high consumer communities within South Central Los Angeles and will be limited
  to 10 participants per cycle. Over the course of 6 weeks, students will
  identify and incubate their brands in a WeWork office space. The shared office
  space model of WeWork will provide students with direct access to a community
  of founders and exposure to various business fields. The course schedule is as
  follows: 


  Week 1|Intro to Branding/Mindset: Students will initiate the program with  a
  video interview, which will include a test of their understanding of consumer
  brands. The BRANDNEW journey will then begin through case studies of popular
  local and international brands in order to provide students with a general
  understanding of the role of branding in the marketplace. 


  Week 2|Defining Your Brand: During this week students will learn more about
  developing and identifying their personal brand. Each student will be given a
  Strengths Finder book to do a personal strengths test assessment. Students
  will also review existing influencer brands and why they are successful. 


  Week 3|Visual Brand: We will review the importance of visual branding by
  looking at sample websites for companies, individuals and social media pages.
  Students will participate in a professional photoshoot to use for their
  personal brand portfolio. Additionally they will learn how to design and build
  a responsive website landing page. 


  Week 4|Utilizing Resources: Students will begin to build a network list and
  create a digital resume by identifying their skills/talents, past
  jobs/internships and programs or extracurricular activities that they have
  participated in. Through the development of this network list, students will
  be able identify accessible resources to support the development of their
  product or business idea.


  Week 5|Power of Partnerships: Students will be taught the importance of
  establishing healthy relationships with friends, family and community members.
  They will review existing brand partnerships and identify ways to find
  partners within their communities. They will be asked to do an assessment of
  their circle of friends and how the circle supports their personal brand and
  vice versa. 


  Week 6|Launching: Students will develop a pitch deck and present both their
  personal and business/product brand to their peers and a community of
  entrepreneurs. A panel of experts will be in attendance to give feedback to
  students. Students will participate in a video exit interview about their
  brand, the impact of the course and the application of the course  to their
  future endeavors.
