      We got Max Geller to volunteer. Max is a nice guy who never volunteers for
      anything. No reason why. On the 10th anniversary of September 11, Big
      Sunday hosted a food drive and community breakfast. It started at 6:00
      a.m., to coincide with the time of the attacks. We collected thousands of
      pounds of food for pantries, which was nice, but what was great was that
      the more than 500 helpers included corporate groups; school groups; groups
      from churches, temples, and a mosque; fraternities and clubs; vets;
      residents from group homes, including people in recovery and homeless
      people; and individuals and families. Everyone helped sort and pack the
      food, and then we all broke bread together. We had a great, donated
      buffet, and lots of tables set up, with loads of people inside and out,
      enjoying one another's company on that sad and somber day. And Max turned
      up. He jumped right in and was great company for everyone he talked. He
      had a wonderful time, too. Getting Max, the world's most reluctant
      volunteer to participate, was an excellent achievement. (Next time, we'll
      get him to bring some food, too.)
       
       
       
       
       
       Also: Since 1999, we've engaged and empowered more than 250,000 people of all ages and backgrounds in thousands of community services projects throughout California. For many, helping at Big Sunday is the beginning of a longterm commitment to a nonprofit, whether it's Big Sunday or another group. We have worked with hundreds of nonprofits, both local and national. We have made major capital improvements at all kinds of nonprofit sites, including Phoenix House, The Venice Family Clinic, North Valley Rescue Mission, Operation Ready Families and many more. We have collected and donated tens of thousands of books; tens of thousands of pounds of food; truckloads of clothing; roomsful of furniture. We started as a single day or service and now have a year-round community calendar listing more than 1000 ways to help each year; Monthly on Melrose, which is a different special event for a different nonprofit, every month; our annual holiday giving list, with more than 150 ways to help at the holidays; Youth In Action, a special toolkit for civic-minded kids; The End of the Month Club, our monthly food drive to fight hunger; theBIGlist, our cool online wish list for nonprofits and donors; theARTlist, our upcoming list for all kinds of artists of all ages to publicize their work; and our ability to fill emergency needs by reaching out to the Big Sunday community.
       
       
       
       
       
       We have won all kinds of awards, and been cited and recognized by all kinds of nice and impressive groups.
       
       
       
       
       
       Truly, though, our most important achievement lies not in how much we've done, but the spirit in which we've done it. We are proud that we've brought many people to a new part of town, be it South Central or Beverly Hills, for the first time. We're proud of our ability to cross racial, religious, age, and socio-economic lines to bring nice people together to enjoy one another in all kinds of ways.
