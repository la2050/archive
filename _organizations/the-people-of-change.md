  HIP Through Science: bringing quality and hip STEM Education to our urban
  communities.
project_description: >-
  HIP Through Science is looking to expand efforts that educate youth in the
  communities of South LA in the STEM fields, we plan to add 1000 additional
  youth served in the next three years.

  HIP Through Science seeks to make STEM Education HIP, relatable and obtainable
  for children in our underserved communities.Our STEM program is aiming to
  change the culture and perception of STEM fields, we'd like to encourage more
  children to join the STEM career fields who come from our underserved
  communities. We are currently making great strides in the past three years,we
  are now also aiming to activate more community residents to help inspire our
  HIP Through Science Kids to purse STEM jobs.

  HIP Through Science will make LA the best place to learn by bringing
  relatable, fun, science programs to youth in Watts, Compton, and South Los
  Angeles. Partnerships with local parks, housing projects, and auxiliary school
  programs allows the lab to travel to where the students are. Tapping into a
  network of local tech companies, entrepreneurs, engineers allows HIP Through
  Science to bring culturally relevant curriculum and connections to youth who
  would otherwise not have these opportunities. Youth in the HIP Through Science
  program are able to participate in year-round learning courses that expose
  them to [CA education standard] based projects. The lab increases exposure to
  STEM careers, provides one-on-one learning opportunities, and inspires the
  next generation of STEM leaders to grow in their local communities. The
  program provides an opportunity for local youth to start STEM learning in
  Kindergarten and stay with the program through high school at no cost and no
  travel obligation. Activities like the HIP Through Science, bowling
  fundraisers, the Annual HIP Through Science Fair, and Our Annual Galas are
  additional opportunities for community members, youth, to participate in the
  development of the HIP Through Science Program. HIP Through Science Kids
  interact with honor students, local leaders, and their peers outside of an
  academic setting. By doing these action items we are immersing students in
  Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math content. We are encouraging
  matriculation in to college and we are also hoping to improve proficiency in
  English and Language Arts and Math.
project_proposal_engage: >-
  HIP Through Science will engage Angelenos to make LA the best place to learn
  by continuing to create STEM education platforms such as our Weekly HIP
  Through Science Sessions, our Annual HIP Through Science Fair, and partnering
  with local agencies at community health events. In South LA we will continue
  to bring quality learning to students in a relatable way. The population of
  students in grades K-8 lacks sufficient STEM education resources and
  educational programs. Our weekly HIP Through Science lessons generally revolve
  around a theme for the month, for example Robotics. We then have a 30 minute
  lecture on the subject which may include written assignments and/or reading
  materials, helping develop literacy skills and word association. Following the
  lecture is a fun, interactive experiment that’s memorable and appeals to
  students who are more hands-on learners. 
   
   Our annual HIP Through Science Fair has been growing the last 2 years and were heading into our 3rd, which will surpass the two previous in terms of participation and community support. The Science fair in South LA, particularly Watts community allows students the platform to be recognized for their academic ability in the STEM field. We've have had projects such as creating plasma, breaking down the chemical reaction of a smoke bomb, air propulsion devices and alternative energy methods. This event showcases children with a passion for science and those who witness an opportunity to be engaged and gain interest.
project_measure: >-
  The measures of our success will be quantified through a variety of methods.
  We will have quarterly quizzes that will be assigned and given out to each
  site to find out what educational points need to be improved on. We will track
  the improvements and our goal will be to have each child improve test scores
  and be STEM ready to meet state-wide testing requirements. HIP Through Science
  surveys will be given out also quarterly to determine and measure the interest
  gained while attending sessions. Information will be provided on such topics
  as what are the STEM field careers that they are familiar with before and
  after, what type of STEM careers relate to what they would like to do in life.
  Our Annual HIP Through Science Fair has been gaining more interest and more
  participants; we have doubled our number of participants and community
  attendance since our first. We will continue to measure the attendance of our
  future science fairs. Our success will also be measured by our youths’
  willingness to participate in sessions and having the confidence to read in
  front of other peers in each session.
project_five_years: >-
  In five years I would hope that this activation is able to inspire children
  from inner cities to pursue STEM careers. We hope to eventually expand this
  program from city-wide to county-wide, to serve and inspire more youth to
  chase their dreams in STEM fields.
