  REDCAT is currently celebrating ten years of bringing experimental and
  interdisciplinary performing and visual art to Los Angeles audiences. Each
  year REDCAT collaborates with local, national and international artists and
  organizations on the presentation of more than 200 events, ranging from
  concerts to lectures, to dance festivals and film series. Collaborating
  directly with a wide range of artists and ensembles in the creation and
  presentation of their work and in the design of REDCAT programming means
  REDCAT is a part of the ongoing conversation about the changing dynamic of the
  local and global arts fields, and is uniquely positioned to influence and also
  respond to changing needs and opportunities. REDCAT engages a young,
  multi-ethnic, multi-lingual, and economically diverse audience, welcoming more
  than 60,000 audience members annually to concerts, dance performances,
  theatrical productions and exhibitions.
