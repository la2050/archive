      Two years ago, United Way worked with the Business Leaders Task Force to
      launch Home For Good, an action plan to end chronic and veteran
      homelessness by 2016. Given our strong homeless partners, instead of
      administering homeless services, we focused on improving the homeless
      systems that hamper the work of our partners. We have seen tremendous
      results in our work together over these past two years:
       
       
       
       
       
       â€¢ Leadership: Over 125 leaders from a broad cross-section of nonprofit, public, and philanthropic organizations, including the Mayor of LA and all 5 of our County Supervisors, signed onto the Home For Good plan.
       
       
       
       
       
       â€¢ Funding: $5 million from 16 private funders was leveraged to secure $100 million from 7 public funders, creating the first ever Funders Collaborative for permanent supportive housing in LA County.
       
       
       
       
       
       â€¢ Awareness: Over 20,000 volunteers have participated in HomeWalk, an annual 5k to end homelessness.
       
       
       
       
       
       â€¢ Systems Change: The time it takes for a homeless veteran to move from the street into a home was reduced by 2 months.
       
       
       
       
       
       â€¢ Housing: Well over 5,000 chronically homeless persons as well as an additional 2,000 homeless veterans were permanently housed.
       
       
       
       
       
       We are also proud to work with the Rapid Results Institute (RRI) and their 100-day model. RRI uses a model that challenges communities to quickly and collaboratively design complex systems and create lasting systems change within 100 days.
       
       
       
       
       
       RRI has worked globally to use the catalysts of network support, a time-limited process, clear goals and the expertise of line staff to engineer remarkable results. Those successes (all in 100 days) include:
       
       
       
       
       
       â€¢ Reducing the days required for placing housing homeless vets in Detroit from 143 days to 34 days (76% decrease) in collaboration with the 100k Homes Campaign
       
       
       
       
       
       â€¢ Reducing operating costs for CALPERS (CA public pension) by $99.6 million (annualized) 
       
       
       
       
       
       â€¢ Getting 15,400 people in Sierra Leone tested for HIV in 100 days, compared to 1,000 in the previous 3 years
       
       
       
       
       
       Here in the US and in LA, they also work closely with Community Solutions' 100K Homes Campaign to transform homeless service systems.
