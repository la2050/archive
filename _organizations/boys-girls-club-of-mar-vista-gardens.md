  The Boys & Girls Club of Mar Vista Gardens has only just recently opened on
  January 28th. To date, 264 young people from the housing community have
  registered as Club members (out of 600 school age residents). Other highlights
  from the past two months include the formation of our first sports league
  (Ultimate Lacrosse League), creation of a recycling program for the housing
  community operated by Club members, our first Family Night celebration in
  honor of our one month anniversary, a St. Patrickâ€™s Day party for teen
  members, and upcoming Easter Celebration for the entire community. Our Club
  members have started creating animated cartoons and recording music in our
  tech room. We are extremely proud of our teen members who have started
  tutoring our younger members. Two of our teens also had the opportunity to go
  to the Keystone Conference for their demonstrated leadership and community
  service.
