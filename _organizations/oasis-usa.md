  After several years of testing and developing the model, there are now 14 TFCs
  in various stages of development in California, Colorado, Ohio and Florida.
  Through training and support provided by Oasis, TFCs:
   
   
   
   
   
   * Participated as a leading member of the Raise the Bar! campaign on a multi-year national campaign to petition Hershey to use fair trade chocolate; in late 2012 Hershey announced specific plans to head in that direction;
   
   
   * Provide ongoing support and assistance to a young woman trafficked into the USA who then identified herself as a victim to a local LA TFC;
   
   
   * Resourced the FBI, local law enforcement and direct service providers with more than 60 freedom bags for trafficking victims rescued in a LA sting operation this year; more than 100 freedom bags have been provided in the last year;
   
   
   * Worked with the LA Metro Anti-TraffickingTask Force to implement a city-wide anti-trafficking bus bench campaign in 2012;
   
   
   * Provided education and awareness to over 1200 new activists in 2011-12;
   
   
   * Mentor survivors of trafficking in partnership with direct service providers, while also providing ESL, cooking and baking classes;
   
   
   * Created an anti-trafficking awareness campaign with funding from the US Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Refuge and Resettlement that reached over 8,000 people face-to-face with awareness information; we worked with Chinese media outlets to publish ten newspaper articles, televise multiple interviews, produce a public service announcement aired on three different Chinese channels, and carry out a public awareness campaign using the LA metro transport system;
   
   
   * Share valuable information and research gathered on trafficking hotspots and vulnerabilities with local officials, most recently a local LA County mayor who was unaware of the issues facing his community;
   
   
   * Served as a sub-grantee in partnership with the Coalition Against Slavery and Trafficking on a Department of Justice grant; through more than 60 outreach and training events, Oasis provided training to more than 5,000 individuals in the LA area; 
   
   
   * Celebrated several years of grass roots community organizing and advocacy in partnership with Fair Trade Town USA in seeing Pasadena declared the second Fair Trade Town in California; 
   
   
   * Partnered with Pasadena Unified School District enabling more than 250 high school students to receive anti-trafficking awareness and education through its ‘Summer Skillz’ program; this curriculum, currently being adapted for use by public schools in Florida, can also be adapted for younger students and is available upon request.
