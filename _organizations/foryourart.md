  <p>ForYourArt creates new contexts for art on- and off-line and applies an
  entrepreneurial spirit to producing and distributing artists’ work. ForYourArt
  experiments with a range of activities in its 6020 Wilshire Blvd. space that
  fall in between the nonprofit and the commercial sectors - generating
  patronage through conversations, pop-up shops, creative interventions, artist
  initiatives and family activities. </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>ForYourArt has worked on significant projects including The Getty’s <em>Pacific Standard Time</em>, and the Hans Ulrich Obrist’s <em>The NOW Interviews</em> at the Venice Architecture Biennale, featuring interviews with leading artists, architects and urban planners by the celebrated curator. ForYourArt has published art maps for Los Angeles, New York, Miami and Chicago and developed an iPad app with artist John Baldessari. </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>ForYourArt also organized the public art component for <em>Arts Matter</em>, a first of its kind, citywide public art exhibition and fundraising campaign to support arts education in the nation’s second largest public school system. Presented by the Los Angeles Fund for Public Education (LA Fund) and the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), <em>Arts Matter</em> addresses the importance of arts education in Los Angeles public schools, the “creative capital of the world.” Artists Barbara Kruger and John Baldessari created public art works that were presented on city buses and other outdoor media all across the greater metro area.</p>
