  Collecting and analyzing data is at the core of our business.  


  In the short term, Equallet's success is defined by the number of women-owned
  businesses that register and utilize our marketing tools, and by the number of
  active users that use Equallet to search for and engage with the businesses.


  In the long term, success will be defined by the increase in sales and
  investments our WOBs have realized through the Equallet platform, the number
  of new jobs those WOBs create for women and the positive impacts those WOBs
  have on our local communities.


  We will be measuring all of this through a combination of digital analytical
  tools, direct interaction with our registered WOB community and regular
  surveys.

  There is no easy way to find and support women owned businesses (WOBs) in LA.
  Equallet was built to fill this void by providing an online and mobile search
  platform (think Yelp or Google) that connects consumers and investors with
  LA-based WOBs. In this way, we will contribute to small business growth, the
  creation of new jobs for women and increased in investments into our
  community.

  - Venture capital investment

  Our platform serves as a beacon for potential customers, clients and investors
  to find and assess women-owned businesses (WOBs). We will provide
  unprecedented rich content and information on each business owner in addition
  to details on the products and services they offer. This will allow consumers
  and investors to make informed decisions on how they wish to engage and
  support the individual businesses. Exposure to WOBs allows us to galvanize the
  collective community support – consumers, investors, government and corporate
  entities – to help WOBs grow. The dividends of that growth will flow in to the
  community through new job creation, generation of wealth, and ultimately
  elevate women to decision making positions that can impact positive change for
  Los Angeles residents.


  Equallet was founded with one driving purpose – to help eliminate gender
  inequality in our lifetime.  By creating an easy way to find and support
  women-owned businesses in LA, we are leveling the playing field and creating a
  supportive environment for women entrepreneurs to thrive.


  Equallet’s focus on supporting women in business is grounded in research that
  shows elevating women is not just a feel-good exercise, but an economic
  imperative. Data demonstrates that more equality leads to higher GDP and
  increased productivity - effects that clearly benefit all of us. 


  According the 2012 US Census, LA County is home to nearly 440K women-owned
  businesses, the largest population of WOBs in the country. However, the
  surveys contain very little information on the businesses themselves. There is
  no comprehensive, accessible database of LA based women-owned businesses that
  exists today. Therefore, there is no reliable way to track key metrics on them
  such as their progress, success rates, growth, services they provide and
  overall needs of these business owners. What we are seeing is that this lack
  of data on women-owned businesses is severely limiting government and private
  agencies alike to make policies and decisions to ensure the women-owned
  business communities are being represented properly.


  As Equallet scales to include all LA based women-owned businesses we will be
  collecting the much needed data on these businesses that can be used for the
  purposes of driving policy and community decisions in order to help these
  businesses thrive. We will become the trusted source of information on our
  great city’s women-owned business community.
