org_summary: "</p>1. Toyota Auto Corporation-funded study exploring how emerging trends concerning automobile size and technology (alternative fuels, smaller vehicles) might affect how we might live in cities, the way they might look and operate in the future (2006).<p>\n \n \n </p>2. A Disney Company-funded study to examine opportunities for the Disney brand to strategically locate into urban cores, in the form of an entertainment-themed hotel chain (2010). <p>\n \n \n </p>3. A cityLAB-funded study for LA County Supervisor Ridley-Thomasâ€™ office for a 15-acre community health-centered park in Willowbrook, adjacent to the Rosa Parks MTA station. Associated with nearby MLK Medical Center, it includes many of the programmatic elements in HYPO-PARK, on a much larger site which encompassed a Sheriffâ€™s station, after-school program, clinic, and pool facility. Exhibited at the 2010 Venice Biennale (U.S. Pavilion). <p>\n \n \n </p>4. Hosted, with cityLAB, \"WPA 2.0\" (http://wpa2.aud.ucla.edu/info), an international design competition soliciting design ideas that leverage investment in infrastructure as a means of concomitantly revitalizing urban community. At the National Building Museum, Washington DC (2009). <p>\n \n \n </p>5. A Haynes Foundation-funded (cityLAB) study envisioning alternative urban scenarios that might transpire around the planned station stops of California's High Speed Rail system. Included â€œSportsvilleâ€\x9D, a design plan for the financing and construction of an Olympic athletesâ€™ training facility and extended stay housing adjacent to Anaheimâ€™s soon-to-be completed station. Centered around Anaheim Stadium and proposing the reuse of its parking lot, it also envisioned the rubber damming of the nearby Santa Ana river channel to enable an Olympic-scaled sports venue (2011).<p>"
