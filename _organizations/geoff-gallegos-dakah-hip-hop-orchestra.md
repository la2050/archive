  I am applying as a composer with an idea about housing. I have no achievements
  in the housing sector. At this point, it’s an achievement to make my rent
  payment on time. 
   
   
   
   
   
   My achievements have all happened on a stage, in a classroom or in a recording studio.
   
   
   
   
   
   As a composer/conductor, my friends and I started daKAH Hip Hop Orchestra in a nightclub in 1999. We started it with no money.
   
   
   
   
   
   By 2001, we had made it to Grand Performances. In 2002, we made a CD, no record label. In 2004, we were onstage at Disney Concert Hall, San Francisco and in Vegas. In 2005, we were at Hollywood Bowl, South By Southwest, New Orleans during Jazzfest.
   
   
   
   
   
   The movie “HIP HOP MAESTRO” was released in 2011. The film traces this journey from the street to symphony hall. 
   
   
   
   
   
   This is what makes me think we can pull it off. All we had to work with was sheet music, and cats in chairs, learning how to play it. After more than a decade, we’ve built a deep community of musicians in L.A.
   
   
   
   
   
   daKAT House operates with the same philosophy as daKAH Hip Hop Orchestra, upping the stakes by providing a cheap roof over their heads.
   
   
   
   
   
   As a musician, I’ve learned how to make something out of nothing. The times I’ve been entrusted with resources have seen success more often than failure. My strength is knowing my weakness, and finding the right people to execute the task.
