  None. 
   
   
   
   
   
   Our organization has not published anything public yet. I conceived this idea about three months ago after talking with the CEO of Dekit Magazine. If I were to receive this grant, I could have the website and social media channels up and running in less than a month, and weekly episodes for all 3 brands out in less than two months. 
   
   
   
   
   
   I can tell you that as an individual, I have line produced two feature films, one of which was acquired and released by Lionsgate (you can view my resume on IMDB at http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1336027/). I have become a member of the Producer's Guild of America, and I partnered with others on two separate internet media companies, and while they fell short of expectations, I have learned from their mistakes.
