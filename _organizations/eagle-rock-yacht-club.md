      Through dodgeball, civic service, partnerships with rec centers and our
      youth, The Yacht Club inspires Angelenos to pursue the common good.
    - >-
      <p>To date, The Yacht Club has successfully transformed 500+ dodgeball
      players into engaged, socially-conscious Angelenos by creating a diverse
      number of opportunities for participants to volunteer directly in their
      communities, in addition to adding roughly 1300+ hours of physical
      activity for kids and adults. This has been achieved through the following
      programming efforts:</p>
       
       
       <p>Creative Fundraising: One example would be our 3rd Annual Valentine's Day Tournament. We worked with private local and national companies to create a unique themed event. This was an incredibly successful fundraising effort with proceeds going towards on-going activities for kids, including Kids dodgeball, Yacht Grub, Yacht Plot, Yacht Pix and forthcoming programs.</p>
       
       
       <p>Kids Dodgeball: Friday nights from 7:30-9 PM: Continuing our efforts to create positive experiences & growth for the youth of Glassell Park & Venice (& starting the program this spring in North Hollywood), we host our Kids Dodgeball League on Friday nights. This program was started under the Mayor's Summer Night Lights initiative over two years ago, which we used as a platform to gauge interest & create an on-going program. We are very proud that this informal league has helped us build relationships with kids in the neighborhood, which has furthered our ability to create new efforts & programs.</p>
       
       
       <p>Yacht Plot: We have firmly planted ourselves in a new spot in Glassell Park - The Drew St. Community Garden. The Yacht Club volunteers, along with helpful neighborhood kids, maintain the garden a few times each week-routinely watering, weeding, tidying up, monitoring plant growth, & dealing with challenges presented by seasonal change. Once mature, the plotâ€™s produce will supplement the culinary needs of the Yacht Grub kids cooking class. To assist in supplementing the needs of our gardening crew, our adult dodgeball league rallied & donated our wish list of kid's gardening tools.</p>
       
       
       <p>Kids Cooking Classes: In 2012, we formed Yacht Grub in collaboration with Whole Foods, creating a cooking & nutrition class for at-risk-teens associated with recreation centers in Venice & Glassell Park. The goal of this six week course is to give students confidence in the kitchen while they learn healthy cooking, practical nutrition information, basic knife skills & complete awareness of how to read ingredient labels. 8-10 students learn two new recipes each week in this 2 hour class.</p>
       
       
       <p>Yacht Pix, an introduction to photography course for kids at the Oakwood Rec Center in Venice. The goal of the class is to learn a variety of techniques & ways of shooting, honing the studentsâ€™ critical thinking skills. Guest photographers showcase their work, allowing students to see how photography can be a profession. At the end of the session, the students work is hung for a â€˜gallery openingâ€™ where one photo is chosen as the winner based on skills learned, directions followed, & positive behavior displayed.</p>
