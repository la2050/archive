  It is important to look at the impact of the ads through three different
  lenses, aligned with FosterMore’s goals.  Each of the three goals has a metric
  to measure success.

  * Recruitment of Foster Parents: The number of referrals made to LA County
  Foster Family Agencies is a clear metric for success and evaluation.  The
  cost/referral allows for comparison with the efforts of other organizations to
  reach the same demographic.

  * Reintroducing Foster Youth to the Public—The overall number of individuals
  who see the ads and watched the films is a strong metric for success because
  the ads are purchased to reach a specific demographic of potential foster
  parents.

  * Long Term Culture Shift: Based on previous research of our partner
  organizations that states that the average foster parent spends two years in
  the prospecting pipeline, we may be able to project interest starting in 18-24
  months, assuming appropriate follow up is conducted.  It is our belief that a
  periodic investment of advertising (targeting the same demographic) could
  yield a conversion rate of 0.005% from those who view the ad.

  To fill LA County’s urgent need for foster parents, our team of communications
  and marketing experts conducted research and focus groups to develop an online
  recruitment effort.  The initial effort used micro-targeting digital messages
  to potential foster parents and mentors reaching millions of county residents
  with a proven message to move them through the prospective foster parent
  funnel.  We would like to expand our online effort to meet the pressing need
  for foster parents in the county.

  The need for foster parents is profound in Los Angeles County.  With this in
  mind, our team of communications experts conducted research and focus groups
  to develop a campaign to recruit foster parents and mentors, while at the same
  time reintroducing the potential of foster youth to the public.  

  The initial effort used micro-targeted digital messages to potential foster
  parents and mentors and reached millions of county residents with a proven
  message to move them through the prospective foster parent funnel.  Our
  messaging features uplifting stories of individuals and families whose lives
  were positively impacted by foster care.  Set to the One Direction hit song
  “The Story of My Life” with voiceover provided by Emmy winning actor Ty
  Burrell, the moving ads are currently being utilized in a targeted online ad
  buy focusing on LA County residents.  

  In a new approach for the field, FosterMore is using 21st century techniques
  to engage people in the lives of youth in care.  This kind of specific
  targeting works at two levels—at best we have recruited a new person to
  actively support foster youth, and at the same time we have promoted the
  larger mission of FosterMore to change hearts and minds.  

  The online media buy targets precise demographics, primarily on Facebook and
  the audiences targeted include middle and upper income households, LGBT
  families, single women and more.   With a budget of just under $12,000 the
  initial effort garnered 1.876 million impressions, with 609k of those watching
  the videos.  One hundred and thirty three viewers were converted to leads (by
  filling out our contact form) and after follow up, 45 individuals were
  referred to foster family agencies and mentoring opportunities.  The overall
  cost per lead in LA was $68.34.  By comparison to other media buys, this is a
  very low viewership cost which can be attributed to compelling content and
  thoughtful media buy targeting. 

  What’s more research shows that foster parents on average spend two years
  considering this decision.  Our effort may serve to accelerate their decision
  and bring new leads into the funnel.  Based on our results to date a periodic
  investment in advertising (targeting the same demographic) could yield a
  conversion rate of 0.005% from those who viewed the ads.  If our assumption
  proves correct, the county can expect 3,047 new foster parent and mentoring
  leads in 2018.  If we look at the static ad impression figures at a conversion
  rate of 0.001%, we can anticipate 1,877 new leads in 2018. 

  We are seeking to expand our online effort to meet the pressing need for
  foster parents in LA County.  The grant would be used for direct digital
  contact with a micro-targeted audience of potential foster parents.  We
  estimate an investment of $25,000 could return 312-384 foster parent leads
  over a 6-8 week effort.  Further the long-term impact could yield an estimated
  5,700-7,000 additional foster parents starting 18 months from the date of
  execution.
