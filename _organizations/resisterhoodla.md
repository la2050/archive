  resisterhoodLA pairs with non-profits to curate unique volunteer opportunities
  for Angelenos. In 2017, we started our annual menstrual hygiene product drive:
  FLOWVEMBER, a family-friendly, gender-inclusive community event that combines
  hands-on volunteering and homelessness advocacy education.
