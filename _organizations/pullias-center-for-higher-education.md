  The Pullias Center for Higher Education is dedicated to improving access to
  college for low-income and historically under-represented students. The
  academic arm of our Center has focused on: (1) researching how students,
  families and schools define and address challenges related to college going
  and (2) identifying effective strategies for improving college going outcomes.
  Our publications are widely used as guides by practitioners across the
  country. Yet just as significant, our Center has developed a three-pronged
  outreach approach where we work with schools and students to provide high
  quality college guidance and support; the three programs we run rank among the
  Center’s most important achievements to date. The first program we developed —
  I AM (Increasing Access through Mentoring) provides targeted college guidance
  support to juniors and seniors in high school as they prepare to apply for
  college. Many of the students we work with will be the first in their families
  to attend college. Many also attend high schools with exorbitant counselor to
  student ratios. I AM mentors work with school based counselors to identify
  students who might slip through the cracks and then meet with students
  regularly to make sure the (very complicated) college application process goes
  smoothly. Once students are accepted to colleges, mentors help students figure
  out financial aid awards and provide students with support as they decide
  where to go. We’ve helped over 1,000 students get into college since starting
  the program in 2005. The SummerTIME (Tool Information Motivation Education)
  program focuses on college completion. We bring students who have graduated
  from LAUSD schools and who will be heading to four-year colleges/universities
  to USC for a month-long intensive writing program. The curriculum is infused
  with lessons on college knowledge such has how to balance finances, how to
  interact with professors and how to cultivate effective study skills. The
  third program provides a twist to traditional college outreach approaches. We
  decided to meet students where they choose to spend after-school hours — in
  cyberspace! We partnered with USC’s Game Innovation Lab and students from
  Foshay Learning Center to create a series of role-playing games about college
  and careers. Our games were developed and pilot tested in Los Angeles and are
  now utilized nationally. My LA2050 funding would enable us to expand these
  programs and train practitioners on how to make use of the game-based tools.
