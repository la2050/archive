  Working with Dan Rosen, Billy Parish, and Arthur Coulston at SolarMosaic
  (www.joinmosaic.com) to develop the financial model for the "Oakland Solar
  Mosaic" was an incredible time for me. Through that effort, $400,000 was
  raised from "the crowd" to develop solar projects for non-profits in Oakland,
  CA. The support we had in developing a crowdfunding model for solar finance
  was absolutely humbling, and to see what happens when a good idea's time has
  come was inspiring.
