  <P>Achievements in Educational landscape: pragmatic, innovative,
  collaborative.<p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <P>Arguably, the most frustrating situations for educators and parents alike include: not being able to support children by giving each child the tools he/she needs to navigate through his or her day with confidence and independence.<p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <P>Our success story: in the fall of 2012, Karen met Lola, a bright, kind-hearted, eager and willing third-grader, the type of student that inspires any teaching heart. As the first week of the school year unfolded, Karen observed Lola, despite her powers of persistence, struggle consistently with recalling/retrieving information that she needed to followed multi-step directions. <P>
   
   
   
   
   
   <P>Karen a veteran third grade teacher, knows that by third grade, kids start to take pride in “doing things on their own” and too many reminders by a teacher elicit painful embarrassment. Fortunately, she had just participated in “Structuring the Learning Environment” a special ed professional development series offering strategies to help special needs kids get through “tasks”. Building on what was learned, she began to create work systems on strips of paper for Lola that broke done daily routines and academic situations into “one step at a time lists” and added a little animal clip for Lola to move as she progressed through each step. Karen, in collaboration with Lola's Mom, Carrie, formalized these systems for Lola by posting them in her planner and empowering her to check off her tasks as she went - allowing her to feel far more in control and independent. <P>
   
   
   
   
   
   <P>It was almost magical: Lola went from being frozen to completely independent, with her “work system” at hand. Building on Lola’s achievement, Karen’s principal requested that she share her strategies with other teachers, who in turn successfully applied work systems with their struggling students. <P>
   
   
   
   
   
   <P>The recent course Karen had taken, coupled with the perfect timing of having Lola as student along with the professional development she shared with other teachers made Karen realize just how many kids would in the future, benefit tremendously by a "work system" like she had informally developed for Lola, and an idea took root: an App version.<P>
