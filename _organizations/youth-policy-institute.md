      YPI has been a leader in education and community empowerment since 1983.
      YPI created the first national anti-poverty program based on a community
      action approach, in which local organizations could operate federally
      funded program with community input. YPI continues that work in Los
      Angeles and now serves over 100,000 Angelenos each year at 125 sites
      throughout the city with education, technology, and training programs. YPI
      is a recipient of U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer's Excellence in Education
      Award, and has also been recognized by Cisco's Growing with Technology
      Award, as a National Council of La Raza Affiliate of the Year. YPI has
      been honored as an international ComputerWorld Honors Laureate for our 80
      Public Computer Centers serving families with broadband services and
      access throughout the city. YPI's Hollywood FamilySource Center received a
      2012 California Award for Performance Excellence by the California Council
      for Excellence.
       
       
       
       
       
       While we are proud of these achievements, YPI is most proud of the direct impact our agency has in the lives of low-income youth and adults in Los Angeles. Our staff of over 800, many of whom come from the communities we serve, are dedicated to doing whatever is needed to ensure youth have the resources and skills to graduate college and career ready. YPI's recent accomplishments include opening the San Fernando Institute of Applied Media (SFiAM) in 2010 on the campus of San Fernando Middle School, a persistently lowest-achieving school. SFiAM increased its API score from 629 to 704 (+75 points) in two years. Notably, SFiAM has surpassed the achievement of San Fernando Middle School in only two years of operation, thanks to the hard work and dedication of teachers, the principal, other school staff, and the programs YPI provides on campus, including an afterschool program, AmeriCorps tutoring, parent education workshops, an iMac computer lab, and a School2Home program that provides all students with iPads. YPI's LA CollegeReady program trained 129 College Ambassadors who assisted 2,115 high school students and 900 parents prepare for college, including helping with applications, financial aid, and learning more about college options. 
       
       
       
       
       
       Beyond the numbers, YPI staff makes other differences. In 2011, "Maria" and her son were referred to YPI by Maria's job training program. Maria was keeping her son home from middle school because he was being recruited by an area gang. YPI staff immediately intervened by connecting Maria and her son with the on-site LAUSD counselor, who enrolled Maria's son in a new school that same day. Last year "Maria" and her daughter participated in YPI's Just Me and My Parent early childhood education classes. When Maria's daughter began preschool this past fall, her teacher was impressed by her fine motor skill development and ability to adapt to preschool. Maria expressed how grateful she was for YPI's early education program and how it has helped her and her daughter tremendously.
