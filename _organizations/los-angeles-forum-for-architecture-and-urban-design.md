org_summary: "The LA Forum was founded in 1987 by a group of designers, architects, planners, and educators who wanted to provide an alternative platform for critical discussion on the built environment in Los Angeles and Southern California. The Forum has organized lectures, symposia, events, exhibitions, competitions, and publications throughout its history. We are a non-profit organization that operates outside of the realms of professional practice and architecture schools. Our members consist of architects, planners, engineers, designers, educators, students, artists, and other people interested in the built environment in Los Angeles.\n \n \n \n \n \n Our publication history includes a significant pamphlet series between 2003 and 2010 that included Dead Malls, Out the Window (LAX), Polar Inertia, After the City, This (Is How We Live), Pendulum Plane, and Meet the Nelsons. The series explored Los Angeles urban design and architecture through creative responses, such as comic book styles and fake screenplays, as well as through speculative architectural projects as part of the Forumâ€™s sponsorship of competitions. In addition, the Forum has published a quarterly newsletter since our founding that provides space for critical thinkers to write about Los Angeles. We have also published larger-scale books, including Experimental Architecture in Los Angeles (Rizzoli International) and Everyday Urbanism (Monacelli Press).\n \n \n \n \n \n The Forumâ€™s public events, including lectures and symposia, continue to play an active role in the identity of LA design. One of our most significant past events focused on the aftermath of the LA Uprisings in 1992, when we brought together our members and the National Organization of Minority Architects for the event â€œAlternative Disorders: On Designing Communities.â€\x9D We also sponsor quarterly Pecha Kucha events for designers to share their work with the community, as well as a lecture series called â€œOut There Doing Itâ€\x9D that spotlights emerging design practices and the â€œOn the Mapâ€\x9D series that provides architectural tours of buildings given by the architects who designed them.\n \n \n \n \n \n In our 25-year history, we have sponsored design competitions to focus attention on opportunities for rethinking the vitality of urban LA. These have included Civic Innovations (1994), Dead Malls (2003), Liner (2008), and Dingbat 2.0 (2010). Our most recent competition on Dingbats focused on the reinvention of this classic LA housing prototype for a new generation of urban citizens, resulting in a forthcoming book and an exhibition of the competition entries. \n \n \n The Forum continues to actively engage all of Los Angeles and has two exhibitions planned this summer for our space in the Woodbury University Hollywood gallery. These exhibitions focus on alternative housing typologies for Los Angeles and will be open throughout the summer for free to the public."
