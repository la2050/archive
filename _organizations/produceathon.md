  Having mastered & streamlined the process for facilitating skills-based
  volunteer teams towards delivering high-quality, low-cost digital stories and
  communication strategies in the social impact space, we have: (1) put over
  3,500 hours of skills-based pro bono hours into equipping non-profits with
  stories, marketing campaigns, & videos that push forward their civic missions
  (2) delivered over $450,000 of pro bono value to non-profits, enabling them to
  re-invest those dollars directly back into supporting their cause & (3)
  mobilized over 300 creatives and industry thought leaders towards active
  participation in initiatives through our Storytelling-themed ProduceAthon
  events. 


  Additional metrics of success are defined as follows:

  (1) NPO Impact: Visibility & engagement resulting from digital content
  distribution, # Volunteers resulting from digital content production &
  distribution, $ raised from digital content usage & execution of communication
  strategy

  (2) Private / Public Sector Impact: total venture capital raised to bring
  prototypes to market, # successful pilot programs launched, total jobs created
  through launch of pilot programs, $ saved in delivering more effective &
  efficient government solutions

  ProduceAthon will help make LA the best place to create by fostering civic
  innovation & entrepreneurship in our region. 


  ProduceAthon is a forward-thinking social innovation lab. After streamlining
  the process of mobilizing skills-based volunteer teams to deliver effective &
  resourceful digital stories on social impact, we recognized the need for a
  more-comprehensive program that maximizes the creative energy and sustains the
  impact generated from our events. To realize this vision, we launched
  ProduceAthon.org, a stand-alone entity that combines storytelling & technology
  innovation to solve our most pressing civic challenges. 


  The ProduceAthon has 3 components: (1) An Innovation Academy (2) A
  Hackathon-modeled event (3) A mentorship and funding component that brings our
  leading volunteer-based teams’ concepts & civic prototypes to market. 


  The Innovation Academy sources local talent & exposes them to pressing
  city-identified challenges. This platform empowers talent with background
  information, tools, and data sets necessary for developing innovative and
  meaningful civic solutions & communications strategies. We will foster
  creativity & entrepreneurship through learning modules that delve into various
  civic topics, including water & power, government efficiencies, small business
  economic development, aging in place, and health & wellness. We will assemble
  Elite teams from this academy and mobilize them to CREATE in our second
  component – the Hackathon event – where they will build-out their concepts,
  ideas, & stories in an accelerated timeframe. 


  The 2nd component of the ProduceAthon is our 72-hour HackAthon event, where
  elite teams have 72-hours to prototype solutions, develop implementation
  plans, & deliver digital stories & communication strategies on their selected
  civic challenge set.  We will connect teams with subject matter experts from
  City Staff, LADWP, & USC’s Institute of Creative Technologies; storytelling
  and marketing experts from Propper Daley and Howling Wolf Productions; &
  non-profits currently on the ground tackling the teams’ selected civic
  challenge sets. 


  ProduceAthon will nurture & expand our region’s entrepreneurial & civic
  innovation economy. We will ensure lasting & measurable impact through our 3rd
  component by matching our leading elite teams with venture capital funders,
  mentors, & business accelerators to help bring their prototypes to market &
  sustainably scale their concepts. We will ensure distribution & visibility of
  the digital content & marketing campaign developed during the ProduceAthon
  through distribution partners like UpToGood, furthering public awareness of &
  engagement with our region’s civic challenges. 


  By creating opportunities & catalyzing engagement in civic innovation, we will
  develop a more inclusive and creative local economy that unites the
  non-profit, private, & public sectors through intentional collaboration & help
  make LA the best place to CREATE.
