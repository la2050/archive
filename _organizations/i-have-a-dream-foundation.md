  We have been helping at risk youth for 35 years so we have comprehensive
  metrics on metriculation rates for high school into and then through college
  as well as tracking their career success through our alumni. We use Civicore
  to track every single student and we also do case management in order to
  stabalize the entire family. We have MOU's with dstricts in order to access
  grades and all other pertinent information on each student. We also had an ROI
  analysis conducted that shows that for every dollar donated, three dollars is
  returned in taxes, far less incarceration, far less need for welfare and other
  markers.

  As we sponsor entire grade levels at the most at risk schools, we stay with
  these students that we call 'Dreamers' all the way to and through college and
  help the graduates to find jobs and succeed. Our new program which teaches our
  high school students how to succeed at work, helps them to end
  intergenerational poverty in their families and in their communities.
