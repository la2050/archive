  10,000+ veterans served since we opened our doors in 1993.
   
   
   Our Supportive Services for Veteran Families program became a national model within its first year of operation in 2012.
   
   
   We consistently maintain an 80% positive transition rate from our transitional programs and a 75% sobriety rate. 
   
   
   We are the largest veteran community in the U.S.A. with the capacity to house 660 veterans.
   
   
   Opened a 196-bed permanent housing in 2011 specifically to address the need for affordable housing for low and very-low income veterans
