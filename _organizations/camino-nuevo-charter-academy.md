  Camino Through College aims to provide our students and families the support
  they need to succeed in college and beyond, and to ensure that by 2022, 90% of
  our students are accepted into, 80% enroll in, and 60% complete college within
  six years of graduating from high school.


  We will measure our success based on the following:

  -Number of college trips provided

  -Number of students who attended college trips

  -Number of students provided ACT/SAT Prep

  -Number of students enrolled in a 2 or 4 year college

  -Percent of students graduating from college

  -Percent of employers interested in providing internships to our students

  -Number of peer mentor matches


  We will continue to survey students, internship employers, staff, and parents
  before, throughout and after going through our program. Additionally, we will
  gather feedback through our alumni focus groups and one-on-one conversations
  with program participants.

  Camino Through College (CTC) will help make LA the best place to learn by
  helping more students get to and through college.


  CNCA students reside in some of the most historically underserved areas of
  Central Los Angeles, including the communities of MacArthur Park, Pico-Union,
  Wilshire Corridor, and Echo Park – a region that holds the second densest
  neighborhood in the U.S., where the annual family income is among the lowest
  in the city. Latinos in California have lower rates of college matriculation
  directly from high school. In fact, approximately 41.3% of MacArthur Park's
  population never graduated from high school.


  CNCA is determined to reverse those statistics. Even though 99% of our
  students from the class of 2016 enrolled in a two or four-year college, we
  continue to build our CTC Program. We are working hard to provide our students
  and families the support they need to succeed in college and beyond, and to
  ensure that by 2022, 90% of our students are accepted into, 80% enroll in, and
  60% complete college within six years of graduating from high school.


  CTC focuses on preparing students for success through exposure to different
  colleges and careers, skill-building, parent engagement, and support
  throughout the college-application process, enrollment and beyond.  All high
  school students participate in a class where they learn about college
  preparation, explore college and career options and prepare for entrance
  exams, applications, and financial aid opportunities. Students also
  participate in career exploration activities, like projects around career
  options, job shadowing, and a 50-hour internship. 


  While exposing students to college and career options, we provide parents with
  the information they will need to help their students get to and through
  college. A series of “College Knowledge” workshops are provided for families,
  which emphasize academic requirements for college acceptance, financial
  preparation, and the social-emotional aspects of sending a child away to
  college. A parent support group is also available to prepare families for this
  life transition.  


  As students begin to narrow down their college and career interests, college
  counselors help students identify which colleges will be best suited to their
  needs and desired field(s) of study. Students participate in college visits to
  public and private universities in California and nationally.  Then, college
  counselors help students complete their college applications. 


  As students move toward graduation, enrollment and their first year in
  college, the program helps to remove financial barriers for the most
  disadvantaged students by providing college scholarships to 25% of the senior
  class through a CNCA scholarship fund. Additionally, we work to match mentors
  with students to help address barriers by providing personal and academic
  support and connecting students to resources on campus. Our staff provides
  individualized support to high-risk students.
