title: The Los Angeles Mayor's Council on Innovation and Industry
org_type: Nonprofit
org_summary: >-
  -LAMCII has been able to attract some of the country’s brightest minds and
  biggest companies to lead the council and is continuously approached by
  business leaders and tech pioneers in the city looking for ways to become
  involved. Members of the council have given their time and resources freely
  and willingly to ensure the success of LAMCII. To date, we have expended
  2,000+ hours of research, extracted 4,000+ pages of reports and engaged over
  75 people and organizations not previously involved in the council. Council
  members, who already have significant commitments and responsibilities, have
  spent 300+ hours in committee meetings in 2012 and many more hours working
  independently towards Council goals.
   
   
   
   
   
   -LAMCII has developed two engaging and robust websites — lamcii.org and edge.la. Both sites are quickly becoming hubs for information directed to those who want to understand how the future of LA is being navigated. The purpose of our websites is to be the gateway or aggregator of information about Los Angeles - involving the innovation and tech community, events and activities, real estate opportunities and contact lists. These sites act as an uber-connector for anyone wanting to become involved in this community. They help others realize the potential of the city and its members. 
   
   
   
   
   
   -As described above, the following initiatives are scoped and underway for 2013:
   
   
   
   
   
   -Texpo Innovation Hubs
   
   
   -EdgeLA Fellowship Program
   
   
   -The EdgeLA Awards
   
   
   
   
   
   Beyond those three major initiatives, the Council has identified the following action items for scoping and next steps in 2013:
   
   
   -Better publicize LA-based capital sources
   
   
   -Attract Tier-1 capital sources to Los Angeles
   
   
   -Support existing LA-based venture capital
   
   
   -Cultivate and expand the angel community
   
   
   -Improve access to city/county information
   
   
   -Encourage mayor to more closely align and promote LA’s innovation economy
   
   
   -Build an entrepreneurial ambassador program with City Hall
   
   
   
   
   
   -Upon completion of the first year of the council LAMCII produced The Leading Edge Report — a 44 page report outlining the council’s motives, initiatives and vision. 
   
   
   The report is available here: http://lamcii.org/resources.html
