  We believe NEXT FEST will be successful if we can reach and bring together
  more Angelenos around some of the most distinctive voices in independent film
  culture today. We hope that our audiences will leave entertained, challenged,
  and having connected in a way that is altogether unique. 


  Sundance Institute emphasizes documentation, benchmarking, and evaluation in
  all of our programs and services, and measures the success of activities
  through a variety of mechanisms, including: audience attendance and engagement
  at all events, surveys of program participants and partners, social media and
  website engagement, media coverage, and story reporting. The Institute also
  conducts extensive data collection and analysis from online, mobile, and
  social platforms featuring the Sundance name. All Sundance Programs are
  responsive to the needs of the participants: Institute staff evaluate Program
  activities on an ongoing basis, meet quarterly throughout the year to measure
  progress in reaching the established goals of our initiatives, carefully
  consider feedback gathered both formally and informally, and make program
  modifications when appropriate.

  An LA2050 grant would enable Sundance Institute to 1) provide 20% of NEXT
  FEST17 screening and event tickets free-of-charge to Los Angeles County
  community organizations and other community outreach programs, 2) support NEXT
  FEST public panels and workshops, and 3) continue NEXT DOOR, a publicly
  accessible outdoor community space located next to the festival and open
  throughout NEXT FEST. Our ticket outreach efforts will reach a broad range of
  Angelenos across the county.

  Los Angeles is vast and complex, posing a unique set of challenges to
  individual civic and cultural participation. Revitalization of the city center
  is crucial to promoting diverse, cross-cultural collaboration. We believe that
  by providing a space for all Angelenos to connect and engage around
  independent storytelling, we can help make our city better. 


  Sundance NEXT FEST goes beyond a traditional film festival format by pairing
  highly anticipated films from the Sundance Film Festival with live
  performance, music, panels, and comedy. Presented in August 2017 at the
  historic United Artists Theatre at Ace Hotel in downtown Los Angeles, NEXT
  FEST annually reaches audiences of up to 10,000 with seven L.A. premiere film
  screenings over the course of three days. NEXT FEST offers unexpected
  juxtapositions. For example, in 2016, following the premiere of Chad
  Hartigan’s “Morris from America,” Sundance partnered with community youth
  organizations 826LA, Inner-City Arts, and Venice Arts to showcase the artistry
  of some of Los Angeles’ most talented youth in a talent show hosted by
  “Morris” star, comedian Craig Robinson.


  NEXT DOOR provides an open community gathering space in the parking lot next
  to the Ace Hotel, where our audiences and the general public can meet over
  food, drink, entertainment and games. Visitors to NEXT DOOR can screen print
  their own NEXT FEST tote bags, play lawn and table games, and participate in a
  variety of activities designed to connect them to the larger NEXT FEST
  community via social media.


  A 2009 National Endowment for the Arts study found that American adults who
  attend art museums, art galleries, or live arts performances are far more
  likely than non-attendees to vote, volunteer, or take part in community
  events. We believe that cultural engagement and access to independent
  storytelling can engender empathy, spark creativity, and promote
  understanding. Sundance aims to increase Angelenos’ access to cultural events
  by implementing a new community ticket initiative reserving 20% of NEXT FEST
  tickets to be distributed free-of-charge to community organizations that serve
  LA County residents. By centering NEXT FEST in the historic core of downtown
  Los Angeles, we hope to reach as many LA residents as possible. As we approach
  the program’s fifth summer, we are eager to build on NEXT FEST’s track record
  of reaching young, diverse audiences. 


  The Los Angeles Times noted that NEXT FEST “has become a Los Angeles summer
  fixture.” Over the past four years we have worked with dozens of Los Angeles
  organizations including BAFTA, CalArts, Ghetto Film School, Homeboy
  Industries, and The East Los Angeles Society of Film and Arts to find ways to
  collaborate during NEXT FEST and year-round. We are excited by the opportunity
  to be able to broaden our outreach in Los Angeles through a fully underwritten
  community ticket initiative and by continuing to offer a free, public space
  for NEXT FEST attendees and the vibrant downtown neighborhood.
