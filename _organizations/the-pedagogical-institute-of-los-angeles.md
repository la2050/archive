  The Pedagogical Institute’s evaluation tools for this Collaborative Teacher
  Project measure the shift away from the traditional academic pedagogy used now
  by K-12 teachers and towards developmentally appropriate practice and
  play-based learning more appropriate for younger children. We measure: 1)
  children’s intellectual, social and critical thinking skills; 2) development
  of teachers’ reflective skills to assess learning; and 3) Principals’
  perspectives.


  The Teachers are asked to complete a scaled survey of 26 questions and 3
  open-ended questions every month to capture change over time. The questions
  are designed to evaluate elements of the Pianta et al. CLASS evaluation
  system, e.g., around children’s independence in the learning environment,
  critical thinking, and opportunities for extended conversation with teacher
  and peers. 


  The teachers also complete a 60 page portfolio of photographs, video footage,
  dialogue, and examples of children’s theory development.  These portfolios
  document both the teacher’s and the children’s learning over time. The
  finished product is a multi-media record of the teacher’s journey in
  implementing new teaching practices. It highlights the teacher’s role in
  nurturing children’s independence, curiosity, and development.

  High quality education starts with teachers who have specialized training in
  early education and access to engaging and thought provoking learning
  materials. Our goal is to bring these resources to underprivileged communities
  who lack both. We are piloting our program at 4 LAUSD Title 1 sites and hope
  to extend our support of these classrooms through May 2017, as well as expand
  our mentoring project to 4 more at-risk LA schools by the end of the 2017-18
  school year.

  While LA is rich in diversity, a great disparity exists between the early
  education offered in middle and upper-socio-economic communities and those in
  less advantaged communities. Compounding the problem, the State’s new mandate
  that Transitional Kindergartens (TK) be offered throughout California’s public
  schools has resulted in elementary school teachers without adequate training
  in early childhood education staffing classrooms with 4 and 5-year-olds.
  Consequently, California children are subjected to curriculum that is
  inappropriate for their developmental level, setting them up for early failure
  and burn-out at a time when they are defining themselves as learners. This has
  been a great setback for children in low income communities where scripted
  lessons that fail to measure the dispositions needed for school and life
  success take precedence over creative experiences and engaging intellectual
  challenges. Our goal is to support classrooms that nurture tenacity,
  curiosity, flexibility, creative thinking, and democratic values that provide
  children with the best preparation for academic success and responsible
  citizenry. 


  The Collaborative Teacher Project (CTP) directly addresses LA’s economic gap
  by bringing innovative programs to LA's most at risk public schools. We begin
  by connecting master teachers with public elementary school teachers who often
  lack the resources or exposure to more creative, child-centered approaches.
  Together with parents, teachers and community volunteers, we refurbish the TK
  classrooms, transforming them into environments that enable children to
  interact, reflect, analyze and create together. During the months that follow,
  CTP mentors work side by side with the TK teachers in their classrooms – 
  mentoring, modelling and inspiring deeply reflective teacher practices.


  Our project is based on the strong affirmation that ALL children, regardless
  of economic or geographic considerations, possess an innate desire to make
  meaning in the world, and thus should be provided with quality early learning
  experiences that nurture their creativity, curiosity and wonder. We know that
  quality early childhood education can change the trajectory of a child's life.
  But who is to provide this quality? Teachers, of course. Yet so many teachers
  lack support and training. With the help of LA2050 we can right this wrong.
  Let’s give teachers the support they need so they can indeed change the
  trajectory of a child’s life, not just in affluent neighborhoods, but
  everywhere.  Now is the time to guarantee that ALL children have access to the
  level of quality it takes to really make a difference! With the help of 2050,
  LA can lead the way in ensuring that young children are curious, engaged
  learners.
