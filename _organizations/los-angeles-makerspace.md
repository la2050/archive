  <p>We are incredibly proud of the achievements our organization has made in
  the past year. We could not have done it without a passionate board of
  directors (4 women, 3 men) and an extremely supportive community. </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>In less than one year we have opened a space in downtown LA, hired two staff members and programmed more than 40 successful events and workshops including programming, design, citizen science, film, woodworking and food science hacking.</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>We have had a lot of support and attention localling in Los Angeles and nationally. The White House - Office of Science and Technology Policy wrote about our incredible efforts: http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/12/12/making-makers-los-angeles</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>We ran a successful Kickstarter campaign and reached our goal in the first 30 hours, proving that there is demand and interest in the maker movement and project-based learning.</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>We have developed and have begun running a student research program whereby students are mentored in the development of their own research projects as well as getting them involved with current research projects. Our current partners are the environmental monitoring group Safecast, the American Physics Society, the West Side Science Club, the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles, University of Southern California, and the California Institute of Technology.</p>
