  Despite the economic downturn and budget reductions we have grown attendance
  at CAAM over the last 10 years from35K to over 100,000 visitors representing
  an average 20% increase each year. We are now presenting 80+ public programs
  each year and 9 — 13 exhibitions while continuing to maintain an active and
  growing research library and collection. We are proud of these numbers and
  equally as proud that they represent a connection to content that has ranged
  from presenting the more than 20 exhibitions that have been directly related
  to telling the story of the African Diaspora around the world…and all still
  for Free Admission! We have proudly collaborated with numerous organizations
  from the Skirball Cultural Center to the Japanese American National Museum,
  the Chinese American Museum and others like Self Help Graphics to the obvious
  connections with the Watts Towers, St. Elmo’s Village, and commercial
  galleries owned by African Americans. We encourage artmaking and training by
  children and showcase the work of other organizations serving this purpose
  like Ryman Arts. But perhaps we are just as proud of our outreach efforts with
  Target that were designed to allow us to showcase the achievements and
  contributions of the African American and collaborative communities through
  our Target Sundays at CAAM programs. Through this effort, we have not only
  created places for the community to showcase what they do but this showcasing
  of talent also included bringing to the public important discussions and
  representatives that could assist with everything from healthy living to
  safety in the water. Target Sundays even helped us create our Artpreneur
  program making it possible for solo art entrepreneurs to have a place to sell
  and expose audiences to their work and earn income accordingly. Our most
  heartfelt achievement is the growth of our Young Docents program having grown
  it from a 2 person 4 week program that is an integral part of our program
  today employing, training and educating 30 high school youth year round for
  their personal and professional career development.
