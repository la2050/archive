  UNIQUE LA has created the largest buy local design show in the country - and
  is the only show to curate and show-off local-made talent. We have brought
  international attention to LA and its great makers (press mentions have
  included Details Magazine, Elle France, Uppercase). In four years we've had
  amazing successes and have expanded in many ways, but I think these numbers
  illustrate the great impact we've had.
   
   
   
   
   
   - 232,000 people have attended UNIQUE shows
   
   
   - We've provided a platform for sales and exposure for over 8000 independent designers + artists
   
   
   - Occupied a total of 424,000 square feet! 
   
   
   - Produced shows in 3 cities, LA/NYC/SF 
   
   
   - An estimated $9.3 million has been spent at UNIQUE shows (all that money goes right back into the local economy)
