  WUF will sponsor a first-ever one-day conference to celebrate the Westside,
  discuss common challenges, and identify projects to make the Westside more
  lively, equitable, and functional.

  - Westside
project_measure: >-
  The primarily measure of success will be the number and diversity of
  attendees. The secondary measure will be the proposal and execution of three
  projects that will arise from the proceedings. Attendees will vote on project
  proposals and then pledge to contribute to one of the projects, and progress
  will be tracked throughout the year. This way, the conference will have a
  lasting impact beyond the relationships and ideas that arise at the event
  itself.

  The Westside of Los Angeles is home to more people than all but a handful of
  American cities in their entirety. And yet, because of the region's
  combination of independent jurisdictions, the Westside is more of an idea than
  an entity. As the Westside's leading civic organization, WUF proposes a
  day-long conference to gather leaders and stakeholders from across the
  Westside spectrum to solve common challenges, seize upon common opportunities,
  and identify projects to pursue in the coming year.

  - Government responsiveness to residents’ needs
  - Public transit riders
  - Participation in neighborhood councils
  - Residential segregation

  The Westside of Los Angeles includes some of the most distinctive, prized real
  estate in the country, with resources and attributes that eclipse those of
  entire cities. And yet, the Westside faces significant challenges. Some
  challenges are obvious, such as the tragedy of homelessness, the annoyance of
  traffic, and the hardship of exorbitant real estate prices. Other challenges
  are more subtle, such as the region's lack of diversity and, sometimes, lack
  of neighborliness, and debates over regional character and the role of
  businesses versus the role of residents. Jurisdictional challenges make these
  problems hard to solve. Likewise, the distance to L.A. City Hall means that,
  despite the dedication of local officials, the Westside's largest jurisdiction
  is effectively governed from afar. 


  The Westside Urban Forum has always viewed and celebrated the Westside as a
  single entity with a common fate and intertwined relationships. WUF's Westside
  Conference, to take place in 2017, will seek to connect civic leaders and
  everyday stakeholders of all walks of life and from all corners of the region
  in order to develop a stronger sense of shared identity, address region-wide
  problems, and celebrate region-wide assets. 


  This conference will include traditional and nontraditional components. The
  former will include keynote speeches and panel discussions with local leaders.
  The latter will include 'un-conference' sessions in which attendees set their
  own agendas and create their own programming. 


  The conference will culminate with crowdsourced proposals for projects that
  attendees will vote on -- choosing three winners -- and pledge to support in
  the coming year. The Westside Conference will physically connect Westsiders
  for a single day but seeks to bring them together emotionally and politically
  for far longer. With LA 2050's support, we hope to reach out to Westside
  stakeholders who do not typically participate in events like this in order to
  a create sense of unity, cooperation, and friendliness among neighbors.
