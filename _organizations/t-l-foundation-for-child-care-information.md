  In an effort to determine the success and adjustments necessary regarding this
  pilot project, we will create an evaluation tool - two surveys - to be taken
  before the first culinary box is delivered and one after the final one is
  delivered (6 months later).  One will be directed toward what made them want
  to participate, assess what their current culinary skills are, children’s
  participation in food preparation, what access to healthful foods are in their
  area, assess current parent engagement in regard to food served at the child
  care, and the child care providers' assessment of the foods served in her
  care.  This will help us assess if the culinary box had any impact on the
  foods served, children’s learning experience, the parent’s engagement as well
  as determine if we accurately set expectations for usage of the culinary box
  in the child care setting.  


  The second survey will help us determine the success of the box itself -
  responses to recipes, ingredients, delivery process, materials, tools, themes
  and lessons.  This will help us determine if they would recommend it to other
  community members, if they would continue to order the box on their own, if
  they would seek out a grant to continue receiving the box and if they thought
  the children and their program benefited from the program and delivery as a
  whole. 

  We will also conduct in person interviews with the providers, children,
  sponsors and parents to get a deeper understanding of their perceptions of the
  project.

  Child care providers are empowered to try new foods and skills with Culinary
  Skills in a Box. Thematic recipes, skills, tools and incentives are delivered
  monthly to a child care provider’s home, including the recipe ingredients!
  This project increases access and willingness to try new foods. The box is 
  focused on helping the provider introduce culinary skills and healthful foods
  to children. Culinary skills and food delivery addresses childhood obesity and
  food access issues in L.A. County.

  We will make L.A.  County the healthiest place to live by changing the
  trajectory of children’s health in targeted high need areas.  Establishing
  healthy habits for children of L.A. County in 2017 is growing the healthy
  adults of 2050. How?  Culinary Skills in a Box. 


  It has been cited time and again that a lack of home cooked meals with fresh
  foods is a contributor to obesity. It is also known that high need areas are
  often without options to purchase fresh ingredients for recipes. There are 11
  areas in L.A. County with childhood obesity rates at 30% or higher and these
  are the areas we are going to target.  Culinary Skills in a Box addresses both
  contributing factors: access to healthy foods and the childhood obesity
  epidemic.


  Culinary skills for a child enriches a culture of health by arming children
  with an arsenal of healthy habits to take with them into adulthood. Hard to
  source ingredients from a corner market? Not to worry, the ingredients for
  three healthy recipes per month are delivered too.


  How does it work?

  Delivered straight to the doorstep, monthly, is a box containing everything an
  adult needs to institute a program to teach culinary skills to children,
  motivate them and be comfortable doing so.  Each monthly kit includes 3
  illustrated recipe guides, 3 culinary skill cards, a creative kitchen project,
  kid friendly kitchen tools, online bonuses and lesson plans.  Don’t forget the
  aprons children get to wear while they are cooking and a magnet to
  congratulate them for a task well done. The ingredients for the recipes
  included in the box will also be delivered.


  Why In Home Child Care? 

  The impact is greater and long lasting. We will pilot this with 50 child care
  providers participating in the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) who
  have 6 full-time children.  We can reach 300 children with introductions to
  kitchen skills and healthy fresh foods, taking home what they’ve learned
  through provider/parent/child interaction.  After participation in the project
  providers will be comfortable with new skills and recipes that they can
  introduce to families who join their care for years to come.


  After the successful pilot, we can take this to other providers in L.A. county
  and potentially reach the more than 78,000 children in licensed in home child
  care.
