  Heavy use -- particularly near schools. And the establishment of programs that
  facilitate learning and opportunities for public art -- such as the
  establishment of a public arts program that will create unique,
  community-based art, for each 'Jutout' park.

  To create a series of cantilevered 'Jutout' parklets overlooking Los Angeles
  waterways -- with a priority of installing the parklets in park poor
  communities.

  - Social & emotional support
  - Cultural events
  - Public/open streets gatherings
  - Government responsiveness to residentsâ€™ needs
  - Public transit riders
  - Participation in neighborhood councils
  - Rates of volunteerism
project_proposal_best_place: >-
  The priority will be to create the 'Jutout' overlook parklets adjacent to
  schools -- such as one next to Vista Middle School in Panorama City, and one
  adjacent to Grant High School in North Hollywood. The existing infrastructure
  of sidewalks that cross the L.A. River and L.A.'s washes provide a unique
  opportunity for parklet/viewing platforms that overlook the waterways. These
  road and sidewalk overpasses are strewn throughout Los Angeles -- which
  provides ample opportunities for researching and selecting sites that are
  closest to heavily populated areas -- within walking distances to dense urban
  environments. A priority will be to first build the parklets in park poor
  communities.


  Given the lack of land available to build parks and plazas in urban Los
  Angeles; I feel this is a good solution for creating more park space in Los
  Angeles by 2050. There are tons of these overpasses throughout Los Angeles
  that people just pass through; what if these overpasses instead become places
  -- places where people can connect and idle whilst viewing and learning about
  L.A.'s urban waterway system -- seeing both the complexity and beauty in its
  natural elements and its engineered elements.


  These overpass parklets would be different than the current parklet model seen
  across the U.S.; different as they will be grade separated (above curbs and on
  the outside edges of sidewalks) from traffic -- making them much safer than
  parking spot parklets -- where the risk of cars running into parking spot
  parklets is high.
