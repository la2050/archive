  For Girls in Tech to achieve its objectivesensure that more women get access
  and opportunities in the tech industry, we need partners. As we are currently
  based in 60 cities around the world we have a strong relationship with
  government officials, corporations and startups and have a successful track
  record of working with partners, sponsors and collaborators. Previous sponsors
  include Facebook and Jim McCarthy for bootcamps; for the Catalyst Conference,
  partners include Intel and GoDaddy.

  To maintain quality as we grow, we’d like to increase our focus on program
  reporting. This would include eSurveys, a program analytics platform, a
  program out comes report that covers KPIs (submitted by mentors to report on
  entrepreneurs’ progress), as well as a post-program review with our board,
  including a detailed budget review. We would also offer participants access to
  quarterly, free webinars. These webinars will focus on topics related to the
  entrepreneurship journey, such as pitching, negotiation, business model
  development and more. We’ll be able to measure the engagement and
  participation of each attendee at these webinars, as well as the progress each
  entrepreneur is making with their startup.


  To capture a comprehensive analysis of the impact the Catalyst Conference has
  on attendees, Girls in Tech will be asking each attendee to make a pledge.
  Their pledge must relate to entrepreneurship, a problem they wish to solve,
  and we will follow up with attendees monthly. 


  These programs all provide tremendous access and support to women in tech, at
  all levels of their careers. Not only do they gain access to our proprietary
  curriculum, they also gain access to possible board member introductions,
  high-quality speakers and a global support system. This puts them in the
  position to gain access to an all-inclusive tech “ecosystem” - other women,
  partners, intrapreneurs, technorati, and more. For women in tech, a support
  system such as this can be career changing.

  GIT aims to eradicate gender disparities in STEM (science, technology,
  engineering, mathematics) fields by educating, preparing and empowering women
  to pursue technology careers and persevere within technology fields. We
  achieve this through the creation of proprietary, innovative programming and
  strategic global partnerships. We provide mentorship and boot camp programs as
  well as the Catalyst Conference, an annual conference for women in tech.

  Girls in Tech has a chapter in LA which already focuses on bringing innovation
  and entrepreneurship to the area as well as encouraging diversity within the
  local community. We plan to expand on this and make LA the best place to
  Create by providing women at every stage in their career the tools and
  confidence to find roles within the tech industry. We understand that this is
  an epidemic challenge, with more than half the workforce being women, yet only
  15% holding technical positions, despite a growing demand for technical roles
  in LA.


  To funnel more women into tech careers and eradicate gender disparities in
  STEM fields, Girls in Tech seeks to provide training and education to women
  who are entering, or have an interest in, careers within STEM. To accomplish
  this, Girls in Tech would launch a Success Factors Boot Camp, a three-day
  course that teaches female entrepreneurs all the basic tools they need to
  succeed, from ideation to product development to pivoting. In this 3-part
  series, the participants of this GIT program will develop skills that they
  will hone and leverage session over session, using best-in-class methods and
  current research for maximum engagement and retention.  All participants leave
  with actionable skills, rich interactions with fellow participants, and
  critical knowledge that they will use and apply for a long time to come. We
  are also bringing an e-mentorship platform that can further support
  participants both in person and online so that progress can be effectively
  reached and measured. We want to ensure that we can bring our bootcamps to LA
  with the aim to educate aspiring entrepreneurs and women with technical
  backgrounds on how to build and launch a company; increase the number of women
  launching startups and secure seed funding; connect seasoned entrepreneurs and
  professionals with aspiring entrepreneurs for long-term, ongoing mentoring and
  sponsoring purposes. 

  In addition to this, we would expand the Catalyst Conference to become a
  semi-annual event allowing GIT to host the conference in additional locations
  every year. The conference has been lauded for its ability to bring women in
  tech from around the world to one location to explore opportunities, learn and
  network with some of the lead thinkers and innovators. GIT will bring this
  tech community to LA and ensure that we increase LA's visibility in the tech
  scene, and help it attract a diverse community of thinkers, leaders, investors
  and entrepreneurs whilst working with local communities to create a
  sustainable tech workforce with gender parity as the key focus.
