  Thomas Starr King Middle School has been educating students since 1926. Our
  students speak over thirty languages and come from more than forty different
  countries, representing a vibrant and diverse cross-section of cultures in Los
  Angeles. Although we are not a Title I school, nearly 60% of our students
  qualify for assisted lunch.


  Until very recently, King was struggling with low test scores and poor student
  engagement. Over the past several years, our parents, teachers, staff and
  students have worked very hard together to address many of these concerns. In
  2013, King converted into a full magnet school and has seen one of the highest
  test score boosts in LAUSD’s history. We have also become one of the most
  desirable Middle Schools in our area. King has performed phenomenally over the
  last several years, but our play facilities have not progressed at the same
  pace. Please help us give King students and our neighboring schools the
  equipment and facilities necessary for sports, art, filming, performance and
  play. 



  Once upgrades are completed, we hope to see an increase in community events
  planned at our school of 20%.


  We hope to see an increase in King events of 25%.


  We plan to open our facilities to even more neighboring elementary schools for
  performances and other events.

  Our proposal is to upgrade T.S. King Middle School’s play spaces, embracing
  the ideals of all three of our magnet programs – Arts and Tech, Environmental
  STEAM, and Film & Media. This includes upgrading the sound in our film studio
  and auditorium, refurbishing our outdoor amphitheater, as well as resurfacing
  our playing field. These changes will benefit the over 2,100 students
  attending King, while providing greater entertainment and recreational
  opportunities for our surrounding neighbors.
project_proposal_impact:
  - Access to open space and park facilities
  - Number (and quality) of informal spaces for play
  - Number of children enrolled in afterschool programs
  - Per capita crime rates
  - Perceived safety

  Thomas Starr King Middle School has long been a cultural and artistic hub for
  our local communities and beyond, and a place for community members to play
  and recreate. While we service students from the immediate area, we also pride
  ourselves in being a true magnet, where we bus students in from all over the
  city. Currently, our southern most stop is 95th near Vermont, as far east as
  Soto/6th, as far north as Peoria near Roscoe/Sun Valley.  Children from all
  over Northeast Los Angeles gather to play AYSO soccer on our field. We host
  events for Ivanhoe and Franklin Elementary Schools in our auditorium and on
  our field. We screen films for the community and broadcast sporting events,
  bringing the community together. We host community field days, featuring
  skateboard demonstrations paired with art shows, as well as offer community
  garden days with our partner EnrichLA. Our community events invite the public
  onto campus as we champion creative and athletic play. In a park poor
  neighborhood, at the nexus of East Hollywood, Los Feliz and Silver Lake, the
  facilities at Thomas Starr King Middle School are a key play resource for our
  community.


  Unfortunately, due to severe budget cuts in LAUSD over the past several years,
  our facilities are in a sad state of disrepair. Our field is worn out, and too
  hot from the exposed crumb rubber, creating a dramatic heat island effect that
  makes the surface significantly less playable. As the crumb rubber migrates
  off the field, it is also becoming harder and poses greater risk of
  concussion. The field is also desperately in need of drainage upgrades, so
  that runoff may naturally feed the arroyo that runs through our school. Our
  recording and audio equipment are severely outdated, making it difficult for
  participants to hear theatrical performances and film screenings of student
  work and others. Our beautiful outdoor amphitheater is in a state of disrepair
  and in desperate need of ground cover and shade trees. This area serves as a
  place for students to play hacky sack and just run around a little during the
  day. It is also a scene of bi-weekly dance parties put on by student DJs, and
  has the potential to be a regularly working outdoor theater and alternative
  physical education space. All of these facilities are used regularly by King
  students, as well as the community-at-large. We would like to restore and
  upgrade them, applying the core tenets from all three of our magnet programs,
  including embracing the importance of the arts for Arts & Technology,
  respecting sustainability concerns for Environmental STEAM and honoring the
  importance of Film and Media here in Los Angeles.
