  58-12 Design Lab is a 501(c)(3) non-profit charitable organization formed and
  registered in the State of California. In 2009, three friends at UCLA who were
  going into architecture, law, and business sought to use the power of good
  design in order create positive social change. They embarked on a journey that
  led them somewhere between anthropology, journalism, and design and this
  unique approach has continued as the organization now focuses on place-based,
  social research and media production that reveals the overlooked, the
  misunderstood, and the opaque.

   Our organizations achievements are intimate, personal, and real: we engage directly with disenfranchised communities to make their stories heard. We are strong believers in the power of storytelling, and the achievements we are most proud of include a multi-media journalistic exploration of migrant workers around the 2008 World Expo in Shanghai, another exploration of an amazing community of people that live in buses in Venice, and a public awareness campaign for Los Angeles that encourages people to meet their neighbors.

   We have also partnered with a number of individuals and institutions in order to achieve our goals, including designers, storytellers, researchers, and cool folks like the people at metaLAB at Harvard. They developed a web application called Zeega that we are currently working with to tell the story of Hmong communities in California, among other things.
