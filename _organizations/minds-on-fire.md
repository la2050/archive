  Minds on Fire is in the start-up phase. However, the organization’s founder
  created and piloted a similar model in New York City public schools as part of
  Mayor Bloomberg’s inaugural NYC Civic Corps in 2009, an initiative launched in
  partnership with AmeriCorps VISTA to engage people across that city in
  volunteerism. The Minds on Fire model is shaped by the successes and learnings
  taken from that pilot, in combination with a deep understanding of the Los
  Angeles education landscape and challenges specific to our school system.
   
   
   
   
   
   In the NYC Civic Corps program, a three-member team of VISTA Volunteers engaged 197 student- and teacher-leaders and 4,721 students across 58 schools in the development and implementation of service and service learning opportunities.
