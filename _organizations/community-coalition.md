org_summary: "<p>Community Coalition hopes to build on its major accomplishments from its 20-year history to broaden the impact of its policies victories in the future. The most notable victories are in the arenas of public safety, child welfare and education:</p>\n \n \n \n \n \n <p>Public Safety\n \n \n â€¢ One of the Coalitionâ€™s first campaigns â€œRebuild South Central Without Liquor Storesâ€\x9D led to national recognition and implementation of the Coalitionâ€™s public health model, which uses nuisance abatement and land use policy to improve public safety. After the 1992 Civil Unrest, this campaign led to the prevention of the rebuilding of over 150 liquor stores that were destroyed. Following this success, Coalition members helped author the citywide Nuisance Abatement Ordinance that was passed in 2008 with support from City Councilwoman Jan Perry. </p>\n \n \n \n \n \n <p>Child Welfare\n \n \n â€¢ In 2004, South LA relative caregivers helped Community Coalition along with Casey Family Programs, the nationâ€™s largest provider of private foster care, secure and establish a kinship-care support center in South LA, the first ever in the region to combine services with advocacy and community organizing. Community Coalitionâ€™s Relative Caregivers have been one of the first organized and politicized constituencies in the nation to advocate around kinship-care policies and engage elected officials around providing relative caregivers public resources. Community Coalition has won significant and important victories over the years including reaching greater parity in the amount of monthly government payments compared to their foster care counterparts. </p>\n \n \n \n \n \n <p>Education\n \n \n â€¢ The â€œEqual Access to College Prepâ€\x9D campaign achieved the landmark A-G Resolution in 2005, mandating that A-G college preparatory curriculum be made available in all schools in LAUSD. Coalition youth leaders recognized that the majority of South LA youth were not on track to graduate and were ineligible for college based on college pre-requirements. In this five-year effort, the Coalition trained student leaders to engage with elected officials and decision-makers. The Coalition also co-founded Communities for Educ</p>"
