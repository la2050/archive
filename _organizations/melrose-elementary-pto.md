  Melrose Elementary PTO supports a culturally supportive, technologically-rich
  environment where a diverse student population can work collaboratively with
  creativity and innovation. Ensuring that our students do not miss learning
  opportunities due to lack of access to technology is vital to fulfilling our
  mission of providing a quality education in the STEAM disciplines. We define
  success for this project as full implementation of our self-sustaining tech
  renewal initiative. Operating our 1-1 tech program free from district funding
  is a key component of our ability to keep pace with changing technology
  regardless of current funding models for public schools and ongoing district
  budget cuts. We measure success based on the following:


  - Percent of students that have access to fully functioning technology
  equipment: Goal=100%  

  - Percent of the cost for maintaining that equipment that is covered by our
  organization’s existing fundraising activities: Goal=100%  

  - Percent of students who complete Digital Citizenship training: Goal=100% 

  - Percent of teachers who receive ongoing professional development to fully
  utilize our technology:Goal=100%

  Melrose Magnet seeks to close the digital divide by ensuring all students,
  regardless of income or ethnicity, have access to 21st century skills and
  technology. Our 1-to-1 integrated computing program engages students to use
  technology as a powerful tool to investigate, collaborate, and bring ideas to
  life. Completing the final phase of a self-sustaining tech renewal project
  will support our mission for students to become self-sufficient learners and
  creators in all aspects of their work.

  The importance of quality primary education has proven time and again to be a
  crucial stepping stone in allowing students to continue on to college and
  beyond. Our young students have so much potential, but we must invest in them,
  give them the tools they need to succeed. Melrose Elementary
  Math/Science/Technology Magnet’s 1 to 1 tech program simultaneously fosters
  our students’ self confidence in their own abilities as they are trusted with
  the responsibility of using and maintaining a new laptop or tablet, while it
  also engages them, creating lifelong learners, leveraging fascination with
  computers for fun and creativity with learning. Alongside required Common Core
  standards, they are taught skills likes coding, film making, and blogging -
  vital to continued interest and their future world. But even more important,
  this program emphasizes the use of technology as a tool, not an end unto
  itself.  Our students become self-sufficient learners and creators in all
  aspects of their work. They begin to see school as a place where they come to
  create knowledge, not just learn by rote, they become engaged as a partner,
  dedicated to their own success.


  Our award winning success with this program so far also allows Melrose to
  reach beyond our own walls. As a recipient of both the School of Excellence
  and Distinction awards from the Magnet Schools of America, Melrose will be a
  host school for this year’s MSA’s National Conference, bringing principals,
  teachers, and administrators from across the country. Melrose Elementary is
  built upon a bedrock commitment to alleviate harms of racial isolation by
  creating a culture of excellence that attracts students from diverse
  communities. As a Magnet school, de facto segregation is addressed through
  LAUSD transportation services for students living beyond a two-mile radius
  from our school, while extending our reach to a wider variety of ethnic and
  socio-economic groups. Also, the newer iPads that would be purchased with this
  grant funding have a greatly heightened dictation capacity. This will help
  bridge the achievement gap of our English Language Learners and our DHH (Deaf
  and Hard of Hearing) students.


  On the surface, it might seem that our need for iPads is like many others. But
  it is actually so much more. It is the final brick in the foundation of an
  incredibly successful tech integration program that could become a model for
  other schools struggling to meet the needs of their students in our ever more
  tech-centered world.
