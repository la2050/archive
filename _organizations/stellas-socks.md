organization_activity: >-
  Stella’s Socks is a 501c3 started by 13-year old Stella Vaughan Verk and her
  father, Jonathan which procures and distributes 100,000 pairs of socks to
  homeless and homeless youth across Los Angeles.
project_proposal_description: >-
  As an upstart organization, we have been largely self-funded. We require
  financial assistance to continue our efforts, stabilize our operations and
  scale to provide other necessary items. We are looking to inspire other kids
  to start-up their own organization or movement to help combat homelessness in
  their community.

  The homelessness crisis in Los Angeles is profound. In every neighborhood and
  every community, from the beaches to Riverside 55,000 of our fellow citizens
  sleep on the streets of our city. And as the political tide turns for the
  right, less and less resources are being made available to them. Through our
  social media, website and monthly Sock Sesh’ Community Meetups, we engage
  people all across Los Angeles. Sock sessions inspire kids and families to get
  involved and connect with their community. From Venice Beach to Skid Row, We
  motivate young families to ‘give back’ and make our city spectacular.
  Inspiring Angelinos to work together for the greater good of the city and
  their struggling neighbors living on the streets. The experiences our
  volunteers, young & old, have had is something we want to expand. We’ve had
  kids out at 8am on Venice Beach, barely awake and partially upset they have to
  be up so early on the weekend and by the end of our sock session everyone is
  laughing, having a great time and interacting with our homeless population,
  because they often are the ones who get overlooked and sometimes feel
  invisible. Angelenos of all economic backgrounds need to work together to make
  our communities thrive and we hope with Stella’s Socks that we can be that
  bridge.
project_proposal_engage: >-
  Not only does Stella’s Socks provide opportunities for Angelenos to
  participate in a fun, exciting activity helping the homeless, but we like to
  think that by engaging with our homeless neighbors we provide them an
  opportunity to have human connections as well. It is amazing to bridge the gap
  between our communities (those doing well and those not) because we are all
  human and we want children to realize that at a young age. Homelessness can
  happen to anyone and without help these people cannot get back on their feet!
  Kids need to know there is more to life than social media and burst out of the
  bubble and their comfort zone (at first) to experience this humbling
  opportunity!
project_measure: |-
  Our success will be measured in several ways:
   
   1. Our ability to consistently provide new socks to the homeless
   
   Increasing the amount of unique individuals that engage in our monthly sock sessions
   
   2. Continue to develop new sock/clothing partners to procure additional inventory
   
   3. Solidify a scalable, replicable process for distributing 10,000 Socks/month to 25+ organizational partners
project_five_years: >-
  I definitely hope that Stella’s Socks spreads across the country. I Would like
  to have Stella’s Socks in 5 of the major cities battling homelessness. I think
  this is a very achievable goal. We can have other kids run the branches and we
  would get together to do an event all together each and every year. Maybe we
  can do the barefoot run we mentioned earlier and get all of the branches
  together to participate! The possibilities are endless. Stella also recently
  spoke at an LA City City Counsel and was recognized with an award from
  councilman Mike Bonin for her work in the community. We would love to see more
  youth advocating at their local city counsels and fight homelessness and get
  support from their councilmen/women.
