  Ten years ago I was a schoolteacher for special education, focused on violent
  offenders age 12-21. 
   
   
   
   
   
   In one program I designed we taught teens to read by using their own music, asking them to rap freestyle into the computer and then sending them home with a CD, their lyrics and the assignment to produce a 2 song album in 9 weeks. Not only did all students complete the assignment, a large portion of the students improved their reading and writing tremendously, many jumping multiple grade levels in a matter of weeks while showing great motivation for the process of creative music production. Two students won demos in local studios for recording contracts and overall engagement and retention of this at-risk population was the highest we witnessed in years of teaching.
   
   
   
   
   
   I saw the sadness, desperation, the expressions of fear that come from feeling lost - and I also saw that the creative arts education can rapidly change this situation and the motivation of the individual learner.
   
   
   
   
   
   Our team at EDDEFY met at Singularity University's graduate program in 2012 at NASA/Ames where we galvanized around a mission to provide educational access to anyone, anywhere, anytime. We saw mobility, ubiquity of resources, tracking and personalization to be essential along with sharing the most engaging learning opportunities available to motivate individuals to be their best and achieve their goals. 
   
   
   
   
   
   Many of us could not SEE THE PATH TO MASTERY and so we began creating the EDDEFY toolkit and this MASTERY campaign for Los Angeles. We aim to map and visualize learning for the city of LA.
   
   
   
   
   
   So far we have shared the EDDEFY tools in development at startup/technology pitch sessions and at the educational GetIdeas Conference. This week we shared our work at DigitalLA and we will be demoing our product at technology events in LA this year.
   
   
   
   
   
   Previously my work included transmedia production challenges for audiences of all ages:
   
   
   * Creating arts events and collaborations including
   
   
   * Festivals, big events and social connectedness games
   
   
   * Educational reform through creative pedagogy and curricula
   
   
   * Cause campaigns for major nonprofits around the world, engaging storytellers to share their work effectively and build momentum for thousands of causes
   
   
   
   
   
   My team has collectively over 2 decades of experience in formal and informal learning settings along with 3 decades of nonprofit management experience and a vast pool of technology tools and expertise to bring to this process. My cofounders include two PhDs in data sciences for analysis and mapping of the insights we find through this campaign and we won awards in our graduate program for our ability to navigate the subtle challenges of the educational field using the EDDEFY toolkit.
   
   
   
   
   
   I have served in government, lobbied for computers in all schools when I was 7 years old and continue my lifelong work empowering others to be their best through any media available.
   
   
   
   
   
   Our network collectively reaches over 100,000 experts in Los Angeles.
