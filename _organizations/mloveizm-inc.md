  From working, guiding, promoting, encouraging and teaching artists, we have
  seen them go on to attain more jobs as entrepreneurs, build their own brands,
  manage their creative and business time, and develop confidence in heart and
  mind. We have impacted Artists in knowledge, perspective, understanding and
  wisdom in their personal life as well as provoked them to dig deeper and see
  meaning in art as well as create depth in their own work. We are pleased to
  see our imprint on individuals as they go on to transform the world in
  positive sustainable ways.
