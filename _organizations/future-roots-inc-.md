  DUBLAB's FM Initiative will be evaluated by the following metrics:


  PUBLIC FEEDBACK:


  To evaluate the response from the public, an e-mail survey will be conducted
  with participants at the end of the project’s first year. Feedback given by
  the public will be compiled with anecdotal reports from studio staff.


  MEDIA RESPONSE:


  Press received will be taken into consideration alongside public opinion.
  Positive coverage in at least three major Los Angeles media outlets will be
  considered a success. We will also take into account the depth of social media
  activity throughout the course of the initiative and the number of followers
  gained.


  Staff Review:


  The staff will conduct a review at the end of each month of operation to
  evaluate the studio's success based on enthusiasm of the audience and depth of
  engagement. At the end of the first year of operation we will determine if the
  quality of the project successfully fulfilled the initiative's goals.

  DUBLAB has received a license from the FCC to broadcast on the FM airwaves in
  Los Angeles, and would like to build our FM broadcasting capabilities with
  funding from the LA2050 grant. We will buy a transmitter, an antennae, and be
  able to hire an engineer to put it all together. The decision for dublab to
  broadcast on the FM airwaves has been a long time in the making, and is part
  of a larger organizational effort to engage more listeners with our diverse,
  freeform broadcasts.

  In its current incarnation, the Dublab radio program reaches every corner of
  the city (and the world) via its Internet stream.  Our Los Angeles listeners,
  which we have between 100,000 to 125,000 annually, are spread across the
  entire city. According to our past surveys, the location of our donors, and
  the emails we have received throughout the years, we have listeners in every
  part of the city: from South Los Angeles, to Highland Park; from East Los
  Angeles to Hollywood and everything in between. Los Angeles is the second
  largest radio market in the US, and we anticipate awareness and listenership
  of dublab programming to increase dramatically once we get on the FM
  airwaves. 


  Beginning in the throes of the internet boom of the late 1990s, dublab has
  maintained a steady, relevant presence that has out-lived countless other
  internet radio organizations. To date, we are officially the
  longest-broadcasting online station in the world. Due to our longevity and a
  desire to share music not heard on mainstream radio, dublab is recognized as a
  pioneer in the now booming field of internet radio streaming. Both an
  incubator for homegrown talent and an early champion of various LA-based
  artists, from Flying Lotus and Dam-Funk to Julia Holter and Animal Collective,
  local and international audiences consider dublab to be an anchor in LA's
  forward-thinking artistic and musical movements. While our organization is
  known internationally as a beacon of LA music and culture, it is also a hub
  where Angelenos can access contemporary sounds from around the world, and
  independent artists can find traction and airtime where they might not have
  had otherwise.


  Dublab has a long history of making LA the best place to connect. Over the
  years, dublab has presented hundreds of free concerts throughout the city of
  Los Angeles. Dublab has curated the main music stages at the Eagle Rock Music
  Festival for six years running, at the Abbot Kinney Festival for the past
  three years and, for four years, we presented a series of free, dublab curated
  concerts as part of the Levitt Pavilion summer series. Our organization has
  also contributed to numerous free, public programs at the Music Center, Getty
  Center, Hammer Museum, LACMA, Los Angeles Public Library, Santa Monica Pier,
  Grammy Museum, REDCAT, cicLAvia, and dozens of other major arts institutions
  in Los Angeles. DUBLAB also serves as a creative incubator for musicians in
  Los Angeles to develop their sonic experimentations in both live performance
  settings and studio­ based radio broadcasts.
