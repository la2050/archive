  Grown in LA is a nonprofit project of Community Partners that is converting
  underutilized land into a network of nurseries that produce plants and provide
  educational opportunities to Angelenos.

  Grown in LA and partners will reinvigorate an underutilized site in Griffith
  Park into an outdoor laboratory that grows and conducts research on
  climate-appropriate plants for cities in southern CA.

  The success of the Grown in LA Outdoor Urban Laboratory will be defined and
  measured by the following: the completion of a fully-functional propagation
  and research facility, which will be measured by the re-purposing of existing
  materials from the old nursery site when possible, the incorporation of
  locally-sourced and/or environmentally-responsible materials when appropriate,
  and the use of water- and energy-efficiency systems; the development and
  execution of cutting-edge urban ecological research, which will be measured by
  the number of research projects and their practicality of application in Los
  Angeles; the contribution of plant material to local restoration efforts,
  which will be measured by the number of plants propagated and installed in
  local Los Angeles water-wise and urban restoration projects; and the number of
  people who engage with the LAb through volunteer and research project
  opportunities as well as through educational programming.

  Grown in LA will work to reinvigorate a relic nursery in the heart of LA’s
  largest public space - Griffith Park! This project will convert an
  underutilized plot of land into an outdoor urban laboratory that will grow
  climate-appropriate plants for public parks and LA River restoration projects;
  conduct cutting-edge research on urban ecology; and engage Angelenos through
  educational opportunities.

  In the coming decades, millions of native plants will be needed for
  restoration and urban greening projects along Los Angeles’ waterways, public
  open spaces, and private properties—a supply that does not currently exist in
  the LA area. This lack of plant material seriously jeopardizes our ability to
  successfully transform LA into a more livable city. Grown in LA (GiLA) is
  working to create a more resilient Los Angeles by converting underutilized
  land within the urban core into a network of nurseries/urban ecology centers
  that provide Angelenos with both a viable source of locally-collected and
  locally-grown climate-appropriate plants, as well as much-needed opportunities
  to engage in urban conservation.


  Grown in LA seeks to create a model for civic ecology in our city by
  developing a pilot project on an underutilized nursery within Griffith
  Park—LA’s largest publicly accessible urban open space. The Grown in LA
  Outdoor Urban Laboratory (LAb) will help the City of LA’s Department of
  Recreation and Parks and the Los Angeles Parks Foundation preserve the site’s
  historic use and begin to actualize the future vision of the space as a
  facility for innovative collaboration, education and research.


  Creating a pilot nursery at this centralized location will provide a highly
  visible and accessible testing ground for innovative plant research and
  production that can translate to more efficient practices used by the public,
  agencies and other professionals. The LAb will serve as the flagship site that
  tests out best practices to be applied to other locations around the region.
  Under the scientific expertise and guidance of The Nature Conservancy, Grown
  in LA will conduct research on plant propagation techniques, climate
  adaptation, urban trees, and water management. Plants grown on site will be
  used in ecological restoration projects in Griffith Park and along the LA
  River. The site will host demonstration installations that reacquaint urban
  dwellers with nature and illustrate how ecology can regenerate and thrive in
  the midst of human activity and climate change. 


  We envision a future where public and private spaces within our region
  function as habitat for plants, pollinators, and animals--including us! People
  are a part of nature and when we enhance and engage with nature we tend to be
  healthier and happier. LA’s Mediterranean climate is rare, covering only about
  5% of land mass globally but home to over 20% of the world's biodiversity. Our
  climate is also one reason so many people want to live in LA, so we need to
  create a model for working with it instead of against it. Investing in the
  upstart of the Grown in LA Outdoor Urban Laboratory will help to develop this
  model and promote healthier habitats in LA that are livable for plants,
  wildlife, and Angelenos--ultimately transforming our region into a metropolis
  that works in harmony with Mother Nature.
