  Technology has changed the way we do business, pursue education, find jobs,
  and communicate. Yet in the country that invented the Internet, nearly one in
  five Americans (64 million), disproportionately from low-income and minority
  communities, are not connected to the Internet at home, forcing them to use
  inconvenient public sources to access basic services. The global impact of the
  digital divide lies in how it compounds and deepens other social inequalities.
  For example, 80% of K-12 students need Internet to do homework, 90% of college
  applications are filled out online, and 90% of job applications are hosted
  online. An unemployed person who has Internet at home will be employed over
  seven weeks faster, due to availability of online job search platforms and
  advice, which translates into over $5,000 in additional income over a year.
  Across the realms of education, employment, and beyond, the means of
  advancement are digital in this day and age. 
   
   
   
   EveryoneOn is committed to eliminating the digital divide by making high-speed, low-cost internet, computers/tablets, and free digital literacy training accessible to all unconnected people in the U.S. By employing a dynamic strategy through the Digital Equity Champion Initiative, we plan to connect low-income households throughout the county, a population that is dramatically underserved and the least likely to be connected. If we can eliminate the digital divide within low-income communities with this initiative, we can use connectivity to create social mobility for all. 
   
   
   
   Connecting people to the internet creates opportunities for an abundance of connections. Internet connectivity is imperative in providing all Los Angeles students with access to early education programs, the capability to graduate from high school and be college and career ready, and acts as a key tool in parents ability to be engaged and empowered to direct their childrenâ€™s learning. Connecting through social media, technological products and an increasingly interconnected society allows residents to feel like the world is their backyard. Today, the ultimate vehicle for opportunity is through the internet.
project_proposal_engage: >-
  Working with local partner organizations that support low-income communities,
  we seek to add a question around home internet access to existing processes
  for various benefit and assistance programs. Our challenge will seek to
  increase capacity in each organization and highlight the increased return on
  investment through employee hours and increased access to online resources for
  residents. Being online is so critical for nearly everything you do today,
  from applying to social services to submitting job applications and turning in
  homework for students. It is imperative that stakeholder organizations that
  are anchors in their community be equipped with the tools and resources
  necessary to support residents attempting to navigate barriers to access.
project_measure: >-
  EveryoneOn on will track the number of low-income people in public housing who
  receive connectivity and get connected to the Internet at home, tracking
  outcomes in education post connectivity. In short, not only will we track the
  actual number of Internet adoptions, but the benefits of which these adoptions
  yield long term results in regards to educational progress and economic
  mobility. Through local data collection, on the ground surveys, standardized
  questions, and real time evaluations, we will be able to analyze the
  effectiveness of our outputs versus outcomes, measuring our findings against
  comparable data. Rigorous monitoring and evaluation for EveryoneOn thus far
  has yielded useful insights which have guided our overall operations. In
  addition, we plan to highlight success stories to help show the real life
  impact that digital inclusion provides.
project_five_years: >-
  We hope that this activation will allow us to sunset our efforts in Los
  Angeles County because the work of digital inclusion will be integrated in
  existing processes within anchor organizations and community stakeholders that
  are already doing work with low-income populations. By empowering the
  organizations to take up this work, we will no longer be needed.
