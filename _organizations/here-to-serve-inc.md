  We define success in two ways:

  1) The number of families we are able to serve and meet all their needs and

  2) Each family's review of how Here to Serve met their needs via survey at the
  end of treatment.

  As one family we served put it: “Here to Serve does not count success by
  providing a lot of people with band aid solutions. Here to Serve comes through
  during the deepest, darkest, most stressful time that a parent can face. When
  a child is gravely ill, Here to Serve is there to help families bridge the gap
  from heart ache and catastrophe to a new life which sadly doesn't always
  include their child.” Leilani O'Dell


  We survey our families asking about the services we provided, and the tangible
  support we were able to give. Here to Serve has been named by Great Nonprofits
  (www.greatnonprofits.org) as a 2014 Top-Rated Nonprofit as it appears on
  Guidestar and we have received no less than 5 stars on EVERY review submitted.
  What demonstrates our success most is how many of our families come out of
  these difficult journeys emotionally, physically and financially healthy,
  keeping their jobs and 75% give back, often volunteering at Here to Serve and
  other nonprofits!


  If we are able to continue our 5-star rating by our clients, keep caregivers
  (parents) healthy, physically, emotionally and financially, employed and able
  to give back (to Here to Serve or other nonprofits) after their journey with
  their critically ill child or parent is over, we count that a measurable
  success!

  Because caregivers face a 63% increase in illness and death, represent 62% of
  all bankruptcies, and lose 25% productivity at work, Here to Serve CONNECTS
  and organizes people, businesses and other charities with families in crisis
  to provide non-medical assistance. Here to Serve stands in the gap to provide
  communication and assistance with critical needs: meals, child, pet home care,
  respite, housekeeping, fundraising, and medical updates to avoid physical
  collapse of family and caregiver.

  Here to Serve believes that young families who face the life-threatening
  health crisis of a child or spouse should not be left to collapse under the
  strain of a health care system that treats physical wounds, but inflicts
  fiscal and emotional ones because caregivers/parents are unable or lack the
  physical and emotional resources to CONNECT with a community of support around
  them to help manage a life in crisis. Coordinated support from family, friends
  and the community is needed to avoid the high rates of illness, death,
  bankruptcies, and lost productivity at work for parents with a critically-ill
  child or young parent who does not qualify for government support. Here to
  Serve stands in the gap to identify, mobilize and organize a community of
  support to avoid physical, emotional and financial collapse of the family and
  caregiver.


  Here to Serve believes we need to care about the well-being of lower and
  middle-class families who DO NOT qualify for government assistance, who's
  health care requires premiums and often large co-pays and no support from
  hospital social workers who are focused on patients on government assistance.
  This invisibly under-served sector of society are contributors in their
  family, community, and the economy. Here to Serve CONNECTS physical, financial
  and emotional resources to help families navigate their home life during the
  medical crisis of a child or young parent. We CONNECT people and organizations
  with them through social media and as family members hand out custom business
  cards provided by Here to Serve to register friends and loved ones on the
  family’s custom online care community. These online communities provide: an
  interactive calendar of daily household needs such as meals, child and pet
  care, house cleaning, shopping, transportation; medical updates; a blog;
  fundraising, and numerous ways to support the family. Here to Serve’s research
  coordinator demystifies and CONNECTS caregiver/families to other charities,
  businesses and organizations through our database of 3000+ organizations.


  LA offers large and diverse communities of people, charities and businesses
  who can help. Los Angeles is by far one of the top 5 cities to offer the most
  resources to people, but that also makes it the most confusing and difficult
  to navigate. Most people in LA are not connected with their communities.  When
  a life crisis hits, they flounder trying to seek small solutions to large
  issues like a meal list at church when they are in for an 18-month journey
  with a child who has cancer. These are not solutions, they are band-aids. Here
  to Serve offers real solutions by leveraging social media to CONNECT
  communities of support not just weeks but for the time needed to get the
  family through a medical crisis, usually 6 to 18 mos.


  LA is the BEST place to CONNECT and Here to Serve offers the only program and
  platform to do that when you have a young child or parent in medical crisis
  and you do not qualify for government assistance!
