  TRUST South LA works to establish community control over economic resources.
  We acquire land to be held collectively, and in perpetuity, by low-income
  community residents. Thus the land will never be subject to speculative real
  estate activities, industrial practices that compromise health, or slum
  housing practices. Use of the land will instead be directed by — and forever
  controlled by — low-income community residents, to meet the needs of their
  families and neighbors. 
   
   
   
   
   
   Important achievements include:
   
   
   Maintained a formal, voting Membership of grassroots community residents to hold ultimate authority over organizational assets and decisions, and to elect a grassroots Board of Directors.
   
   
   
   
   
   With partners, raised $5 million in equity from private and public sources for land acquisition.
   
   
   
   
   
   With the City of LA, secured: $1 million for pedestrian improvements, in a high-traffic near an elementary school; and $5 million for development of a 4 acre park in LA’s most park-poor Council District.
   
   
    
   
   
   Led the Housing Working Group of United Neighbors in Defense Against Displacement (UNIDAD) Coalition Housing Working Group during the Lorenzo community benefits agreement and USC Specific Plan campaigns, which resulted in over $20 million in funding for affordable housing, 4000 new beds of student housing, and a tenants’ rights legal clinic at USC.
   
   
   
   
   
   With the City and non-profit developer Abode Communities, advanced plans to develop the 7 acre Slauson&Wall Brownfields site with a 4 acre park, community center, and 120 affordable homes — all designed by the community.
   
   
   
   
   
   Established a vibrant Slauson&Wall Neighbor’s Organizing Committee to move forward all planning, community engagement and campaign work related to this transformative project.
   
   
   
   
   
   Used Theatre of the Oppressed as a community education and advocacy tool, including utilizing street theatre to explain dynamics of gentrification around light rail.
   
   
   
   
   
   Organized a tenant-led campaign that resulted in the owners’ agreement to sell the 48 unit, 2 acre Rolland Curtis Gardens property adjacent to USC and the Expo line, rather than displacing families to convert to student housing; and conducted a participatory planning process to rebuild as a key Transit Oriented Development with affordable housing for 140 families, bike and care share programs, and community-serving commercial uses.
   
   
   
   
   
   Brought CicLAvia to South LA, opening up the streets for thousands of people to use as recreation space, for walking, biking, running, skating, and simply hanging out — as a step in TRUST South LA’s growing mobility work which seeks to better utilize public land to serve local families.
   
   
   
   
   
   Initiated Ride South LA mapping projects as community advocacy tools, to demand equitable bike/pedestrian infrastructure investment in South LA.
