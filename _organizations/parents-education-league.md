  LA families struggle to access comprehensive, objective information on  school
  choices.


  With the support of LA2050, and in collaboration with leading childhood
  experts and area preschools, PEL will create a series of accessible, dynamic,
  purposeful and content-rich “Public Service Mini-Courses on Early Childhood
  Education” to educate families on the importance and purpose of early
  childhood education AND the methodology and criteria to find the best fitting
  early childhood environments.

  While, fortunately, there are many educational options (private, public,
  magnet, charter, etc.) in Los Angeles, families struggle to find the best
  fitting schools. Navigating these choices is well-known to be confusing,
  time-intensive and overwhelming. As a non-profit organization and Google-Grant
  recipient, PEL provides families no-cost opportunities to learn more about
  schools and educational options via its website and collaborative live events
  (speakers, workshops, panels, fairs).  PEL’s goal is to provide families a
  one-stop educational resource which is current, comprehensive and unbiased.
   
  PEL continues to thrive because it works in collaboration with families,
  schools and educational organizations to produce and deliver the most accurate
  and timely programming from the source.  The result is confident parents with
  ownership in their decisions. Equipped with knowledge, families can make the
  best choices for their children--and finding the right fit for schooling has
  proven long-term results. 


  And, school choice begins at the early stages of childhood. Decades-long
  research shows the impacts of early childhood education on future educational
  success, along with the need for easily accessible, high-quality early
  childhood centers (Naeyc.org). PEL understands that one of the first questions
  new parents are often asked is “where are you sending your child to school”?
  PEL seeks to alleviate the stress and anxiety of the school choice selection
  process and create pathways to ACCESS information about early childhood
  education.


  This pilot program will consist of a series of 8 dynamic, accessible,
  content-rich, multi-media “Public Service Mini-Courses” that will be broadcast
  throughout the greater Los Angeles-area in a multitude of languages, including
  English and Spanish.


  The content will be created in collaboration with leading childhood experts
  and local preschool directors, to include research-based evidence on the
  importance of early childhood education on the future, long-term educational
  success of children. The Mini-Courses will include the where’s and how’s of
  finding the best fitting preschool or early childhood center, criteria to look
  for in a school, the costs of schooling, including tuition-free options,
  timelines and application processes, and understanding your child’s unique
  learning style as it impacts future educational choices. 


  The 8 Mini-Courses will be delivered via a number of platforms, including
  online, radio, podcast, and webinar, and will be navigable and user-friendly
  at 5-7 minutes each.


  With the support of LA2050, we can help families feel armed with information
  and confident about their school choice process, AND we can reach families in
  every part of the Los Angeles area. We believe parent engagement improves,
  kids thrive, and schools have increased buy-in and participation from their
  families WHEN children begin their education in the BEST fitting school
  environments.
