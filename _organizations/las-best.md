  AARP Foundation Experience Corps volunteers will use evidence-based curriculum
  to tutor struggling readers attending LA's BEST after school program so they
  achieve reading proficiency by 3rd grade.

  In the pilot year of the proposed project, LA’s BEST will recruit 34 AARP
  Foundation Experience Corps (EC) volunteers to tutor and mentor 100
  kindergarten through 3rd grade students who are in need of additional support
  in language arts and literacy, as identified by teachers, parents or LA’s BEST
  program staff. Tutoring sessions will take place three times per week, and
  will be offered in small group settings, including one EC volunteer and up to
  three LA’s BEST students. 


  Over a single academic year, success will be defined by the number of LA’s
  BEST students who are tutored by EC volunteers and make at least 60% more
  progress in learning two particular reading skills – sounding out new words
  and reading comprehension – than their non-participant peers. Another measure
  of success will be the percentage of students targeted by the proposed project
  who achieve reading proficiency by the end of the third grade. 


  LA’s BEST will employ more than 2,000 young adults who reside in economically
  distressed neighborhoods to teach, coach and mentor the 25,000 children who
  attend the LA’s BEST After School Enrichment Program every day. At least 85%
  of children served will report feelings of safety while participating in LA’s
  BEST, and all LA’s BEST participants will have daily opportunities to take
  part in at least 30 minutes of physical activity and programs that promote
  proper nutrition.

  Highly trained AARP Foundation Experience Corps (EC) volunteers – retired
  Americans ages 50+ – will tutor and mentor LA’s BEST kindergarten through 3rd
  grade students to cultivate reading proficiency by the end of the 3rd grade.
  LA’s BEST program staff – teachers, mentors and coaches to the children served
  – will work alongside EC volunteers and receive training and tools to expand
  and sustain the project, while growing personally and professionally through
  invaluable intergenerational exchange.
project_proposal_impact:
  - District-wide graduation rates
  - Proficiency in English and Language Arts and Math
  - Students’ perceived sense of safety at and on the way to school
  - Youth unemployment and underemployment

  Through the proposed project and AARP Foundation Experience Corps (EC)
  evidence-based intervention using Reading A – Z curriculum, LA’s BEST will
  promote reading proficiency by the end of 3rd grade among struggling students.
  Further, children served will report perceptions of safety while participating
  in LA’s BEST, and have increased likelihood of ultimately graduating high
  school than their non-participant peers. The project also addresses the City’s
  challenge of youth underemployment, as LA’s BEST employs more than 2,000
  program staff each year – primarily young adults from the same communities as
  those served by the organization – to teach, coach and mentor the 25,000
  children served by LA’s BEST every day. Through the project, program staff
  will work alongside EC volunteers and receive training to replicate and expand
  the project. 


  In addition to making LA’s BEST the best place to LEARN, the proposed project
  will help make LA the best place to PLAY through the enrollment of 25,000
  children in the LA’s BEST After School Enrichment Program each year; the best
  place to CONNECT by providing social and emotional support to participants and
  increasing rates of volunteerism; the best place to LIVE by giving children
  daily opportunities to take part in nutrition education programs and at least
  30 minutes of physical activity during the after school hours; and, the best
  place to CREATE by offering high-quality employment opportunities to young
  adults who reside in low-income, under-served neighborhoods and meaningful
  volunteer opportunities to retired professionals.


  On average, 90% of LA’s BEST students qualify for free or reduced-price
  lunch.  Moreover, all LA’s BEST sites—Los Angeles Unified School District
  (LAUSD) elementary schools—are located in high-crime, low-income communities
  throughout Central, East and South Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley.
  English is a second language for 44% of LA’s BEST service demographic. 


  Reading proficiency by third grade is the most important predictor of high
  school graduation and career success; however, more than 80% of low-income
  children fail to meet this vital milestone. Students who work with EC tutors
  for a single school year experience more than 60% greater gains in critical
  literacy skills when compared to similar students who are not served by EC.
  They also score significantly higher on standardized reading tests. 


  Assessment results demonstrate that participation in LA’s BEST increases a
  student’s likelihood of graduating high school and decreases their chances of
  becoming involved in juvenile crime. Children report overall feelings of
  safety while participating in LA’s BEST, and program surveys show that
  children become more confident and interested in the academic content areas
  LA’s BEST intentionally infuses into enrichment activities. Finally, the
  organization is effective in helping children develop social and emotional
  skills through a pro-social approach to programming.
