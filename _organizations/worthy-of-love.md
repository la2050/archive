  The number of children in LA experiencing homelessness has increased. Worthy
  of Loves reaches to lift their souls and spirits by celebrating their
  birthdays. We have witnessed the happiness given to hundreds of children and
  their families while attending a Worthy of Love birthday party and are
  compelled to expand the parties to additional locations.

  The organization of Worthy of Love was an abstract concept at it's beginning
  but has evolved to becoming concrete in implementation. Social and emotional
  support is rooted in community connections. Community programs provide
  children living homeless shelter basic survival needs yet these programs often
  lack connecting the children with social and emotional support. Worthy of Love
  builds the bridge to connect the hearts of the children with the hearts of the
  LA Community.

  Since the onset of Worthy of Love, the numbers of volunteers has increased
  each month. Residents of LA County have connected to volunteer and recruit
  volunteers. Various social organizations have requested to remain volunteering
  their services on a rotating basis. Person after person connected with the
  mission of Worthy of Love. We have experienced increased numbers of viewers on
  social media. The cycle of friends sharing posts with friends has formed a
  network among Angelenos with a growing number. Worthy of Love does not offer a
  specific strategy to connecting people, however, it has proven to be a
  constant result after each party given. Some could say that Worthy of Love
  demonstrates Los Angeles as being the 'City of Angels'.
