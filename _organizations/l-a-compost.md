  LA Compost restores lost connections to the soil and one another.
  Cooperatively with a diverse network of partners within LA County, we
  co-create spaces for local compost access, restorative practices, and
  community empowerment. We support a healthy transition where food is never
  wasted, but returned to the soil for the next cycle of life.
