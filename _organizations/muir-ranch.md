      My students have iPods and don't wear county ankle bracelets any more. 
       
       
       
       
       
       Alondra, Jacqui, Perla and Lali, all 15-18 year-old students, help manage a 6-figure start up: schedule, distribution and payroll.
       
       
       
       
       
       They steal all the customers champagne grapes during the season. The business part of me cringes. The teacher says, "go ahead, eat them. they're good for you and the customers don't know they were in the CSA anyway."
       
       
       
       
       
       My kids know how to grow a "green zebra" tomato.
       
       
       
       
       
       We won this year's "Green Curriculum" award from the Green School Summit. We don't have an actual curriculum. We do have an actual business. As an employer what matters to you???
       
       
       
       
       
       Not a single case of food-born illness to date. Knock wood. Clean hands.
       
       
       
       
       
       We haven't missed a single CSA distribution since launch. Consistency.
       
       
       
       
       
       50 Low-income families receive free CSA boxes thanks to the Pasadena Children's Health Foundation. The wait list for other familes is 2-3 times this.
       
       
       
       
       
       We have been approved by the USDA for SNAP electronic payments.
       
       
       
       
       
       We host the LA County Master Gardeners, the largest food justice group in Los Angeles, as of this year. The LA County Master Food Preservers are not far behind.
       
       
       
       
       
       Amongst Whole Foods' Whole Kids Foundation's 2,000 plus school garden grantees our grant was 5 times the average amount and the only one given in the country as a social enterprise business. The kids are invited to Austin, Texas in 2014 for the national corporate meeting.
       
       
       
       
       
       We've brought on chef Ernie Miller of the Hollywood Farmers' Market to teach in our semi-endowed "Julia Child Culinary Chair" as the kids learn to cook chard, kale, lentils and shiso. Yes, shiso. 
       
       
       
       
       
       Our second long table dinner at Muir Ranch with chef Matthew Poley of Heirloom LA in April 14. Come eat.
