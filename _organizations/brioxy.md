  Demographically, Los Angeles is one of the most diverse cities in the country.
  Yet leadership in the social entrepreneurship and nonprofit sectors have
  struggled to reflect that diversity. 
   
   
   
   We want to activate 10,000 innovators of color in Los Angeles--who each reach 10 people to increase opportunity for everyone in Los Angeles. 
   
   
   
   Through boot camps and trainings, online engagement we will help Los Angeles become the best place for innovators of color to create.

  Brioxy will help make Los Angles the best place to create by supporting a
  generation of innovators of color to build creative spaces that drive
  community.
   
   
   
   We know that we are on the precipice of incredible change in this country. LA is leading the nation’s demographic shift as people of color become the majority of our nation. Yet as our community becomes increasingly diverse, leadership in the social entrepreneurship and nonprofit sectors have struggled to reflect that diversity. 
   
   
   
   Creative innovators drive transformative change in our communities. We believe by investing in artists and creatives of color we can help them to stay imbedded within their communities, combatting displacement, and giving communities the tools to create jobs, provide leadership and generate community wealth. 
   
   
   
   By cementing a commitment to LA’s Diverse creative scene we will not only ensure that LA remains the creative hub of California but we will do so in a way that all Angelenos see themselves reflected in our creative core. Our arts and culture sector cannot thrive if it is not equitable. 
   
   
   
   Our Cerebro Pipeline Program trains social entrepreneurs of color to build and scale solutions that increase opportunity and equity. Highly interactive, these programs give Angelenos space to practice what they are learning, build a powerful network and access critical skill building. Sessions on topics like leadership, management, governance, strategic planning, fundraising, financial management, marketing, grant writing, evaluation and more. With your vote we can help position Los Angeles to be an epicenter of creative activation for innovators of color. We see the creative industries as a core focus to building “possibility models” for our neighborhoods and communities. 
   
   
   
   These bootcamps are 4-day immersives that deliver the core tools and skills needed to run a nonprofit or startup business. Our Cerebro Pipeline centers wellness and self care—balancing that with hard skills like fundraising and financial management. We invite thought leaders and successful innovators to join each cohort for talks, meals and community as these local creatives map out how to grow their leadership and take LA’s creative industry to the next level.
project_proposal_engage: |-
  Our core activation strategies include: 
   
   Training & development through our 3-5 bootcamps and innovation labs. 
   
   Pushing a conversation through the news/OpEds to advance a diverse creative community. 
   
   Encouraging people to align their values with their actions through boycotts, digital activism, organizing their communities, volunteering and donating
   
   We also seek to help innovators of color create jobs and build wealth that has a high circulation in communities of color across Los Angeles
   
   
   
   Brioxy Innovation Labs are platforms for innovation. Our popular education based approach leverages the best of ideation: the creative process of generating, developing, and communicating new ideas—with an eye toward out of the box solutions. We bring together top thinkers in the fields of social justice, technology, media and government for a daylong immersion in systems change through a design thinking lens. These labs give us a chance to reimagine old problems through diverse lenses and engage new thinking and approaches. They also galvanize leaders across sectors, building important and valuable relationships and community.

  We close the opportunity gap for innovators of color by: 1.) Training them to
  build and run strong organizations in the communities they grew up in; 2.)
  Strengthen Los Angele’s creative ecosystem by building the pipeline of diverse
  leaders ready to take the helm of its institutions and create their own. 
   
   
   
   Regionally we are looking to see: 
   
   Support for and increase in the number of minority- and women-owned firms in LA—our programs are culturally based, draw from some of the country’s best trainers and thought leaders—with hard skills that will build resilient organizations and companies. 
   
   
   
   Increased employment of artists and creative of color within the creative industries: The gap around diversity is persistent at all levels. We need to increase employment in arts administration, CEOs, as well as artists that are featured in arts spaces across the city. 
   
   
   
   Growth in the number of arts establishments per capita in Los Angles by 2050: Creative hives are crucial to artistic and cultural vitality of LA. Artists are being displaced at an alarming rate. Increasing the number of arts establishments per capita is essential—ensuring that those at the margins, people of color, women and LGBTQ creatives are placed at the center. 
   
   
   
   We want to see the region become a center for entrepreneurial activity driven by the creative leadership of people of color, employment opportunities for artists and scaffold infrastructure that generates wealth for our city’s diverse communities.
project_five_years: >-
  Our goal is to build the infrastructure that expands opportunity in the fields
  of nonprofit social change, technology, media, philanthropy, entertainment,
  and finance, building inclusive sectors where young people of color thrive as
  the demographics of this country shift over the next two decades.
