  for our children, with and without disabilities, in our neighborhoods there
  aren't any inclusive high school options

  Several times a month the Principal will facilitate data chats with teachers
  to open dialogue, reflection and planning based on student achievement data. 
  In order to support this process, the school will systematically collect and
  analyze student data on key demographic, behavioral and proficiency
  indicators.  We will collect data through the implementation of a robust set
  of diagnostic and benchmark assessments that compliment the state standardized
  test data (SBAC, CELDT, etc.) and provide continuous information about student
  progress towards standards.  We will use a variety of assessment tools to
  allow us to measure the depth of learning and competencies.  We will consider
  what defines the growth of a student's learning, and ensure that data
  collection remains an ongoing process throughout the academic year, using both
  qualitative and quantitative measures.  Systems to measure the growth of our
  scholars will include:  Mastery Based Digital Portfolios with goal setting at
  the outset, clear learning outcomes and evidence that demonstrates the mastery
  of content, Presentations of Learning - individual service based project
  connected to an internship and a student researched community identified
  problem, Exhibitions - Gold Standard PBL projects culminating each quarter
  that allows students to demonstrate their depth of knowledge, critical
  thinking and problem-solving skills and ability to collaborate with peers on
  real-world issues and Curriculum based formative assessments.

  As many of our children are about to graduate eighth grade, they will once
  again be faced with the challenge of no inclusive school options.  WISH
  Academy is designed to build on the unique and successful model of WISH
  Charter elementary and middle school, offering a rigorous, meaningful
  curriculum for ALL students - inclusive populations of students including
  those with mild, moderate and severe disabilities, as well as students who are
  designated as being high achieving and highly gifted.

  WISH Academy will serve as a small, high-performing 9th-12th grade school that
  will model best practices for inclusive education, university partnerships and
  a constructivist, interdisciplinary approach to instruction that leverages
  technology in a rigorous college-preparatory curriculum.  All students will
  graduate from WISH Academy as collaborative, informed, resourceful and
  reflective individuals who are college-ready, career-prepared and
  community-minded.  As demonstrated by our International Fair exhibitions,
  Service Learning Culmination presentations and Annual Project open house,
  elementary and middle school students are prepared to problem-solve and be the
  environmental stewards of tomorrow.  WISH Academy will utilize best practices
  in project-based and real world learning to foster refinement of key academic,
  social and ethical skills and attitudes that can only be developed when
  students of various abilities, needs and backgrounds learn together.  There is
  a strong research base to support the education of children with disabilities
  alongside their non-disabled peers.  WISH Academy will demonstrate the
  importance and broader benefits of a high school charter partnership with a
  university.  As with our existing K-8 school, through our co-founding
  partnership with Loyola Marymount University, we will be able to provide our
  teachers with exceptional professional development by university faculty,
  offer a low student-adult ratio via LMU's student teachers, and create a
  valuable feedback loop.  In addition, LMU's counseling students will support
  our college-ready commitment by counseling secondary high school students
  about college options and ways in which students can prepare to apply for
  colleges.  Parents, community members and other industry professionals will
  bring real world learning and expertise into the classroom and beyond.  There
  is a serious need for WISH Academy.  There are very limited options for high
  schools in the area and the demand for viable high school options will only
  increase due to the proliferation of new families moving to the area employed
  by the Silicon Beach corporations in Playa Vista.  More importantly, there are
  no inclusive high school education options. Period.
