  More than 2,000 members of the public were trained by Avis Ridley-Thomas in
  the years that I oversaw the Los Angeles City Attorney's Dispute Resolution
  Program of the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney. Emeritus UCLA
  Professor Buzz Wilms initiated a class at UCLA in 2001, and hundreds of
  undergraduates have been trained as a result of that class.
