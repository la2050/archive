  If it were a district, KIPP LA would be the highest performing in Los Angeles
  County serving a majority of students from low-income communities. For nearly
  a decade, KIPP LA’s schools have been proving what is possible in raising
  student achievement in traditionally underserved low-income communities. In
  2011-12, KIPP LA’s weighted average Academic Performance Index (API) score was
  892 (800 is the statewide goal), compared to 700 in the neighboring schools of
  South and East Los Angeles. KIPP LA Prep, in Boyle Heights, is the
  highest-performing middle school in Los Angeles Unified School District for
  the second year in a row with an API of 924. Similarly, KIPP RaÃ­ces Academy,
  in East LA, outperforms 98 percent of elementary schools in California with an
  API of 961. According to the national norm-referenced SAT-10 test, 96 percent
  of KIPP LA’s kindergarteners and 94 percent of our first graders scored at or
  above the national average in English language arts. Finally, 96 percent of
  KIPP LA alumni are attending high-performing, college-prep high schools, and
  nearly 85 percent are currently enrolled in college.
