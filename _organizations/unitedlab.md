  In many instances, professional practice may have constraints that could be
  client driven or simply pertaining to ordinances and budgetary constraints. In
  my earnest efforts at overcoming such limitations by streamlining design
  operatives, I founded UNITEDLAB as a private practice in 2006. It strives to
  develop and refine said operatives by periodically participating in
  international competitions while engaging in theoretical and adaptive
  research. To that effect, chosen topics vary from architecture and landscape
  architecture to urban design and cross-disciplinary systems with locations in
  Asia, the United States, and Europe. Projects such as the Magok Waterfront and
  Busan River City are provocative urban scenarios which combine city planning
  with infrastructure, landscape, architecture, social policy, and development
  as urban expansion merges with green belts or farmland merges into cities.
  When working on these proposals it was important to understand that the city
  is not merely the sum of many objects but a kind of organism which relates to
  and is composed of those that are visible as well as numerous invisible
  variables. The Magok Waterfront Project was awarded by the American Institute
  of Architects (New York) and by the State of New York.
   
   
   In the Yongsan Park Masterplan, we proposed a project to ecologically regenerate an urban site that had been used as a military base for more than 100 years. Its location in central Seoul, as well as its proximity to Old Seoul eventually distorted its natural axis. The site needed to incorporate the historical situations of the Second World War, the Korean War, and the societal atmosphere which Korea was forced to face. Its solution demanded research about the ecology and sustainability inherent to the site. UNITEDLAB was fortunate enough to receive the ASLA Professional Award and an AIA LA Award for this project.
   
   
   More recently, I developed a research project called ‘Los Angeles Affordable Apartments,’ a multi-unit residential prototype based on traditional village housing schemes. I proposed unit prototypes for the low-income which compels pedestrian activity in DTLA. For a mobile city like Los Angeles, I believe this could be new typology that encourages such activity.
