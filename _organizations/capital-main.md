  Storytelling is one of our most powerful tools for inspiring people to act.
  And there is nothing more inspiring than the stories of those who are bringing
  real and lasting change to their communities. As a news outlet that focuses
  much of its resources on investigative journalism, Capital & Main excels at
  uncovering corruption and malfeasance. But we also recognize that it is
  imperative to offer a counter-narrative, based on the incredible stories of
  Angelenos who, sometimes at great personal cost, are making this city a far
  better place to live. We know that when we tell these stories well -- with
  words and images that move our audience to action -- we become more than
  storytellers. We become catalysts in transforming our city. This project will
  endeavor to tell the untold stories of change-makers, thereby seeding the next
  generation of social progress innovators.
