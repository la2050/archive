  Since its humble beginnings, Swipes for the Homeless has donated over 35,000
  pounds of food just in Los Angeles and thousands of additional meals around
  the nation. In fact, we have recorded a whopping number of 57,268 pounds of
  food donated as of January 2013! All of this couldn’t have been done without
  our dedicated university chapters. We are continuing to spread our mission to
  university campuses, and additional students from over 30 universities have
  recently reached out to us to establish a chapter on their perspective
  campuses. Swipes for the Homeless has been featured in many publications and
  media outlets such as the Los Angeles Times, MTV, GOOD Magazine, Forbes, UCLA
  Magazine, and many others. Our biggest (and most exciting) achievement to date
  was when our organization was recognized by President Barack Obama as a Campus
  Champion of Change in 2011. The Champions of Change challenge was launched by
  the White House to honor five young leaders for outstanding leadership on
  their college campuses. After reviewing a record number of entries, fifteen
  Challenge finalists were announced and the public chose the top five projects
  they think best embody the President’s goal to win the future. Swipes for the
  Homeless was voted as one of the top five! Our members were honored with the
  opportunity to travel to the White House and personally meet Obama for a press
  conference with the other winners. In 2012, Swipes for the Homeless was also
  recognized as Most Influential College Organization at the 2012 Stay Classy
  Awards, the largest philanthropic recognition ceremony in America. From these
  various recognitions, we have been blessed with the opportunity to bring this
  important cause to further light on the national media scale, and would like
  to thank all of our supporters who have been with us every step of the way.
