  Over the past decade plus, the Hammer Museum has transformed itself into one
  of the most innovative and well-respected arts and cultural institutions in
  Los Angeles. One important focus of our exhibitions and artist programs is
  highlighting emerging and under-recognized artists. Last summer we organized
  L.A.’s first ever biennial exhibition, Made in L.A. 2012, which showcased 60
  emerging local artists in four venues across the city. The Hammer is also
  proud of its 14 year old Hammer Projects exhibition series which features
  emerging local and international artists in what is often their first solo
  museum exhibition in the United States. Through our public engagement program,
  launched in 2010, the Hammer has established itself as a leader in innovation
  through unique and unexpected artist projects that challenge visitors’ notions
  of traditional museum experiences. As a cultural center, the Hammer also
  attracts tens of thousands of visitors each year to our multidisciplinary
  public programs which take place in our state-of-the-art Billy Wilder Theater
  and adjacent Courtyard, and which include literary readings, artist
  performances, film screenings, musical acts, meditation sessions, and
  scholarly and popular culture presentations. All of the Hammer’s public
  programs are free to the public and we feel strongly that we could be helpful
  to both artists and our neighbors if the vitality and sense of community that
  the Hammer enjoys could spill out into our commercial neighborhood as well.
