  Since its inception in 2009, Children Mending Hearts has helped over 12,000
  disadvantaged youth become involved in practicing Global Citizenship and
  positive social activism. The thing we’re most proud of is helping children of
  ALL cultural, socioeconomic and educational backgrounds learn that they have
  the power to make a positive difference in another child’s life. After
  participating in our community outreach events or after school programming, we
  have seen countless children — most of whom are themselves challenged by
  poverty, community violence and limited educational opportunities — gain a
  sense of empowerment as they discover that they have an innate capacity to
  make life better for someone else. As their sense of pride and self-esteem
  grows, they become eager to reach out and help in their communities.
   
   
   Some of Children Mending Hearts’ additional achievements include:
   
   
   - Providing free, sustained after school programming for hundreds of youth living in Los Angeles neighborhoods challenged by drugs, gang violence and poverty;
   
   
   - Developing a CMH blog that educates thousands of Los Angeles parents and youth about volunteerism, Global Citizenship and positive social activism;
   
   
   - Sponsoring outreach trips to Haiti, Darfur and Democratic Republic of Congo, where we provided thousands of children living in crisis with arts and educational workshops, in addition to providing them with basic necessities such as shoes and school supplies;
   
   
   - Holding large-scale public children’s events in Los Angeles, Las Vegas and New York, where hundreds of children learned about the importance of volunteerism and Global Citizenship and participated in projects to help their local communities;
   
   
   - Successfully developing and implementing our Global Arts After School program, including publishing a formal curriculum that teaches middle school-aged youth the importance of acting with empathy and helping people in their own communities as well as the world at large.
