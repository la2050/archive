  with online dispute resolution to take a child-centric approach to separation,
  divorce and coParenting.

  Our goal is to measurably improve coParenting for over 12,000 individual
  children in Los Angeles County.  In addition to utilizing powerful digital
  measurement tools that account for access and engagement, we will also measure
  quantifiable change in coParenting knowledge and active behavior achieved
  through utilization of the platform. To this end, we have three primary impact
  outcomes and measurement strategies. First, our coParenting curriculum is
  designed to increase awareness of the importance of coParenting and introduce
  coParenting best practices which will be measured by pre- and post- surveys of
  workshop participants. Second, the coParenting app will directly lead to more
  effective coParenting behaviors and reduced conflict measured by our
  proprietary coParenting scoring algorithm. This score draws from real time
  user data to measure collaboration, conflict levels, and coParenting
  optimization. Lastly, #coParenterProject is designed to build a community of
  young people from coParenting families to mitigate stigma, social isolation,
  and to share information. Measurements will include total number of community
  members, total number of questions asked, average user time on platform, and
  user surveys.

  coParenter Project targets nearly 3M separated, divorced and never-married
  Angelino parents, empowering them to save money, stay out of court and make
  better decisions for their children. The initiative offers high-quality
  education, personalized coaching and access to a state-of-the-art coParenting
  management and mediation platform. #coParenterProject, a moderated twitter
  initiative, helps kids exposed to parents’ separation find answers, get help
  and build community.

  There are almost 3 million Angelinos in an active coParenting relationship
  with an additional 200,000 Los Angeles residents joining that community every
  year.  And as the exponentially larger millennial generation- many of whom opt
  out of marriage altogether- reach the ‘Age of Conscious Uncoupling,’ that
  number will surely skyrocket. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics,
  high conflict divorce/separation is the second (out of ten) most common
  Adverse Childhood Event (ACE) which have been proven to lead to negative
  health, academic, and economic outcomes in adults.   Conversely, children
  growing up with coParents who collaborate, cooperate and effectively
  coParenting, thrive. But catastrophic cuts to an already-overwhelmed court
  system have eliminated mediation, coParenting resources and self-help
  programs, leaving separating, divorced and never-married parents with few
  options for resolving conflict.  This lack of resources force many Angelenos
  to manage conflict and every day coParenting issues on their own. 
  Unfortunately, a disproportionate amount of parents end up litigating in court
  leading to advanced economic hardship for families as well as ACEs- which have
  documented connections to negative health, academic, and economic outcomes in
  adults.  It doesn’t have to be this way. A family’s marital status does not,
  in and of itself, lead to negative outcomes for children.  coParenter Project
  disrupts the cycle of conflict through three interrelated strategies.  First,
  our project will deliver research-based coParenting education to 1,000
  coParents through a network of community-based organizations. Second, we will
  distribute 5,000 free licenses of coParenter, a coParenting management and
  mediation platform offering family communication, scheduling and management
  tools, automated conflict resolution and live, professional coaching to help
  coParents resolve disputes, make agreements and make better, more informed
  decisions for their kids. Finally, #coParentingProject, a Twitter based
  learning network for children of coParents, will connect youth in coParenting
  families with each other, to mitigate social isolation, build a community, and
  share information and resources in a safe, anonymous environment. We
  anticipate 10,000 tweets between kids helping each other through this
  innovative, first-of-its-kind network. These three activities will directly
  address the LA2050 live metric of disrupting adverse childhood events and have
  wide impact on child and family well-being across LA County.
