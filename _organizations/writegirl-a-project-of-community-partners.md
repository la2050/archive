      WriteGirl is a creative writing and mentoring program in LA that pairs
      underserved teen girls with professional women writers.

      <p>For eleven consecutive years, WriteGirl has guided 100% of the seniors
      in our Core Mentoring Program to not only graduate from high school, but
      enroll in college, often on full or partial scholarships. Many are the
      first in their families to attend college. How do we do that? There is a
      direct connection between creative writing and confidence. When you are
      empowered to believe in the value of your own voice, you can be the
      architect of your own success.</p><p>WriteGirl has published 12
      anthologies that have earned 48 national and international book awards.
      These books, highly interactive and beautifully designed, contain the work
      of teen girls and the women writers who mentor them. They are a concrete
      testament to the power of the pen.</p><p>WriteGirl has hosted hundreds of
      creative writing events for audiences large and small, in many different
      settings. We work with girls who participate in our Core Program for up to
      five years, as well as working with writers we have never met before in
      one-time only programs. </p><p>We have developed creative writing programs
      for critically at-risk teens (both boys and girls) who are
      pregnant/parenting, on suspension, incarcerated or struggling with
      significant life challenges. We have developed more than 15 books of
      writing from these young people. We are now providing graduation support
      and higher education guidance for this group of participants.</p>
       
       
       In 2002, LAUSD high school student Glenda Garcia joined WriteGirl, not knowing what to expect. During her four years in the program, she attended monthly workshops, worked with several mentors, attended college readiness sessions, read her creative writing at public readings and had her work published in several of WriteGirlâ€™s award-winning anthologies. In her senior year, WriteGirl nominated her for a Posse Scholarship. She won, and attended Dickinson College on a full ride. Upon college graduation, Glenda was awarded a prestigious Fulbright Scholarship. Weâ€™re very excited to say that she is taking a year to work with us at WriteGirl as our Membership Coordinator. Where will Glenda be in 2050? We are confident that she will be a key contributor to the success of any community in which she resides..<p>Here are a few more alumnae success stories:Emily is on her way to Harvard University, where she received a full scholarship.</p><p>Lovely has a summer fellowship in nuclear policy at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory and will spend next year researching in China.</p><p>Jamilah, a junior at Dartmouth, spent the last semester doing community outreach work in Los Angeles and will travel to China in the fall to conduct research for her senior thesis.</p>Our success has been recognized:
       
       
       In 2010, WriteGirl was awarded a Medal of Service and named the California Nonprofit of the Year by the Office of the Governor.
       
       
       In 2010, WriteGirl received the Humanitas Philanthropy Prize. 
       
       
       In 2011, WriteGirl was finalist in the National Arts and Humanities Youth Program Awards.
