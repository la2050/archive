  Since 1964, KCET has served Los Angeles and an 11-county region of Southern
  and Central California. We reach one of the most diverse market areas in the
  country with the finest regional, national and international programming, as
  well as with educational resources and community events.
   
   
   
   
   
   In October 2012, KCET announced a merger with San Francisco-based Link Media, an award-winning national media organization focused on global news and culture. With the new name of KCETLink, our merged organization is poised to introduce an entirely new model for independent public media that represents the future of the industry — driving digital innovation, creating sustainable growth and serving the public interest. Utilizing multiple on-air, online and mobile distribution platforms, KCETLink will have a greater capacity to address key issues in our local communities, as well as across the nation and around the world.
   
   
   
   
   
   Over the years, KCET programming has received numerous awards:
   
   
   
   
   
   Ballot Brief was launched in 2012 and met with tremendous success as discussed above.
   
   
   
   
   
   Our weekly news program, SoCal Connected, has been recognized with several of the highest honors in broadcasting, including the George Foster Peabody Award; two Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Awards; and 17 Los Angeles Area Emmys Awards, among others.
   
   
   
   
   
   Since its launch in May 2012, our transmedia, cultural journalism program, Artbound, has been named “Best Arts & Culture Site” at the 2012 LA Weekly Web Awards; has won a National Entertainment Journalism Award for “Best Documentary or Special Program, Short” from the Los Angeles Press Club; and has received two Golden Mike Awards from the Radio & Television News Association of Southern California.
