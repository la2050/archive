  Resident involvement in the planning of their communities is the number one
  indicator of success.  The vision of Drake Park serving as a community hub
  that strengthens family bonds and reduces neighborhood violence begins with
  everyday people owning and defining their neighborhood identity.  Our program
  will recruit, train and organize 20-24 residents to serve as social change
  agents in the Drake neighborhood and surrounding communities. The information
  obtained through neighborhood surveys will be used to inform decision makers
  on how best to prioritize park funding as well as create new private and
  public partnerships that invigorate the currently disenfranchised,
  marginalized Drake community. Resident leaders will present their findings to
  City Council and advocate for equitable park funding in low-income
  communities; taking on a systems approach on how our parks are used,
  maintained, and sustained.  Resident leaders will inspire their neighbors to
  get involved and join them at the community action day at Drake Park, where
  residents will program park activities, and showcase their newly found
  partnerships.  Through the PPS project resident leaders will re-engage their
  neighbors to inform city budgetary priorities and have government be more
  responsiveness, and increase volunteerism to create opportunities for everyday
  people to define how parks can serve as community hubs for healthy
  intergenerational play and a healthy community for all.

  In the People’s Planning School, residents participate in a 6-week planning
  workshop that includes developing a neighborhood action plan to identify
  resources for parks and open space programming at Drake Park and the
  surrounding areas. PPS residents lead an advocacy action day to inform
  decision-makers on municipal budget prioritization to have parks serve as
  community hubs that strengthen family bonds and reduce community violence.

  The PPS project connects people, parks, and institutions to create active,
  safe neighborhoods for all generations to thrive.  It is a multi-sector
  approach to connect resident leaders with government and community-based
  organization resources (CBOs) to activate open space and parks in the Drake
  community and surrounding areas. Well-engaged, safe parks provide many
  benefits. Parks serve as a connecting space that build social capital by
  providing a shared space for users to develop and maintain neighborhood ties.
  These interactions enhance the personal and communication skills of users,
  which significantly contribute to residents' sense of safety and
  emotional/social support.  PPS’ three project goals are to: 1) increase
  resident capacity, building up their advocacy for increasing access and
  resources to parks and open spaces; 2) increase the rate of resident and
  partner organization volunteerism at parks and open spaces; and 3) increase
  communication between government, CBOs and residents on the use of vibrant
  park spaces within Drake and surrounding communities. Authentic resident
  engagement is critical to develop a community vision for safe parks that
  support early childhood, intergenerational play, and reduced neighborhood
  violence.


  Capacity Building:  People’s Planning School will offer a free, 6-week city
  planning training to 20-24 residents and work with them to develop a
  neighborhood action plan. Using the tools learned in their training, residents
  will co-design a neighborhood survey along with project partners, collect
  data, and present their findings to city decision makers.  In the Neighborhood
  Action Plan, residents will identify specific community resources that meet
  the needs presented in the data, securing commitments for programming and
  maintenance of Drake Park. 

  Connection to Place and Volunteerism: PPS will strengthen existing government,
  CBO and resident relationships while identifying new partners to increase park
  activity and responsiveness to resident needs. Residents will create private
  and non-profit partnerships to increase park programming and create
  opportunities for resident volunteerism at local parks. The connection between
  organizations and resident volunteerism is key to create a neighborhood
  identity where residents have the power to support programming in parks and
  open space.  

  System Change-Communication: PPS partners and residents will work together to
  open dialogues with policy and civic decision-makers, expanding the current
  conversation from designing park spaces to include support for long-term park
  programming in low-income areas of the City. The City of Long Beach has made a
  commitment to increase opportunities for its citizenry to live active, healthy
  lives.  As part of this commitment, PPS will work to impact budgetary
  decisions on how park program funding is allocated and bring new community
  resources to bear to support the desired level of park programming.
