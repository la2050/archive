project_proposal_description: >-
  One of the biggest problems every city faces is an inability to effectively
  collaborate all the local research and effort in a sustainable way. The goal
  of our project is to unify all of the thinkers, doers and research from local
  universities, orgs and businesses into one hub that surfaces the best ideas,
  campaigns, research & innovation. The result is a living convergence of local
  effort & research that allows everyone to keep their finger on the pulse of
  local emerging ideas & collaborations.

  Our project strikes at the heart of helping LA 'capitalize on its
  concentration of higher education facilities to foster new businesses, advance
  research, and spur innovation.'  #Library is a information sorting engine
  built in collaboration with a UN think tank, and it was designed to do just
  that.


  It will make LA the best place to LEARN in three ways: 

  1. Providing great opportunities for students.

  2. Surfacing LA innovation, businesses and solutions.

  3. Hyper-driving collaboration in universities and across the city.


  1. Providing Opportunities for Students:

  Students with the most inspired ideas get recognized by leaders in business,
  government and education, helping them find better jobs, graduate programs and
  opportunities.  When brought to scale, by 2050 every student in LA who attends
  a university and participates would have the same opportunities to rise above
  the noise and get recognized by global leaders for their ideas, research and
  hard work.


  2. Surfacing Great Local Ideas:

  After great ideas are submitted by local students, professors, researchers,
  orgs and business, we use the power of the crowd, machine learning and
  sentiment analysis to surface the best ideas every day, week, month and year. 
  The result is a living archive of great ideas that is always surfacing the
  best innovation and solutions from LA residents. 


  3. Hyper-Driving Collaboration:

  When the best local ideas and research are always being surfaced in one LA
  hub, this allows everyone in the city to keep their fingers on the pulse of
  emerging projects and research, increasing recruitment and funding
  opportunities for the most promising LA innovation.  This will allow everyone
  working on the same problems to find each other and organize.  The goal is
  sustainable convergence for all of LA's thinkers & doers, instead of
  fragmented research and effort.


  Conclusion:

  Using #Library to unify LA's ideas, research, projects and efforts by
  synchronizing its students, researchers, activists, orgs and local businesses,
  would make LA the most collaborative city in America.  By 2050, millions of
  people will be given opportunities for better jobs, graduate programs and
  funding, and each will be given the chance to play a role in the advancement
  of local research and innovation in Los Angeles.
