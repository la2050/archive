   <p>DCA is spearheading a number of initiatives that directly address the LA2050 indicators. In Housing, DCA is working with the Actors Fund Housing Development Corporation & Artspace, an organization dedicated to creating sustainably affordable space for artists & arts organizations, to build the Broadway Arts Center (BAC) - a mixed-used facility to include approximately 100 affordable live/work units, along with rehearsal & performance space. The BAC will be part of the Broadway Cultural Quarter, anticipated to include a downtown campus for CalArts’ MFA Theater program, creative industry incubator space, and upper-floor offices for creative businesses and startups. </p>
   
   
   <p>The Watts Our Town initiative, funded by the National Endowment for the Arts, brings together community members and stakeholders to design an artistic “green” pathway connecting the 103rd Street Metro Station to the Watts Towers. Environmental Quality is promoted by replacing existing concrete walkways with grass and trees, and Social Connectedness is encouraged by repurposing a historic train station into a visitors center and gallery.</p>
   
   
   <p>The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences’ Media Literacy Program currently serves nearly 1600 high school students annually.
