  ERW Design + SALT have partnered to develop the Park-in-a-Box concept. ERW
  Design (www.erwdesign.com) is an award-winning, multi-disciplinary
  architecture firm whose work is based on the intersection of the built form
  and the landscape. Founded in 1999, ERW Design has completed over 40
  institutional, residential, and landscape projects throughout the Los Angeles
  area. 
   
   
   ERW Design is experienced working with a wide array of neighborhoods and communities throughout Los Angeles. Some notable projects include the Marsh Park Pavilion at Marsh Park, the first regional park on the LA River in Elysian Village; the Vista Hermosa Park structures in downtown Los Angeles; Beverly Gardens Park Restoration in Beverly Hills; and an all-ages exhibition gallery at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.
   
   
   ERW Design received the Grand Prize, as well as the award for best Civic Project for their work at Vista Hermosa Park. The project received Best Urban Project by the Los Angeles AIA in 2009. 
   
   
   SALT Landscape Architects (www.s-a-l-t.com) is a Los Angeles-based design studio focused on creating enduring, engaging, and innovative landscapes on a range of scales. The firm’s name, derived from “salt of the earth,” reflects the sense of grounding that we strive for in all of our projects. 
   
   
   SALT has been working with the Trust for Public Land (www.tpl.org), also our partner for Park-in-a-Box, over the past year to bring significant changes to the Avalon community of Los Angeles, south of downtown. SALT developed a master plan for the pedestrian opportunities in the community, including a thorough analysis of the existing pedestrian challenges and degraded mobility infrastructure. We also developed designs for the conversion of more than 1,800 linear feet of alleyways into storm water infiltration centers and enhanced pedestrian and bicycle pathways. This project has already received over $1.7 million in funding to date in public funding from various local, county and state agencies and expects to have the construction documents completed by the end of 2013.
   
   
   SALT also co-founded the Take Back the Boulevard (TBTB) initiative in 2011 in the Eagle Rock neighborhood of northeast Los Angeles. TBTB is seeking to bring significant pedestrian improvements to Colorado Boulevard through a grass-roots and community based effort, focused on recapturing a portion of the public right-of-way from automobile traffic and reallocating it for other modes of transportation. Through a series of outreach efforts facilitated by the TBTB steering committee, the initiative has brought the community together to identify ways of making Colorado Boulevard more humanely-scaled and more of a “Main Street” with a vibrant business district and pedestrian life. 
   
   
   Both SALT and ERW Design continue to seek unique opportunities to work closely with local constituencies to develop innovative approaches to remaking Los Angeles incrementally more humane and sustainable.
