  Downtown Long Beach (in the shadows of LA) is the only waterfront downtown
  between San Diego and San Francisco. As the creative class jobs continue to
  expand from Santa Monica South to downtown LB we need to continue to support
  and expand our organic entrepreneurial business ecosystem. The Ports of LA and
  Long Beach have recently committed over $14 billion in green technology
  investment and CSULB has made substantial investments in Sustainable Energy &
  Environmental research in partnerships with The Port of Long Beach. As
  consumer and business efficiency requires sustainability, our goal is that
  Long Beach leads the way as a sustainable city. The IIE will build the bridge
  with the intellectual and human resources from CSULB and the expertise from
  local institutions. This will lead to a strong partnership to grow the green
  tech sector in the community, enhancing Long Beach's status as the premier
  sustainable city and a global model for others to follow.

  When a college graduate/student/entrepreneur thinks about where they can find
  support to launch their idea our expectation is they think about Long Beach
  first, due to the resources and success of prior entrepreneurial launches
  supported through our business expansion, attraction, and retention
  programming. Expanding the creative community to support the development of a
  truly sustainable city that focuses on the people, planet and profit!
