  Our series of groundbreaking Report Cards — which measure and compare how each
  state provides protection to maltreated children within the framework of its
  state law — have educated untold numbers of Americans about essential
  legislative, legal and policy developments. They have become the gold standard
  arbiter of policy and legislation and now greatly influence lawmakers, the
  judiciary and CPS agencies on a running basis. Over time have seen states’
  grades improve, showing that the Report Cards are fueling state-level
  improvements. The Children’s Advocacy Institute, Center for Public Interest
  Law at the University of San Diego School of Law is a treasured partner in
  developing and disseminating the Report Cards nationwide.
   
   
   We convene Congressional Forums, held in the U.S. Capitol, where lawmakers and their staffs are invited to learn about the latest Report Cards and to dialogue with experts in the field on child abuse, dependency courts, foster care, and child protective services. The discussions provide guidance and feedback on pertinent policy areas. They also provide a rare opportunity for youth who have experienced Foster Care to speak directly to government, face to face.
   
   
   Our Foster Youth Academies, now operating in Los Angeles, CA, Rhode Island and the greater Washington, DC area, are inspiring, challenging and equipping foster youth in grades 8 through 10 for success in college and beyond. Students who remain in good standing are invited to continue in the Academy program — summer residential sessions, monthly workshop days, and our protected students’ social media site — each year through high school graduation. With the enthusiastic support of local public-private partnerships, including child welfare agencies and public schools, we have launched these three Academies in two years. To launch and operate Academies around the ï¿¼country, additional public-private partnerships are at work at six additional campuses across the nation.
