  Multi-spectral imaging sensors have been introduced and widely used for
  in-field plant sensing but this technology is not commercialized, and the data
  is not formalized into meaningful information.


  We will simplify, and make it compatible with all water piping systems.  


  Here's why we should use Multi-Spectral Imaging: 


  1. Nitrogen: Plant growth and nitrogen deficiency symptoms can be detected by
  leaf spectral reflectance differences in the red and near infrared portion of
  the electromagnetic spectrum.


  2. Irrigation: Heat emitted by plants under water stress can be assessed
  through thermal images. Spectral changes due to water stress can be also
  detected with visible and Near Infrared wavelengths. 


  3. Yield Management: “Plant growth can be detected by plant spectral
  differences in the visible and NIR portion of the EM spectrum”. 


  4. Soil Mapping: Variations in soil color related to soil properties such as
  texture, or organic matter can be detected by soil spectral differences in the
  red and NIR portion of the EM spectrum.


  Fuzzy logic is an approach to computing based on 'degrees of truth' rather
  than the usual 'true or false' (1 or 0) Boolean logic on which the modern
  computer is based. A fuzzy logic control algorithm is applied to automatically
  adjust camera exposure and gain to control image brightness within an image’s
  targeted gray level affected by illumination disturbance quickly converged.


  This creates a vegetative index.

  The objective of this proposal is for the Research and Development of a
  drought-adaptive gardening hub, suitable for a city-gardener.
  Over-fertilization can be a source of unnecessary harm, resulting in
  environmental hazards in the cases of nutrient run off. The development of an
  in-field, real-time, plant sensing system for a site-specific application can
  protect the environment from excessive chemicals and save management cost
  while controlling the productivity of watering systems.

  The implementation of self sustained gardening sensors will create
  opportunities for urban gardening, but could also help with water
  conservation. Cutting back on water while being more efficient in deciphering
  which areas need water more will help public spaces retain their appeal, as
  well save money. From this project we hope to create programs regarding public
  city-farming and agriculture. 


  Our mission is to help the planet by providing a system that learns and
  teaches its users. As a Southern California based company, we know firsthand
  how severe a drought can be. The objective is producing a drought adaptive
  product.


  Market opportunity has become validated because of the rise in global
  temperature. All across the nation crops are producing low yields and are
  dying off. Now consumers can rely solely on themselves for agricultural
  cultivation. 


  The ability of a remote sensor to detect such subtle differences in vegetation
  makes it an extremely useful tool for quantifying within-field variability,
  evaluating crop growth, and managing soil based on current conditions that may
  be overlooked using typical ground-based visual scouting methods.
