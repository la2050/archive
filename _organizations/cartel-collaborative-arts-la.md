  Our greatest achievements have grown out of the people and artists with whom
  we are privileged to work. Our ensemble of dedicated artists has grown over
  the years into a dedicated, well-rounded staff. In addition to our core team,
  we have worked with and showcased over 2000 artists over the past five years
  -- in successful productions and events that span several mediums of art
  including film, theatre, music, art and more.
   
   
   
   
   
   While operating with very little money, we’ve been creative and efficient with our resources, so perhaps our biggest achievement has been the fact that we’ve kept it all going! We have been fortunate to be able to do a lot with very little, never stopping, never settling and constantly taking on new challenges with vigor. For example, our Brokechella and No Budget festivals -- which today stand as our most far-reaching and well-attended events -- started very small. Brokechella started in a coffee shop, and in April 2013, 2000 people will join us downtown for a day of music, food, and art (we’ve literally had to shut down an entire street in order to accommodate everyone and everything). No Budget began in a 50-person theater with no curating process and 16 videos submitted by friends and fans; it now is in its fourth year and has a red carpet, panel discussions led by arts professionals, a sold-out 300-person theater and has been a launchpad for young artists to create work and launch meaningful relationships within the film industry. The winners of the very first No Budget festival just released a trailer for a series based on their winning film, and many past Brokechella bands have been featured as “bands” to watch and have developed large local followings. The growth is so exciting to watch and defines what success means to us.
