  Flying under the radar, I have been a sort of underground for progressive
  thought, where some of the people at the edge have inspired others of us at
  many salon type events I've held. My blog, called "Making Sense of These
  Times," reaches thousands. My mission is to influence thought to where we
  rethink our worldview, and without having names, like projects might, I have
  fostered a community of thought whose interactions have led to things of note.
  I'm stepping out more publicly now producing a TEDx event
  (www.TEDxWestHollywood.com), where the intention is to deliver a body of talks
  that could activate people who want to change the world.
