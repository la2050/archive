       <p>Bresee is proud of its many alumni who are living out its vision by serving the next generation. This success is exhibited by Cesar, who came to Bresee for a karate class and now has his own karate studio that offers its program at Bresee; by Pedro, who learned to make films in Bresee's media program and is now teaching film at a nonprofit; and by Roger, who was sent to Bresee by the probation department and recently served as assistant to assemblyman Mike Davis. <b>These young leaders acknowledge that Bresee was critical to their success.</b> Andy, a Bresee alumnus who now serves as a founding board member of Multi-Cultural Communities for Mobility, shares his story:
       
       
       <blockquote>"My mom struggled to make ends meet. I had no sense of direction. I began using drugs and stealing to find happiness. I got caught and was referred to Bresee, where my perspective on life changed. I took anger management classes and met weekly with my counselor Rene who helped me to look at life differently. Bresee gave me this sense of accomplishment-something I had never felt before. One day Rene told me about a job opening at Bresee. I took the job and began working with first-time offenders, opening Bresee's first community service program. This was the first real job I had ever had. I worked part-time at Bresee, went to community college, and eventually transferred to UCLA. With the help of Bresee and their scholarship opportunity I graduated - something unimaginable during my younger days. Without Bresee's financial and emotional help I never would have gotten this far."</blockquote></p>
