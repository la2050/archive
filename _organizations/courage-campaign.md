  <p>Double Bubble: Courage won an unprecedented voting-rights victory after
  thousands of LA voters were disenfranchised by a flawed ballot design. As the
  LA Times highlighted in a front-page article, Courage uncovered the flaw and
  leveraged 32,802 petition signatures, and grassroots pressure to force the
  Registrar to count 47,153 ballots previously discarded. As a result, the
  County Registrar replaced the double-bubble ballot with a new ballot for DTS
  voters & the California Secretary of State revised ballot documents to clarify
  instructions statewide.</p><p>Prop 8 Trial Tracker: After gathering 140,671
  signatures in three days calling for the Prop 8 trial to be televised, Courage
  launched Prop8TrialTracker.com, to promote transparency in the historic trial.
  US Supreme Court Justice Breyer referenced 138,542 public comments gathered by
  Courage in his dissenting opinion, in favor of televising the trial. Through
  live-blogging, coverage of breaking news, & expert commentary, the site gained
  over 4 million views & 100,00 comments. Our Equality on Trial website now
  provides up to the minute coverage of legal cases involving the rights of LGBT
  Americans.</p><p>Foreclosure Flashlight: In April 2012, following the
  introduction of the Homeowner Bill of Rights, Courage launched The Foreclosure
  Flashlight to shine a light on key California legislators, how foreclosures
  affected their districts, how much money they’d taken from the banking
  industry, & where they stood on a strong, pro-homeowner bill. The online tool
  encouraged Californians to contact their legislators. One by one, we won the
  key votes. This was an unprecedented victory over Big Bank lobbyists to pass
  fundamental reform ending the most deceptive & unethical foreclosure
  practices. We were proud to partner with the Alliance of Californians for
  Community Empowerment, California Reinvestment Coalition, Center for
  Responsible Lending, PICO, State Labor Federation, National Council of La
  Raza, Cal-PIRG, Consumers Union, Presente.org, & Rebuild the
  Dream.</p><p>Progressive Voter Guide: Each election season, Courage publishes
  the California Progressive Voter Guide. In 2012, the guide contained the
  recommendations of 14 progressive organizations, important deadlines including
  voter registration & vote-by-mail, a Spanish version, & a mobile-optimized
  version for voters to easily access even while voting. The Progressive Voter
  Guide was viewed more than 252,365 times.<p>Prop 30: Courage Campaign played a
  key role in creating and passing Prop 30 in 2012, which produced much-needed
  public revenue. Courage and partners created a ballot initiative, The
  Millionaire’s Tax, which was more progressive than the Governor’s revenue
  proposal. As a result of Courage’s research and organizing, along with
  partners, the Governor compromised to incorporate aspects of The Millionaire’s
  Tax & made Prop 30 more progressive & ultimately more feasible to pass,
  providing important revenue for vital services and education.</p>
