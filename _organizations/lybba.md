  OPENHealth Central is being designed by Lybba, a 501(c)3 nonprofit based in
  Los Angeles that designs networks, tools, and events that help people better
  care for themselves and one another. We design networks of patients,
  physicians, and researchers in collaborations that create breakthrough
  solutions.
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Over the past three years Lybba is a founding designer of the Collaborative Chronic Care Network (C3N), a new model for devising and testing innovations in clinical care and research. We are designing tools that help patients track their health between appointments, visualize their health over time via clear and engaging graphics, communicate with physicians using online and mobile applications, and choose to share their medical data with other patients and researchers. By increasing patient engagement, the C3N can transform the experience and outcomes of illness, and accelerate the discovery and application of new knowledge. (Supported by the National Institutes of Health.) 
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Lybba is currently designing and building an automated decision-support aid for doctors and patients to use together to achieve better outcomes. By using this software product, patients with serious chronic illnesses will arrive at decisions about the treatment options most suitable to their particular situation. (Supported by a major L.A. research medical center.)
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Lybba designed a Genetic Care Interchange that networks the collective experience of patients, researchers, and physicians, along with genetic information, to supply insight for creating new genetically defined targets for drug development. (Supported by southern California life-sciences company.)
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Lybba designed a knowledge base of medical diagnostics, including knowledge-sharing models for how potential contributors--such as MDs, patients, organizations, and others--will participate in the creation and cultivation of an online knowledge base of medical diagnostic information and techniques. (Supported by The California Endowment.)
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Lybba is a co-designer of the Regional Resource Network of quality improvement leaders throughout the country. With the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, we are devising prototypes that will make it easier for people to develop, curate, and spread knowledge. (Supported by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.)
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Lybba conceived of and created an immersive DIY bio-design event for high school science classrooms in partnership with The California Endowment and their Building Healthy Community initiative in South L.A. Biohackathon L.A. 2013 focused on career opportunities in the life sciences and the cross-application of biotech knowledge. (Supported by the California Biotechnology Foundation.)
   
   
    
   
   
   
   
   
   In addition to the programs above, Lybba has designed, constructed, and created content strategy for a dozen healthcare websites. Lybba has also produced two dozen films on science and healthcare with our film-making partner, Wondros.
