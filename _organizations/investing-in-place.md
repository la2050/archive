  Access to greater opportunity depends on how you get there. Our team will
  document and amplify stories of how people get around — and leverage the
  stories to improve our transportation options.

project_measure: >-
  There are over 10 million people in LA County. When Metro was creating the
  expenditure plan for Measure M (LA County’s transportation ballot measure in
  November), about 48,000 people — or less than half a percent of the total
  population — was engaged in the process. Our goal is to increase this level of
  engagement by, most importantly, directly working with and mobilizing the
  people most affected by our transportation decisions — these include our most
  vulnerable populations like youth, students, older adults, and individuals
  with disabilities.


  Our success will be measured by three metrics: 


  1) Number of new organic viewers, followers, and engagements on social media.
  Our target goal is: 1,000 new followers.


  2) Number of individuals and organizations we recruit and mobilize through
  letter writing campaigns, public comment letters and testimonies, petition
  signatures, and meetings with legislators and their staff. Our target goal is:
  cultivating and sustaining a leadership circle of more than  25 new
  individuals and 5 new organizations.


  3) Number of advocacy meetings with newly cultivate leaders and elected
  officials and their staff. Target goal: At least 10 meetings total.

  In Los Angeles, like many major metropolitan areas, you can’t get ahead if you
  can’t get around. Our transportation system — our roads, sidewalks, buses,
  trains, bikeways — are complex and more interconnected than people think. We
  will spark a series of discussions and online videos that decipher our
  transportation system — from how it’s funded and who makes the decisions to
  who depends on our buses and trains as their connection lifeline — and what we
  can do to make it better for all.

  We formed Investing in Place on January 2015 to bring together businesses,
  public agencies, philanthropists, researchers, and community organizations to
  help find solutions to improving quality of life for all, especially
  low-income and middle-income families in Los Angeles County.


  The problem we’re trying to solve is clear: Per the National Equity Atlas, the
  Los Angeles metropolitan area has a higher rate of inequality than California
  and the U.S. The gap between the region’s wealthy and low-income communities
  manifests itself spatially, where you live can greatly affect opportunities
  for educational attainment, job access, health outcomes, public safety,
  environmental quality, mobility, and more. Simply put, place matters — and how
  you access those opportunities through different modes of transportation is
  paramount to one’s success.


  Our proposal will accelerate our efforts and make LA the best place to connect
  in three ways:


  1.We will de-mystify the politics of regional transportation financing through
  a digital video series that is dynamic, educational, and accessible to all
  audiences. For the past year, Investing in Place has been working to put
  action behind the “just growth” framework developed by Dr. Manuel Pastor
  (director of USC PERE) and Dr. Chris Benner. Simply put, “just growth” is the
  idea that by putting equity at the center of regional economic development,
  the region will grow stronger for everyone, for the long-haul. Indeed, there
  is evidence to support this not just from Pastor and Benner, but from the
  International Monetary Fund and Standard and Poor’s, to name a few. This means
  that closing the gaps between the rich and the poor through policy and other
  strategies benefits everyone. Our proposal will help draw the connections
  between transportation and broader economic opportunities.


  2.We will create a story bank of how individuals travel throughout Los Angeles
  County and the challenges and opportunities they encounter in their own voice
  and experience. We are inspired by efforts from LA’s Legalize Street Vendors
  Campaign, DREAMers, low-wage workers organizing for dignity and recognition,
  and community members organizing for better neighborhoods. The core of our
  campaign is to empower the people who depend on more affordable, frequent, and
  reliable transportation options to amplify their stories to decision makers
  through social media, in-person meetings with elected officials, and through
  traditional media and the press.


  3.Throughout this process, we will help cultivate new leaders and connect them
  to opportunities on how to improve transportation decision-making in their
  neighborhoods. 
   
  Deliverables: 

  3-4 videos from people across LA County on mobility experiences.

  Multilingual education tools on equitable transportation public policy,
  including 2 videos on how/where key LA Region transportation decisions
  happen. 

  Screening event at Impact Hub LA. 

  All accompanied by communications & advocacy campaign.
