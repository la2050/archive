  SK8 4 Education is an after school program developed to motivate at-risk youth
  by combining skateboarding with education. Our mission is to inspire,
  motivate, and empower the youth through skateboarding and urban arts. We use
  art activities, art shows, skate competitions, and merchandise as incentives
  for kids to come after school and do their homework and exchange it for
  points.

  The Garage Board Shop was created with the idea to bring the youth community a
  safe place where they can express their talents through different vehicles,
  like dance, music, arts and skateboarding. It was meant to be a safe space
  where they could be themselves. After some time, many of the younger kids that
  hang out at our shop started opening up about their situations at school and
  in their homes. That is why we initiated the program called SK8 4 Education.


  SK8 4 Education is an after school program developed to motivate underserved
  youth by combining skateboarding with education. Our mission is to inspire,
  motivate, and empower the youth through skateboarding and the arts. We use art
  activities, art shows, skate competitions, and merchandise as incentives for
  kids to come after school and do their homework and exchange it for points. 


  The program combines skating with education by having our members treat
  skating similar to an academic sport, much like football or track; encouraging
  kids to apply themselves in their grades as well as in their skating.  The
  program allows the kids to come in after school to receive tutoring and,
  practice skating in our indoor skate area.  To become a member, each scholar
  needs to bring in their report cards, good or bad, so we can monitor the
  progress in their classes.  When we see an improvement in their grades, we
  reward them with skate events, sponsorship, product, and wonderful memories.
  Our main goal with the SK8 4 Education program is to not only to reward each
  kid with skating supplies so they can continue skating but create and motivate
  an interest for education in them and to encourage them to pursue education
  beyond K-12.
