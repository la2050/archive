  FosterMore highlights the amazing potential of youth in the foster care system
  and encourages all of us to play a part in ensuring that they receive the
  support and guidance they need to thrive.

  To help meet LA County’s urgent need for foster parents and mentors, the
  effort combines predictive analytics and powerful digital content to generate
  foster parent and mentor leads across LA County. This effort will connect with
  over 500,000 residents generating thousands of recruits and sharing a positive
  message about youth in foster care.

  With state-level reforms taking place, the need for foster parents in Los
  Angeles County is at crisis level. With this in mind, our team of
  communications experts conducted research and focus groups to develop a
  winning, digital campaign to recruit foster parents and mentors, while at the
  same time reintroducing viewers to the potential of foster youth.
   
   In a new approach for the field, FosterMore uses21st century techniques to engage people in the lives of youth in care. This kind of specific targeting works at two levels—at best we have recruited a new person to actively support foster youth, while at the same time we have promoted the larger mission of FosterMore, to change hearts and minds, reducing stigmas for foster youth. 
   
   In 2016, we ran a pilot campaign which produced 133 leads for local agencies at a cost of roughly $68 per lead. To build upon that success, the online media buy began employing predictive analytics and big data to provide accuracy and effectiveness. In 2017, armed with the latest in digital targeting and additional creative content, we produced over 1,800 leads and referred 260 prospective foster parents for just $26,000 (or $14/lead). 
   
   The campaign messaging features uplifting stories of individuals and families whose lives were positively impacted by foster care. Set to the One Direction hit song “The Story of My Life” with voiceover provided by Emmy winning actor Ty Burrell, the moving ads received a prestigious Cynopsis Social Good Award for best ad over 30 seconds and earned FosterMore a commendation from the County Board of Supervisors.
   
   The funds from the LA2050 grant will enable us to continue this campaign for two additional years, reaching and connecting with 500,000 Angelenos, who will view the content during the run of the campaign. Using a conservative estimate, the funding will also generate interest in foster parent opportunities from over 10,000 County residents.
project_proposal_engage: >-
  The grant will allow us to reach millions of Angelenos and we will engage
  500,000 to connect by watching our ads. We will be able to provide realtime
  reports while the ads are being run. 
   
   There are numerous ways to measure success (as defined in the next question) but for the purposes of connecting Angelenos, we believe that our greatest offering is the sharing of FosterMore’s message, to developing empathy for our young residents facing the challenges of foster care, and providing opportunities for individuals to support them in their journey to reach their potential.
project_measure: >-
  We believe it is important to look at the impact of the ads through three
  different lenses, aligned with FosterMore’s goals. Each of the three goals has
  a metric to measure success.
   
   * Recruitment of Foster Parents: The number of referrals made to LA County Foster Family Agencies is a clear metric for success and evaluation. The cost/referral allows for comparison with the efforts of other organizations to reach the same demographic.
   
   * Reintroducing Foster Youth to the Public—The overall number of individuals who see the ads and watched the films is a strong metric for success because the ads are purchased to reach a specific demographic of potential foster parents.
   
   * Long Term Culture Shift: Based on previous research of our partner organizations that states that the average foster parent spends two years in the prospecting pipeline, we may be able to project interest starting in 18-24 months, assuming appropriate follow up is conducted. It is our belief that a periodic investment of advertising (targeting the same demographic) could yield a conversion rate of 0.005% from those who view the ad.
project_five_years: >-
  We will have provided a significant resource to Los Angeles County to address
  the needs of foster youth and we hope that they will adopt and utilize the
  template in their ongoing efforts to recruit foster parents. If we are
  successful, there will be sufficient foster homes to address the need and the
  public will see foster youth as they are — children facing a difficult time,
  not simply difficult children.
