  For over 30 years, Share Our Strength has been a leader in the war against
  poverty. In 2010, we launched No Kid Hungry, a national campaign to end
  childhood hunger in America to ensure kids have access to meals where they
  live, learn, and play. Today, 1/3 fewer kids are struggling with hunger.
