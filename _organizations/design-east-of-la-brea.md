  We've built a community of committed design enthusiasts in Los Angeles in
  about 4 four years. We currently have over 1,000 followers on Facebook, nearly
  700 followers on Twitter and 3,000+ email subscribers.

   Our events consistently reach capacity within hours of announcing them, and typically have waitlists. We plan, program and host about 2 events per month, and expose new audiences to innovation and creativity in LA. We also aim to bring people into spaces and neighborhoods they may not visit otherwise. We've experienced consistent growth for our recurring events, such as the design-n-dim sum bike tour and Palm Springs Modernism Week.

   In 2012, we hosted our first home tour, bringing people into four outstanding examples of urban infill and sustainability in Echo Park, all within walking distance of one another. Two of the homes on the tour were then included in Dwell's home tour two months later.

   In December 2012, we also received our non-profit status and are currently applying for grants for the first time.
