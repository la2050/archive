  <p>SBCC has achieved significant community-level and countywide impacts in
  areas including:</p>
   
   
   <p>Economic Development: For nearly 20 years, SBCC's career training and placement programs have opened up access to living-wage employment for residents of low-income communities. Over the past 5 or more years, these programs have provided training and placement assistance to more than 150 individuals per year in employment sectors including energy, renewables, digital arts and media, film and video production, and K-12 teaching. Placement rates exceed 75%, and 24-month community college completion and transfer rates have been as high as 90% (as compared to statewide, 6-year rates of less than 30%).</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>SBCC has adapted this approach to youth entrepreneurship with our innovative Streetcraft LA project, which supports at-risk youth as they develop and market their own lines of apparel and accessories. Additional projects in community-based agriculture, food service, and neighborhood financial services are currently in development.</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>Finally, SBCC has used our community organizing project's extensive reach into low-income, immigrant-dense communities to launch a highly successful Deferred Action initiative, placing young adults on the path toward legal residency and full participation in the legitimate economy.</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>Healthy Childhood and Early Education: SBCC's Community Doula program mobilizes community advocates for women during pregnancy, birthing, and in the post-partum months. These doulas help new mothers navigate the medical system, form healthy attachments with their infants, promote good nutrition and breastfeeding, and engage from birth onwards in activities that support children's cognitive, social and emotional development. The program has proven effective at eliminating infant mortality, significantly increasing rates of breastfeeding, and significantly reducing numbers of low-weight births.</p>
   
   
   <p>Our Preschool Without Walls program works with families in these communities to address critical gaps in early learning and preschool resources. PWW brings early learning experiences to more than 500 parents and children in community institutions and locations that serve as learning and development resources. In homes and neighborhoods, parks, libraries, and community centers, the program engages parents and children in a shared early learning experience leading to improved child development and school readiness through supporting parents' role as their children's primary educators.</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>In all of our work, our primary commitment is to develop community capacity to address education, economic development, and other issues in an ongoing way. Provision of high-quality direct services is necessary, but does not go far enough: what is needed is the growth of leadership and ownership within communities themselves to carry these initiatives forward on a self-sufficient, sustainable basis.</p>
