  The LANLT was founded in 2002 to address park and health inequities. Our
  mission is to contribute to the equity and well-being of neighborhoods through
  the development of parks, gardens, and community-driven organizing across
  greater Los Angeles. We focus our efforts in low-income communities of color
  that have little access to green space.
