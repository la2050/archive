  In February of 2010, after a couple years of developing the program, honing
  our business model and having our checklist vetted by various entities, AEP
  signed a groundbreaking contract with the Los Angeles Department of Cultural
  Affairs to assess and then assist all City owned cultural facilities to become
  green certified businesses. 
   
   
   
   
   
   Since then we have been asked to be a part of Los Angeles official green business certification program, sharing administrative duties with the Los Angeles Community College District (LACCD) and Los Angeles Visitor and Tourism Board. AEP will assess and administer any business in the arts and culture sector (Museums, Theaters, Art Galleries, Dance Studioâ€™s, Production Offices, Arts related non-profits and Cultural Centers.) LACCD will handle restaurants, garages and general offices and Los Angeles Visitor and Tourism Board will handle green hotels and lodgings. Any business that goes through AEP certification will be recognized as a green business by the City of Los Angeles. We also have the exact same arrangement with the City of Santa Monica and their green business administrator Sustainable Works. This is a powerful new system of greening businesses through non-profits rather then city departments and is unlike any in the country or world.
   
   
   
   
   
   To date we have 40 members in Los Angeles. You can see a full list here. http://artsearthpartnership.org/members/
