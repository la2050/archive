      Stephen Glassman Studio first raised widespread critical acclaim in the
      early 1990â€™s creating free-form bamboo installations for devastated
      urban sites in the aftermath of the Rodney King Riots, Malibu Fires, and
      Northridge Quake. Since then, Stephen Glassman Studio has gone on to do
      significant large-scale projects including a 4,000 square foot sculpture
      plaza at the LNR Warner Center, the Fairmont Skate Park in Salt Lake City,
      Utah, Arkansasâ€™ Southeast Shear (an NEA & White House Millennium
      Project), the Sylvia Campuan Bridge in Bali, and more. Stephen Glassman
      Studio has collaborated with architects such as Sasaki, Steinberg, Miller
      / Hull, and Arup Engineering as a creative consultant to urban master
      planning, as well as in the creation of commissioned art works for
      large-scale projects. Glassman is the recipient of numerous grants and
      awards including the NEA, Nathan Cummings Foundation, LA Cultural
      Endowment, and was a 2000 Chrysler Design Award nominee. Stephen Glassman
      Studioâ€™s work has been collected and exhibited throughout Southern
      California, New York City, and internationally. The design and concept for
      Urban Air first received notice when it won the 2011 London International
      Creativity Award. As a successful Kickstarter project Urban Air went on to
      generate international dialogue about the nature of advertising and the
      role of art in communities, garnering support from over 1500 people
      internationally, with the film about it receiving over 150,000 downloads
      in 125 countries. Urban Air has been written about in countries around the
      Globe including Japan, Greece, Egypt, India, China, Russia, Italy, Peru,
      Brazil, France, England, Taiwan, Italy, Poland, and by publications and/or
      programs including The Huffington Post, Wired (Italy), LA Times, National
      Geographic, Forbes, Dwell, Landscape Architecture, DAD (Peru), Good
      Magazine, NPR, KCET, The Discovery Channel and more. Urban Air is
      currently slated as a main stage presenting project for The NYC Green
      Festival this upcoming April. Since its publication internationally
      Stephen Glassman Studio has received interest and inquiries from all over
      the world about the possibility of Urban Air projects in other cities...
      and the work of the studio, including Urban Air, has been the subject of
      collegiate studies at Vassar College, Syracuse University, Hampshire
      College, and other institutions.
