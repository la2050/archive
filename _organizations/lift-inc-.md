  By some measures, low-income families spend as many as twenty hours/week
  researching, finding, and traveling to multiple agencies to attain the
  services they need. LIFT and One Degree are working together to connect
  overstretched parents to the resources their families need to get ahead. Both
  are data-driven organizations, measurement is built into their systems. 

  We will define our collective impact along the following measures:

  (1)Program uptake: 200 LIFT members will utilize One Degree, as tracked via
  LIFT’s management system, Link. Changes in access can be measured via One
  Degree’s 'Get Started' tracking system, which allows users to tell us that
  they used a service. This puts the power in the hands of those accessing
  resources - the overworked mom, the school teacher, the care provider - and
  ultimately builds a community of advocates.

  (2)Program retention: 75% of LIFT members who use One Degree will utilize the
  resource at least once a month. Tracking and measurement capabilities are
  built directly into One Degree’s system, Mixpanel, and a proprietary dashboard
  to keep track of metrics. 

  (3) Increase in linkages and referrals: of LIFT members who utilize One
  Degree, at least half will have successful completion of a referral towards
  achieving a goal.

  At LIFT-Los Angeles and One Degree, we know that poverty is complex but
  believe that getting help does not have to be. We are combining our respective
  strengths to provide historically marginalized communities with supports to
  address short- and long-term needs and goals. Both in-person and via an online
  tool, LIFT and One Degree are working hand-in-hand with families on their
  journeys out of poverty.

  We know that our city is at its best when the families and networks that make
  up our community are vibrant and resilient – yet far too many of our members
  struggle just to stay afloat. Low-income parents want what all parents do – to
  make a better life for themselves and their children – but they face numerous
  barriers to plugging into the economy and cannot readily access the
  opportunities they need to excel. Through this grant request, LIFT and One
  Degree seek to make LA the best place to live by solidifying the ground on
  which low-income parents stand, thereby creating a fairer society for the next
  generation of Angelenos.
   
  LIFT has always helped our members navigate complex social service systems in
  order to be able to connect to housing, employment, education, child care,
  legal services, and other systems that members bump up against as they
  endeavor to provide a better life for themselves and their families. It has
  always been LIFT’s ultimate goal to empower members to access these
  resources…getting this information directly in their hands instead of being
  the intermediary. Furthermore, we know that this program model can pose a
  potential barrier to members in requiring them to come into our offices to be
  able to engage services and get the information they need.
   
  One Degree, a technology-driven nonprofit, provides LIFT members with a strong
  community resource platform that is uniquely user-friendly and accessible
  (available at all times via computer and mobile device). Partnering with One
  Degree puts LIFT closer to the goal of true empowerment in putting critical
  information directly into their hands. With this technology, LIFT is able to
  be more active in the coaching process in communicating with members to follow
  up on appointments, offer suggestions, send motivating messages- beyond the
  bounds of an office appointment.
   
  Members at LIFT will utilize One Degree in their resource search to directly
  access healthy food, housing assistance, and other resources that help parents
  become more self-sufficient and create happier, healthier homes for their
  children. To track members’ progress, One Degree uses a referral management
  system (RMS). RMS will help streamline LIFT’s work by enabling LIFT staff to
  specifically recommend services and provide a check-list of next steps to
  members. As part of our shared commitment to elevating members’ voices, LIFT
  and One Degree infuse accountability into our work by responding directly to
  members’ feedback and concerns (e.g. via LIFT’s survey system, Constituent
  Voice and One Degree’s rating system), which in turn helps LIFT build a
  higher-quality experience for families.


  LIFT’s strategic approach to partnership-building and One Degree’s innovative
  tech solution represent the future of poverty alleviation: together, we create
  new avenues for greater coordination among diverse stakeholders and empower
  people to access resources efficiently.
