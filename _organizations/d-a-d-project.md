  The purpose of this proposal is for D.A.D Project to provide programs in Los
  Angeles County to help change the culture for men and youth in the community,
  by providing workshops specifically for father/male engagement that support
  school readiness goals. Considering the special role, a father has in the life
  of his children and their overall development. Also, studies show that
  children with an engaged father are more likely to further their education,
  get married, and less likely to become incarcerated. On the other hand, father
  involvement and the prevalence of fatherless homes and communities are a
  crisis in this nation that needs to be addressed. Below is a quote from United
  States Census Bureau: 

  “Children in father absent homes are almost four times more likely to be poor.
  In 2011,12 percent of children in married couple families were living in
  poverty, compared to 44 percent of children in mother only families.” U.S
  Census Bureau, Children’s living arrangements and Characteristics: March 2011,
  table C8. Washington D.C.:2011. 

  “Children whose families maintain high rates of parent participation as early
  as elementary school are 6 times more likely to graduate High
  School”

   By educating parents on their importance and the responsibility of advocating for their children. Our partnership will further the opportunity to spark positive change in the community by empowering and promoting fatherhood and parent engagement in all grade levels. Where we will identify communities where there is a lack of parent involvement and the negative correlation to graduation rates.  Children are at risk of not completing high school, and it’s important for parents to better support their children education by attending college prep trainings, job fairs, stress and communication workshops, health fairs, literacy and S.T.E.A.M programs designed to empower parents to encourage their children to further their education.  D.A.D Project provides support programs and resources for fathers to strengthen the quality of life for participants and their families.  Helping fathers get jobs to provide financial stability in the home, which empowers him to be a positive role model, and offering activities for fathers to participate with their families that strengthen relationships between fathers and their children, and support parent relationships offer a sense of security for their children. Most importantly, connecting the community with young leaders, interns from local colleges to support and encourage students to pursue their education.  The quality of our programs and collaborative partners is the determining factor that makes D.A.D Project a unique contributor to making L.A the best place to learn by empowering and strengthening parent/father engagement.
