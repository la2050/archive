title: UCLA William Andrews Clark Memorial Library
org_type: Nonprofit
org_summary: >-
  The Library has offered a range of public programs and theater productions,
  taking advantage of the collection’s focus on the 17th- and 18th-century, one
  of the great ages of classical drama. Most recently, the Clark Library
  partnered with L.A. Theater Works (LATW) to present “Pride and Prejudice” in
  the Library’s drawing room for a live audience and radio broadcast. Other
  indoor performances have included the operatic scena “Il Combattimento di
  Tancredi e Clorinda” (with Opera UCLA), and William Wycherley’s “The Country
  Wife” in collaboration with UCLA’s School of Theater, Film and Television.
  Theater performances build on the tremendous success of the Clark’s Chamber
  Music Series, now entering its 20th year, which draws over 700 people each
  year.
