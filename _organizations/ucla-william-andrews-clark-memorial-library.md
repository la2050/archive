org_summary: "The Library has offered a range of public programs and theater productions, taking advantage of the collectionâ€™s focus on the 17th- and 18th-century, one of the great ages of classical drama. Most recently, the Clark Library partnered with L.A. Theater Works (LATW) to present â€œPride and Prejudiceâ€\x9D in the Libraryâ€™s drawing room for a live audience and radio broadcast. Other indoor performances have included the operatic scena â€œIl Combattimento di Tancredi e Clorindaâ€\x9D (with Opera UCLA), and William Wycherleyâ€™s â€œThe Country Wifeâ€\x9D in collaboration with UCLAâ€™s School of Theater, Film and Television. Theater performances build on the tremendous success of the Clarkâ€™s Chamber Music Series, now entering its 20th year, which draws over 700 people each year."
