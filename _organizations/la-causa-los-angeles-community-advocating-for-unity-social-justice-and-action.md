  LA CAUSA YouthBuild is regarded as the organization that transformed the
  perception that the lives of the youth it serves from a deficit based
  perspective (identifying the things they lack such as income, healthy food,
  education, employment) to an asset based population (passionate, conceptual
  thinkers, willing, and determined) that can overcome the challenges of life.
  It's asset based thinking model has been adopted nationally by YouthBuild USA
  and many other programs. 
   
   
   LA CAUSA has empowered young leaders since 2005, allowing them the opportunity to go to post secondary education, start their own non-profits, and become gainfully employed in a variety of jobs whereas, as new students in LA CAUSA they were young adults with no high school diplomas and limited job skills. We have served thousands of youth over a very limited time.
   
   
   The organization was recognized by former Secretary of Labor of the Western United States opening of the United We Serve initiative of volunteerism by President Obama in 2010. LA CAUSA has long focused on empowering our youth to volunteer as an AmeriCorps designated site and countless projects to "green" East LA and build gardens and healthy eating and living opportunities. With that our organization continues to be progressive and promote challenging learning models including a mental toughness curriculum designed to prepare our youth for the world outside of our walls.
   
   
   Recognized as one of unincorporated East Los Angeles's only youth services group. The opportunities and resources in the community are relatively limited while showing significant positive outcomes.
