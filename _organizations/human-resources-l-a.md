  HRLA was a collaborator and grant receiver of Getty Museum for PST festival
  2012, We have collaborated with REDCAT Gallery, UC Riverside, CalArts, LAND,
  Machine Projects on cooperative programs. Human Resources is a team of
  creative individuals, whose mission is to broaden public engagement with
  contemporary and conceptual art. Our organization emphasizes underexposed
  modes of expression and interdisciplinary arts practices that do not fit
  easily within existing institutionalized structures.
   
   
   
   
   
   Human Resources was identified by the Los Angeles Weekly in 2012 as one of the city's "most dynamic arts venues." We foster active public appreciation of performative, participatory and multi-disciplinary art practices by encouraging maximum community access. Events are free or very low cost. Members of our broad community generate exhibitions, performances and readings - artists who attend our events are encouraged to bring proposals to directing members. Our programming procedures encourage direct conversation with artists, musicians and writers in order to educate our audiences about our mission. These conversations also shape our understanding of the needs of artists working in non-commercial and experimental paradigms. 
   
   
   
   
   
   Human Resources serves as an important point of convergence for diverse and sometimes disparate art communities. We offer regular platforms for conversation and idea-sharing in order to promote the sustainability of non-traditional art forms. We nurture the kinds of artistic intelligence produced by working closely with different artistic communities - such as that of experimental music and performance art. We have also collaborated with other art spaces and events, including Pacific Standard Time, Silvershed's Collective show, fundraisers and events for Les Figues Press and Darin Klein's Box of Books, and the Chinatown Perform!Now! Festival. We continue to provide a substantial venue for large events, installations, video screenings, music performance, performance art and hybrid events in the Chinatown area of Los Angeles.
