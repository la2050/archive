  The Boys & Girls Club of Venice was established in 1968 as a VISTA project on
  Venice Beach. The Club then operated for many years from a converted duplex
  home on Lincoln Boulevard, which was finally condemned after the 1994
  Northridge earthquake. In 2000, after a successful capital campaign, the Club
  celebrated the grand opening of its new 30,000 sq.ft. facility at 2232 Lincoln
  Boulevard. The new Club features a basketball court and gymnasium, stage area,
  kitchen, teen/career center and store, counseling department, community room,
  music room, wellness center, art studio, activity center, computerized
  learning center, library, and administrative offices. 
   
   
   
   
   
   The past year has been an amazing culmination of opportunity meeting execution. Through the generosity of our donors and volunteers and with the care and commitment of our staff, we have created an environment where reaching new heights is the norm, and excellence prevails in many areas of the Club.
   
   
    
   
   
   Since 2006, we have increased the number of college scholarships distributed annually from one to eight with the total amount annually distributed increasing from $1,000 to over $60,000.
   
   
    
   
   
   In the fall of 2010, the Club completed its fourth major renovation project in the last five years when it opened its doors to the newly renovated teen lounge. The renovation of the teen lounge comes after major renovations of the art center, technology center, and gymnasium.
   
   
    
   
   
   In 2011, the Club chartered its fifth after-school site at Mark Twain Middle School, where we will service middle school students through our Tomorrow’s Leaders, PowerHour homework help, the arts, sports, fitness, and recreation programs.
   
   
    
   
   
   These services are critical and are coming at a time, when children and families need the support of the community to navigate the challenging waters of unemployment, decreased government spending, and unforgiving streets.
   
   
    
   
   
   In our Club as a whole, over three-quarters of our members are Latino/a, or African American. Our Club children are challenged every day by the breakdown of traditional family structures:
   
   
    
   
   
   48% of Club members are from single parent households 59% qualify for free or reduced-price lunches at school Several LAPD Gang Injunctions reflect gang territories; our youth walk through them on the way to school.
   
   
   
   
   
   In spite of these challenges, we continue to achieve miracles, and enhance our core services. Without the support of individuals like you who breathe life into our youth development organization, our mission and work would be filled with empty dreams and missed opportunities to make a difference in the life of a child.
