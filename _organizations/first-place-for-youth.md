  First Place demonstrates that with the right guidance and support, at the
  right time, foster youth can defy the odds that are so stacked against them
  and reach their full potential in school, work, and life. In the coming year,
  First Place will expand in Los Angeles County by almost 40 percent (from 145
  to 200 youth), and we expect youth to meet the following positive education
  and employment outcomes:

  * 70 percent of youth will receive their high school diploma or GED
  certificate, or will be actively pursuing their high school diploma or
  equivalent. 

  * 80 percent of eligible youth will successfully enroll in post-secondary
  education. 

  * 70 percent of youth will obtain employment, and/or realize a wage increase
  or promotion. 


  First Place has a customized performance management database that allows us to
  collect a variety of quantitative and qualitative data to track the progress
  of participants across four primary domains: education, employment, housing,
  and healthy living. Data tracked includes: school attendance, education
  progress, employment status, income, avoidance of risky behaviors, etc. We
  also administer outcome surveys when a participant exits the program, and then
  again at six months and 12 months post-exit.  First Place’s Evaluation and
  Learning Department analyzes program data in real-time to identify trends
  among our youth, and effectively improve interventions and program delivery.

  First Place will expand our program operations, currently located in
  Koreatown, and launch a new satellite office within the A+P Campus. By
  providing outcomes-driven services to more youth in need, First Place can push
  for higher standards through our leadership in the field and change the way
  that youth are treated within the foster care system.

  First Place will help make LA the best place to learn by providing foster
  youth with the skills they need to be college and career ready. The First
  Place program is designed to achieve the following objectives: 1) Youth make
  important progress in their educational attainment by finishing high school
  and enrolling in college; 2) Youth improve their economic security by
  increasing their job skills and career readiness; and 3) Youth are provided
  access to safe housing, which allows them to focus on strengthening the
  self-sufficiency skills needed to be an independent adult. 


  Youth growing up in foster care are among LA County’s most at-risk
  populations. These are young people who experience trauma and neglect within
  their families. As these young people grow older, many struggle to succeed in
  school and find work, and have yet to develop critical self-sufficiency
  skills. A 2014 study by the National Working Group on Foster Care and
  Education found that 85 percent of foster youth say they want to go to
  college, but only 49 percent of foster youth graduate high school and only 20
  percent enroll in a postsecondary program. First Place helps youth reduce
  high-risk behaviors and build the critical skills needed to live a healthy,
  independent life. Last year in Los Angeles, 97 percent of youth were attending
  school or employed within six months of entering the First Place program. 


  Youth participants are each assigned both a Youth Advocate (Master’s Level
  Social Worker) and an Education and Employment Specialist (EE). Specific
  support services include:

  * Intensive Case Management: Weekly Youth Advocate meetings are a critical
  opportunity to develop individual goals in the areas of education, employment,
  health, and personal relationships. 

  * Intensive Education Support: EE’s support youth in completing their high
  school diploma or GED certificate and, once eligible, enrolling in college.
  EE’s provide in-depth assessments and academic tutoring (as needed), and youth
  participate in ongoing education activities that prepare them to enroll in
  college. Youth enrolled in college receive support in course selection and
  identifying critical on-campus resources for financial aid and academic
  support.

  * Intensive Employment Support and Career Exploration: With the support of
  their EE, young people gain skills around employment readiness and success in
  the workplace, and they have the opportunity to explore careers and select a
  career path. Youth receive support around job training and retention, goal
  setting, and building work readiness skills. 

  * Linked Learning Opportunities: First Place’s linked learning opportunities
  are focused on nine distinct career pathways (Health Care, Human Services,
  Hospitality, Law Enforcement, Logistics, Business, Green Tech, Office
  Administration, and Media Arts), all of which offer youth the opportunity to
  receive an industry-recognized certificate and can lead to a living-wage
  career.
