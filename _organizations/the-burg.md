  We will consider The Burg a success if we accomplish the following:


  1. Expand the number of people who play an active part in their community and
  local politics


  2. Improve communication between residents as well as between community
  leaders, elected officials, and civic organizations


  3. Increase voter registration and turnout


  As a nonpartisan platform, our goal is not to push a particular political
  agenda. Rather, we aim to get as many people involved in their community as
  possible and give them the tools to improve their city. Although it is
  difficult to measure civic engagement on the local level, there are a number
  of reliable indicators we will consult, such as voter turnout, the instances
  of locally driven campaigns and petitions, and the prevalence of community
  oriented discussions around public issues. These metrics, along with direct
  feedback from elected officials, organizations, and community leaders will
  give us a measure of the success of The Burg.   Furthermore, by requiring
  users to register to vote or verify their status to access The Burg, we aim to
  directly increase voter registration.

  The Burg is an online platform that will make it easy for individuals to
  address the local issues of their community in real time. The Burg will
  connect members of a district and allow them to communicate directly through
  collective expression (i.e. petitions, campaigns, public service projects). By
  creating a private space dedicated to informing and organizing members of a
  community, the Burg will connect LA residents and cultivate civic engagement
  in a truly innovative way.

  We built the Burg in response to the lack of local civic engagement and
  community involvement we noticed in our city.  After meeting with dozens of
  local organizations, neighborhood councils, and community leaders, we realized
  that the central problem facing local civic engagement is how widespread and
  disconnected our communities are. The online hyperconnectivity that defines
  our relationships with our friends, family, and even our work life is
  noticeably absent when it comes to local civic involvement. In fact, there is
  no easy way for a community to share information and take action over local
  issues.


  In response we created The Burg, a digital public square built exclusively for
  your community. The Burg is an online and mobile based platform that brings
  together the different elements of civic engagement on a single platform, from
  local discussions and citizen driven projects, to information about upcoming
  policy and city planning.


  Residents submit posts which are then seen, discussed, and upvoted or
  downvoted by the community. In this way the most pressing and important issues
  are brought to the forefront for everyone to see and interact with. Community
  members will have the option of making different types of posts, including
  simple text posts as well as more complex options such as petitions,
  campaigns, videos, polls, and projects.


  The Burg will also connect communities with their elected leadership and
  government organizations. Elected officials and publically funded offices such
  as LAPD, LAFD, Neighborhood Council and City Council will have unique verified
  pages to inform and communicate with their Burg. From these pages they can
  make public posts as well as solicit feedback on certain issues through polls
  and direct Q&A’s posts.  


  When a new user wants to join The Burg they will need to either prove they are
  a registered voter, or register to vote online, right then and there.  We also
  provide an option to join The Burg for those unable to register to vote. We
  have collaborated with the nonprofit group Rock the Vote to provide a quick
  and easy way to verify and register voters online through The Burg.  A Burg
  user’s community will consist of their City Council district, with the option
  to expand to include neighboring areas if they choose.
      
  At the heart of this project is our belief that cities are home to a vast
  reserve of untapped potential in the form of actively engaged residents.
  People do care about the areas they live in and they want some say in
  direction of their city. By making communication easier, information about
  local issues more accessible, and organizing readily available for all, we can
  unlock some of that potential. We believe through the use of technology, we
  can make LA the best place to connect by lowering some of the barriers that
  inhibit civic engagement.
