  LA LISC is seeking to engage stakeholders in a coordinated effort to develop
  cultural economic strategies. It is our hope to inspire the need for
  neighborhood and historic preservation of culture in demanding economic
  conditions. Success will be evaluated by the following metrics: 


  • 10 participant communities/commercial districts and neighborhoods in the
  Cultural Economic Development Summit (40-50 participants); 


  • Four project partners implement an iconic cultural economic development idea
  from among their strategy during the grant period; 


  • Four project partners complete inventory of small businesses that contribute
  to the cultural economy; 


  • At least 20 businesses receive technical assistance to nurture their growth
  and development; and 


  • At least 4 businesses receive financial assistance.

  Over the last 10 years, LA neighborhoods have undergone unprecedented change.
  Expanding public transit options and the blossoming of dynamic art centers,
  have transformed neighborhoods that once had limited desirability into
  attractive places to live and work. LA LISC seeks to empower four culturally
  diverse neighborhoods to negotiate the change process and develop a robust
  approach for leveraging culture as a tool for promoting sustainable
  neighborhood identities and economic development.

  communities.


  Over the last 10 years, Los Angeles neighborhoods have undergone unprecedented
  change. Expanding public transit options, the blossoming of artistic cultural
  centers, as well as the increased interest in urban life, have transformed
  neighborhoods that once had limited desirability, into attractive places to
  live and work. This has often meant an escalation of rents resulting in the
  displacement of many residents in communities across the Los Angeles
  landscape. Ultimately, this phenomena has the potential to transition the
  urban core of the city from a collection of culturally dynamic neighborhoods,
  to a relatively homogeneous area populated based on one’s ability to afford
  the rents. However, as noted in a recent paper by UCLA researchers, there is
  the opportunity to occupy the space “in between” the neighborhoods of the
  recent past and the potentially gentrified future to negotiate the ultimate
  destiny of the neighborhood. In particular, cultural economic development
  provides a solid platform through which to level the playing field in the tug
  of war that determines a neighborhood's future.


  LA LISC, in collaboration with LA Commons, are poised to take on the challenge
  of supporting local stakeholders in 4 distinct neighborhoods by engaging
  businesses, residents, merchant associations, arts-related entities and
  community based organizations to maximize collaboration and harness the
  creative cultural potential to achieve a sustainable future that allocates the
  benefits more equitably. Through this work, we will further the development of
  more culturally-based businesses and solidify neighborhood identities and the
  ability of residents to live and work locally.


  As part of the project, LA LISC will: 


  (1) Convene a cultural economic development summit to address the many facets
  of cultural economic development and connect participants to creative
  strategies that have been used both locally and nationally. Attendees will be
  exposed to many ideas to pilot in their neighborhoods. 


  (2) Activate 4 cultural magnets with a pilot or iconic activity that will spur
  the creation of culturally-based businesses. The cultural magnets include:
  Central Avenue Historic District (local partner: Coalition for Responsible
  Community Development), Little Tokyo (Little Tokyo Service Center), East Los
  Angeles/Boyle Heights (East Los Angeles Community Corporation and Leimert Park
  (LP Village 20|20 Vision Initiative).


  (3) Support and grow entrepreneurial enterprises contributing to neighborhood
  cultural vibrancy. The goal will be to assist these businesses with access to
  capital, information, larger markets and technical assistance.
