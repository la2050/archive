  LA County is modernizing the voting experience. In order to educate the
  community about this new voting experience, the County will engage Angelenos
  through a mock election. This mock election will allow voters to interact with
  the new technologies that will be used in future elections, and experience
  firsthand the exciting changes.The mock election will encourage voters to be
  more engaged in their community and the democratic process.

  The County’s current voting system has served the voters of Los Angeles County
  with accuracy and integrity since 1968, the design of the systems and the age
  of their technology do not offer the technical and functional elasticity
  necessary to continue to accommodate our growing and increasingly diverse
  electorate. Additionally, the existing voting systems market is limited and
  inadequate to meet the needs of our region. We are overdue for solutions that
  are transparent, publicly owned and that ensure the security and integrity of
  our elections. In 2020, the Los Angeles County will introduce a new voting
  experience that will address many of these concerns. To prepare Angelenos for
  this change, we will conduct a mock election in September 2019 at 50-100
  locations throughout the County. 
   
   
   
    
   
   
   
   By providing Angelenos the opportunity to become civically engaged through this mock election, the Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk (RR/CC) will get voters excited to try a new and improved voting model that addresses their needs. We also hope that this activation will increase the rates of voting in Los Angeles County. This new voting model, and the mock election, will support LA2050’s goal to make “Los Angeles the most civically engaged region in the U.S. During the Presidential Primary Election in 2016, only roughly 42% of registered voters cast a ballot. For the Presidential General Election on November 2016, 69% of Los Angeles County voters turned out to vote. LA County sees much lower turnout rates for off-cycle election. As is the case of the CA 34th District Representative election; turnout for the Primary Election in April, 2017 as well as the General Election in June, 2017 was just 14% of registered voters. With the mock election, we hope to activate Angelenos to vote in all elections, not just Presidential Elections. We also want to increase the number of registered voters, and make voting easier and more accessible to those voters. This mock election will provide eligible voters who are not yet registered the opportunity to register on-site the day of the mock election. 
   
   
   
    
   
   
   
   The mock election will serve as a way for the RR/CC to gather feedback from voters about their thoughts on the new modernized voting system. This will ensure that the RR/CC, a government entity, is responsive to the needs of LA residents when it comes to exercising their right to vote. An increased responsiveness to the voting needs of Angelenos will in turn make Los Angeles a hub for innovation, policy changes, and government transparency. 
   
   
   
    
   
   
   
   Like the efforts of LA2050 to “#PartyatthePolls,” the mock election is a county wide event that is all about voter engagement, activation, and education. At the various mock election sites, the RR/CC will ensure that the changes to the voting experience and the new voting system are perceived as fun and exciting.
project_proposal_engage: >-
  This activation will target all demographics of voters, but in particular
  those who traditionally have low-participation rates in elections. These
  include young adults (ages 18-29) and communities of color. LA2050’s goal is
  to have Los Angeles be the best place to connect is to have the “voting
  population reflect the diversity of the region,” and to have “75% of Angelenos
  report voting often in local elections.” With this mock election, the RR/CC
  will push towards ensuring that those goals are met and that all eligible
  Angelenos participate in all elections, including local, state, and federal
  elections. 
   
   
   
    
   
   
   
   One strategy that the RR/CC will employ will be working with local community organizations to engage the voters and disseminate information about the election. Also, we plan on having a multiplatform mass media campaign surrounding elections which will include multi-lingual promotional materials on buses, bus benches, billboards, and street banners placed throughout LA County. Also, we will engage voters via social media through interactive Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter posts, as well as placing promotional material on those sites highlighting the mock election. Lastly, our efforts will include on-air TV, and radio interviews broadcast in a variety of languages to ensure voters of all ages, and demographics throughout the entire LA County know of this mock election.
project_measure: >-
  To successfully measure the success of our mock election, we will look at
  three different metrics: voter impression and successful interaction with new
  model, voter turnout for the day of the mock election, and voter turnout at
  elections post-mock election.To measure the first metric, an in-person survey
  will be administered by an election volunteer after voters interact with the
  various components of the new voting experience. This survey will measure the
  voter’s first-impressions, as well as gather feedback as to how LA County can
  continue improving the experience, and how accessible and easy-to-use the new
  model is. To measure the second metric, the RR/CC will track the number of
  Angelenos who visited any of the available Vote Center locations during the
  mock election. Registered voters will be able to check-in utilizing the new
  ePollbooks, and eligible voters who are not registered will have the
  opportunity to register to vote on-site and cast a ballot, a new option for
  eligible voters. The further measure effectiveness, we will track our social
  media interactions and mentions on the day of the mock election to see how
  Angelenos are talking about this activation on their various platforms. To
  measure the metric of “post-mock election voter turnout,” the RR/CC will track
  voter turnout rates for the election occurring from 2020-2022, and compare
  those figures with those of previous elections to analyze whether the mock
  election sparked greater interest in civic engagement.
project_five_years: >-
  In 5 years, LA County will have a modernized voting system utilized for all
  elections that will cater to all county demographics by being accessible to
  all. We will strive to ensure that the number of voters turning out for
  elections keeps growing, and that we can demonstrate increased voter awareness
  and participation in all elections. Lastly, in 5 years we hope that other
  counties will utilize this new voting model and provide their respective
  constituents with a modernized voting experience, and that they would be able
  to tailor it to the specific needs of their communities.
