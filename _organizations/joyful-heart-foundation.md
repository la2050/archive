  The evaluation of the Retreat Model’s effectiveness will be led by Mary Ann
  Dutton, Ph.D., a Professor of Psychiatry at Georgetown University. Dr. Dutton
  is a well-respected clinical psychologist and researcher with over 20 years of
  extensive experience in the areas of intimate partner violence and alternative
  healing practices. The evaluation will include standardized quantitative
  assessment measures (Patient Health Questionnaire--Somatic; Insomnia Severity
  Index; PTSD Checklist; Perceived Stress Scales; Multidimensonal Fatigue
  Symptom Inventory Short Form; and Satisfaction of Life Scale)that track levels
  of PTSD symptoms, stress related outcomes, and the acquisition of healing and
  wellness competencies: self-efficacy, positive self-concept, increased
  self-compassion, healthy coping skills, decreased isolation, and increased
  connectedness among program participants. Qualitative assessments will target
  patterns of isolation and physical health factors that directly relate to
  ability to access support within their families, friends and community.
  Assessments will be captured in data collection periods: two weeks prior to
  retreat, two weeks following retreat and at three and six months post retreat.

  The demand for our signature Survivor Retreat Program for survivors of
  domestic and sexual violence exceeds its availability and reach. In response,
  we have undertaken an ambitious research project in partnership with
  Georgetown University to evaluate our retreats. Our research findings will
  used to create a replicable Retreat Model that organizations can implement and
  offer to survivors, the healing professionals who serve them, and communities
  beyond our current capacity and scope.

  The domestic violence and sexual assault service provider community currently
  faces an unprecedented challenge in effectively helping survivors understand
  and heal from the trauma that they have endured. The challenge is twofold:
  there is a void in access to and training for services that holistically
  address a survivor's mind, body and spirit in order to activate long-term
  change. And, for the past forty years, the field has been so entrenched in
  meeting the immediate needs of survivors with limited resources and support
  that staff are themselves, suffering from high levels of vicarious trauma. A
  2009 study in Violence Against Women found that 70% of participating domestic
  violence advocates met the criteria for clinical levels of post-traumatic
  stress disorder. As a result, despite extensive personal sacrifice from front
  line workers in the field, the services that survivors receive oftentimes fail
  to meet the overwhelming need in both volume and quality. This challenge has
  been amplified in Los Angeles, where in 2015, the LAPD announced that reports
  of sexual assault had increased by 21% and domestic violence incidents had
  increased by 33%.
   
  Joyful Heart Foundation's four-day retreat is designed to restore
  participants' central nervous systems by addressing the physical, emotional
  and psychological impact of trauma, reducing the short and long term effects
  of this trauma, and ultimately laying the groundwork for participants to
  create healthy, permanent change in their own lives. Retreats are separately
  offered to survivors and healing professionals. The retreat offers 16 key
  workshops that integrate traditional and alternative healing methods and
  provide participants with tools they can implement themselves, post retreat.
  Participants are provided with nourishing meals, bodywork, time for
  reflection, and space and direction to create their own action plans for
  change and healing. 


  With support from LA2050, JHF will implement two survivor retreats. To date,
  Georgetown University has evaluated three survivor retreats and a retreat for
  healing professionals. The aim of this project is to demonstrate the
  effectiveness of the retreat as a new approach to healing and as an
  evidence-informed model that organizations can bring to their staff and client
  populations. This project will make LA a better place to LIVE by promoting
  positive mental health outcomes, community resiliency and increased support
  for advocates in this work.
