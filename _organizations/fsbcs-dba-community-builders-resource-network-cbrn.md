  The First Southern Baptist Church of Sylmar (FSBCS), who is the sponsoring
  partner of this initiative, began a food pantry immediately after the
  Northridge earthquake in ’94, as a distributor for FEMA. Since the need to
  assist the hungry didn’t end once the infrastructure was repaired, neither did
  the FSBCS. The church is quite small; in fact, it averages less than 50 people
  a week for its Sunday service — yet it provides food to an average of 5,000
  people per month. It manages to do this week after week, month after month,
  year after year — with a workforce comprised entirely of volunteers. There are
  no administrative costs or overhead. 
   
   
   
   
   
   This has been done by effectively collaborating with a host of other community organizations from withing the public and private sectors. As continued recipients of Federal resources, the boundaries between Church and State are clearly understood and respected.
