  In 8 years, our organization has grown into one of the most well-established
  organizations dedicated to organizing and political engagement of LGBT people
  of color. We are one of the largest non-service-based groups, based on staff
  size and member involvement, representing Asian and Pacific Islander LGBT
  people. We have a robust volunteer base of hundreds of activists and 5
  standing committee, which plan and execute a year-round calendar of
  activities. The creation of this space and organization in itself is perhaps
  our greatest achievement, since prior to our existence there was not an
  organization dedicated to political empowerment of API LGBT people. Along with
  our allies, we provide an important foundation for further organizing in LGBT
  communities of color.
