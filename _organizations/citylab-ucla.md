  cityLAB, a research center at UCLAâ€™s School of the Arts and Architecture,
  was founded in 2006 by Director Dana Cuff and Co-Director Roger Sherman. Since
  that time it has become one of the most well respected urban think tanks in
  America. cityLAB was featured in Architecture Magazine, on CNN International
  News, in Newsweek Magazine, and in the American Pavilion of the Venice
  Biennale. It gained worldwide recognition and the national spotlight with its
  open design competition, WPA2.0-Working Public Architecture, the results of
  which were presented to lawmakers in Washington DC and key members of
  President Obamaâ€™s urban advisory team. cityLABâ€™s important role in Los
  Angeles is increasingly evident through its frequent mention in the news, its
  work to revitalize Westwood Village, its studies about the ways high speed
  rail and transit systems can improve civic life, its role in advancing new
  urban policy, and its championing of good design in our region. cityLAB is
  successful when it explores new ideas for urban design that reach the public,
  studentsâ€”our next generation of urban activists, and urban leaders of all
  stripes.
