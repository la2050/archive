  Liberty Hill invests in community groups on the frontlines of change with
  critical resources that are needed to advance their work and win. We
  supplement those financial resources with a highly impactful training program
  designed to advance grassroots campaigns for social change. 
   
   
   
   
   
   Over the last 10 years, this is what Liberty Hill has helped our grantees deliver for Los Angeles:
   
   
   
   
   
   * Nearly 100,000 low-income men and women registered to vote
   
   
   * Legal safeguards to protect California's 25,000 LGBTQ high school students from harassment and violence
   
   
   * 25,000 men and women raised above the poverty level by living wage jobs
   
   
   * $400 million secured for parks in low-income neighborhoods
   
   
   * 400,000 L.A. bus riders ride the largest clean-fuel bus fleet in the country
   
   
   * $1.74 million in back wages for men and women working at poverty wages in Koreatown supermarkets
   
   
   * 300,000 bottle-fed babies safe from the toxic chemical BPA
