  MAKE IT IN LA is a community of diverse creators who turn their passions into
  products in L.A.; our content, connections and programming help entrepreneurs
  create products and brands that matter.
project_proposal_description: >-
  Our first Maker Walk attracted 500+ attendees for a choose-your-own-adventure
  of businesses and factories in the Arts District. They begged for more, so we
  will sustain and replicate the experience in maker hotspots around the region
  (DTLA, El Segundo, Long Beach, Vernon). So doing, we’ll raise consumer
  awareness of locally-made brands, identify and cultivate champions for
  manufacturing, and encourage creators to partner with local factories to fully
  unleash the creative potential of the city.

    corporate social responsibility)

    Encourage creators to partner with local manufacturers. Identify and inspire
    champions to advocate for local manufacturing. Inspire consumers to change
    their buying behavior and share content about LA-made brands. Activate the
    local (and national) media to highlight and celebrate local manufacturing. 
project_proposal_best_place: >-
  Los Angeles is the largest center for manufacturing in the country, with half
  a million jobs—that’s nearly four times as many jobs as film and
  television—yet most Angelenos don’t fully appreciate its importance to our
  economy. More important than jobs, manufacturing is a critical piece of
  innovation infrastructure that, if activated, could better unleash Los
  Angeles’ creative potential. 
   
   
   
   Maker walk engages thought leaders and the creative public for a unique look behind manufacturing in the city. Our pilot run attracted more than 500 participants. They checked in for this free event at the Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator and received a map for a self-guided walking tour of the Arts District neighborhood. Participants enjoyed visits to a dozen different factories and businesses, including Hyperloop, Angel City Brewery, La La Land Production and Design, HIVE lighting, the LADWP substation, the Advanced Prototyping Center, Blue Bottle, Greenbar Distillery, and Oblong Industries. It ended with an after party, featuring mini maker workshops and locally crafted cocktails at locally made shoe brand, COMUNITY. You can watch a video here: http://makeitinla.org/makerwalkvideo 
   
   
   
   Our attendees were impressed and surprised by the diversity of industries that are manufacturing in LA and they asked us for more. To build on Maker Walk’s success and expand its impact, we want to engage new neighborhoods and manufacturers and become a monthly event. We have yet to finalize the neighborhoods, but we have begun to scout venues in El Segundo, Pasadena, Vernon, in DTLA, and Long Beach.
   
   
   
   We have partnered with Artisanal LA and the LA Food Fest to bring a pop-up market aspect to enhance the event. The markets will raise awareness of consumers and inspire them to purchase locally made goods. 
   
   
   
   Because the tours are so visual, we expect many attendees to share on social media and we will add playful encouragements for sharing like photo stations. We will highlight many of the makers and manufacturers on social media and on our website to drive traffic and awareness. We will also implement an extensive PR campaign to attract media coverage.
   
   
   
   We anticipate repeating our Arts District Maker Walk in October 2018, and ramping up to a total of 18 events in the grant period. We expect to grow by 10% each month and attract more than 2,500 attendees per event by the second year, for a total of 25,000 attendees to date.

  Maker Walk will help make connections and inspire founders and aspiring
  entrepreneurs to consider “making it” in Los Angeles. We will use the events
  to uncover new creators to engage in our events and our Catalyst program and
  new manufacturers that we can support. 
   
   
   
   We will use the events as opportunities to reach the public with the message “manufacturing is sexy” through the media, social media, and our attendees. The events will be visually appealing to make it easy for people to share with their friends and raise awareness among the public. We will highlight manufacturers and brands hosting tours and selling at the market on our website.
   
   
   
   The pop-up markets will inspire and enable consumers to buy locally-made.
   
   
   
   We hope as these rotating events move, each neighborhood and city will start organizing additional events to involve their local residents, to expand our impact even further.
project_measure: >-
  We will measure our impact through the number of attendees (projected
  25,000+). This is the most important metric because by taking part they will
  become champions for local manufacturing. We will also track the number of
  website visits and profile views (100,000+), social media shares, and
  qualitative responses to surveys.
project_five_years: >-
  We aim to make Maker Walk will be a monthly institution, part of the cultural
  fabric of Los Angeles, attracting thousands of people from diverse parts of
  the region and beyond to celebrate manufacturing and locally made. We hope it
  becomes successful enough that we can replicate this in other cities to help
  them celebrate their ecosystems
