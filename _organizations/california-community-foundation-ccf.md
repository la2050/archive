org_summary: "Since implementation in May 2012, our five service partners have enrolled 105 BLOOM youth into their respective programs. We are planning to add at least four more service partners in June 2013. We will continue to add partners over the next couple of years to help us reach our projected target number of 2,000 youth served by 2017.\n \n \n \n \n \n Our â€œBLOOMersâ€\x9D are being provided with unique opportunities. As part of our partnersâ€™ program models, BLOOMers not only have positive connections to male mentors but also spend more than 100 hours undergoing self-actualization training which includes leadership development, cultural enrichment, and guidance on succeeding in school and the workplace and other important topics.\n \n \n \n \n \n Two BLOOMers earned an exclusive opportunity to participate in the six-week AEG Job Shadowing program. The program takes place from February 20 through March 15. This exclusive opportunity is only offered to one out of every 2,000 high school students in Los Angeles. The program will allow BLOOMers an opportunity for regular exposure to the daily operations behind one of the most successful entertainment companies in the world while learning critical job skills that will make them competitive in the workplace.\n \n \n \n \n \n The following profile provides just one example of our BLOOMers (the name has been changed to protect confidentiality of the youth). \n \n \n \n \n \n James is completing his senior year at Evans Community Learning Center in the heart of Downtown Los Angeles. James is on probation for being involved with a grand theft auto incident. He would like to attend San Diego State University in the fall. His interests lie in Human Behavior and Philosophy. James has participated in community service activities such as feeding the homeless and neighborhood beautification projects. People who meet James find it hard to believe he has any association to Probation. However, James recently shared that, â€œI thought I was living life the way it was supposed to be lived in the inner-city. I just didnâ€™t know better. I now realize there are options and opportunities.â€\x9D\n \n \n \n \n \n In conjunction with LAGRANT COMMUNICATIONS, CCF has produced print and radio media placements and materials to expand BLOOMâ€™s messaging. Examples of such placements include: KJLH radio (radio spots by BLOOM spokesperson Larenz Tate), The Huffington Post, California Crusader, and coverage on KABC7 Eyewitness News at 6 pm. BLOOM is also one of five philanthropic initiatives featured in Where Do We Go from Here?: Philanthropic Support for Black Men and Boys, a report published in October 2012 by The Foundation Center. The report examines U.S. foundation giving explicitly in support of Black males by issue area, type of support, and geographic area served. The analyses explore patterns of giving by larger U.S. foundations over the past eight years, with a focus on giving from 2008 to 2010."
