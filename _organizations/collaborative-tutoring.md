  <p>Collaborative Tutoring is an organization driven by the ultimate goal of
  collaborating with businesses, organizations, agencies, the young people, and
  their families to promote teaching through mentoring. Collaborative Tutoring
  has been able to connect with community-based-organizations and other agencies
  to provide services and resources to not only students in the Collaborative
  Tutoring program, but to at-risk and high-risk youth and young adults in
  low-income communities. We have also implemented an informal mentoring model
  embedded within the organizationâ€™s structure to improve student educational
  success and their socio-emotional development as well.</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>We have also been able to connect with collaborative partners to provide internship opportunities within their businesses/organizations. </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>It is our goal to continue to develop and implement a structured Mentoring and Internship program for our students.</p>
