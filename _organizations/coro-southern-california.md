  Coro Southern California uses a sophisticated blend of experiential learning
  and seminar-based training to give emerging leaders the skills and frameworks
  they need to lead ethically and effectively.
project_proposal_description: >-
  Coro’s Neighborhood Leaders Program (NLP) is a nine-month, part-time program
  that provides a cohort of 25 emerging leaders from South LA with leadership
  training to solve complex challenges in their community, effectuate lasting
  change, and activate thousands of other community members to do the same. NLP
  cultivates South LA leaders through a cross-sectoral skill-building immersion,
  equipping participants with the skills, knowledge, and networks to enact
  impactful change in their communities.

  Coro’s mission is to strengthen the democratic process by preparing emerging
  leaders for effective and ethical leadership in public affairs. For over 60
  years, Coro Southern California has used the city as its classroom to teach
  rising leaders from across sectors how Southern California works so they can
  make it better. Today, Coro’s multiple leadership development programs
  continue to strengthen the region’s leadership pipeline by cultivating a
  community of alumni who are shaping the future of Los Angeles.
   
   
   
   NLP will bring Coro’s proven training methodology to South LA community leaders and equip them with the skills they need to understand complex policy issues and effectively enact impactful change in their communities. Program participants will also gain an in-depth understanding of city and county government, political campaigns, and large-scale community organizing efforts.
   
   
   
   Through the program components outlined below, participants will gain the knowledge, skills and network to directly impact three metrics outlined under LA2050’s CONNECT goal: (1) government responsiveness to residents’ needs; (2) increased participation in neighborhood councils; (3) and increased rates of volunteerism.
   
   
   
   1) Interviews: Through inquiry-based exploration, NLP participants will interview leaders across the public, private, and nonprofit sectors in South LA, helping participants to build key relationships and expand their social capital, learn important subject matter from experts, and build strategies to advocate for their communities.
   
   2) Issue Days: Each cohort will travel the region to explore policy issues and complex community challenges. Participants will come away with in-depth knowledge of the issues persistent in their neighborhoods, and the resolve to enact change.
   
   3) Group Projects: NLP cohorts will engage in group projects, immediately applying the program tools and knowledge gained to navigating complex challenges with high levels of ambiguity. This includes a Neighborhood Logic Study, where the cohort will collectively study and present on the “logic” of their community.
   
   4) Seminar Training: Participants will engage in leadership development, reflective practice, and hard skills training through a variety of analytical tools and frameworks used to train civic leaders for over 60 years.
   
   5) Community Change Projects: NLP participants will apply their program learnings and newly expanded networks to launch community change projects addressing the salient challenges they’ve identified and explored throughout their experience.
   
   
   
   NLP’s core goal is to connect community leaders in South LA to each other and to the civic network in the region. Through this cohort-based, experiential learning, participants will not only be more inclined to run for Neighborhood Council seats, engage their elected officials to respond to their needs, and increase the rate of volunteerism; they will have the skills to activate and guide thousands more to do the same.

  NLP will help current and emerging local community leaders from underserved
  communities in South LA to develop stronger civic leadership skills that
  enable them to be more effective leaders within their communities and our
  city. Through Coro’s proven methodology of cross-sectoral, inquiry-based,
  experiential learning, participants are given the skills, resolve, and
  networks to champion meaningful change in South LA and activate thousands of
  other community members to do the same. Participants will be those who reside
  and/or work in South LA, age 18 or older, who currently volunteer to support
  an organization or institution within their community. Examples include school
  PTAs, faith-based organizations, neighborhood councils, or local non-profits. 
   
   
   
   NLP will involve leadership development seminars each month exploring topics such as community asset mapping, effective inquiry, and reflective practice. Seminars will be coupled with one-day issue explorations each month: a deep dive inquiry-based investigation into the challenges most prevalent in South LA. These Issue Days will involve interviews with leaders across sectors to provide participants with multiple point of views to analyze. At the program’s conclusion, each participant will launch a community change project to use their newfound leadership skills, frameworks, and connections to bring concrete improvements to their community.
project_measure: >-
  By participating in NLP, South LA neighborhood leaders will:




  *Examine challenges facing their South LA communities;


  *Employ Coro methodology of inquiry and reflection through interviews with
  leaders in the community and group debriefs, giving participants invaluable
  insight on what it takes to be a leader in the region;


  *Expand leadership capacity through exposure to Coro’s leadership tools and
  frameworks;


  *Build and bridge social capital through group learning processes and team
  management towards common purposes;


  *Demonstrate project management skills through the development of a community
  change project;


  *Build and expand social capital by deepening their networks across the
  region.



  Success for the program will be measured in a variety of ways. The first is
  through pre-program participant surveys assessing: 1) prior access to
  leadership development; 2) prior access to hard skill development; and 3)
  proficiency in various skills, including presentations, project management,
  written communication, team management, and understanding of leadership
  frameworks. Post-program surveys will collect self-reported proficiencies in
  these skills as a result of participation in NLP. Coro will also measure the
  impact of participants’ community change projects by assessing how many people
  have been or will be affected by the project, and will evaluate qualitative
  data from participants and partner organizations on the impact both felt and
  observed as a result of NLP participation.
project_five_years: >-
  In 5 years, Coro will have trained approximately 125 community leaders in
  South LA who are continuing to implement their Community Change Projects in
  their neighborhoods and communities. Armed with Coro’s proven tools and wide
  network, NLP participants will have the ability to effectively activate and
  engage the residents of South LA, creating concrete, lasting impacts that will
  continue to strengthen and revitalize the region. Additionally, NLP will be
  positioned to launch in other communities in Los Angeles, allowing Coro to
  expand its impact and reach in Southern California.
