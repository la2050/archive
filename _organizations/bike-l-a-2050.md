  We have been involved in a number of projects focusing on urban mobility and
  the interface with cities and the built environment. Marc Alt was founding
  Executive Director of the Green Parking Council, a non-profit organization
  which is seeking to transform parking into a platform for innovation to
  support bike sharing, car sharing, electric car charging infrastructure, green
  building standards and re-inventing parking as a force for good in cities.
  Marc has also worked with some of the leading companies in the automotive,
  architecture and engineering fields on urban mobility projects, including the
  launch of electric vehicles and charging infrastructure.
