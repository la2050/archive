  Stephen Glassman Studio first raised widespread critical acclaim in the early
  1990â€™s creating free-form bamboo installations for devastated urban sites in
  the aftermath of the Rodney King Riots, Malibu Fires, and Northridge Quake.
  Since then, Stephen Glassman Studio has gone on to do significant large-scale
  projects including a 4,000 square foot sculpture plaza at the LNR Warner
  Center, the Fairmont Skate Park in Salt Lake City, Utah, Arkansasâ€™ Southeast
  Shear (an NEA & White House Millennium Project), the Sylvia Campuan Bridge in
  Bali, and more. Stephen Glassman Studio has collaborated with architects such
  as Sasaki, Steinberg, Miller / Hull, and Arup Engineering as a creative
  consultant to urban master planning, as well as in the creation of
  commissioned art works for large-scale projects. Glassman is the recipient of
  numerous grants and awards including the NEA, Nathan Cummings Foundation, LA
  Cultural Endowment, and was a 2000 Chrysler Design Award nominee. Stephen
  Glassman Studioâ€™s work has been collected and exhibited throughout Southern
  California, New York City, and internationally. The design and concept for
  Urban Air first received notice when it won the 2011 London International
  Creativity Award. As a successful Kickstarter project Urban Air went on to
  generate international dialogue about the nature of advertising and the role
  of art in communities, garnering support from over 1500 people
  internationally, with the film about it receiving over 150,000 downloads in
  125 countries. Urban Air has been written about in countries around the Globe
  including Japan, Greece, Egypt, India, China, Russia, Italy, Peru, Brazil,
  France, England, Taiwan, Italy, Poland, and by publications and/or programs
  including The Huffington Post, Wired (Italy), LA Times, National Geographic,
  Forbes, Dwell, Landscape Architecture, DAD (Peru), Good Magazine, NPR, KCET,
  The Discovery Channel and more. Urban Air is currently slated as a main stage
  presenting project for The NYC Green Festival this upcoming April. Since its
  publication internationally Stephen Glassman Studio has received interest and
  inquiries from all over the world about the possibility of Urban Air projects
  in other cities... and the work of the studio, including Urban Air, has been
  the subject of collegiate studies at Vassar College, Syracuse University,
  Hampshire College, and other institutions.
