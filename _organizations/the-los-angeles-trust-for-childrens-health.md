  One of the most significant achievements to date for The LA Trust has been the
  engagement of a broad cross-section of stakeholders to develop a strategic
  plan, which outlines the vision for the Wellness Networks. This considerable
  undertaking has built the foundation and buy-in across the many collaborators
  and partners.
