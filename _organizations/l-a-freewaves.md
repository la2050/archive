      <p>Since its inception 24 years ago as an umbrella organization uniting
      the many diverse media voices of greater Los Angeles, Freewaves has
      pioneered artistsâ€™ use of every new development in the field. </p>
       
       
       
       
       
       <p>Beginning with its successful efforts to bridge the 1990s divide between mostly small, culturally specific media arts centers, Freewaves has established itself as one of the most adventurous advocates for raising media arts to a truly democratic vector for ideas and images.</p>
       
       
       
       
       
       <p>Freewavesâ€™ activities have consistently been in the vanguard of the field, models for others to emulate. Specific areas in which it led the way include:</p>
       
       
       <p>â€¢ Placing experimental media arts in public spaces, reaching hundreds of thousand of people who may never have seen art in this genre;</p>
       
       
       <p>â€¢ Showing 3000 artistsâ€™ works</p>
       
       
       <p>â€¢ Producing 11 festivals celebrating the newest artistic developments;</p>
       
       
       <p>â€¢ Positing live internet links as an art form;</p>
       
       
       <p>â€¢ Positioning interactive media (CD-Roms) as predecessor to web interactivity;</p>
       
       
       <p>â€¢ Placing experimental media arts on cable, PBS and public access television, plus in all L.A. libraries and high schools;</p>
       
       
       <p>â€¢ Presenting large format, video display of experimental media arts on video billboards previously dedicated almost exclusively to paid advertising;</p>
       
       
       <p>â€¢ Engaging international, web-implemented curation of its festivals, using the latest web technology to stream hundred of hours of video worldwide;</p>
       
       
       <p>â€¢ Offering workshops bringing new media technologies to underserved communities and to working artists seeking new avenues of expression.</p>
       
       
       <p>â€¢ Exhibiting videos at Hammer, MOCA, LACMA, Getty, and 100 other venues</p>
       
       
       
       
       
       <p>Out the Windowâ€™s excellence has been acknowledged with numerous extremely competitive grants from MacArthur, Rockefeller, Warhol, Durfee and Irvine Foundations, National Endowment for the Arts, California Arts Council, Los Angeles County Arts Commission and The City of Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs and others, leading to two critical awards: one of L.A. Weeklyâ€™s Top Ten Art Projects of the Year, and Public Art Reviewâ€™s Top 50 National Projects of the Year.</p>
