  Our ultimate goal is to improve LA kids’ lives by minimizing incidences of
  trauma and reducing the impact when it occurs.  Our success will be measured
  by the reduction in the number of children who have Adverse Childhood
  Experiences and the increase in the number of children who have access to the
  supports and services they need to prevent or heal from trauma, including
  health coverage and access to mental health services. We will track
  county-level data over time to see whether our efforts are successful. We
  already regularly track this kind of data through our California Scorecard of
  Children’s Wellbeing (http://scorecard.childrennow.org/2014/), and will
  highlight LA County trauma related indicators.


  In the short-term, we will measure success by the size and diversity of the
  coordinated trauma advocacy network. We will track the number of groups and
  individuals that join the network and participate in public support campaigns,
  including sign on statements and communications to policy makers. To measure
  the impact of the public support campaign, we will track the number of
  targeted communications that are produced by the advocacy network and for
  local policymakers, qualitative data on local policy decisions that are made
  based on our efforts, and traditional and social media produced as well as the
  reach of those communications.

  Too many LA children experience frequent traumatic events that can be toxic
  and lead to a lifetime of physical and emotional challenges. Children Now will
  bring together thousands of voices in LA County to promote a comprehensive
  policy agenda to reduce childhood trauma and ensure the needed supports for
  kids who experience it. The power of these voices will be demonstrated through
  a public support campaign and advocacy around specific policy changes.

  Traumatic events in a child's life such as abuse, neglect and neighborhood
  violence can be toxic and lead to a lifetime of health consequences such as
  heart disease, diabetes, and depression, as well as social consequences such
  as academic failure, homelessness, victimization, and crime. Too many kids
  that experience trauma lack the supports and services they need to heal and
  thrive, are placed into the foster care system or end up arrested or homeless.


  In LA County, there are currently 28,000 youth in foster care. In 2013, more
  than 500 LA County children under age 4 were hospitalized for intentional
  injuries. In 2014, nearly 7,000 kids under 18 were arrested. And based on
  state estimates, over 418,400 kids in LA County have had at least two Adverse
  Childhood Experiences (ACEs) in their lives.


  The LA community already has the power to address this problem – it just needs
  to be harnessed and coordinated. Hundreds of LA agencies, organizations,
  congregations, coalitions, businesses and community leaders serve or support
  children and want them to grow up trauma-free. There are many promising
  practices that can prevent trauma, build resilience in kids and heal those
  that have had ACEs. The problem is that these groups are often disconnected
  from each other or lack the support to scale what is working.


  Children Now will connect all of these groups under our 'Pro-Kid' frame to
  build a strong base of support to achieve scalable change. Our team has
  decades of relevant experience to develop and advance policy solutions to
  prevent and address the impact of trauma across early childhood, health care,
  child welfare, and education systems. We lead The Children's Movement, a
  network which includes 385 diverse organizations in LA County dedicated to
  making kids California's #1 priority.


  To move toward a trauma-free LA for kids by 2050, we will engage Movement
  members, and hundreds of other groups across early childhood, health,
  education, and child welfare fields to speak with one united voice for needed
  policy solutions. We'll learn from local efforts and leverage our policy
  knowledge to develop a comprehensive cross-sector agenda that outlines
  concrete steps to reduce the number of kids, 0-18, who experience the
  consequences of trauma. These policy changes will include expanding voluntary
  early childhood home visiting programs, increasing access to mental health
  services, creating targeted education supports for foster youth, reducing
  juvenile criminalization, reforming school discipline practices, etc .


  We will create a public support campaign to raise awareness about the profound
  impacts of childhood trauma in LA. We will recruit hundreds of supporters who
  will be publicly listed to demonstrate the strength of support behind this
  agenda. It will be used to urge the LA County Board of Supervisors, school
  districts, and other LA policymakers to take action on the agenda and make
  real change to make LA the Best Place to Live for kids.
