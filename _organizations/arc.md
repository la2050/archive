  ARC provides comprehensive, afterschool programming for over 23,000 student
  participants annually: 6 Elementary Schools, 6 Middle Schools, 21 High Schools
  and more than 80 other schools with LEAD Programming. ARC also collaborates
  with over 275 youth based, community, organizations—from unified school
  districts, charter schools, park and recreation departments to religious youth
  groups, independent schools, YMCA’s, Boys and Girls Clubs, sports clubs, and
  other youth development organizations. 
   
   
    
   
   
   In twelve years, we have grown from two staff members to over 170 whose individual diversity models the diversity of our LA-based student population. Our award-winning afterschool and Leadership, Experience, Adventure & Development (LEAD) programs have made a difference in the lives of thousands of students in low-income communities in Southern California, created authentic partnerships with schools and closed the opportunity gap for all our kids.
