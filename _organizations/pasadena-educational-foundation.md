  The APP Academy is a four-year computer science education program where high
  school students learn mobile, web and game development through real-world,
  inquiry-based, hands-on projects.

  Success is measured by the number of students engaged and the quality of their
  experience. For example, following the graduation of the first class of 17
  seniors in 2016, there are currently 297 students enrolled in the APP Academy
  in grades 9 through 12. We also strive for cultural, economic, and gender
  diversity among the students.


  As the project graduates more students in the future, we will also quantify
  achievement using college matriculation and completion rates, and success of
  APP Academy alumni in their chosen fields.


  We define success by what the students are able to achieve. Students are
  assessed formally (i.e,. through project reviews, grades, and scores on AP
  Computer Science exams) and informally (i.e., through observation and
  one-on-one meetings) throughout the year by the teachers. Students and parents
  also complete surveys and feedback forms that have been used to assess and
  improve the instructional methods, curriculum, course sequence and
  assignments. 


  The quality of teaching and learning in the APP Academy classrooms is also
  reviewed by PUSD and Pasadena Educational Foundation leadership and by
  observations by visiting industry leaders.

  The APP Academy is a collaboration of the Pasadena Educational Foundation and
  the Pasadena Unified School District, designed to teach computer science to
  high school students from diverse backgrounds and prepare them for success in
  college and career. The 4-year program delivers a project-based learning
  experience where students learn programming by creating their own websites,
  games and mobile apps. Started in 2012, it graduated its first class of
  students in 2016, who are now all in college.

  Technology is creating new opportunities for youth to reach their full
  potential and to lead fulfilling and successful lives. By the year 2020 it has
  been estimated that 1.4 million computing jobs will be created in the US, but
  there will only be 400,000 people qualified to take them. LA will be the best
  place to learn when all students have the opportunity to learn, succeed, and
  compete in this growing field.


  The goal of the APP Academy is to teach computer science to high school
  students from diverse backgrounds and prepare them for success in college and
  career. The 4-year program delivers a project-based learning experience where
  students learn programming by creating their own websites, games and mobile
  apps using industry-leading tools. The project is taught by two credentialed
  teachers who have been selected for their knowledge of the field, their
  ability to connect with young people and their enthusiasm. Each has a BS in
  Computer Science and two advanced degrees. 


  Pasadena Unified School District serves an economically and culturally diverse
  student population. 66% are low-income; 59% are Latino; 18% White; 13%
  African-American; 7% Asian; and 3% other.


  The APP Academy has its home on the campus of Pasadena High School where, in
  addition to their computer science classes and project, Academy students
  experience a complete high school education, from English to arts and music.
  The curriculum includes field trips to places like JPL, Art Center College of
  Design and Microsoft's LA offices, and guest speakers from Caltech and
  Idealab.


  APP Academy classrooms are designed to emulate a high-tech start-up
  experience. They have laptops for every student, comfortable seating, spacious
  desks, large monitors along the walls, and space for group work in the center.
  The rooms are painted an attractive blue and the walls are lined with
  cartoons, video game art, and in one room, a rotating display of top-quality
  work created by the students.


  The course sequence begins in grades 9 and 10 with students learning HTML,
  CSS, JavaScript and C# to develop web applications. In grade 11, they create
  their own mobile app, which combines computer science concepts -- algorithm
  design, object-oriented programming, and database design and integration --
  with programming techniques. In grade 12, students apply advanced programming
  concepts to advanced web development, 3D game development and the 'Internet of
  Things.' The program culminates with seniors designing and developing their
  own Capstone Projects, either in groups or independently. The 2016 Capstone
  Projects included: an R2D2-inspired robot, designed to inspire younger
  students to become interested in computer science; 'To Protect and Serve,” a
  story-based game that serves to shed light on the experience of
  African-American youth; and Star Gazers, a wearable product that allows users
  to locate constellations in the night sky (see the uploaded image for details
  about the student and her project.)
