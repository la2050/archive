  As a non-profit organization we cater to the female youth through our
  programming. Through our philanthropy "TIJERAS," cutting through to enhance
  education opportunities, we fundraise hundreds of dollars every year to donate
  to another non-profit organization which carries out this purpose on a grander
  scale. We also serve our community through our Annual Latina Youth Leadership
  Conferences that are targeted to middle and high school students. We offer
  these students workshops about A-G Requirements, resume building, networking,
  mental health, and student panels among many others. Overall our organization
  encourages students to pursue a higher education and we offer them the tools
  and support to do so.
