  Los Angeles prides itself on being the entertainment capital of the world.
  Everyday people travel from all over the world to see the city where dreams
  come true and stars are born. This reputation has attracted thousands of
  aspiring artists to join our community and turn Los Angeles into a City of
  Creatives. Our community is flooded with artists, innovators, pioneers, and
  dreamers. Angelenos have remarkable gifts that have been celebrated and
  praised globally.


  However, while the world is applauding, our home is silent.  Los Angeles does
  not celebrate art the way the rest of the world does.  This city is deprived
  and far behind any other metropolis. Our creative community is starving for
  acknowledgement, appreciation and inspiration. Art is the greatest form of
  entertainment and if we truly are the capital, then our city should be
  flourishing with art. 


  When people interact with art and become part of a piece, it creates an
  emotional connection between the artist and observer.  The art piece becomes a
  heartfelt letter from the artist that the observer reads through each personal
  interaction.  As people notice others reading the letter and feeling the same
  connection, a community begins to form. It’s amazing how in seconds strangers
  become friends over a letter written by someone neither of them personally
  knows.  If art is that powerful just imagine if our entire city was immersed
  with these beautiful, colorful and inspiring letters.


  Playascape is a public arts program that will transform urban communities into
  artistic playgrounds through interactive and immersive art. We produce
  cultural experiences that infuse community engagement, technology and media to
  interact with the whole family. 


  The art we curate shares a symbiotic relationship with math and science,
  creatively pushing boundaries and inspiring innovation.  This can be seen and
  understood by the large scale interactive pieces that most people experience
  at art and music festivals. Exposure to the festival experience is limited to
  a small percentage of the community. Further, the lack of public spaces in
  urban communities makes it difficult to install permanent art pieces. To fill
  this void, Playascape focuses on bringing these inspiring ephemeral pieces to
  these communities for all to enjoy.


  Playascape's cultural experiences engage its community through outreach
  programs such as field trips and artist engagements. The art they curate
  contains technology and they utilize media to expose, educate and inspire. For
  example, PlayascapeTV is an educational Youtube channel that showcases artists
  and their creative inventions.   


  Playascape is a art establishment that will make LA the greatest place to
  create as it will provide opportunities for artists to shine in their city,
  increase visibility to female and minority artists, and advance LA's artistic
  achievements that will transcend this city as the creative capital of the
  world.
