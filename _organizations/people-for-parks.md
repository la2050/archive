  We are collaborating with Kid Healthy, a community based organization, on
  parent empowerment at our Community School Parks. The Los Angeles County
  Department of Public Health will assist us with data collection and review so
  that we may evaluate our progress.

  Aided by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, PFP will evaluate
  the following outcomes. Results will contribute to program improvement and
  demonstrate success on LA2050 dream metrics.


  Goal1--Expand community use of CSPs: 


  We will use geographic mapping to examine each CSP to understand how many and
  what types of people we are creating access for (eg, age groups, income,
  access to resources). We will use a systematic observation tool to measure how
  many and what types of people use the parks. We aim to serve 300-500 parkgoers
  per month and 4500+ for special events.


  Goal 2--Empower individuals to access parks and take community leadership
  roles: We will systematically collect data from parents, children, and
  community members in outreach activities (e.g., trainings) to understand
  barriers and facilitators to parks access, tools/resources we can provide, and
  needed changes in community capacity. Outreach and park attendance data will
  be linked to understand what activities increase park use.


  Goal 3--Improve individual and community wellbeing:  

  We will examine annual scores from LAUSD’s Physical Fitness 5th grade testing
  to describe youth activity levels and obesity rates. We will also conduct
  interviews with school staff to understand the impacts of CSP use on student
  health, parent involvement, and neighborhood quality (e.g., park quality,
  crime and safety).

  In 2016, People for Parks (PFP) opened 9 new Community School Parks (CSPs) for
  use during non-school hours, providing a park within walking distance of
  45,000 Angelenos. In 2017, PFP will operate 11 CSPs and through a strategic
  partnership with Kid Healthy, train parents and residents in neighborhood
  engagement, recruiting, playground management and physical activities.
  Community mobilization by PFP and Kid Healthy will keep these play spaces open
  and sustainable.
project_proposal_impact:
  - Access to open space and park facilities
  - Number (and quality) of informal spaces for play
  - Number of children enrolled in afterschool programs
  - Number of parks with intergenerational play opportunities
  - Number of residents with easy access to a “vibrant” park
  - Per capita crime rates
  - Perceived safety

  People for Parks (PFP) will make LA the best place to PLAY in 2017 in two
  ways. First, we will continue operating our 11 Community School Parks (CSPs).
  Second, in collaboration with community based organization Kid Healthy, we
  will empower community members to become leaders in recreation, play and park
  vibrancy so that CSPs are fully utilized and become self-sustaining. 


  CSPs are supervised school playgrounds that PFP opens to the public on
  weekends and during the summer. Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD)
  youth enrichment staff engage park-goers in play, sports and art & crafts.
  PFP’s community organizer carries out community empowerment.  LAUSD is the
  second largest landowner in LA. CSPs “joint use” of otherwise locked
  playgrounds is a creative way to provide park space in dense neighborhoods.


  PFP will partner with Kid Healthy to customize and carry out its quarterly 
  “Padres En Accion” (PEA) education series with parents from all of our CSPs.
  Together we will train parents on playground leadership, physical activity,
  joint use and the recruitment of other parents and neighbors in recreation
  activities. This builds upon outstanding examples of inter-generational play,
  found at our Vine St CSP, where one grandma is a sought after goalie and
  Berendo, where neighbors formed a handball league enjoyed by players of all
  ages.

  PEA sessions will be interactive with hands-on role-play and action planning
  to keep CSPs safe, fun and enriching. We will hold each training at one CSP
  site. Three parents from each CSP will participate in the training and then
  share what they learned at each of their sites. PFP’s Community Organizer will
  support this ongoing knowledge sharing. 


  Background: In 2016, with an LA2050 grant and leveraged matching funds, we
  opened 9 new Community School Parks, making a total of 11! Located in
  Pico-Union, Westlake, Central Alameda, South Park, Hollywood, and Koreatown,
  these CSPs provide safe park access for more than 55,000 Angelenos and support
  community building and healthy lifestyles through play. 


  We also grew our team with a Community Organizer who leads our CSP Incubator,
  helping parents and neighbors take ownership of these community spaces through
  parent-led activities such as Zumba classes, park beautification days,
  gardening clubs and sports teams. This has helped lower crime and strengthen
  perceived safety.  Berendo’s principal, Rosa Trujillo, writes, “Adults at the
  Saturday program clean and supervise their respective areas, decreasing
  vandalism activities as they take more ownership of the shared space.” 


  And a parent shared, “Each staff member we have met has been wonderful. I know
  they are always keeping an eye on my son to make sure he is safe and having a
  good time.” 


  This grant will help keep our CSPs thriving, and allow us to take our
  community empowerment to the next level through a strategic partnership with
  Kid Healthy, helping make LA the best place to PLAY for generations to come.
