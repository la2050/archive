org_type: Nonprofit
org_summary: >-
  In 2005, we founded the Environmental Change-Makers (ECM), a network of
  "proactivists" who focus on What We Can Do about our environmental and social
  issues.
   
   
   In 2008 ECM built the Community Garden at Holy Nativity. ECM members continue to manage this garden's production and have achieved 5 years of weekly harvests for the benefit of Food Pantry LAX.
   
   
   Since 2008, ECM has offered monthly Organic Vegetable Gardening classes to the general public.
   
   
   In 2008, ECM hosted the first Transition Training in Southern California, bringing trainers in from the UK to do so. Subsequently, we launched 8 action groups in neighborhoods around the greater LA area.
   
   
   In 2009-2011, ECM worked with LAUSD and the Mayorâ€™s office to found and build the Emerson Avenue Community Garden.
