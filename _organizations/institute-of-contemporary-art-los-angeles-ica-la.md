  ICA LA’s goals include: 1) expose students to creative professions; 2) develop
  a dialogue to understand the social and economic forces that impact their
  neighborhood; 3) provide opportunities for students to gain their first work
  experience in the creative sector; and 4) forge meaningful, long-term
  partnerships between local community groups and creative businesses. 


  ICA LA will measure success of the pilot program based on the following:

  - Number of students who complete all three phases of the program (spring,
  summer, fall)

  - Percentage of students who are invited for additional opportunities with
  their summer employer

  - Number of students who return in 2018 to mentor the next cycle of
  participants

  - Employer satisfaction with the program

  - Feedback from students in the form of pre- and post-project evaluations
  (written and verbal)

  - Number of visitors to the pop-up arts space and series of cultural events

  - Breadth of participating business and organizations in the workshop series
  and internship placement program, which thus far includes Self-Help Graphics,
  Hauser Wirth & Schimmel, Linear City Development, Leadership Urban Renewal
  Network (LURN), Civic Center Studios, Fabian Debora (founder/artistic director
  of La Classe Art Academy), glassworks artist Jaime Guerrero, and the City of
  Los Angeles Departments of Housing and Planning, among others.

  ICA LA, in collaboration with arts advocate Pete Galindo and Legacy LA, will
  create Agency of Assets—an initiative designed to catalyze local high school
  youth into leadership roles in the arts and creative economy through
  engagement, experience, and employment. In its pilot stage, a cohort of twenty
  students will participate in a spring break immersion program, followed by
  mentorship meetings, summer job positions, and the creation of a pop-up art
  space in fall 2017.

  ICA LA’s Agency of Assets will help make Los Angeles the best place to create
  by providing opportunities for local youth to pursue leadership roles within
  the booming creative sector.


  ICA LA is a new contemporary art museum in Downtown Los Angeles, launched by
  core members of the former Santa Monica Museum of Art (SMMoA). The
  organization’s new identity and 12,700-square-foot home in the Arts District,
  slated to open in Fall 2017, will serve as a hub for community members of all
  backgrounds and income levels. 


  LA is emerging as a global capital of cultural production. While broadening
  the reach of art is important for our region’s economic well-being and
  cultural vitality, the relationship between art and gentrification has never
  been more controversial. The depletion of manufacturing and the rise of
  creative industry has had an adverse effect on many of the surrounding
  low-income neighborhoods. As cultural institutions and businesses continue to
  propagate, the concerns of local residents become increasingly urgent. 


  As it prepares to open its doors, ICA LA is immersing itself in the local
  community and confronting issues of gentrification head on. Our LA2050 project
  intends to break down any barrier between arts organizations and adjacent
  communities—the “Us vs. Them” mentality—and to activate the museum as a forum
  for social change. 


  Agency of Assets is a three-part program: (1) spring break workshop intensive,
  (2) summer job placement, and (3) pop-up community art space. 


  The spring break intensive will expose students to diverse creative pathways
  through hands-on workshops, one-on-one mentorship, and daily excursions. Helen
  Campbell, analyst at the City of LA Housing and Community Investment
  Department, will collaborate with students to create a map of Los Angeles,
  analyzing shifting economic trends and identifying assets within the
  neighborhood. Participants will gain an understanding of the economic forces
  driving change in their neighborhoods, as well as the tools necessary to forge
  their own careers in the cultural sector. Each day of the one-week intensive,
  students will visit cultural institutions and participate in
  multi-disciplinary workshops.


  For our second phase, ICA LA will partner with businesses, government
  entities, and nonprofits in the Arts District and Boyle Heights to develop
  one-month, full-time summer job positions. These paid learning experiences
  will span a number of creative fields in order to best meet students’
  interests. These include architecture, graphic design, printmaking, urban
  planning, glass blowing, film production, and fashion design, among others. 


  Agency of Assets culminates with a pop-up arts space and event series,
  designed with the students based on what they have learned. By instilling
  local youth with agency, ICA LA will cultivate a new, diverse generation of
  arts professionals to participate in the City’s changing socioeconomic and
  cultural landscape.
