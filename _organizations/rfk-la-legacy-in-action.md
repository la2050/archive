  During it's first year and a half, RFK-LA conducted three major projects:
   
   
   
   
   
   * The Participatory Learning and You Program (PLAY!) was a joint program between RFK-LA and the USC Annenberg School’s Innovation Lab. Under the supervision of RFK-LA’s lead academic partner, Henry Jenkins, Provost’s Professor of Communication, Journalism, Cinematic Arts and Education, LAUSD teachers and students, as well as invited non-profit organizations, provided a year long training and research program on the application of 21st century new media literacies in the classroom. 
   
   
   * Partnering with USC Annenberg, RFK-LA provided after school programs with community outreach nonprofits, including among others: KCET’s Departures Program; Laughter for a Change; and Animaction.
   
   
   * Conducted an international educational game program: a semester-long, synchronous game played between the 5th grade math class at RFK Community Schools’ Ambassador School of Global Leadership and a 5th grade math class in Seoul Korea. The program was led by Professor Jong H., Wi, internationally recognized “serious game” designer and visiting Professor at CRESST UCLA school of education.
