  Success is defined by growth in the areas of building reflective
  practitioners, making progress on school-wide instructional practices, and
  building mindful school cultures. Using action research, we will investigate
  the effectiveness of our model of support and process for improvement. The
  documentation and data for the pilots effectiveness, regarding the learning
  community’s positive shift in its practice and/or development of its
  professional capacity, will consist of: quantitative data; net promoter score
  surveys, teacher and coach monitoring using the Pedagogics rubric for the
  Stages of Integration, Path 2 Expertise metrics; and qualitative data;
  recorded interviews, educator reflection, and coach generated anecdotal notes
  and informal assessment. We will evaluate the qualitative data using the data
  source triangulation method then use it to validate the quantitative data to
  generate results. A successful pilot will result in positive change in both
  quantitative and qualitative data. We anticipate seeing an increase in
  implementation of instructional skills and strategies (rubric, anecdotal
  notes), a positive change in the overall mindset of educators (surveys), a
  shift to a more mindful school culture (interviews, reflection), educators
  engaged in seeking more information and interacting with the Pedagogics
  community (Path 2 Expertise metrics), and the achievement of personal goals.
  Overall effectiveness of our pilot will result in a positive net promoter
  score.

  A 10 month Pilot of coaching services in 3 LA schools to connect educators
  with effective instruction, mindful learning, and a more dynamic school
  culture based on existing vision. Schools start where they are in
  implementation of best practice and mindful learning and collaborate with
  Pedagogics to refine strategies and explore tools that address challenges and
  issues unique to each site. Ongoing learning and development is facilitated by
  a PLN to shift education towards a more mindful LA.

  “Are we preparing kids minds for a life of tests or the test of life?” Arthur
  L. Costa 


  Pedagogics Coaching Group can help make LA the best place to learn through
  dynamic one to one support, and hands-on classroom work in LA Schools. We want
  to work with schools; within their vision and with what resources they have
  available. Our focus is to improve the effectiveness of instruction and grow
  the school culture with ongoing individualized coaching and mindful learning
  for the “Whole Educator.” For the pilot, 3 schools will have a choice between
  three best practice topics: Powerful Formative Assessment, Instruction in a
  Mixed Ability Classroom, and Habits of Mind for Developing a Mindful School
  Culture.


  There are 3 ways in which we will implement our pilot:
   
  1) By supporting shifts in professional practice to reset the existing mindset
  in the elementary school setting by guiding and supporting administrators,
  teachers, and instructional support staff in several ways including:
  non-evaluative observation and planning with the staff; engagement in
  professional learning to ensure a common understanding of the agreed upon
  process and to deepen the understanding of the topic; in-class support to
  model, co-teach, and mentor the shift in practice; a debrief at the end of
  each day to engage teachers in metacognitive practice leading to growth and
  change. This is a 2 week cycle lasting for a total of 6 weeks.


  2) We create ample opportunity for continued access, understanding, and growth
  by providing our schools with a gamified platform that encourages self-driven
  eLearning and professional Learning Networking opportunities with our partner
  Vignettes Learning. Access to the Path to Expertise site provides educators
  with webinars; access to peer reviewed research, articles, white papers; and
  blogs within the greater educational community. It also provides an
  interactive professional learning community/network of educators where points
  can be gained for each learning step, sources can be tagged favorite/like, and
  any information, learning, and insights can be shared. In addition, educators
  will be engaged in a system that includes to both monitoring and updating of
  goals, and goal achievement as related to a rubric of implementation.


  3) We want to garner an opportunity for extending learning through online
  university credit coursework focused on Mindful Learning, Formative
  Assessment, and Meeting the Needs of a Mixed Ability Classroom. This
  coursework will provide teachers with an opportunity to earn credit/ salary
  points for the work they are doing within the pilot and on the Path to
  Expertise platform.


  The pilot will be supported by action research to determine its effectiveness,
  personal and professional impact on educators, and the impact on school
  culture.


  In 2050, LA is known as the tipping point of dynamic mindful learning and
  instruction across the global education community!
