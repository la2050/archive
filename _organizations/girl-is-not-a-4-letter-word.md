org_type: Nonprofit
org_summary: >-
  Girl is NOT a 4 Letter Word fights to gain momentum for girls in
  skateboarding, where female skaters are still an "afterthought" and are rarely
  seen in skateboard magazines, videos, and contests. We work to create female
  inclusive contests in LA, we also strive to create and achieve visual exposure
  so other girls know that "they can do it too"!
