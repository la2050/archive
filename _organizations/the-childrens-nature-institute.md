  CNI’s mission is to educate children, families, and their communities through
  interactive experiences with nature and to cultivate respect and
  responsibility for the natural environment. We are the only organization in
  Los Angeles that focuses exclusively on environmental education for young
  children during their most impressionable years: birth through age 8. CNI
  works with more than 100 schools, early-education centers and social service
  agencies to serve 15,000 children each year. We focus on reaching children in
  underserved communities to share with them the wonder of nature as a tool for
  academic achievement, personal growth, and community building.
   
   
   CNI was founded in 1985 by three mothers who were anxious to find ways to teach young children about nature outside of the classroom. We have been at the forefront of the movement to connect children with nature ever since. The organization was run by a core group of volunteers that led young families on walks at area parks and beaches. After the Los Angeles riots in 1992, motivated by the call for equity, justice and inclusion, CNI launched the outreach Nature Discovery Program to give children from low-income neighborhoods and academically low-ranking schools of Los Angeles the opportunity to learn science, math and reading skills through experiences with the natural world. In 2000, CNI added a traveling classroom called the WonderMobile to the program (a visit that includes live animals and various natural artifacts).
   
   
    In 2010, CNI became the "environmental arm" of the Magnolia Place Family Center. As part of the groundbreaking Magnolia Community Initiative, CNI actively collaborates within a network of more than 70 service providers to improve the quality of life, including educational outcomes, for the 100,000 people living within a 500-block radius of the Center. CNI offers a wide range of hands-on activities for families living in West Adams, Pico-Union, and the North Figueroa Corridor. These communities represent some of Los Angeles County's most challenged neighborhoods with historically low educational access and a high rate of families living at or below the federal poverty level. We have served more than 350,000 children, their parents, and teachers in the greater Los Angeles area since we started, and show no signs of slowing down. 
   
   
   Joining MCI gave CNI the latitude and capability to embark on the leadership role for ExN:LA, a collaboration modeled on MCI and focused on bringing continuous, high-quality environmental education to schools throughout Los Angeles. Now in its second year, ExN:LA has grown to include the entire 2nd and 3rd grades at 2 schools, 6 partner organizations and the MCI network of collaborators and community. ExN:LA is part of national Education by Nature umbrella with iterations throughout California, Hawaii and Massachusetts, each of which is designed to meet the specific needs of its community, and to share best practices and ideas with each other
