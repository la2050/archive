  We are still a young organization. We worked hard last year to get over 100
  founding industry and cultural veterans to come on board as our founding
  members. 
   
   
   
   
   
   We have also made many key collaborative partners such as E-stewards for our Ewaste program and The Center for Conscious Creativity in downtown LA.
   
   
   
   
   
   We know we have changed the lives of individuals through personal testimonials and we truly believe we are doing good work. We have inspired both people and organizations to consider the environment and our other responsibilities back to society. A few of our industry partners, RaveReady.com & RollRandom now adds "green tips" into their newsletters, and the retail stores for Emazing Lights are working with us in the development of our Ewaste program.
   
   
   
   
   
   Last September we were co-sponsor of "State of the Arts" at the Center for Conscious Creativity:
   
   
   
   
   
   STATE OF THE ARTS - AMPLIFY! turns up the volume on emerging arts and media trends in this one-of-a-kind immersive symposium, exploring the critical impact of human creativity on digital innovation, with a deep focus on 21st century education and the accelerating convergence of traditional entertainment with groundbreaking content and formats. You'll experience the extraordinary power of fulldome immersive cinema during the conference, engulfed by phenomenal planetarium programming, vivid music visuals and stunning live dance productions. This is storytelling at its most innovative and transformative. 
   
   
   
   
   
   This year we are pleased to plant the seed of a new idea incubated by the c3 called f2: FUTUREFEST, in the form of an experiential showcase featuring cutting-edge immersive entertainment, technology exhibits, an arts and performance showcase; music, dance, 360 film, and new forms of educational experiences in LA's first ever fulldome immersive showcase.
