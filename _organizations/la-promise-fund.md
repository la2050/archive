  Our organization will track participation and gather general information about
  students that includes ethnic background, first-generation status, prior work
  experience, and interest in pursuing a postsecondary education. In 2015-2016,
  The Intern Project placed 54 students (70% African American/Hispanic and 30%
  first-generation) in paid internships with prominent local businesses such as
  Bad Robot Productions, SpaceX, and Kaiser Permanente. An additional 200
  students were exposed to careers in high growth fields through various
  internship, mentorship, and volunteer opportunities, 17 of which received
  scholarships ranging in value from $5,500 to $10,000.

  The Intern Project is a countywide effort to expose more than 325 African
  American and Hispanic students from predominantly low-income backgrounds to
  mentorships, volunteer opportunities, and paid internships in high growth
  career fields that include digital media, entertainment, technology, health
  care, and design. By supporting our LA2050 campaign, an additional 50 students
  from one of 11 South Los Angeles Promise Zone high schools will participate in
  paid summer internships.

  According to researchers, work-based learning programs provide many social and
  academic benefits to students such as increasing their interest in college,
  establishing connections between the classroom and real-world, inspiring
  ownership of their career trajectory, and developing critical life skills
  (creative problem solving, conflict resolution, communication, and teamwork).
  The LA Promise Fund will advance each of these core values in partnership with
  the South Los Angeles Transit Empowerment Zone (SLATE-Z), a coalition of
  community organizations, educational institutions, government agencies, and
  elected officials, which seeks to revitalize an economically impacted South
  Los Angeles area through the successful implementation of programs and
  initiatives that adhere to three primary tenants: Economic Development and Job
  Creation, Cradle to Career Pathways, and Improving Transit Infrastructure. In
  the area of Cradle to Career Pathways, our organization will expand The Intern
  Project to 11 participating high schools located within the federally
  designated South Los Angeles Promise Zone. Included among them are 10 Los
  Angeles Unified School District campuses (Manual Arts Senior High School, West
  Adams Preparatory High School, Foshay Learning Center, Dorsey High School,
  Crenshaw High School, Santee Education Complex, Jefferson High School, Fremont
  High School, Maya Angelou Community High School, and Orthopedic Hospital
  Medical Magnet High School) and a YouthBuild operated charter school known as
  the Coalition for Responsible Community Development Academy, which is located
  at Los Angeles Trade Technical College and serves students (ages 16-24) who
  have dropped out of traditional high schools. Your generous support will help
  expose more than 325 students from predominantly low-income backgrounds to
  workforce readiness training (resume building, job application preparation,
  dressing for success, mock interviews, etc.) and other Linked Learning
  opportunities (i.e. field trips, job shadowing, career panels, career fair,
  etc.). More than 100 students will also be placed in paid internships with
  local businesses in high growth industries such as digital media,
  entertainment, technology, health care, and design.
