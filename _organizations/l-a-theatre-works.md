  LATW, the nation’s leading producer of audio theatre, seeks to expand the
  reach of local productions across the globe and enable students to create
  their own theatre-based educational apps.

  LATW is in conversations with two LAUSD schools which will partner on the
  development of the educational platform section of our new website. We cannot,
  however, announce the schools’ name at this time as we have not yet received
  official confirmation and permission.

  The investment in the online platform will yield a more robust and sustainable
  LATW able to expand our cultural outreach to underserved communities (i.e.,
  rural and urban low-income) and deepen our impact on public education. For Los
  Angeles, the impact will be seen in the number of local productions we are
  able to mount; number of recordings we are able to produce; number of artists
  we are able to employ; number of high schools and students we are able to
  engage in developing interactive theatre-based apps; and the dissemination of
  this work locally, nationally and internationally, as measured by distribution
  numbers, i.e., downloads, online streams, purchases; website, social media and
  other online analytics; general marketing analytics; and feedback from
  educators, consumers and program partners.


  The Audio Theatre 2.0 platform will be the infrastructure that enables a
  vital, self-sustaining lifecycle of Los Angeles theatre that spans play
  development > live performance > radio broadcast > online distribution >
  audience engagement > app development > educational outreach… a Los
  Angeles-based ecosystem that will have global reach.

  L.A. Theatre Works has a treasure trove of 500+ plays recorded by
  award-winning actors for the audio format. We want to build an online
  infrastructure that will expand worldwide access to these Los Angeles-based
  works, create new artistic opportunities via the online platform, and increase
  public and student engagement with theatre – including models for LAUSD
  students to create their own interactive educational technology based on our
  new educational platform resources.

project_proposal_best_place: >-
  Over the past 25 years, L.A. Theatre Works (LATW) has produced a unique and
  growing library of 500+ plays recorded by top actors specifically for the
  audio format (radio, downloads, podcasts, streaming, apps, etc.), encompassing
  world classics, modern masterpieces, contemporary and original works. We
  record 8 – 10 new plays each year, recorded live at UCLA’s James Bridges
  Theater and in-studio, employing 100 – 150 theatre professionals annually. We
  disseminate these recordings to a global audience of 7+ million through a
  weekly public radio show in 50+ U.S. markets (KPFK in Los Angeles); download
  and streaming on-demand at our website and retail partners; and free
  distributions of over 27,000 to the public,  schools and libraries nationwide
  - including 30-40 public libraries and over 100 public schools in LA County,
  which serve an estimated 1,000-2,000 library patrons and 6,000 students per
  year.


  An essential part of expanding worldwide public, educator and student access
  to our plays and educational resources is building a 21st century
  infrastructure to support them. We are pursuing a major technological capacity
  building project that will encompass a total rebuild of our website, new
  constituent and asset management systems, and a re-tooling of our educational
  resources.  


  Since 2012, we have developed innovative mobile apps that use theatre as an
  interdisciplinary teaching and learning tool for high school students. Our
  current apps enable users to experience plays as an enhanced form of
  literature by bringing the text to life through synchronized audio. As part of
  our Audio Theatre 2.0 project, we are developing an expanded online
  educational platform featuring advanced apps that will integrate text and
  audio with standards-aligned lessons, exercises and activities designed for
  use in English, history, drama and science classes, a community space for
  educators and students to share ideas, and models for student-driven projects
  based. An example of this is the iBook created by students at Canyon Crest
  Academy, a public high school in San Diego, who used our app to build their
  own interactive learning app (see video link).  The new website platform will
  be a universally accessible and welcoming one-stop storefront featuring our
  educational tools and resources which will be accessible by any device.


  The project will achieve progress toward the LA2050 goals by: a) Enhancing the
  sustainability of LATW as an “arts establishment” as well as the dozens of
  local arts organizations we support through PSAs on our radio show; b)
  Increase employment in creative industries by enabling LATW to pursue new
  artistic ventures such as podcasts, video, social media and interactive
  content; and, c) Expand LA’s cultural influence by building on LATW’s global
  reach, which has included live productions in Europe and China, and radio
  co-productions with the BBC, Voice of America, Radio Beijing, NHK (Japan), CBC
  (Canada), ABC (Australia), Radio New Zealand & others.
