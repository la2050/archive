org_summary: >-
  Our organization is a new one whose purpose is to pursue the singular goal of
  making multi-modal transport easier and more accessible in Los Angeles. 
   
   
   
   
   
   The members of our organization have been active in the Los Angeles bike community, particularly through the bicycle co-ops the Bicycle Kitchen and the Bikerowave. These organizations are non-profit bicycle workshops and education spaces that provide the space, equipment, and support necessary for people to repair and maintain their bicycles. Our volunteer efforts at the BK and Bikerowave are one way for us boost community support for alternative transportation and make it accessible to more people. It is working with these organizations that it occurred to us just how many more people would change their transportation habits if given the knowledge and community support to feel confident venturing out onto the street.
