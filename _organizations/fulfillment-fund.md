org_summary: "The Fulfillment Fund has been able to gauge the need of the Los Angeles community and build a successful model that works for students. The Fulfillment Fund provided mentoring to help students graduate high school and educate them about college access. Through the interactions with students, parents, and educators, we saw the great need for the community to be educated on college acccess for all students especially those in first-generation, low-income or under-resourced areas. We were able to build on our mentoring program and develop proprietary high school curriculum that is delivered in partnership with schools during class-time and one-on-one counseling through our College Access Program Advisors. We also have a CAP (College Access Program) Leadership Crew that meets once a month. \n \n \n \n \n \n Experiential learning opportunities are provided for the students in our program including college overnight tours and the annual Destination College event. Destination College has successfully been held for 16 years and we have been able to provide a unique college experience for thousands of high school students. Fulfillment Fund provides financial aid workshops and also has a robust scholarship program open to students that go through our program. Parent workshops during Destination College are provided in English and Spanish to help them provide support for their children in high school and college. \n \n \n \n \n \n  A testament to our success has been the recent ability to provide the city of Las Vegas the tools to replicate the Fulfillment Fund model as a pilot in their schools. The participating schools have already started seeing a shift in perceptions on attending college from the students.\n \n \n \n \n \n The Fulfillment Fund program students have a 90% high school graduation rate compared to 64.2% in LAUSD overall. In 2012, 90% of our students planned to enroll in college versus 54% of students from low-income communities nationwide. An impressive 81% of Fulfillment Fund students become the first in their family to attend college, helping break the cycle of poverty in their family and community.\n \n \n \n \n \n We strive for the students in Los Angeles to have quality college access programs and have an experience similar to Nicole Harris Blackwell. Nicole shared that her family wanted her to be the first to go to a four-year college â€œbut [they] didnâ€™t know how to help [her] navigate through choosing a school or completing applications and financial aid forms. The Fulfillment Fund was invaluable in helping me to successfully enroll in Spelman College.â€\x9D She is a proud graduate of Spelman College and Claremont Graduate University and is an English professor at Santa Monica College."
