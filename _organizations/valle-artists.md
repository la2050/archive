  Mural Mile has become a necessary project for artists, community members, and
  art enthusiasts. There have been a dozen new murals added to Van Nuys Blvd. in
  Pacoima, all in the past 2 years. This has been a grassroots effort, propelled
  forward by a core group of public artists who collaborate with local
  non-profits, but who can also lead a self-funded project with the community.
  The Pacoima Art Movement has restored pride in the community.
