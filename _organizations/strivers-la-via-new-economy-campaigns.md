    - "<p>STRIVERS.LA is a new organization that will incorporate as a California B Corporation, a new incorporation option designed for businesses with a social mission at their core. Co-founders are Angel Dean Lopez and Catherine Geanuracos. Catherine Geanuracos is the founder of New Economy Campaigns; she leverages technology and media to create global movements that respond to the most urgent social, environmental and political issues of our time. Angel Dean Lopez is a writer with extensive credentials in television and digital content production. In addition to his entertainment work, heâ€™s taught screenwriting at USC, UCLA, and Cal State Fullerton; his experiences teaching low-income students were the inspiration for STRIVERS.LA.</p>\n \n \n  \n \n \n <p>STRIVERS.LA is being incubated by New Economy Campaigns, a digital strategy consultancy that has created national and global programs to leverage technology for social impact. Creating accessible ways to engage with causes that matter is the cornerstone of New Economy Campaignsâ€™ work. Whether the entry point is through a brand marketing initiative, a political campaign, or an open streets event, we offer pathways for consumers, constituents, and creators to have measurable and scalable impact. Weâ€™re rigorous in our assessment and evaluation, and only work on projects we believe can fulfill both marketing and cause-related objectives. The significant movements weâ€™ve been part of building, including MoveOn.org, Live Earth, and CicLAvia, connect masses of people through simple, fun actions and transform our cultural understanding. Recent successes include the creation and funding of â€œSpin the Vote,â€\x9D the first-ever national voter registration initiative for the dance music community, and the creation of the Paul Frank Art Supplies Round-Up, which generated close to $100K in cash and in-kind donations to support childrenâ€™s art programming nationally. </p><p>Our partner, the Los Angeles City College Foundation, has had several recent programmatic achievements in supporting low-income students. One example is the Foundation's support of recent U.S. combat veterans. According to the latest statistics collected by the College, approximately 600 current students have identified themselves as veterans--and 370 of those students receive support from the Veterans Success Institute on the LACC campus. </p>\n \n \n \n \n \n <p>LACC has great success moving students into well-paid careers. Each of the Allied Health Programs (Nursing, Dental Technology, Radiologic Technology) boasts of impressive student test results, job placements and successful alumni. However, the path to success for many of these students is filled with financial hardship, personal sacrificeâ€”and even homelessness. In addition, these programs are more expensive to complete because they require additional tuition, expensive textbooks and supplies. STRIVERS.LA will work with LACCF to target recruitment of students involved in each of these successful LACC programs. </p>"
