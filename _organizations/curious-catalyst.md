  <p>Curious Catalyst is a new consultancy that employs agile and lean
  methodologies typically associated with disruption in ICT to drive
  transformation and innovation in urban planning. Composed of a senior corps of
  emerging platform strategists, Curious Catalyst engages subject matter
  expertise as well as citizen stakeholders to develop breakthrough MVPs. We use
  a license model to incentivize project pioneers to open the core of the
  solutions we develop to other mega-cities. For example, when we design a
  business model for addressing food deserts in Los Angeles, the plug-and-play
  core “Experience Blueprint” will be released to other cities for a nominal
  license fee; this positions the pioneers as leaders in a given area of urban
  challenge but benefits the broader global community while providing upside to
  the initial stakeholder. And we provide consulting services for localization
  and contextual adjustment.</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>This disruptive business model was developed by founder, Kaz Brecher, as part of an accelerator project at THNK, the new Amsterdam School for Creative Leadership. The members of the Curious Catalyst team have collectively worked on strategy and implementation of solutions for everyone from the Library of Congress to Microsoft, and Disney to Oprah. We’ve done hundreds of agile sprints in emerging platforms, and our expertise is easily applied to the complexities of urban challenges facing Los Angeles.</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>The company has garnered support from some of the top architects and urban developers in the world, as we’re building our Advisory Board. And as passionate believers in user-centered design, we are committed to genuine collaboration with all constituencies when developing approaches to these solutions.</p>
