  We are basing our goals on the data in the studies mentioned above, namely: 

  * Access: We would like to retain 20 participants in the project and perform
  to community audiences of at least 200.

  * Self-Discovery and Community/School Engagement: we would like to chart
  improvement in participant’s sense of self and engagement at school, home and
  in their community. 

  * Self-Identity and Identity as Artist: we would like participants to emerge
  with an understanding of what it means to be artists, expanding their
  perceptions of possibly careers in the arts.


  We will measure our progress via pre-, mid-, and post-program surveys, as well
  as video diaries, where we will include questions and prompts that ask
  participants to evaluate their willingness to share, both in school and within
  their community; to challenge their definitions of self; to examine their
  risk-taking and risk-management behaviors; and to understand art as something
  that belongs to them, where they are and who they are.  


  We will also gather information through group work, one-on-one discussions
  with participants, and ongoing informal evaluations.

  Say Word and 4C LAB merge interdisciplinary arts for socio-emotional
  development in youth to create original work. 'Merge' engages our students to
  share, create and navigate through personal narrative to discover identity,
  empathy and equality in L.A. Through collaboration we will explore the
  landscape of Los Angeles and its freeway systems that connect and divide us
  interpreted and culminated through spoken word and dance in a public
  performance to create dialogue in surrounding communities.

  - College completion
  - College matriculation rates
  - Proficiency in English and Language Arts and Math
  - Suspension and expulsion rates
  - Youth unemployment and underemployment

  MERGE, a joint project of Say Word and 4C LAB, will make LA the best place to
  learn, connect and create by providing an opportunity for Los Angeles youth to
  share their cultural and personal experiences through movement and spoken word
  poetry as a means to creating meaningful dialogue. By crossing city borders
  that are too often divided, intersecting art forms and exposing youth to live
  theater, poetry, dance, and the history of LA, MERGE will create original
  work, build equity, and foster healing through arts education. 


  We know art changes lives. We witnessed this just recently, when the Say Word
  poets met the 4C LAB dancers for the first time. 4C LAB’s Marissa Herrera
  asked them to explain to a partner “an instance where art saved your life?”
  The room filled with the voices of young artists opening their hearts and
  sharing their stories with conviction and passion. Later, Say Word’s Kat
  Magill explained, “If you don’t document your story before it becomes history,
  someone else will define your legacy.” The only sound heard were the urgent
  scratches of pencils on paper. 


  MERGE will continue this work, bringing together 25 young adults, ages 14-24,
  over the course of 14 weeks. They will examine the landscape of LA freeways,
  from the 405 to the 57, exploring the communities torn and formed by their
  formation, understanding the local history alongside their own personal
  narratives of identity, and defining their civic and artistic role in the
  greater LA community. Informing their work will be field trips, guest
  speakers, and professional performances. Using a framework of artistic
  development, peer mentorship, and community activism, we will engage
  participants in a collaboration of movement and verse that digs deep to give
  voice to merging narratives, culminating in a public performance of original
  work. 


  Studies have shown: young people who receive arts instruction in high school
  are 55% more likely to attend college and 29% more likely to earn a 4-year
  degree (Arts Education and Positive Youth Development, Elpus, 2013). They
  perform better at school, show significant gains in self-confidence, tolerance
  and persistence and are more likely to obtain employment (The Arts and
  Achievement in At-Risk Youth, Findings from Four Longitudinal Studies,
  National Endowment of the Arts, 2012).


  Our work echoes that data. 100% of teachers working with Say Word see
  improvement in students’ social skills, teamwork, and vocabulary. 90% of
  participating students see a full letter grade improvement, and 90% go on to
  college. Of 4C LAB’s participants, all are in high school, or have graduated.
  Of the graduates, all are attending either a 2 or 4-year university. Nearly
  half have jobs in the creative or mentorship field, and the others are
  interested in careers in the creative economy. 


  MERGE will be a pilot program, but one we hope to develop into a joint program
  that happens every spring, serving 20-30 young people, and audiences of 200+,
  each year.
