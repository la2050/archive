  In the past five years Departures Youth Voices has worked with almost 200
  students in schools and organizations throughout Southern California. These
  include the L.A. Leadership Academy in Lincoln Heights in an exploration of
  the L.A. River; the Environmental Charter High School in Lawndale to uncover
  the social history of Compton's Richland Farms; Venice High School to examine
  the myth and reality of Venice; the Chinatown Service Center’s Youth Council
  to highlight the rich and diverse history of Chinatown, and Franklin High
  School to share the stories of the people, places and historical events that
  have shaped Highland Park.
   
   
   
   
   
   The award-winning Youth Voices program is a vital outreach component of KCET’s Departures, a multimedia documentary series, community engagement tool, and digital literacy project that explores the social and cultural vitality of Los Angeles’ diverse neighborhoods. Departures has received funding from non-profits and public and private agencies, including the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Adobe Youth Voices, Boeing, the L.A. Department of Cultural Affairs, and the California Council for the Humanities.
   
   
   
   
   
   An important aspect of Departures Youth Voices is our website, where we have built an archive of all student generated media from each of our neighborhood documentaries. The Youth Voices Curriculum can be accessed through our website, allowing educators and youth advocates open source access to our lesson plans. 
   
   
   
   
   
   Specific achievements include when students from the L.A. Leadership Academy were selected to perform their songs and poetry at “Corrido of Los Angeles,” an event celebrating the bicentennial of the Mexican Revolution at the L.A. County Museum of Art. In the winning entries the students positioned themselves as agents of change in their neighborhood, working as a team looking to reclaim the streets and make them a better place.
   
   
    
   
   
   Another student producer, Mo Rahman, traveled to Washington, D.C. and took part in a panel discussion at the Silverdocs Festival where he shared his Youth Voices experience. He presented student produced work from the L.A. River installment, and discussed how the skills he learned offered new opportunities for his future. He, along with several other Youth Voices student producers, have continued their study of media, while others have had an opportunity to intern at KCET Departures.
   
   
   
   
   
   An on-going example of our achievements is how our work is advancing and evolving. Currently we are continuing our collaboration with The L.A. Leadership Academy, and developing new partnerships with two newly-established schools: ArtLAB and The L.A. River School at the Sotomayor Learning Academies in Glassell Park. 
   
   
   
   
   
   In addition Departures Youth Voices has partnered with The HeArt Project, a non-profit arts organization that has been utilizing the Youth Voices curriculum to engage students at L.A.-area alternative and continuation schools through the arts.
