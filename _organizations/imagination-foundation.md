    - "<p>On the last day of summer, through a chance encounter, filmmaker Nirvan Mullick met Caine Monroy, a 9-year-old boy who built an elaborate cardboard arcade inside his dadâ€™s East LA auto parts shop. Nirvan was Caineâ€™s first customer. Amazed by the boyâ€™s creativity, Nirvan organized a flash mob of customers to surprise Caine and make his day. Then he made a film about it.</p>\n \n \n \n \n \n <p>The Imagination Foundation is a new organization, but is rapidly becoming the leader of a worldwide movement to foster creativity, imagination and entrepreneurship in children. The film that launched the Imagination Foundation, â€œCaineâ€™s Arcade,â€\x9D has been widely cited as one of the most inspirational stories of 2012. The film has received nearly 8 million views, trended worldwide on Twitter, gathered a Facebook community of 130,000+ fans, and inspired a wave of cardboard creativity in backyards and classrooms across the globe. The Christian Science Monitor calls the film a â€œgreat American story,â€\x9D and Wired Magazine writes, â€œItâ€™s a sweet story that brings viewers back to a time of potent imagination and creativity.â€\x9D</p>\n \n \n \n \n \n <p>Our first Global Cardboard Challenge took place in October 2012, with thousands of participants in 41 countries on six continents.</p>"
