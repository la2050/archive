      Since its inception in 1995, Hollywood HEART hasnâ€™t stopped providing
      amazing programs and support staff. Hollywood HEART was initially created
      as Camp Pacific Heartland (CPH) in 1995, and has since welcomed more than
      1,750 campers. Created by entertainment executive David Gale, the camp was
      founded to address the social and recreational needs of Southern
      California children affected by HIV/AIDS. 
       
       
       
       
       
       Camp Pacific Heartland was held for 17 years in Malibu, California for kids aged 6-16 â€” providing them with opportunities to build skills, confidence, and hope. CPH allowed campers to take a break from the stress and stigma of living in a family impacted by HIV/AIDS while providing a safe, healthful environment in which these children could enjoy themselves and experience the normalcy they often lacked in their lives.
       
       
       
       
       
       The Movie Team sought to utilize the film industry backgrounds of Hollywood HEARTâ€™s founders, board members and volunteers to give children and teens the opportunity to participate in the art of filmmaking. Through the Movie Team experience, the youths learned to write, produce, and star in their own short films. The program collaborated with local social service agencies including foster homes, community groups and Boys and Girls Clubs to produce over 70 films throughout the United States and South Africa. The model has since been integrated into Camp Hollywood HEART as well as the ongoing Educational Arts Workshops.
       
       
       
       
       
       Our Educational Arts workshops are a condensed version of Camp Hollywood HEART and distill performing and visual arts skills into after-school and weekend-long formats throughout Los Angeles. Collaborating with local social service agencies and community groups, these workshops continue to share industry expertise and creativity with dozens of at-risk youth across Los Angeles. The goal of the Educational Arts Workshops is to provide skill sets to groups one workshop at a time. Programs include everything from intensive writing and documentary filmmaking workshops to fashion and set design. This allows our participants ample time to absorb, practice, and sharpen skills passed on from Hollywood professionals. Being able to provide these opportunities in collaboration with volunteers and small budgets have allowed Hollywood HEART to achieve unforgettable programming.
