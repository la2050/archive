  Before we tout our own horn, we should note you don't have to take our word
  for it about our achievements. Some of Los Angeles' most prominent leaders and
  foundations have given major donations -- and in each case, major follow-on
  donations -- to us, including business leaders Elon Musk (of Tesla & SpaceX
  fame), the David Bohnett Foundation, and Robert A. Day (of Trust Company of
  the West). They've found our achievements worthy of repeated funding, and we
  appreciate the Goldhirsh Foundation's consideration of joining the ranks of
  our funding partners.

   KEY ACHIEVEMENTS<br>
   
   
   * Laying the groundwork for $40 billion in transportation funding: our CEO Summit at the City Club on Bunker Hill brought together prominent business leaders to get everyone together on the need to dramatically increase the momentum for change. The next day's LA Times announced the support by business leaders for a sales tax for transportation, and the LA Business Journal featured a dedicated editorial praising the event and the newfound sense of possibility. Speakers included David Fleming (recent Chair of the LA Chamber, and Chair of BizFed), Bob Lowe (Chairman/CEO of Lowe Enterprises), Pam O'Connor (Metro Board Chair), among others; event partners included Metro, the LA Chamber, and BizFed.
   
   
   <br><br>
   
   
   * Programs attracting key elected officials and policymakers. Our events have attracted leaders from the LA City Council & Mayor's Office, Santa Monica City Council, Assembly, Senate, Metro Board, etc.
   
   
   <br>
   
   
   * Raising expectations and pushing for change. From outreach to
   
   
   op-eds, our efforts have gained widespread media attention:

   “It was invigorating for me to attend last week’s rollout meeting…. It was reassuring to hear David Murphy, one of the organizers of the group, say in opening comments: ‘It’s time to come together…. Enough is enough.’”
