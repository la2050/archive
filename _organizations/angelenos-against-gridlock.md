org_summary: "Before we tout our own horn, we should note you don't have to take our word for it about our achievements. Some of Los Angeles' most prominent leaders and foundations have given major donations -- and in each case, major follow-on donations -- to us, including business leaders Elon Musk (of Tesla & SpaceX fame), the David Bohnett Foundation, and Robert A. Day (of Trust Company of the West). They've found our achievements worthy of repeated funding, and we appreciate the Goldhirsh Foundation's consideration of joining the ranks of our funding partners. \n \n \n <br><br>\n \n \n KEY ACHIEVEMENTS<br>\n \n \n * Laying the groundwork for $40 billion in transportation funding: our CEO Summit at the City Club on Bunker Hill brought together prominent business leaders to get everyone together on the need to dramatically increase the momentum for change. The next day's LA Times announced the support by business leaders for a sales tax for transportation, and the LA Business Journal featured a dedicated editorial praising the event and the newfound sense of possibility. Speakers included David Fleming (recent Chair of the LA Chamber, and Chair of BizFed), Bob Lowe (Chairman/CEO of Lowe Enterprises), Pam O'Connor (Metro Board Chair), among others; event partners included Metro, the LA Chamber, and BizFed.\n \n \n <br><br>\n \n \n * Programs attracting key elected officials and policymakers. Our events have attracted leaders from the LA City Council & Mayor's Office, Santa Monica City Council, Assembly, Senate, Metro Board, etc.\n \n \n <br>\n \n \n * Raising expectations and pushing for change. From outreach to\n \n \n op-eds, our efforts have gained widespread media attention:\n \n \n <br>\n \n \n BROADCAST: CBS2, NBC4, ABC7, KCAL9, KPCC, KCRW, KABC 790, KNX 1070\n \n \n \n \n \n PRINT / ONLINE / WIRES: LA Times, LA Daily News (article & op-ed), Los Angeles Business Journal (front page article, editorial, and op-eds), Patch, LA Observed, Curbed LA, Metro's The Source, Streetsblog LA, Reddit, HuffPost, Rough & Tumble, City News Service\n \n \n <br>\n \n \n WHAT THEY'RE SAYING:\n \n \n \"We would be happy to share [Angelenos Against Gridlock's \"Transit 101\" How to Ride Guide] internally with our 30,000+ employees through our many different internal communication vehicles. We truly appreciate all of the work you are doing for all Angelenos. It is our sincere hope that we will help to accomplish some of the change you are striving towards.\" -- Ralphs Grocery Company / Food 4 Less\n \n \n <br>\n \n \n â€œIt was invigorating for me to attend last weekâ€™s rollout meetingâ€¦. It was reassuring to hear David Murphy, one of the organizers of the group, say in opening comments: â€˜Itâ€™s time to come togetherâ€¦. Enough is enough.â€™â€\x9D \n \n \n  -- Editorial by Charlie Crumpley, Editor, LA Business Journal\n \n \n \n \n \n â€œI think your sympathizers are in the millions.â€\x9D \n \n \n  -- Warren Olney, host of KCRW's â€œWhich Way, L.A.?â€\x9D, introducing us on the air. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n (Our efforts under the names Angelenos Against Gridlock, and our predecessor efforts under the name Building LA's Future are covered herein.)"
