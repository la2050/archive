  3 metric categories will be used over the next 12 months to evaluate our work
  and progress:


  People: Community Engagement

  Community engagement is the number of people that join, be a part of, and
  contribute to our community.  We will also track organic growth in membership
  outside our targeted LA communities.

  Measurements include: number of registered users, number of active users on a
  daily/weekly/monthly basis, the variety of GrowCycles used, and the number of
  farm/garden locations in the community, etc.


  Plants: GrowCycles (GC)

  We will begin the community with 10 initial GCs, and measure the use and
  comments we receive on each. We will also engage the community in the
  modification of existing GCs and in the creation of new ones.

  Key measurements will include: the number of GCs, comments on GCs, number of
  GCs completed or abandoned, etc.


  Product: Plantaware online and mobile community

  Online community will begin with a minimal product, containing limited
  features that will grow over time through dialog with users. Use of agile
  development will allow us to prioritize community needs. Initial features
  include: membership, GC activation, and comment threads.

  Measurements used on product development are use-case growth, backlog
  expansion, and the ability to integrate new features to address community
  needs.


  These 3 metrics categories, will give us a quantitative and qualitative
  picture of Plantaware’s progress and impact in the communities we serve.

  Plantaware will support the growth of fresh local food, beautify life with
  living plants, and provide better connection to the urban environment we live
  in. 


  We’ll make LA a garden of food and beauty,  while offering Angelenos
  personalized knowledge and tools to grow plants, any plants, successfully. 


  Our community will provide a place to connect, get location specific and
  obtain specific instructions related to any crop of interest.

  LA brings together people of diverse social and cultural backgrounds. Many, no
  matter where they come from, are interested in urban farming as a way to make
  LA more self sufficient, sustainable, beautiful, and connected.


  Plantaware is a web and mobile social community space for people interested in
  gardening and urban farming. It offers the tools for people to interact with
  each other, share their knowledge and “home grown” product, as well as receive
  personalized,  hyper-local information about the plants they want to grow.


  Of the 3+ million LA households, over 1 million have shown interest in food
  gardening. Still, only a few actually do so. There are many who would like to,
  but do not know how or where to begin. We look to fill this space and become
  that social community and knowledge place for “All-Things-Plants”. 


  Our vision is to have LA become a garden of food and beauty. Our mission is to
  connect people, and to offer anyone who is interested, the personalized hyper
  local knowledge and tools to grow any plant successfully.
   
  A key innovative concept developed by Plantaware for its community is the
  GrowCycle. GrowCycles serves as a framework for knowledge that is time and
  place dependent as well as the hub for communicating instructional data-sets
  in a fun and engaging way. The GrowCycle provides all the information
  necessary for tracking a plant’s life cycle and configures itself for the
  plant’s local environment incorporating real-time data from weather and other
  public services.


  GrowCycles generate weekly garden instructions, with tips, suggestions, and
  to-dos, specifically tailored to a given garden and plant.  They include:

  tips about sustainable gardening methods that won't deplete your wallet,

  suggestions about what will grow well in your garden, and

  GrowCycle generated to-do lists to remind you of things to look after in your
  garden that are delivered as text, videos and pictures to communicate the
  relevant information.  

  The GrowCycle is the hub of personalized information and its delivery to our
  members. In our context, personalized information is the intersection of
  plant, place, method, and real-time data.


  We plan to begin our online community in LA and the San Gabriel Valley. We are
  truly hands on, so we plan to go door to door and invite residents of these
  communities to join. Our experience suggests that almost 25% of residents,
  have tried their hand in food growing, and did not continue on the path for
  lack of information and support. 

  We assembled a team of engineers and business people with extended background
  in urban farming and online community building. Our work showed us that  it’s
  not about technology but about connecting people and knowledge.


  Plantaware will bring together and aggregates all people who are interested in
  urban gardening and farming in Los Angeles, its neighborhoods and communities.
