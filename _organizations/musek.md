  The program is fairly new and underfunded. However, all students who have been
  enrolled in the program for the 2012-2013 cycle- have been accepted to a 4
  year university. These students come from diverse backgrounds. Some students
  were significantly performing academically below grade level, but were able to
  thrive while in the program. All of the students are first-generation college
  students, so to watch the students overcome personal obstacles to accomplish
  academic goals is rewarding. 
   
   
   
   
   
   This program has shown that it can help students improve their grades by empowering with tools that inspire critical thinking, focus, and organization. Implementing this curriculum has definitely motivated my students to pursue higher education. Not only are they thinking about college but they now understand the skills they must develop to get into college and to succeed in college.
