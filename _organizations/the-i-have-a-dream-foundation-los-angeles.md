org_summary: "<p>As an organization, we have changed the lives of over 1,000 students in LA thus far by guiding them diligently through their academic careers and exposing them to enriching experiences which motivate them to attend college. Our results speak for themselves: Of our most recent class, 94% have graduated from high school, and 96% of those are in college. This more than doubles the average graduation rates that typically characterize these depressed areas. Program-wide, 97% percent of Dreamers report that IHADLA is like a â€œsecond familyâ€\x9D to them and Ninety-eight percent of Dreamers feel that their mentor will be there for them â€œno matter whatâ€\x9D and can trust them with their problems.</p>\n \n \n \n \n \n <p>Additionally, in 2011, IHADLA received the FBI Directorâ€™s Community Leadership Award for outstanding service to the community. Only one organization nationally is honored each year. We were thereafter able to forge a partnership with the FBI, and were able to match many of our Dreamers with FBI mentors. </p>\n \n \n \n \n \n <p>Each of our current classes has achievements from this year which exemplify the success of our program overall:\n \n \n \n \n \n In 2002, IHADLA adopted an entire grade level of almost 150 first grade students from Murchison Elementary School. Almost all of these students lived in the Ramona Gardens Projects in East LA, and many still do. These Dreamers are now on the eve of their high school graduation. Eighty-three percent of our graduating Dreamers from this class will be attending college, and that number will grow next year when our second year seniors graduate as well. Colleges that Dreamers will be attending include: UC Irvine, UC Santa Barbara, UC San Diego, USC, UCLA, Stanford University, Ithaca University, a host of Cal States throughout California, and many, many more. \n \n \n \n \n \n Adopted back to back in 2006 and 2007, IHADLA has two grades of Dreamers in Inglewood. This year, we are proud to report that these middle-school Dreamers are performing better than their peers on the California English Language Development Test. Seventy-one percent of Dreamers were rated as â€œearly advancedâ€\x9D or â€œadvancedâ€\x9D, compared with only 39% of their peers. These Dreamers continue to flourish academically, with 66% improving their grade point averages this year overall. Despite turbulence within the Inglewood school district, the majority of our Dreamers have above a 3.0 GPA, and many of those below are Dreamers in our special education program.\n \n \n \n \n \n Our newest group of third grade Dreamers have not only melted our hearts, but inspired our organization as a whole. These children come from extraordinary circumstances, including domestic violence, familial gang membership, and unbelievable scenarios of poverty. Despite it all, these children are well on their way to becoming the future leaders of our society. Over the course of IHADLAâ€™s first six months of programming, these Dreamers went from 32% only passing their quarterly assessments to 62% at advanced/proficient level.</p>"
