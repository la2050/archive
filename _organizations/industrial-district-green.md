  - Greening 7th St. in Skid Row/DTLA
organization_id: '2013096'
title: Industrial District Green
org_type: Nonprofit
org_summary: >-
  Well before founding Industrial District Green, Katherine McNenny had begun
  laying the groundwork for future non-profit greening activities. In December
  of 2011 after 12 months of preparation, she conducted her first planting of 7
  trees along San Pedro St. in Skid Row between 4th and 5th Streets with the
  support of the Central City East Association (CCEA) and it's Executive
  Director, Estela Lopez. This successful first effort involved lobbying and
  coordinating with all relevant property owners, Jan Perryâ€™s office, the Bureau
  of Street Services, and TreePeople, who managed the plantings.
   
   
   
   
   
   She is currently overseeing another tree planting also in Skid Row, with the LA Conservation Corps along Boyd & Omar Streets between 3rd and 4th. She has been working with property owners and sponsors on this project for several months now. The planting date will be March 23rd, 2013. Volunteers from Union Church (in Little Tokyo) and several local residents from the neighborhood will help plant the trees.
