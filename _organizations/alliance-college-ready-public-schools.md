      Alliance is the largest charter school network in LA, providing a college

      Alliance College-Ready Public Schools has grown to become the largest
      charter management organization operating in LAUSD, educating 9,500
      low-income students at 21 high-performing public middle and high schools.
      If Alliance were a stand-alone district, we would be larger than 75% of
      the school districts in California. Alliance has a consistent and
      exemplary track record of educating students at high levels. More than 92%
      of incoming Alliance 9th graders graduate in four years (vs. 65% for LAUSD
      and 78% for the state). One hundred percent of Alliance graduates pass the
      A-G college prep courses required by California four-year public
      universities and more than 95% of our graduates have gone to college.
      Average daily attendance at Alliance schools is 95%. Alliance schools
      consistently outperform neighboring schools on California achievement
      tests and four schools have been named California Distinguished Schools.
      In the past six years, Alliance-wide California Academic Performance Index
      (API) scores surpass those of neighborhood schools by nearly 100 points,
      LASUD by 62 points and the state by 18 points. In 2012, six Alliance high
      schools were ranked in the top 3% of all high schools nationwide by U.S.
      News & World Report, and Alliance Gertz-Ressler High School was the only
      school in LAUSD to be named a National Blue Ribbon School by the U.S.
      Department of Education. By consistently achieving academic success across
      a network of 21 schools, Alliance proves that quality education does not
      have to be the exception; it can be the rule.
