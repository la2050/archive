    - "<p>Since 2008, ACE has reached more than 1.5 million teens in over 2,000 schools across the country. Over 35,000 students in environmental action teams, have completed over 1,500 climate-saving projects in their schools and communities. Nearly 2,000 young people have attended ACE Leadership Trainings and we have elevated the voice of 9 Youth Reps â€“ the most dedicated, passionate youth climate leaders nationwide.</p>\n \n \n \n \n \n <p>The video showing the impact of Santa Monica High Schoolâ€™s â€œTeam Marineâ€\x9D is one example of the kind of student action and leadership that ACE supports and inspires. ACE took our multimedia assembly there in 2010 and our Educators have been working with Team Marine ever since. They have a highly engaged faculty sponsor, they won ACEâ€™s â€œStar Warsâ€\x9D campaign a few years back, they took on our Biggest Loser Energy Challenge, and they used an ACE starter grant towards building an electric car:</p>\n \n \n \n \n \n <p>http://www.acespace.org/blog/2012/04/for-immediate-release-team-marine-wins-first-place/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=for-immediate-release-team-marine-wins-first-place</p>\n \n \n \n \n \n <p>Also, in January 2012, Kavi Reddy, an ACE Youth Advisory Board member, was the keynote speaker at SMUD's (Sacramento Municipal Utility District's) Youth Energy Summit. In 2011, in April 2011, ACE youth went to the White House to speak with Secretary of Energy Stephen Chu, and U.S. Chief Technology Officer, Aneesh Chopra, about scaling energy-efficiency in U.S. public schools. ACE's programs provide both a foundation of knowledge in climate science, as well as the resources and support to turn that knowledge into action.</p>\n \n \n \n \n \n <p>In the school year 2011-12, we both reached our 1 millionth student and received the EPA Region 1 (New England) Merit Award for outstanding contributions to preserving and protecting the environment, alongside renowned advocates like Gary Hirshberg, President and CEO of Stonyfield Farms.</p>\n \n \n \n \n \n <p>In addition to this prestigious award, ACE was named Climate Change Communicator of the Year by George Mason Universityâ€™s Center for Climate Change Communication and received the 2011 Breathe California Clean Air Award for Public Awareness and Education.</p>"
