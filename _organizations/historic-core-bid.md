  Success for this project means a better connected Downtown. It means more
  face-to-face interactions between community members, more individuals
  accessing their friends, family, and information through technology, and
  faster safer travel connections for pedestrians, bicyclists, and vehicles
  through Downtown.


  • We will document and photograph special events happening at parklets.

  - We will survey parklet users regarding the reasons and frequency of their
  parklet usage.

  - We will survey locals on the “DTLA” Facebook group (over 14k resident
  members). 

  - We will track the number of unique users accessing the public wifi.

  - We will work with CD14 and LADOT to compare traffic, public transportation
  ridership, and pedestrian safety data from before and after the Spring Street
  reconfiguration.

  Our proposal is to build new technology-equipped public parklets on Spring
  Street, and enhance the two original pilot parklets. Strategically located
  adjacent to DTLA hotspots like Guisados and The Last Bookstore, the parklets
  will feature planters, shaded seating, free wifi, charging stations, and
  spaces for arts and culture programming. With a pledge of matching funds from
  Councilmember Jose Huizar, the parklets will be designed, built, and
  maintained by the HCBID and the City of Los Angeles.

project_proposal_best_place: >-
  The Historic Core is Downtown LA’s residential hub, cultural center, and
  creative crossroads. It is one of the most dense and diverse neighborhoods in
  the City of Los Angeles with nearly 1:1 market rate and low income housing.
  Its burgeoning small businesses, restaurants, and cafes set beneath beautiful
  historic architecture, its tight-knit community of residents and stakeholders,
  and its transit oriented urban density make it a pioneering location for
  innovative ideas and policies to plan for the LA of the future.


  The new Spring Street parklets will make LA the best place to connect for the
  tens of thousands of residents, visitors, and commuters that use Spring Street
  every day in several ways:


  - Public/Open Space: In densely populated DTLA, public open space is an
  important and scare resource. Projects such as Pershing Square Renew and DTLA
  Forward seek to maximize public open space for the benefit of our entire
  community. The Spring Street parklets will add public open space in a critical
  zone: the residential, bar, and restaurant hub of Spring Street. The parklets
  will allow Downtowners, visitors, and daytime workers to relax, eat, work,
  play, and meet one another in beautiful shared space.


  - Cultural Events: Working with cultural organizations such as the monthly
  Downtown Art Walk, we will coordinate visual and performing arts in the
  parklets. 


  - Technology Connections / Access: Each parklet will be equipped with free
  public wifi access. This will allow all members of the DTLA community to
  better connect to their friends, family, work, and information. In particular,
  this will serve as a vital resource for our numerous residents in low-income
  housing buildings along Spring Street who may otherwise have difficulty
  accessing wifi. 


  - Transit Efficiency: The parklets are an important feature of Councilmember
  Jose Huizar’s Spring Street Redesign that will significantly improve traffic
  flow, relocate public transit stops, create protected bike lanes, and make
  DTLA overall more pedestrian, bike, and transit friendly.
