  In June of 2012 for the fifth year in a row, 100% of NYAâ€™s seniors graduated
  high school on time and went on to college! Most are among the first in their
  families to attend college! In addition to California State Universities and
  Universities of California campuses, NYA Alumni currently attend Macalester,
  Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Mount Holyoke, and many other
  prestigious colleges in California and throughout the country. Three of
  NYAâ€™s students have been recognized by the Gates Millennium Scholarship
  Program, including one winner and two finalists. 
   
   
   
   
   
   Each year, NYA awards college scholarship funds of between $500 to $2,500 to its best performing students and Alumni based on their academic achievements, participation in extra-curricular activities, communication skills and demonstrated ability to overcome personal challenges. At the most recent annual Scholarship and Community Service Awards Dinner in March of 2013, NYA awarded scholarships to 23 students â€“ more than in any other year! Over the last thirty years, NYA has awarded over 175 college scholarships to its students. 
   
   
   
   
   
   Additionally, as many as half of NYAâ€™s alumni who remain in the Los Angeles area after high school, return to the program as volunteers. Alumni volunteers set an example for younger students and help guide the way for the next generation of youth to graduate from high school, succeed in college and transition into meaningful careers.
