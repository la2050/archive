  Though NativLA does not yet exist, it will coalesce my years of experience
  with nature and the environment. While earning a BA in Journalism at the
  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, I created the show Habitat for
  UNC-CH Cable TV on the abundance of nature found on campus. I spent summers
  interning at 60 Minutes, The New York Times and studying with the Wildlands
  Studies Program through San Francisco State University. My first job out of
  college was shadowing an environmental reporter at CBS affiliate WRAL-TV in
  Durham, NC where I put together a reel which landed me my first job reporting,
  at NBC affiliate KIEM-TV in Eureka, CA. As morning and then evening anchor, I
  wrote, produced and filmed dozens of stories on the local environment,
  including a three-part special on Coho salmon and their plight, and stories on
  the headwaters of the old growth coastal redwoods in Humboldt County. After
  moving to Los Angeles, I wrote and produced nature documentaries for
  television, including Earthâ€™s Fury, Storm Warning and The Top 10
  Environmental Disasters. When I chose to leave the workforce and start a
  family, I created my own company called Dutch Touch Art designing and
  commissioning a series of hand-painted oils for the design industry, based on
  the Netherlandâ€™s Golden Age and their iconic depictions of nature in the
  wild. Currently, I am Chair of a non-profit organization called Friends of
  Wonderland, which raises over $450K annually for Wonderland Elementary School
  in Laurel Canyon. We provide the enrichment programs that Los Angeles United
  School District (LAUSD) no longer funds, including PE, library, music and art.
  We also ask, where field trips are concerned, that the parents carpool and pay
  for all admission fees.
