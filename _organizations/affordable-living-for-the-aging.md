  In the 35 years since ALA was founded, we have helped more than 30,000 seniors
  in their search for safe, stable housing that preserves their dignity and
  independence and keeps them engaged in their communities. 
   
   
   
   
   
   Our most significant achievement to date is partnering with the National Shared Housing Resource Center to lead the revival of the shared housing movement by rebuilding the Centerâ€™s capacity and launching a national campaign to strengthen existing programs. 
   
   
   
   
   
   Through a collaborative six-month process ALA worked with stakeholders from around the country to develop the Strategic Guide on Scaling Shared Housing, which highlights the exciting work happening in the field and identifies the new opportunities for growth. For example, New York City used shared housing as a disaster response solution in the wake of super storm Sandy. 
   
   
   
   
   
   With the support of Enterprise Community Partners and the Archstone Foundation, ALA hosted a Shared Housing Symposium that convened leaders from Illinois, Vermont, New Jersey, Maryland, Washington, Michigan and California to launch the Strategic Guide and discuss ideas for reinvigorating this decades-old movement.
