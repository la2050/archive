  Besides our latest project at our center.... La Loma is a critical partner in
  the creation of Arlington Gardens, a three acre, award-winning community
  garden. We were also awarded the Green Hero Award by Environmental Charter
  Schools for the greening of their campus, which also received national
  attention as a runner-up in the White House Race to the Top contest. We
  received the Pasadena Beautiful Golden Arrow Award for our classic terraced
  vineyard project and other front-yard gardens. We were published on the cover
  of Landscape Contractor Magazine for our use of recycled concrete in
  beautiful, monumental projects, as well as stories in LA Times, Sunset,
  Pasadena Star, and others. We had an acclaimed installation, the Public Fruit
  Tree Theater, at LACMA that unfortunately was replaced by "Levitated Mass." We
  have been publicly commended by several council members for our work at
  schools and other community projects, such as Plaza Morazan (Ed Reyes), Main
  St. Elementary (Jan Perry), Pasadena Senior Center (Steve Madison). We
  bioremediated our site, eliminating the gasoline, oil and chemicals. We are
  leaders of converting toxic chlorine pools into Natural Pools, that create
  habitat and store drinking water. We were called upon as an emergency
  responder to the recent windstorms, and we pride ourselves as being a force of
  nature for our community. Currently we are finishing a large Demonstration
  Garden for the Chino Basin Water District. Marco Barrantes was formerly a
  Parks and Recreation Commissioner, as well as a member of Food Policy Council,
  he wrote a book called "Feed Your City: Urban Agriculture Food Systems." We
  are a registered Small Business, Minority Business Enterprise, and
  pre-qualified for projects with LAUSD, MWD, among other major institutions. We
  have created jobs and income during a recession, what more can you ask?
