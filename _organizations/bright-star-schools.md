  Since opening, Bright Star's schools have earned some of the highest API
  scores in Los Angeles, making our organization one of the preeminent schools
  for any child in Los Angeles. It is the daily attention to our core values
  that has helped Bright Star Schools gain remarkable distinction as an academic
  leader among Los Angeles schools. California gives each public school a score
  on an Academic Performance Index (API); 800 being the state proficiency goal
  on a scale of 1000. Our continuing success is illustrated by our 2011-12 API
  scores: 
   
   
   
   
   
   * Stella Middle Charter Academy (5th and 6th grades) earned an API score of 802. 
   
   
   * Bright Star Secondary Charter Academy (7th- 12th grades) earned an API score of 812.

   Bright Star Schools was recently awarded a $1 million grant from the Broad Foundation to fuel our growth. In March 2013, we were awarded our fourth charter from LAUSD for our new high school in the San Fernando Valley which will open in 2013-2014. We have also received generous start-up funding from the Annenberg Foundation and the Kaplan Family Foundation for our Connections Program.
   
   
   
   
   
   Since its inception, the Connections Program has had 100% participation. The Connections Program is currently serving 747 students in grades 7-12. During the 2011-2012 school year:
   
   
   * Connectors helped 18 seniors prepare 262 applications to 63 colleges.
   
   
   * 100% of 2012 seniors graduated from high school 
   
   
   * All high school graduates were college-bound
   
   
   * Connectors increased communication between home and school (by meeting with family members and providing social service referrals)
   
   
   
   
   
   Connectors have made great strides creating a college-going culture on our middle and high school campus. This year, Connectors established “College Clubs” for middle school students and our juniors and seniors to encourage college and career exploration. These after-school clubs provide fundamental information on the college admissions process and help students explore their career interests. Students learn how to research colleges online, navigate the admissions process, and receive the information and guidance when applying to colleges and universities. 
   
   
   
   
   
   Connectors also built a “College Center” on the high school campus where students and families can access college resources such as financial aid and scholarship information and applications, admissions exams and study guides, and participate in college-bound workshops led by Connectors.
