  The first milestone we reached was opening our doors December 5, 2012. After 9
  months of fundraising, drawing, re-drawing, building, permitting,
  re-permitting, installing, inspecting, re-building, re-installing, and
  re-inspecting, we opened as a fully permitted restaurant, allowing us to
  legally sell food to the public. Throughout the process, our friends and
  neighbors continuously offered their hands and tools, making it possible to
  finish, install, and outfit TYFC for under $20,000. 
   
   
   
   
   
   Weâ€™ve begun building a volunteer force and forged dozens of relationships, enabling us to source local produce, accept time dollars as currency, or offer a class on the History of Art and Food. 
   
   
   
   
   
   We are proud to have hosted 3 diverse residency projects by multidisciplinary artists who each contextualized food in a different manner through their work at TYFC-- 
   
   
   
   
   
   Cristina Victor/ L.A.Novela Special: "As the daughter of Cuban-American exiles born and raised in Miami, exile experience is at the root of my desire to contextualize a sense of cultural displacement. Through performance/food events, I create environments where parody, contradiction and nostalgia are ingredients to addressing the complexities of representing identity. My practice often involves appropriating stereotypes present in mass media, specifically about Latinos, through my alter ego Miami. By way of humor, kitschy aesthetics, and 'authentic' food, I intend to seduce people into a situation in which they are immersed in stereotypes that are familiar yet very clearly performed."
   
   
   
   
   
   Jennifer June Strawn/Superstition & Sustenance: "Reportedly, superstitious belief is on the rise in modern society, neck-and-neck, it seems, with an ever-widening faith in scientific fact. The purpose of this project is to examine the mechanism of superstition, its role in our private and public lives, and its relevance. As sensitive creatures vulnerable to the harsh realities of the world we live in, superstition, as a complicated system of smoke-and-mirrorsâ€”regardless of its actual efficacyâ€”is necessary to our survival as a species. Through the scope of whimsy, play, and humor, my mission is to present superstition in the form of food and food-for-thought."
   
   
   
   
   
   Japanther/69Â¢ Only: "In our research, we found that a nickel in 1930 is valued, coincidentally, at 69Â¢ today. But while automats used to provide public dignity for pennies on the dollar, in 2013, questions about value, quality and service are still highly contended. Our intention in creating a 69Â¢ Only store is to provide a place where people can eat and hang out affordably in LA. Weâ€™re challenging ourselves to fully consider the costs and value of things that are too-often omitted in the conversation: labor, modern manufacturing processes, etc. It is without a doubt that we will need to rely on creative resource gathering, careful proportioning, DIY processes, and the generosity of friends and strangers to realize a 69Â¢ Only store."
