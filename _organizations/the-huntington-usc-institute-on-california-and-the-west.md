  <p>LASA has been active since the summer of 2012. Our inaugural class of 20
  high school juniors, one high school intern, two college interns, and seven
  high school teachers has met in a summer intensive Los Angeles history and
  culture seminar at The Huntington Library, and we've met one Saturday a month
  since then. Each Saturday session is focused on a different "node" of regional
  infrastructure. The day usually begins with a speaker and discussion, and then
  the LASA group goes into the field and to various sites which fit that day's
  themes. Our investigation of water started with a history overview of regional
  water development -- with rare documents -- and we then went to the dispersal
  facility for Colorado River water coming into the Metropolitan Water District
  system. Our business investigation took us to a private aerospace
  manufacturing facility, in business for 57 years, in Glendale, and a tour with
  that company's chief technologist. We ended that day with a discussion with
  Idealab executives and entrepreneurs. Our law enforcement day featured a
  morning with Connie Rice of the Advancement Project (we all read her book on
  the LAPD), and an afternoon tour with LAPD leaders of the new station and the
  regional 911 call center; we ended the day with a tour of SWAT team equipment
  and vehicles. For our investigation of regional transit and transit history,
  we began our day with seminars by experts from The Getty and the Automobile
  Club of Southern California on the history of automobiles, freeways, and
  railroads in the region. Following an on-foot journey from LAPL to Union
  Station, we met with the lead architectural design team tasked with
  re-imagining Union Station in the urban fabric of downtown (a stop at the
  Bradbury Building completed that day). A more recent investigation of the
  entertainment landscape of Los Angeles took us to AEG's Staples Center, the
  GRAMMY Museum, the Disney Concert Hall, and an end-of-the-day Bunker Hill
  discussion with the architecture critic of the Los Angeles Times. </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>We believe our LASA students are getting to know the region, getting to know one another, and beginning to build lasting ties to their home and one another through LASA's commitment to fostering engaged civic participation and civic education. We believe that we are off to a great start.</p>
