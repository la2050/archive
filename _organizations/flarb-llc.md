  <p>FLARB LLC is one of the earliest developers and publishers of mobile games
  and content in the West. In addition to consulting on mobile and social games
  FLARB recently created Camera Birds (www.camerabirds.com), a unique 3D
  birdwatching simulator for iOS and Android that uses Augmented Reality
  technology to bring its virtual birds into the real world.

   FLARB LLC's mobile games often do not fit the mold of traditional entertainment. One of FLARB's more popular experiments in pushing boundaries is Brick Buddies (www.flarb.com/bb), a hilarious satire of social games that has been favorably reviewed by such media outlets as The Guardian. Creating apps as a platform for social activism is a natural next step.

   FLARB LLC has the expertise in the design and development of mobile apps as well as the Augmented Reality technology necessary to build this application.
