  Founded in 2003 in response to the acute shortage of leadership and management
  talent in the education sector, Education Pioneers attracts, prepares, and
  advances top leaders, managers, and analysts to accelerate excellence in
  education. <br><br>Our partners include major urban school districts, charter
  management organizations, and nonprofit organizations. These partners hire EP
  Fellows to complete mission critical projects and fill important
  organizational roles. EP provides exceptionally valuable talent to our
  Partners. Over 90% of Partners indicate that they would hire their Fellow in
  the future. <br><br>EP has grown into a thriving national organization and
  since its 2007 launch in Los Angeles has supplied professional talent to
  nearly 40 education organizations and built a network of program Alumni
  numbering over 150. EP has significantly expanded the talent supply in
  education by connecting our Alumni to high-impact careers in education and
  supporting them to succeed. More than 70 percent of our employed Alumni work
  full-time in education.
