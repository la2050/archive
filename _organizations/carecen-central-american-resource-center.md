  For 30 years, CARECEN has worked to empower the Central American and Latino
  immigrant community to fight for social and economic justice. Part of that
  fight has been to ensure that the children in our communities receive a
  quality education and cultural teachings. Through educational reform advocacy,
  educational programs, and active roles in the design and implementation of new
  school structures, CARECEN seeks solutions everyday to the obstacles our youth
  face in achieving success and in the development of the arts and culture
  component that defines their and that of their families personal struggle. 
   
   
   Currently CARECEN offers an Art & Culture Program for children and youth in the Pico Union/Westlake Community, as well as, a dedicated Parent Center, which provides families education around the role of community schools. Each program is based around the need of the community to never lose sight of the roots of their native culture and an in-depth analysis of the continuous struggle for immigrant children to receive a quality education. 
   
   
   CARECEN has offered after school programs for youth since 1992; then called, Nueva Generacion (New Generation), the original program was focused on helping youth learn work skills and become familiar with the computer. In 1998, when the agency moved into its 30,000-sq.ft community center it was able to expand the age range of participants as well as the programs offered. From 1998 until today, education programs have included academic enrichment, cultural projects, a summer youth program, parent involvement, field trips and a special focus on being college-ready.
   
   
   With the continuous educational cutbacks on all levels (local, state and federal), schools within a 5-10 mile radius of CARECEN will experience continuous setbacks, for example â€” the cuts to arts and culture, parent centers and academic enrichment programs. Given this reality, CARECEN feels it is important to open its doors to the community and provide children and youth the best educational experience during their lengthy break from school.
