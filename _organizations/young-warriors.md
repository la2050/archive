  YW started with a relationship between Jason Hill and one 10-year-old boy
  named Wonder. Along with other mentors, Jason was able to give Wonder the
  mentoring relationship that Jason had received from caring mentors who changed
  Jason's life. Wonder is now on a healthy path and thriving. In fact, Wonder
  received an award for Male Athlete of the Year at his school. 
   
   
   Wonder is responsible for the birth of Young Warriors. During Wonder's success, Jason decided to give other boys broader horizons. YW started with a small group of boys, their single moms, and a circle of friends. The program was extremely successful, and quickly grew to over 20 boys, with moms calling from as far as two hours away, asking to come Young Warrior events. YW participants are committed; they enjoy being in the program and attendance rates are over 96%. Adults in these children's lives have noticed almost an immediate change in the boy's attitudes and behaviors. In addition, grades are showing improvement.
   
   
   YW has expanded its program throughout the community. YW community members (such as Galpin Ford, Nestle, Wells Fargo, the city of Van Nuys, and many private investors) are excited to participate in the program. YW now has two programs: (1) the original YW group, and (2) two elementary schools consisting of 24 fatherless 5th grade boys. Other principals heard of YW and are expressing a strong interest in hosting the YW program at their schools. In addition, Jason has peaked the interest of various gang-prevention units. The waiting list for YW is growing with 100’s of kids waiting for the program to become available to them!
