  Currently we are able to assist 20 patients annually, however we have to turn
  away twice that many. The Ava's Heart Healing House will be able to help every
  transplant patient in need of assistance. Many patients relocate to Los
  Angeles to continue their care. Our facility will a safe, secure and provide
  many needs to our patients who otherwise would struggle to pay for them.
  Success is the opening of the Ava's Heart Healing House.

project_proposal_description: >-
  We are looking for funds to launch our capital campaign, our Goal is to raise
  $26 million for renovation and improvements and capital needs to have an
  actual site to house transplant patients near the three world premier
  hospitals that provide transplants in Los Angeles California. Transplant
  patients who cannot afford the required temporary housing find Ava’s Heart
  through word of mouth or are referred by their transplant teams.
project_proposal_impact:
  - Housing affordability
  - Healthcare access
  - Self-sufficiency
  - Residents receiving coordinated healthcare services
project_proposal_best_place: >-
  Ava’s Heart plans to build a strong Capital Campaig to raise the necessary
  funds to build a Healing House for patient’s pre and post-transplant.  There
  will be wonderful opportunities for volunteer engagement.  Foundations and
  Corporations can adopt rooms and name them, through sponsorship, as well as,
  donating products in-kind, such as equipment needs, electrical etc. People
  come from all over California as well as the United States to Los Angeles
  where we have the best transplant centers in the world with the most advanced
  treatment and care. Yet many find themselves unable to get listed because they
  cannot afford both pre and post transplant housing. Southern California does
  more transplants than any other center in the United States. We need to create
  a safe living facility where people can heal. Cities like Philadelphia, have a
  healing house for transplant patients that serves their transplant centers.
  Los Angeles should be number one in providing this facility.
