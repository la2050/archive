org_type: Nonprofit
org_summary: >-
  Most importantly, Slake proved Los Angeles can produce a beautiful, exciting,
  smart journal of arts and letters that bridges the gap between stagnant
  old-world iterations of such and the future of long-form publishing. Slake is
  as intelligent as it as it is lovely and its success belies the myth that
  people don't have time or don't want to engage with more in-depth narrative.
  We've raised expectations for both Los Angeles and for the world as to what we
  should expect from a Los Angeles journal. Meanwhile, we've provided much
  needed gravity around which this often diffused community.
