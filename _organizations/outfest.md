  Founded by UCLA students in 1982, Outfest is the leading organization that
  promotes equality by creating, sharing, and protecting LGBT (Lesbian, Gay,
  Bisexual and Transgender) stories on the screen. Outfest builds community by
  connecting diverse populations to discover, discuss, and celebrate stories of
  LGBT lives. Over the past three decades, Outfest has showcased thousands of
  films from around the world to audiences of nearly a million, educated and
  mentored hundreds of emerging filmmakers, and protected more than 20,000 LGBT
  films and videos. In addition, Outfest produces one of the largest film
  festivals in Southern California, the only LGBT people of color film festival,
  three filmmaking programs using mentors, and we have over 400 volunteers who
  participate in our programs.
