  In fewer than 18 months, DIYFO has grown from an arts and crafts-oriented
  meeting among friends at a bar, to an organization whose vision will change
  the way Los Angeles uses and cultivates its creative talents. We have teamed
  up with organizations like Junior League Los Angeles and Aviva, and are driven
  by our desire to reach those in need. DIYFO has also partnered with organizers
  of events like Unique LA Local Love 2012 and the LA Weekly Pancake Breakfast
  to host onsite DIY projects — free of charge — for the events’ thousands of
  attendees, and will partner with Jubilee Music Festival to do the same in
  June. We also continue to provide programming around the city in our sponsor
  venues — teaching DIY, while working to raise money for a variety of
  organizations.
   
   
    We plan to accomplish much more in 2013 and beyond, by instituting our pilot program in a physical space, while meanwhile expanding our multimedia content to extend our reach — using all available resources and outlets to provide artistic opportunities, advance appreciation and understanding, and unlock the creative potential in all of LA’s residents.
