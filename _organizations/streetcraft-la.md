  Streetcraft LA is a new social venture of the South Bay Center for Community
  Development (SBCC). SBCC is a long-standing non-profit organization that has
  been working to empower low-income communities in the greater Los Angeles area
  since 1976. SBCC has a long history of being one of those do-gooders that
  operates job-training programs to mitigate unemployment. The organization’s
  career pathway programs have been recognized by the United Way of Greater Los
  Angeles as a national best practice and were awarded a Everychild grant (one
  of the most competitive grants in LA) to apply its model to unemployed at risk
  youth. In addition, the organization founded the Urban Teacher Fellowship, an
  initiative that moves underrepresented groups into the teaching profession
  funded by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation; and The Promo Pathway, a
  career pathway funded by The James Irvine Foundation and recognized by The
  Aspen Institute as a national best practice. In doing this work, however, we
  came to believe that job training wasn’t good enough. We needed to train
  entrepreneurs who can create their own jobs. So a team of us launched
  Streetcraft LA as a related, but autonomous social venture to train and
  incubate youth-led micro ventures. 
   
   
   
   
   
   Streetcraft is currently testing its core components and theory of change in a proof of concept pilot state funded the James Irvine Foundation. Guided by our board of directors, the focus of this planning stage was to test three assumptions critical to our model: marginalized youth engaged in graffiti culture or other illicit entrepreneur activities have talents that can be re-directed; a process of engagement can be created including partnerships with public systems and community based social networks; and youth’s talents can be monetized and professionalized. Streetcraft has piloted its model with 50 Streetcraft fellows, referred through probation and other community-based networks, who went through a work based contextualized learning experience and developed products for a retail store located on main street, Santa Monica. During this pilot period 100% of participants completed the pilot and 85% percent increased their annual income by 50%.
