  The benefit of this project for the entire community is threefold:  Young
  people will have an opportunity to take REALationships to the streets...They
  can actively participate in the most current dating abuse campaign and work to
  mobilize and spread the word through their community.  And they can connect
  for more enhanced dialogs through the Let’s Be Real high school chapters. 
  Secondarily, families can use the information for youth organizations, local
  churches, community centers and schools. Collectively Los Angeles will Break
  the Cycle taking the new mobilized energy to work with community leaders to
  create additional permanent spaces where youth are empowered to take action
  and change their norms of relationships.  The following metrics will be used
  to measure success:


  * # of visits to the mobile technology hubs

  * # of sign ups for Let’s Be Real

  * # of sign ups for Love Is Not Abuse

  * Time connected to Wi-Fi

  * 75% of participants will identify healthy relationships behaviors

  * 75% of care takers will feel comfortable speaking to their teens about 
  healthy relationships

  * 80% of young people will feel comfortable speaking to their friends about
  healthy relationships

  * 5 community partners will be engaged to take action and prevent dating abuse
  (host a mobile technology hub, host a Let’s Be Real or Love Is Not Abuse
  chapter) 

  * 2 stores will be engaged to take action and prevent dating abuse (host a
  mobile technology hub, host a chapter)

  The Zone will bring dating prevention education to young people in Los Angeles
  in casual spaces, removing obstacles to real talk about the factors that
  restrict healthy relationships.  The Zone will bring together various parts of
  specific neighborhoods: young people, caring adults, retail community members,
  community volunteers to ignite connectivity, inspire action and community
  pride for healthy relationships and healthy spaces for all.

  Break the Cycle (BTC) is moving outside of traditional school systems.  BTC
  was fortunate enough to hear the needs of the young people of Los Angeles at a
  recent Los Angeles for Youth Rally.  During the rally a young woman about 18
  years old shared a story with the audience about her younger sister.  She
  recalled that she was sharing a memory about how safe and engaged she felt
  attending their youth center.  Her younger sister asked her, “What’s that?”
  She realized that her sister had no relationship with the center.  Other young
  people talked about how their safe place was a liquor store around the corner
  until they got harassed by gang members or cops thinking they were gang
  member. Some sections of Los Angeles youth are provided with spaces that help
  them proactively contribute to the community while in others they are not.  We
  specifically see this challenge in the City Terrace neighborhood of East Los
  Angeles. There is a huge opportunity to ignite a neighborhood of healthy
  relationships through a pilot called the Zone.  Los Angeles’ young people need
  more info about healthy relationships and resources to take action, their
  families and adults need support to break down intergenerational forms of
  violence in communities.


  This reinforced BTC’s desire to bring prevention education to young people in
  the spaces where they reside.  BTC has been very successful in bringing dating
  violence prevention education to schools in Los Angeles.  However, the space
  does not allow for completely open dialog and misses out of school youth. 
  Unedited, frank conversations with young people is the key to creating
  enhanced peer prevention educational tools and awareness campaigns that reach
  spaces outside the school setting.  BTC is particularly interested in the time
  just after the school day and before young people return home.  For some young
  people that time can be extremely unpredictable.  While only a few hours that
  time may include, walking to a store to get a snack.  Stores may be bodegas,
  liquor stores, convenience stores or other shops that serve multiple purposes
  in the neighborhood.  It may include a brisk walk through either official gang
  territory or unfriendly neighborhoods.  For others it may be a direct route to
  a local neighborhood club.  This time and space is a good time to reach youth
  through The Zone.


  The Zone a mobile technology station would have TV monitors and tablets which
  would rotate media clips discussing various relationships.  Youth would be
  encouraged to view the media, talk to peer educators, take a fun engagement
  tool, and sign up for the Let’s Be Real youth group for continued information.
  Collectively the station provides a place for people to gather in public and
  open street gatherings, would provide access to free Wi-Fi and through the
  participation of a peer to peer educator and volunteers would encourage
  volunteerism and a connection point for social and emotional support.
