  We have trained more than 10,000 individual students in mindfulness. We have
  successfully maintained daily programs for which NO person is turned away for
  lack of funds. We have trained nurses, doctors, and social workers in
  mindfulness practices to deal with the dying and bereaved. We received grants
  totaling more than a half-million dollars from the Federal government to train
  clinicians at the Veterans Administration of Los Angeles to help them treat
  chronic sufferers of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and other conditions
  suffered by American veterans. We have expanded from a group of mindfulness
  practitioners meeting in a living room one night a week to full-service
  centers in three locations, and two satellite locations in the San Fernando
  Valley and South Bay. We have brought in nationally renowned speakers and held
  large public forums to educate citizens about how mindfulness can improve
  their lives.
