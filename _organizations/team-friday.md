  Our brightest achievement was our central mission at the founding of
  ARTmageddon, to redefine Carmageddon II as ARTmageddon. And it worked! We
  brought together hundreds of artists and arts organizations including LA's
  major arts organizations, and even the mayor's office joined in on the action.
  We were featured in local, national, and international press including USA
  Today, Newsweek, LA Times, NBC, Huffington Post, and dozens more, including
  neighborhood and city newspapers and newsletters from most LA District
  offices. We even noticed on Twitter and Facebook that people outside of Los
  Angeles (even in China!) were talking about "Less Car. More Art." and
  expressing their desire to be in LA for ARTmageddon weekend. enjoying
  ARTmageddon weekend. Hundreds of thousands of people encountered our simple
  idea, and many of them took the opportunity to walk, bike and metro to art
  nearby!
