  Since 2005, Los Angeles Universal Preschool (LAUP) has supported the operation
  and/or development of more than 325 preschools in Los Angeles County, touching
  the lives of more than 60,000 children through enriching curricula and
  nurturing environments aimed to best prepare children to succeed in
  kindergarten and beyond.
   
   
   LAUP is a non-profit that was initially created in 2004 by First 5 LA, our primary funder, to fund preschool for four-year-olds in Los Angeles County. First 5 LA was created by the California Children and Families First Initiative of 1998 (Proposition 10). This voter-approved initiative increased the tax on cigarettes by 50 cents per pack and dedicated the funding to early childhood education and health programs for children ages 0-5.
   
   
   
   
   
   These are some highlights of our 2011-2012 accomplishments:
   
   
   
   
   
   More than 10,000 children received quality preschool experience. 
   
   
   
   
   
   Over 975 children with special needs received a quality preschool experience.
   
   
   
   
   
   29 LAUP coaches provided one-on-one quality improvement and professional training to more than 1,752 preschool teachers.
   
   
   
   
   
   71 preschools provided obesity prevention education to 2,600 students.
   
   
   
   
   
   Over 1,000 active students and professionals were enrolled in LAUP workforce programs providing support and services for continued education towards a career in early child education.
   
   
   
   
   
   Over 1,300 parents completed advocacy training and are better prepared to actively engage as preschool advocates for their children and community.
   
   
   
   
   
   11 parents participated in meetings in Sacramento and Washington D.C. with their elected officials to advocate fot early childhood education.
   
   
   
   
   
   422 center-based and family child care providers from across Los Angeles County received career and quality coaching and 1,965 attended trainings.
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   LAUP provides a multitude of services, including:
   
   
   * Providing financial backing and a business structure for preschool providers to improve existing preschools. 
   
   
   * Coaching support and mentoring by experienced educators to enhance quality and fiscal stability among LAUP preschools, and boost the involvement of parents in their child's preschool experience. 
   
   
   * Giving parents choices about where to send their child to preschool. LAUP preschools include private, public, charter, faith-based and family home care programs. 
   
   
   * Increasing access to preschool for thousands of children in Los Angeles County by providing the operating funds needed to fill previously empty classrooms.
