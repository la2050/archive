  LA CAUSA has successfully begun to grow gardens at Humphreys Elementary and
  Eastman Elementary. These gardens have served to host mentor/mentee events and
  has engaged a number of community youth and elementary school children.
  Through the California Endowment, LA CAUSA has also helped corner stores in
  Boyle Heights change their appearance and products to offer healthier foods,
  including more fruits and vegetables. The corner stores receiving this
  attention are those surrounding poor-performing elementary schools in Boyle
  Heights. Recently, San Gabriel Conservation Core and LA CAUSA have been
  discussing a partnership to grow a community farm that would feed families in
  need of healthier food options.
