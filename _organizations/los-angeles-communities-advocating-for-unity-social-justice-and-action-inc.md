  LA CAUSA has successfully begun to grow gardens at Humphreys Elementary and
  Eastman Elementary. These gardens have served to host mentor/mentee events and
  has engaged a number of community youth and elementary school children.
  Through the California Endowment, LA CAUSA has also helped corner stores in
  Boyle Heights change their appearance and products to offer healthier foods,
  including more fruits and vegetables. The corner stores receiving this
  attention are those surrounding poor-performing elementary schools in Boyle
  Heights. Recently, San Gabriel Conservation Core and LA CAUSA have been
  discussing a partnership to grow a community farm that would feed families in
  need of healthier food options.

      LA CAUSA YouthBuild is regarded as the organization that transformed the
      perception that the lives of the youth it serves from a deficit based
      perspective (identifying the things they lack such as income, healthy
      food, education, employment) to an asset based population (passionate,
      conceptual thinkers, willing, and determined) that can overcome the
      challenges of life. Its asset based thinking model has been adopted
      nationally by YouthBuild USA and many other programs. 
       
       
       
       
       
       LA CAUSA has empowered young leaders since 2005, allowing them the opportunity to go to post secondary education, start their own non-profits, and become gainfully employed in a variety of jobs whereas, as new students in LA CAUSA they were young adults with no high school diplomas and limited job skills. We have served thousands of youth over a very limited time.
       
       
       
       
       
       The organization was recognized by former Secretary of Labor of the Western United States opening of the United We Serve initiative of volunteerism by President Obama in 2010. LA CAUSA has long focused on empowering our youth to volunteer as an Americorps designated site and countless projects to "green" East LA and build gardens and healthy eating and living opportunities. With that our organization continues to be progressive and promote challenging learning models including a mental toughness curriculum designed to prepare our youth for the world outside of our walls.
       
       
       
       
       
       More recently, LA CAUSA partnered with The California Endowment and implemented the PALOMA Project, a project that focused on researching food accessibility within East Los Angeles, specifically Boyle Heights. During this run of the program, the youth and program directors partnered with local corner store ownerâ€™s to assess the accessibility of fresh fruits and vegetables within the surrounding community, along with addressing the store owners and community economic challenges, healthy eating options and beautification projects. 
       
       
       
       
       
       LA CAUSA is recognized as one of unincorporated East Los Angeles's only youth services group. The opportunities and resources in the community are relatively limited while showing significant positive outcomes
