  Our project is a model that can be duplicated in other communities and help
  others, too. We offer proven Boys & Girls Club youth-development activities in
  affordable housing communities to kids 6-18 years of age. Programs yield
  academic success, good character & citizenship, and healthy lifestyles. What’s
  special here is that we are bringing the Club to the home community so that
  kids are directly served with programs they need, and the whole family
  benefits from using the family-centered space.

  Remember when you were a kid – some of your best friends were from your
  neighborhood. Families today tend to be scattered and busy with life, work,
  and school, with little time to connect. Our community centers provide a place
  for resident families to connect, in beautiful settings where gathering, play,
  and learning becomes a natural course of life.


  We believe that great futures start at home. This collaborative endeavor began
  nine years ago and serves as a model for other communities to adapt, by
  creating neighborhoods that inspire family love and pride, where families
  learn to live, adapt, grow and play together, and have good experiences that
  create important useful resources, and lifetime memories. 

  Our family centers include an array of free services:

  * Free, convenient neighborhood youth development center with Boys & Girls
  Clubs programs, right at home in the heart of the community.

  * Safe, secure space at home for youth to learn and play alongside their
  neighbors in an easily accessible, inspiring, enriching setting. 

  * Friendships, because some of the best friendships in childhood begin in the
  neighborhood. These kids and their families are creating friendships that will
  last a lifetime.

  * Family opportunities to share experiences and grow together. Our centers
  offer family resource workshops for parents, community celebration events, and
  after-school programs. 

  * Pride of ownership and community becomes the norm by having a
  family-centered area to gather right inside the community. Residents become
  more inclined to invest in maintaining safe, well maintained, and vibrant
  communities. 

  * The Boys & Girls Club members have opportunities to explore the world
  outside their neighborhood, with full access to the events and activities
  offered by the Boys & Girls Clubs including college tours, cultural field
  trips, and interaction with kids from surrounding communities. 

  * The community centers are managed by dedicated, caring youth development
  professionals who serve as positive role models to the Club members, with
  important information for families at their fingertips as a valuable,
  accessible resource.
