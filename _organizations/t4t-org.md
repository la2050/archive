  The music instructors and the students will evaluate our final outcome through
  pre-then-post surveys undertaken by the children involved in the making of
  instruments and the playing of those instruments. The instructors and
  engineers will also take part in the surveys and the outcomes will be
  published in open source libraries.

  Let’s create an LA LandfillHarmonics. Research confirms that music raises your
  IQ, so let’s start making music. We will gladly accept musical instruments
  from anyone who has one collecting dust. We will also work with engineers to
  create instruments out of up-cycled materials T4T has diverted from landfill.
  These instruments will inspire a cohort of students to become musically
  literate. Students who would otherwise not have an opportunity to learn a
  musical instrument or even hear a concert.
project_proposal_impact:
  - Number of children enrolled in afterschool programs
  - Number of parks with intergenerational play opportunities

  T4T.org works to inspire the next generation of Scientists, Engineers,
  Artists, and Mathematicians. We do this using manufacturers clean waste. We
  nurture environmental stewardship in this generation by helping them see that
  not everything people think of as waste is waste. Not the time we spend on
  them or the material we use to make their music come to life. We want to
  increase the brain power in these future Scientists and Engineers through
  musical engagement. 

  Music literally expands your brain. In a study of 48 preschoolers, musical
  engagement was found to increase their verbal IQ after only 20 days of music
  training. This increase was five times higher than the group that didn’t have
  the music training. Music enhances a child’s ability to plan, organize,
  strategize and solve problems. What the world needs are better problem
  solvers. 

  Our orchestra will perform in local schools and parks.
