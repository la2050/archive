      Peace Over Violence has been a leader in advocacy for victims of violence
      since the early 1970â€™s, when it established a rape crisis hotline,
      prevention training and advocacy for women who had been assaulted. In
      1976, the organization expanded the hotline to include counseling for
      victims of domestic violence. Over the years, Peace Over Violence has
      evolved beyond one-on-one intervention in sexual assaults and domestic
      abuse, toward one-by-one prevention of youth violence and child abuse,
      serving over 22,000 individuals a year. A leader in advocacy for victims
      of violence, Peace Over Violence played a major role in the
      acknowledgement of rape, battering, and stalking as crimes, changes to
      criminal procedure to respect the rights of victims, the development of
      anti-violence policies and curricula, and the training of emergency room
      and other medical personnel to recognize and intervene in cases of
      domestic violence and rape. POVâ€™s national Denim Day in LA & USA sexual
      violence prevention education campaign registered over 5 million
      participants in 2012, in all 50 states and in 117 foreign countries.
       
       
       
       
       
       In our four decades of service, survivors, volunteers and staff have identified the following consistent needs: culturally and linguistically appropriate crisis intervention services; long term therapeutic services for children exposed to and directly impacted by violence; effective primary prevention approaches that reduce risk and eliminate violence among youth and within families; and the need for comprehensive, no cost legal services to meet the unique needs of immigrant and youth survivors of domestic and sexual violence. 
       
       
       
       
       
       POV has responded to these needs through developing new, innovative programming integrating feedback and input from the target population. In 1987, we established our Deaf and Disabled Services program--the first in the nation to address deaf/disabled survivor needs--with representatives of the Deaf community who began a crisis hotline delivered via a TDD and in-person services delivered in ASL. In 1991, In Touch With Teens was conceived out of the understanding among youth that their dating relationships contained the same power/control dynamics as adult married couples; and youth acted as leaders in peer education, prevention and advocacy activities. In 2000, we established the Legal Advocacy Project, which provides free civil legal services to address survivors' family and immigration law matters. In 2008, we began to provide weekly violence prevention education groups and direct intervention services to former gang members through our ties with Homeboy Industries. In 2011, our advocacy efforts resulted in the Los Angeles Unified School District passing a Teen Dating Violence Prevention Policy for the entire school district.
