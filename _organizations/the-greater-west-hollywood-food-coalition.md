  Having been called into being as volunteers by the City of West Hollywood in
  1987, we suffered the awful realization just two years later that West
  Hollywood, as a political entity, wasn't ready to defend a group that was
  helping the homeless. We were accused of perpetuating homelessness,
  encouraging criminal behavior, despoiling the neighborhood, and destroying
  property values -- all this for serving hungry people something to eat once a
  day -- and we were effectively run out of town and into Hollywood, suddenly an
  orphan group of volunteers but with a reputation in the media for having
  fought city hall and survived. From that point forward we have only gotten
  braver, because little by little we came to know that there were a lot of
  people like us in the community who wanted to do something "good" but didn't
  know where to begin. We have since fought any number of running battles just
  to keep going -- against neighbors and neighbors' groups, against politicians
  and other "social service agencies," and, just two years ago against a company
  which sued us for creating "a public and a private nuisance." When that
  happened we were defended pro bono for eight months by a partner and four
  associates of one of the largest law firms in town, and at the end of it the
  judge in the case threw it out with prejuidice. We are now stronger and more
  effective than we have ever been, and we continue to grow stronger still. We
  serve an ever-better meal, to between 150 and 200 people every night. We have
  two or three new volunteers coming to us every day, and our ability to network
  in the community at large is nothing short of extraordinary. As far as we
  know, no other ragtag grass-roots organization formed to help the homeless has
  lasted as long as we have and attracted so much support. And yet we are still
  at the takeoff point, in that every new volunteer who means it has a new idea
  as to how we can reach deeper into the community and how we can avail
  ourselves of its strength to do more for the weakest among us.
