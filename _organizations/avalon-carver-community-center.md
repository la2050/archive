  The Mobile STEM project has helped students gain a greater level of enthusiasm
  and  positive regard towards science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
  Outcomes are measured using the California Standards Test (CST) for science, a
  pre and post assessment survey and a multilayered scientific portfolio. 


  The use of the pre and post assessment survey will assess 1) the impact of the
  program on students and teachers  2) the effectiveness of the program content
  and delivery,  3) how we can improve our teaching methods and curricula for
  future programming and 4) Students’ scientific literacy will be measured based
  on specific knowledge and understanding gained during the program. Information
  on the types of responses we receive, the quality of responses, and the amount
  of data we collect will allow us to improve the tools themselves as well as
  the overall evaluation plan.  At the end of the program, students will be able
  to demonstrate a detailed understanding of key issues using practical
  solutions to solve real-world problems.


  Each student receives a scientific portfolio, which is a multi-layered
  assessment tool that documents and showcases student work and achievements
  during the program.  Portfolios will be evaluated using a standardized rubric
  to determine how well the students have developed specific knowledge about
  STEM issues and STEM literacy.

  The Mobile STEM  project will provide twenty-six (26) one-hour and fifteen
  minute weekly scientific investigation and engineering design projects for
  students in 3rd through 5th grade. Project-based activities provide in-depth,
  kinesthetic and creative learning experiences that are hands-on and
  learner-centered. The learning experiences actively engage students in
  inquiry-based and problem-solving practices to achieve depth of core ideas in
  the disciplines of science.

  Avalon Carver’s Mobile STEM Project is an educational school based initiative
  that is designed to eliminate disparities in access to STEM education, promote
  STEM literacy, and inspire the next generation of scientist, engineers,
  innovators, and American STEM professionals.


  The Mobile STEM project helps broaden the participation of women and
  minorities in science and math related disciplines. Our goal is to make LA the
  best place to learn by 2050 by exposing more than 5,000 students a year in
  underserved communities to a high quality STEM education.


  Early exposure to STEM is essential in preparing students to face the
  challenges of a science and technology driven society. Immersing students into
  STEM education during elementary school, teaches them to become critical
  thinkers, creative problem solvers, effective communicators, and to work
  collaboratively with their peers. 


  Students who participate in the program gain the skills and abilities required
  to be competitive in the 21st century global market. STEM activities and
  workshops create experiences that inspires the next generation of innovators,
  entrepreneurs, and world changers. Most jobs of the future will require a
  basic understanding of math and science. In fact, STEM degree holders have a
  higher income even in non-STEM careers and play a key role in the sustained
  growth and stability of the local and U.S. economy. 

  In addition to providing students with a quality STEM education, the Mobile
  STEM project supports teachers and administrators. Our goal is to build a STEM
  education pipeline that will begin with our current elementary programs, and
  expand into the local middle and high schools by 2017. 

  The Mobile STEM project supports teachers and administrators by focusing on:

  -Understanding the literacy processes and the pedagogy that determines how
  students learn, what they need to understand and should be able to do to meet
  state standards

  -Raising expectations for students and encouraging creative thinking

  -Catering to the diverse needs of students from different cultural and ethnic
  backgrounds

  -Engaging students in challenging learning experiences

  -Providing professional development workshops that focuses on STEM academic
  vocabulary and effective literacy teaching across various disciplines
