  SAJE builds community leadership and power for economic justice. We believe
  that the fate of our city should be decided by those who dwell here because
  our vibrant and diverse community has been built by all of us. We belong to
  the United Neighbors in Defense Against Displacement Coalition (UNIDAD) which
  supports equitable development in South LA.
