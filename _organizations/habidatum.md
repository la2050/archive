  Expected impacts

  The strategic goal of our work is to increase the flexibility, dynamism and
  responsiveness of urban governance and planning, to enhance the efficiency of
  investments, to unveil cities’ time resources and to improve the quality of
  life through timely and adequate response to communities’ needs, values and
  attitudes. The proposed project will strongly support the public transport
  development in Los Angeles urban area and will transform the way people move
  and feel in the city.

  By using Habidatum Platform we help identify the priority public transport
  development areas. We highlight places where public transport is unavailable,
  and people have to wait or walk longer than in other locations.

  We also analyze where public transport is inefficient. In some cases, getting
  somewhere by foot is faster than using public transport. 

  Automated spatio-temporal analysis performed in our platform supports
  improvement of public transit’s reputation and quality of life in the city.

  Rationale

  LA is multifaceted megapolis which function like archipelago. To be a place to
  create and live it has to connect its part in an number of alternative ways:
  by private vehicle, public transport, pedestrian routes, WiFi. 

  LA has long been car-obsessed and now desperately needs public transportation
  network. Therefore 'bridges' of public transit and pedestrian paths have to be
  built in large quantities. It is a long iterative process, but the first thing
  we can do is to see how LA connects now, to discover where fast
  problem-solving may be implemented and what has to be connected.

  How to do it?
   
  Solution

  By using Habidatum Platform we help identify the priority public transport
  development areas. We highlight places where public transport is unavailable,
  and people have to wait or walk longer than in other locations.

  We also analyze where public transport is inefficient. In some cases, getting
  somewhere by foot is faster than using public transport. 

  Automated spatio-temporal analysis, which is performed in our platform and
  based on open data only, supports improvement of public transit’s reputation
  and the quality of life in the city. We still leave space for analysts’
  creative work producing interactive analytical visualization which sets a
  dialogue between the complex data and the transport planner.

  By playing with metadata filters, layers intersection, time and geographical
  scales, the analysts can unveil transport system’s pain-points which further
  leads to both fast problem-solving and building strategic optimization
  roadmaps.
   
  Habidatum Platform description

  Habidatum Platform is a space-time analysis tool serving the exploration of
  space use and operation through time (hourly, daily, monthly or even annual
  time intervals). The platform accumulates various types and combinations of
  data multiplying several indicators. Project deliverables may be presented in
  various formats including monitoring dashboards, research interfaces, text &
  stats reports et al. The visual interface is user-friendly and easy to
  understand. It can be fine-tuned for each project according to customer’s
  priorities.
   
  Innovative characteristics of the proposal

  •Space-time visual analysis technique to define behavioral patterns

  •Semantic analysis engine to explore people’s attitudes

  •Visualization system to support real-time interaction with data

  •Innovative metrics built by experienced urban analysts

  •Hybrid approach: machine-learning and human training
   
  Feasibility and implementation

  The platform has proven its value for urban managers and planners in 15+
  cities globally, and the scope continues to grow. It is mainly used for area
  development planning, transportation planning  and management, real estate
  property management and evaluation.

  The public transport application of the platform has been used in 5+ cities.
  Among them is the city of Pune, India, which serves to showcase the
  feasibility of the current proposal (see the video).
