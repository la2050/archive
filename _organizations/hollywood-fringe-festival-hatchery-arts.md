  Hollywood Fringe measures its success through its levels of participation from
  both artists and audience members and the breadth of diversity represented at
  the festival. The organization will measure this through number of artists
  participating, number of theatres participating, number of tickets sold,
  number of Fringe Scholarships awarded and the level of participation of those
  with diverse and/or underrepresented backgrounds.

  Hollywood Fringe seeks support for its annual June festival, which is
  currently one of the largest open-access art festivals in the country. The
  festival gives 100% of ticket sales to the performers and is supported by
  volunteers and staff who work well below market rates. The organization is
  especially looking for support of its Fringe Scholarships program, which
  provides scholarships to performers from diverse and underrepresented
  backgrounds.

  Hollywood Fringe supports the entire Los Angeles theatre community including
  actors, designers, producers, venues and patrons. During the festival,
  theatres book performances in defined slots at various times during a given
  day, allowing them to net significantly more while the producers pay
  significantly less for the space. Local businesses also benefit from the
  festival as thousands of audience members are brought to the neighborhoods
  around the theatres in June. Several establishments also take part in the
  Fringe’s Hot Spot program, where Fringe “button holders” can receive discounts
  at local restaurants and bars.


  For the June 2017 festival, Hollywood Fringe is expanding its Fringe
  Scholarships program, which was piloted during the 2016 festival. Part of this
  effort includes expanding the marketing and communication of the program, as
  well as the hiring of a social media manager to better manage Hollywood
  Fringe’s outreach across social media platforms.
