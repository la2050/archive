  <p>To date, the most important achievement of thrdPlace is our viability. 
   
   
   In one year, thrdPlace has built a web platform for its service at www.thrdPlace.com. Mobile will launch in April 2013. ThrdPlace has developed the nascent business from a startup to a platform with a global footprint of impact. And thrdPlace has achieve all of this with a limited investment...just $45K. </p><p>In January 2012, the two co-founders were accepted to startup accelerator StartEngine (www.StartEngine.com). In March 2012, thrdPlace sold its first, pilot services to Whole Foods Market. Whole Foods used thrdPlace to manage an international, workforce volunteer campaign across the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. To execute that campaign, Whole Foods identified, vetted and collaborated with over 200 Non Profits all on thrdPlace. </p><p>Since the pilot, thrdPlace has secured technology and distribution partnerships with ESRI and ADi Global. ESRI (www.ESRI.com) is global leader in geo-data mapping and visualization with $1B+ in annual revenue and 500K global clients. ESRI signed thrdPlace to its Partner Program because their clients face challenges in community outreach. ESRI is contracted to provide mapping and data analytics software to thrdPlace as well as distirbute thrdPlace to its existing clients. Similarly, ADi Global (www.ADi.com) is contracted to distribute thrdPlace to its existing clients. ADi is a global leader in supply chain and philanthropic efficiencies. Their 300K clients around the globe face the same challenges in community outreach as ESRI’s clients. ADi, therefore, integrates thrdPlace into its salesforce and distribute thrdPlace on our behalf.</p><p>Furthermore, HUB Los Angeles (www.theHUBLA.com) invited thrdPlace and its co-founders to be founding members in its membership club. HUB Los Angeles is dedicated to build the local, sustainable economy in Los Angeles and beyond. ThrdPlace and HUB are working together to certify Certified B Corporations and Benefit Corporations, display their impact on surrounding communities and invite community members to optimize their impact in LA.</p><p>April 3, 2013 thrdPlace will demo its services alongside Mayor Antonio Villarigosa as he debuts his MYLA311 App. The Mayor’s mobile application will enable Angelenos to report issues in community development like potholes, illegal trash dumping and burst downed power lines directly to City officials for repair. ThrdPlace is 1 of 7 technologies invited by HUB Los Angeles and the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce to promote emerging civic engagement tools Angelenos can use to develop their communities.</p><p>ThrdPlace has achieved a lot in a short period of time with little money. What’s more, industry leaders like StartEngine, ESRI, ADi Global, HUB Los Angeles and the LA Chamber of Commerce have all vetted thrdPlace. And all of these industry leaders promote thrdPlace due to its potential to impact community development. </p>
