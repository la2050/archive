  The most important achievement of The Learning Garden is the continual growth
  of programs and gardens it has inspired over the past ten years. With very
  little funding, The Learning Garden has demonstrated the true meaning of
  sustainability through community spirit and volunteerism. Over 250 high school
  students a year are trained in organic horticulture, and many have pursued
  careers in horticulture related fields. In our Seed to Sale program, students
  learn the process from planting to harvesting to selling at the local Farmers
  Market. Our art students regularly use the garden to draw and paint. The
  science classes are out in the compost piles learning the nitrogen and
  phosphorus cycles.
   
   
   We have inspired and supported gardens at many of our feeder schools so that garden curriculum is developing from Kindergarten thru High School. 
   
   
   The Learning Garden has one of the most extensive Chinese Medicinal gardens in the country and our local Traditional Chinese Medicine schools are trained from seed to harvest to medicinal use at our garden by world experts. Our Native Californian and Succulent gardens are works of beauty and an example for homeowner to strive for in water wise gardening. This year, our Natural Arts Garden is in the process of being installed and will be home for classes in weaving, dying, painting, all with natural fibers and dyes. Upcoming plans include simple designs for water catchment and water gardens as demonstration for homeowners to emulate. We offer classes through UCLA extension and the UC Davis Master Garden programs, as well as our own Victory Garden classes and regular gardening, tai chi, chi gong and cooking classes. The Learning Garden works with organizations such as Occupy Venice and Sivananda Yoga to make sure that all extra food goes to those in need. 
   
   
   Our community events, including the Spring Equinox Celebration, the July 4th Ice Cream Social (with ice cream made from the garden), Pesto Day (our garlic and basil whipped into a heavenly meal) and our Winter Solstice all bring together our community in celebration. We also sponsor, with Transition Mar Vista/Venice, a 100 Mile Meal, stressing the importance of eating locally. Most important, our weekly potlucks create a regular and safe place for people of all kinds to join together to share their garden foods.
