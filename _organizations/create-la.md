  Within the past year, we have been thrilled to work with a dedicated group of
  volunteers to provide free art workshops to youth in the community in various
  capacities. We have successfully engaged community members by hosting
  fundraising events in our facility, showcasing Los Angeles artists. We have
  been fortunate enough to participate in local initiatives, cosponsoring with
  American Legacy Fine Arts, Glassell Park Improvement Association, Eagle Rock
  Yacht Club, Glassell Park Elementary School, Los Feliz Arts Charter School,
  Los Angeles River School, eCALS, Saint Bernard Catholic School, Work Source
  California, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, and the City of Los Angeles. We
  have worked hard to establish a network of support consistently contributing
  time, money, and materials to our cause, including California Arts Club,
  Glassell Park Partners LLC, and The Classroom LA. We are excited about our
  upcoming collaboration with the Gang Reduction and Youth Development program
  of Los Angeles in piloting our after school program.
