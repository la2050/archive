  Common Sense is the leading independent nonprofit organization dedicated to
  helping kids thrive in a world of media and technology by providing unbiased
  information, advice, and innovative tools.
project_proposal_description: >-
  48 percent of LA's population and 65 percent of students enrolled in public
  schools are Latino. Common Sense’s free English and Spanish-language online
  resources are linguistically and culturally relevant, and can activate the
  skills and knowledge that underserved families need to play an active role in
  their kids’ media and tech lives. A grant from LA2050 will fund our Latino
  Specialist’s in-person trainings for parents and community-based
  organizations.

  Common Sense is uniquely positioned to address the needs of Latino families in
  Los Angeles. Over the last year, Common Sense began efforts to broaden our
  reach to low-income Latino families in Los Angeles. We launched a new
  destination for Spanish-speaking families, Common Sense Latino, which features
  all of our Spanish-language resources including blog posts, reviews, and
  advice content. This content development is led by specialists in
  Latino-focused communications and parent advice experts. We’ve also formed a
  Latino Advisory Council to help forge new partnerships with grassroots LA
  organizations serving Latino families. To date, we’ve established partnerships
  with key organizations such as Abriendo Puertas and EveryoneOn/ConnectHome, as
  well as with several school districts, such as Compton Unified, that are
  interested in educating Latino families about media and technology. 
   
   
   
   With support from LA 2050, we will strengthen our partnerships with these organizations as well as build relationships with additional nonprofits working with Latino families. These partnerships allow us to bring the content we are creating at the national level directly to parents locally. Specifically, we will engage in the following activities: 
   
   
   
   Facilitate parent workshops to help families understand the impact of media and how to best guide their kids - a unique opportunity for families who are not tech savvy to understand better the digital world, identify tools to support their kids goals, feel safe so they can learn. 
   
   
   
   Create new and culturally-relevant content (English and Spanish) for families, including tip sheets, recommended lists, and other parent-facing resources covering a wide range of topics including:
   
   *Helping families discover and use quality and age-appropriate media with their kids
   
   *Establishing a healthy media diet, using technology to bond with kids, and media that brings family together
   
   *Using media to support academic goals
   
   *Supporting kids in being good digital citizens and discovering new ways that technology can empower kids’ learning at home and in school
   
   
   
   Establish more partnerships with community organizations ( i.e. Para Los Ninos, First 5 LA) to disseminate our content with the families they serve.
   
   
   
   Provide in-person training to community-based educators, who will then provide workshops to families on media and technology issues
   
   
   
   Through these efforts, we will help kids build the skills they need to harness technology for learning and life - from using the internet safely and responsibly to using media and technology to optimize learning. Our award-winning Digital Citizenship program covers media balance and well being, digital footprint and identity, privacy and safety, relationships and communication, digital drama, cyberbullying and hate speech, and news and media literacy. This comprehensive work will be executed by a team of people in our LA office, supported by our national staff who are creating the programmatic resources.

  Our ultimate goal is to ensure that young people have the skills and knowledge
  to live, work, and thrive in the 21st century. Raising the next generation to
  be savvy consumers and producers of media is critical to the health of our
  city and our democracy. Over the last year, for the first time since we
  launched our Los Angeles program in 2011, we are offering curated
  Spanish-language resources and parent workshops (both directly and through a
  train-the-trainer models) to low-income, immigrant families to help them
  understand the power media and technology can have to help their children
  reach their educational goals. We want to expand the range of these in-person
  trainings to other schools and community organizations so they may help more
  Spanish-speaking families understand the impact of media on their kids and
  teach them how they can play an active role in helping their kids harness
  media and potential to its full potential. Our content is readily sharable,
  and our train-the-trainer model facilitates easy adoption in schools and
  grass-root organizations. Our interactions on the ground in underserved
  communities, in turn, influence the creation of content at a national level
  that benefits all families through our social channels and media outlets.
project_measure: >-
  Common Sense is committed to measuring the impact of our work. By the end of
  the grant period, we anticipate that we will have:
   
   
   
   Our Reach:
   
   At least 200-300 parents will have attended a parent workshop (via schools or community partners). These workshops offer a better understanding of the digital world, identify tools that support the educational goals of the family, and allow underserved parents to feel welcome in a safe environment for learning. 
   
   
   
   Partnerships will be established with at least 4-5 community-based organizations in LA who will disseminate Common Sense content.
   
   
   
   At least 100 community-based educators will be trained to provide workshops to families on media and technology issues. All participants in the train-the-trainer programs will receive recognition for being agents of changes in their community as a Common Sense Technology Champion.
   
    
   
   Our Impact:
   
   Through surveys of Los Angeles area parents:
   
   At least 90% of parents and families will report that they were either “very satisfied” or “satisfied” with Common Sense sessions 
   
   At least 90% of parents and families will report that our sessions were of “high quality” or “quality.” 
   
   At least 85% of parents and families will report that they have higher levels of confidence in helping guide their kids to be good digital citizens
   
   At least 80% of parents and families will report that they feel better educated on where they can go to access more information and support on digital tools to support learning at home
project_five_years: >-
  In five years, we hope to have grown and fostered a community of parents and
  families who can guide their children towards success in the 21st Century. We
  hope also to have learned how to best support these families, and that these
  lessons will inform content production for our national Latino resources. This
  will have been possible thanks to the support of organizations such as LA2050,
  who help us create culturally-relevant, research-based content that is
  disseminated to trusted partners (schools and nonprofits) through ongoing
  in-person trainings and consultations.
