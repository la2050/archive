  In 2013, the California Board of Education adopted the Next Generation Science
  Standards (NGSS) for K-12 public schools. Those standards were developed by 26
  lead states in collaboration with key stakeholders in science, science
  education, higher education, and industry, based upon the new Framework for
  K-12 Science Education developed by the National Academy of Sciences. NGSS
  emphasizes “three-dimensional learning”: disciplinary core ideas, crosscutting
  concepts, and science and engineering practices. NGSS aligns with Common Core
  State Standards to prepare students for college and careers. 
   
   
   
   NGSS adoption in California was critical. It had been 15 years since standards were revised, despite numerous advances in the field of science and the innovation driven economy. However, implementation has been uneven with limited teacher training. LA simply cannot be the best place to learn if our science teachers are not given the skills to prepare our students for the future of STEM. Students will not be prepared for college, careers and citizenship unless teachers set the right expectations and goals. Improved science standards will inspire students to pursue STEM in higher education and prepare them for the rigors of college, lifting our higher education completion rates and time to completion. In turn, employers can hire workers with strong science-based skills—including specific content areas but also skills such as critical thinking and inquiry-based problem solving.
   
   
   
   To address the urgent need for training, our activation is an NGSS training that includes a dynamic combination of classroom training, real-time feedback, and group collaboration. It will be rolled out to teachers in LAUSD-Local District South (includes San Pedro, Lomita, Gardena, South LA, South Central LA) and Compton USD. We will train two cohorts of 50 teachers (100 total) in two years. The program will be rolled out according to the following timeline each year:
   
   _Months 1-2:_ Teacher Selection - CISE will collaborate with superintendents and STEM coordinators to identify which schools will most benefit from training. Principals at selected schools will recommend 2-3 K-9 teachers.
   
   _Months 3-4:_ 3 Days of NGSS Classroom Training - Teachers will be trained on the conceptual and instructional shifts from the current standards. They will learn the 3 dimensions of NGSS, analyze lesson plans, and break down the new performance expectations. 
   
   _Months 5-6:_ Classroom Observations - 1) An NGSS expert and teacher will meet in advance to agree on the observation focus and review the lesson plan; 2) The NGSS expert will observe and document evidence of good teaching practices; 3) Formal feedback will be provided.
   
   _Months 7-10:_ Lesson Study Cycles - Teams of teacher trainees will engage in collaborative planning-teaching-observation of learning, followed by lesson evaluation and refinement.
   
   _Months 1-12:_ Training Evaluation and Revision - Will occur on an ongoing basis (details in #12).

  Our activation focuses on schools in LAUSD-Local District South and Compton
  USD. These districts were selected because implementation has been limited and
  because the largest achievement gaps in science among student groups are
  defined by race and income. LAUSD enrollment is 90% students of color and 80%
  are socioeconomically disadvantaged. Compton USD enrolls almost 100% students
  of color and 87% are socioeconomically disadvantaged. 
   
   
   
   We will engage directly with teacher trainees, totaling 100 over 2 years. In turn, these teachers will engage their students as they become more effective and inspiring teachers. CISE will also give our teacher trainees strategies and tools to engage parents. Examples include at a minimum keeping parents informed about the shift to NGSS and at most enlisting parents to volunteer in and outside of the classroom to help with NGSS-based science projects.
   
   
   
   CISE will enlist the 50 trainees in our current pilot and the 100 additional trainees to become NGSS experts at their schools that mentor fellow teachers. NGSS experts will provide guidance to these 150 teachers as they help their fellow teachers learn the new standards.
   
   
   
   The 150 trainees we engage will represent 50 schools averaging 1,000 students. With those trainees engaging their fellow teachers on the new standards, 50,000 students will be touched directly or indirectly by our effort. With our push to keep all parents informed at a minimum, we will touch well over 100,000 Angelenos.
project_measure: >-
  Success is defined by the impact participating teachers have on student
  learning. This will be measured based upon 1) Participant Surveys:
  Participating teachers will complete a survey at the end of each training day
  and at the end of each lesson study cycle assessing training effectiveness; 2)
  Expert Observations & Evidence: NGSS training team members (experts) will
  participate in lesson study cycle as observers and will gather evidence based
  upon an instrument used for teacher observations by the district to evaluate
  performance; 3) Expert Review of Developed NGSS Lessons: Training team experts
  will review lesson plans developed by participating teachers for the lesson
  study cycles to assess quality based upon NGSS standards; 4) Consistent
  Attendance: Tracking attendance for all components of the training (in-person
  training, lesson study cycles, etc.).
project_five_years: >-
  Our goal is to train a minimum of 3-5 teachers from each school within our
  service area who will serve as the NGSS experts at their schools and
  districts, offering their students a more engaging and inspiring STEM
  instructional experience. We expect our effort to translate into stronger
  results on the National Assessment of Education Progress in science, a
  narrowing of the achievement gap among student groups defined by
  race/ethnicity and family income, and more students enrolling and persisting
  in postsecondary STEM programs.
