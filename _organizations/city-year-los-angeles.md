  Our mission is to build democracy through citizen service, civic leadership
  and social entrepreneurship. We leverage the service of our AmeriCorps members
  to address the inequitable distribution of educational resources across Los
  Angeles, which we believe strengthens our democracy and develops civic leaders
  and social entrepreneurs.
