  Step Up is proud that since beginning Teen Empowerment Programs in 2006 we
  have worked with nearly 700 underserved teen girls. For the past three years,
  100% of Step Up seniors graduated from high school and were accepted to a
  college of their choice.
   
   
   
   
   
   In addition, after participating in Step Up:
   
   
   * 80% of students felt comfortable speaking in public, as compared to 60% before
   
   
   * 75% felt they had gained strong college and career role models
   
   
   * 80% felt they understood the college admissions process, as compared to 60% before
   
   
   * 85% felt informed about career options, as compared to 65% before
   
   
   * 90% felt they understood and felt comfortable networking professionally, as compared to 50% before
   
   
   
   
   
   Here are some stories of our girls that help bring these successes to life. 
   
   
   
   
   
   Kayla, Class of 2013: “Step Up has shaped who I am today. I’ve learned to speak my mind and become an independent woman and a leader. After graduation, I plan to go on to college and continue my journey, to try out all of the great things that the world has to offer me. I would definitely encourage other girls to join Step Up. Step Up is a family you build, and it will only make you stronger.”
   
   
   
   
   
   Yosselin, Kenyan College Class of 2015: At 10 years old, Yosselin left El Salvador to join her mother in Los Angeles and a troublesome period of her life began. She was skipping a lot of school and got involved with a gang. She turned a corner her freshman year of high school when she joined Step Up. Through Step Up, she was able to imagine a better life for herself for the first time. “My best moment with Step Up has been interviewing Jane Wurwand, founder of Dermalogica, and having been able to visit her office and see her in action, running her company. This is when I realized that school was very important and I had to get serious. In 9th grade, Step Up not only became my escape, it became my new family. It has been the influence of so many strong successful women that have kept me working hard. It has been the Step Up college tours, internships, and my Step Up mentors that have helped me envision the future I know now I am capable of achieving. Through Step Up, I discovered my passion for writing and my potential to thrive in college.”
   
   
   
   
   
   Ja’Nai, Gettysburg College Class of 2016 “By participating in Step Up they taught me all about the business world and what I needed to do to be successful in it. In addition, it taught me exactly what my working style is and helped guide me in my search of what career I may want to pursue in the future by providing me with several exceptional mentors who are successful businesswoman. Through this program I was also able to obtain an internship at The JAR Group. I want to be a writer when I get older so my internship really helps me exercise my skills, since I spend most of my time finding content and sampling copies to go along with it. The Step Up program has given me the opportunity to have a voice.”
