org_summary: "College Preparatory Curriculum: ABC co-convened the Communities for Educational Equity, a network of more than 20 organizations that mobilized thousands of parents, students, and stakeholders to advocate for LAUSD to adopt a policy that provides the A-G college preparatory curriculum to all students. The policy was adopted in 2005.\n \n \n \n \n \n Pilot Schools and Zones of Choice: In response to the poor academic outcomes produced at local schools, ABC incited and supported the District in its efforts to bring new, innovative models of learning to Mid-City, Belmont-area students. Today, these students are provided school choice through a novel program called the Belmont Zone of Choice. Incoming 9th grade students choose among 19 career-themed options housed within four campuses.\n \n \n \n \n \n Linked Learning: ABC is committed to developing high quality college and career education opportunities via the Linked Learning approach to instruction. Efforts include the successful passage of LAUSDs Linked Learning Resolution and the authoring of The Bottom-Up Approach: How Youth & Parent Organizing Strengthen Linked Learning Pathways to Both College and Career. ABC is also an evaluator for the Linked Learning Statewide Certification Review Team. \n \n \n   \n \n \n Afterschool Programs: ABC authored the report, â€œMaximizing After School Opportunities for English Learnersâ€\x9D which outlined policy recommendations for improving the academic outcomes of ELs through after school programs. As a result of the report, then Assembly member Torlakson authored AB 2178 which allows after school program operators to obtain student academic data from school districts in order to improve programming and service delivery to students and Governor Schwarzenegger signed AB 2178 into law. \n \n \n \n \n \n Donâ€™t Hold Us Back Coalition: ABC was a leading member of this partnership comprised of a group of civil rights, parent and community organizations that believe every child deserves a quality public school education that prepares them for college and 21st century careers.. Our key demands to the LAUSD and the local teachers union included lifting the cap on teacher-led school structures; providing multiple measure evaluations to teachers; and assigning teachers to schools based on student need and not \"must-place\" hiring practices. As the spokesperson for the coalition, ABC used its platform in interviews with every major LA Spanish and English language newspaper and local media outlets, to describe how together, 100 parents and community members were mobilized, 26 organizations signed on to our efforts, close to 1,000 signed our petition, and as a result LAUSD-UTLA passed the Local Schools Stabilization and Empowerment Initiative of 2011. Since the coalitionâ€™s efforts wrapped up in December 2011, ABC shared its efforts with teacher groups, community organizations, parent groups and researchers nationwide to promote the replication of this type of effort."
