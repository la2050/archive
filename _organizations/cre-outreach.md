  In the past two years, CRE Outreach has become a fixture within the Inglewood
  Unified School District serving over 100 at-risk youth with after-school
  programs, doubled our audiences for local productions, expanded our donor
  database by over 15%, and been able offer stipends to our Theatre by the Blind
  actors for the first time. Our seventh Theatre by the Blind production,
  Private Eyes, completed a successful six-week run in April 2012. An audience
  favorite, the show was prominently featured in the Los Angeles Times and other
  local publications (see attached press). In addition, we have forged a strong
  relationship with the Braille Institute and the Junior Blind of America to
  develop and execute arts-based programming in the Los Angeles area serving
  approximately 200 visually impaired participants. CRE Outreach has also become
  the parent company for Outreach Through the Arts, at the Santa Monica Music
  Center, which provides over 80 under-served youth with scholarships for
  instrument lessons and music instruction. Most recently, we have developed a
  partnership with the Veterans Affair’s New Directions program to implement
  “Heroes’ Stories” — a performing arts residency that gives a voice to our
  nations brave service members helping to honor and empower them through
  theatre.
