  Come Alive Long Beach’s goals are to 1) connect inner-city families and their
  students with inspiring and affordable creative summer programs 2) make
  lasting and effective partnerships with community organizations and artisans
  to empower and encourage healthy youth and child development 3) raise
  awareness among inner-city families about community based resources and
  support services available 4) create jobs for local artists 5) generate
  community volunteerism 


  Program success will be evaluated by the following:

  -Number of volunteers recruited, new and returning 

  -Amount of students participating from neighborhoods near the camp locations,
  new and returning

  -Amount of students registered from low-income families

  -Percent of families and/or students involved in programs offered by
  partnering organizations after camp participation

  -Student and family satisfaction of subjects offered 

  -Program satisfaction for parents, students, volunteers, instructors and
  partnering organizations

  -Number of organizations partnered

  -Percent of organizations desiring ongoing partnerships

  -Number of new organizations interested in future collaborations


  Evaluations will be collected from parents, volunteers and partnering
  organization at the close of the summer program. We will gain feedback from
  students through group and one-on-one discussions throughout the four weeks of
  camp. Feedback will be reviewed, discussed and considered for ongoing program
  assessment and enhancement.

  CALB in partnership with Light and Life Community Center and Side By Side
  Community Church will host Come Alive Creative Summer Arts Camps for a second
  year for students (ages 6-15) to learn from experienced local artisans about
  creative expression. These camps will create jobs for local artists and offer
  internships (16-25) and volunteer opportunities (16 years and older). Students
  will be mentored and families introduced to partnering organizations that
  offer ongoing support services.

  Come Alive Long Beach (CALB) makes LA the best place to connect through
  collaboration with community members to serve as mentors and artisans at
  summer camps and with community organizations who host camps, contribute
  volunteers and resources and extend support services to Come Alive Long Beach
  (CALB) families and students throughout the year. Come Alive Long Beach’s
  (CALB) approach addresses social and emotional support, rates of volunteerism
  and residential segregation. 


  Low-income families will have access to affordable, innovative summer programs
  to enrich their students, contributing towards the eight categories of assets
  required for optimum individual success and well-being: support, empowerment,
  boundaries and expectations, constructive use of time, commitment to learning,
  positive values, social competence and positive identity. Parents gain a
  support team for their youth and children when their students participate in
  CALB camps. Families gain awareness and access to year round support services
  offered by CALB’s partnering organizations that include parenting classes,
  support and recovery groups, low cost counseling and free family events. 


  For mentors and artisan, they get to intentionally engage students, bonding
  through shared experiences in classes, during meals and playing together.
  Then, the youth and kids also connect with one another as they come together
  at camp and develop friendships.


  Come Alive Long Beach (CALB)’s pilot program took place July 2016 and was made
  possible by a team of 55 volunteers from the local community and partnering
  organizations that contributed 1,123 hours to teach, mentor and help manage
  camp operations. The reputation of the camp gained momentum as a result of the
  four week camp by way of social media and word of mouth, attracting more
  volunteer sign ups and inquiries. The rates of volunteerism and community
  collaboration allowed CALB to offer a wide range of quality creative subjects,
  drawing the interest of new artisans, volunteers and potential partnering
  organizations to host a Come Alive camp in their facilities.


  CALB’s 2016 camp had mentors and artisans from around the city and surrounding
  areas of Long Beach. Together, individuals from residentially segregated areas
  are working together and taking action, giving their time, energy and talents
  to nurture vulnerable youth and kids in inner city Long Beach. CALB brings
  together all of these people from partnering organizations, volunteers,
  families and their children and it lends to cultural exchanges and meaningful
  experiences for all involved. Former camp artisan, mentors and families have
  already committed to participate at future camps, desiring to continue the
  connection among one another and with the youth and children.
