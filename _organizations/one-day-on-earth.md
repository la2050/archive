  <p>DEVELOPMENT OF THE ONE DAY ON EARTH SOCIAL NETWORK:
   
   
   In early 2010, One Day on Earth launched an online social-networking platform to organize an international community of filmmakers. The site (www.onedayonearth.org) currently hosts over 35,000 members representing every country of the world, and over 1,200 in Los Angeles County alone. Through the One Day on Earth platform participants collaborate on an annual film, as described below.</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>GLOBAL FILMING EVENTS:
   
   
   One Day on Earth has produced three annual filming events on 10.10.10, 11.11.11, and 12.12.12. These events have generated over 12,000 hours of video submissions representing every country of the world. The filming events have been adopted by NGOs and nonprofit organizations around the world as an effective means to engage talented filmmakers on local and global issues.</p>
