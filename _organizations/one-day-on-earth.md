  <p>DEVELOPMENT OF THE ONE DAY ON EARTH SOCIAL NETWORK:
   
   
   In early 2010, One Day on Earth launched an online social-networking platform to organize an international community of filmmakers. The site (www.onedayonearth.org) currently hosts over 35,000 members representing every country of the world, and over 1,200 in Los Angeles County alone. Through the One Day on Earth platform participants collaborate on an annual film, as described below.</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>GLOBAL FILMING EVENTS:
   
   
   One Day on Earth has produced three annual filming events on 10.10.10, 11.11.11, and 12.12.12. These events have generated over 12,000 hours of video submissions representing every country of the world. The filming events have been adopted by NGOs and nonprofit organizations around the world as an effective means to engage talented filmmakers on local and global issues.</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>GEO-TAGGED VIDEO ARCHIVE:
   
   
   All footage produced during One Day on Earth filming events and uploaded by participants is available to the public: archive.onedayonearth.org
   
   
   The archive is interactive and searchable by location or content-specific metadata tagged by participants upon upload. </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>FEATURE DOCUMENTARY FILMS:
   
   
   One Day on Earth has recently released a feature film cut exclusively from footage captured during the 10.10.10 filming event. This film was released theatrically and is now publicly available on home video. The 11.11.11 and 12.12.12 films are currently being edited.</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>THE WORLD'S MOST GLOBAL PREMIERE
   
   
   One Day on Earth premiered in over 160 countries on Earth Day 2012 (April 22, 2012), making it the world's most global film premiere: <http://mashable.com/2012/04/22/one-day-on-earth-premiere/></p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>NONPROFIT PARTNERSHIPS:
   
   
   One Day on Earth has developed organizational partnerships with over 100 global NGOs and nonprofit organizations around the world, and we have helped many of those organizations work towards their missions by empowering widespread media-creation in support of their cause.</p>
