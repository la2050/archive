  We will define success through the numbers of students that we are able to
  service and the increase in the number of students that complete one or more
  of our digital curriculum. We also hope to provide our alumni instructors with
  a version of this software that will allow them to provide similar services in
  their local community.

  We will development and deploy a tablet-based, fully accessible digital
  curriculum tool that allows our visually impaired instructors to effectively
  teach digital literacy skills to our blind students in one-on-one and group
  settings.
project_proposal_impact:
  - Student education pipeline
project_proposal_best_place: >-
  The demand for technology instruction, especially instruction for the visually
  impaired, is growing rapidly as the baby boomer population continues to age.
  These services are both specialized and usually very expensive. We have
  developed a technology education environment that employs visually impaired
  instructors to provide technology instruction to other visually impaired
  technology users. By providing our instructors with an accessible,
  tablet-based instruction tool our instructors will more efficiently handle
  their client load, provide more effective instruction and move their students
  through the curriculum more effectively – providing more students with this
  free, one-on-one service.
