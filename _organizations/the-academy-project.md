  TAP aims to improve outcomes for both the individual foster youth and the
  foster youth community.  Although that can take many different forms, we will
  evaluate and monitor our progress by tracking the following metrics:

  Individual: 
   Number of youth participating in TAP
  Number of youth applying to TAP

  Daily Attendance 

  Baseline metrics established via evaluations (academic, physical, mental)
  given upon joining The Co-Op and monitored throughout

  Academic proficiency and general well being

  We will conduct monthly review interviews and survey our youth and staff
  before, during and after selected milestones to measure satisfaction with
  program.  As an example:  With the guidance of The Department of Social
  Welfare at  UCLA we evaluated the success of Camp Xavier 2016 with surveys
  given to campers on the first & last day of day camp & the last day of
  sleep-away camp. 

  Community: Several studies (The Invisible Achievement Gap) have provided
  baseline metrics for LA’s foster youth. TAP will work with Partner Schools to
  establish & track key performance indicators like:  

  Student attendance

  Transfer rates to alternative schools
   Suspension & expulsion rates
  CST scores and participation

  Drop-out rates

  High school graduation rates

  College attendance rates   

  We intend to continue to work with UCLA to create and execute a thorough and
  detailed evaluation of TAP.  We intend to continue to track life outcomes (
  housing, addiction, employment) as our youth leave the system

  50% of  the 28,000 foster youth in LA end up homeless, in gangs,
  institutionalized or in jail.  Over 42% of foster youth drop out of high
  school and  only 3% graduate from college.  Starting in Grade 7, TAP will
  build an exclusive & consistent community for at-risk foster youth, building
  on the success of our summer program to include an afterschool program to
  launch in April providing the necessary support & motivation needed
  year-round.
project_proposal_impact:
  - College matriculation rates
  - District-wide graduation rates
  - Proficiency in English and Language Arts and Math
  - Student education pipeline
  - Suspension and expulsion rates
  - Truancy rates in elementary and middle schools

  TAP will make LA the best place to learn by supporting foster youth so they
  have the foundation needed to succeed in and  graduate from high school,
  college & career ready.  Many foster youth fail during middle school and
  without support, dropout of high school.  Some don’t make it to high school at
  all. TAP will provide intensive support to our youth through middle school
  with summer and afterschool programs, so they are ‘high school ready’,
  performing at or above grade level, while being emotionally & behaviourally
  prepared when matriculating into high school.  


  The Academy will pilot its afterschool program, The Co-Op in April of 2017,
  before launching full time in September of 2017, building on the continuing
  success of our summer program, Camp Xavier, extending its reach and effect. 
  Camp Xavier is a 2 week summer program held the last two weeks of July,
  focused on building trust & community within a day camp & sleep away camp.  It
  will be followed by The Co-Op, an exclusive after school program for the same
  20 foster youth, providing enrichment, remediation, & a safe place to belong. 
  Supports will continue to be available to our members throughout high school. 
  By maintaining connected services, we will support the Student Education
  Pipeline, following the youth from middle to high school and beyond. 


  Research has shown that keeping  school as the point of stability in a foster
  youth’s life, is essential in lowering dropout rates & increasing proficiency
  & interest in academics. Unfortunately, foster youth attend an average of 
  7-10  schools & can change placements 20+ times.  With the systems set up as
  silos, it is nearly impossible to guarantee a foster youth continued
  enrollment in school.  As we work to change this, TAP has taken another
  approach. TAP members are guaranteed a continuous, tuition free placement
  within The Academy Project, regardless of placement changes, through to the
  completion of high school. Because of the support & security TAP offers, youth
  can look forward to going to school and are freed to invest in their
  education, lowering truancy rates.

  Although this is a difficult promise to keep, we will do whatever it takes to
  keep our youth engaged with the group they belong to.  We will work with the
  school & foster placements as soon as an issue arises so we can prevent
  placement changes in the first place.  There will also be events & field trips
  throughout the year where transportation is provided to all of our youth,
  regardless of distance of placement.    By increasing academic proficiency &
  making high school graduation a reality for our most vulnerable population,
  suspension, expulsion and dropout rates will decrease and graduation & college
  matriculation rates will rise. The Academy Project will provide the necessary
  support & motivation to give our youth the chance to own their own narratives
  & future successes.
