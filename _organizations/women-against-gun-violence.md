      Women Against Gun Violence has been around since 1993 working to prevent
      gun violence in Los Angeles City and County. We have done this work
      through storytelling. Our Speakers Bureau members, gun violence survivors
      themselves, share their stories with students throughout Los Angeles
      Unified School District so that youth can see the actual tragedy of gun
      violence. Our Speakers Bureau members also share their stories with
      policymakers to encourage change in our gun regulations. We were included
      in Vice President Biden's meetings in January 2013 where our Speakers
      Bureau format was considered part of a national solution.
