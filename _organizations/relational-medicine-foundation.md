  Dr. Federica Raia, a complexity scientist and assistant professor in the UCLA
  Graduate School of Education and Information Studies and the UCLA David Geffen
  School of Medicine, has extensive experience evaluating the impact of
  ethnographic work and the analysis of recorded medical encounters following
  patients with their doctor encounters for two years, and she has provided a
  comprehensive framework for understanding the practice of the patient-doctor
  collaboration in high-tech modern medicine. With Dr. Mario Deng, Professor
  Raia has established the Relational Medicine Foundation. 

  To measure community level impact of using the arts to aid patients in their
  journey of healing and to educate patients about preventative measures, we
  will work with the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health to develop
  questionnaires further distributed to the community electronically. The
  questionnaires could be distributed to community members through an app
  developed to display the patients’ work.

  Based on Dr. Federica Raia's ethnographic and participatory research, the
  Relational Medicine Foundation's key activities include: patient and student
  involvement in the artistic integration of Art and Medicine to aid the process
  of healing through collaboration with innovative and well-respected arts and
  cultural institutions, and the dissemination of research results to the
  community.

  Forty years ago, it was unthinkable to live a life with an artificial heart,
  with somebody else’s heart, or with an assist heart pump. The unfathomable
  experiences of a person in interaction with the scientific and technological
  advances as experienced in advanced heart failure are novel to patients and
  their families, and unknown to health care professionals (e.g.
  http://ampersand.gseis.ucla.edu/federica-raia-book-on-relational-medicine-reveals-doctor-patient-collaboration-2/;
  http://newsroom.ucla.edu/stories/q-a:-federica-raia-and-life-with-a-new-heart
  ). For the last five years, Dr. Federica Raia conducted an ethnographic and
  participatory research study on the practice of high-tech modern medicine in
  collaboration with the advanced heart failure cardiologist Dr. Mario Deng,
  director of the UCLA Integrated Advanced Heart Failure-Mechanical
  Support-Heart Transplant Program. Based on ethnographic work and the analysis
  of recorded medical encounters following patients with their doctor encounters
  for two years, the authors provide a comprehensive framework for understanding
  the practice of high-tech modern medicine (PS More information about this book
  can be found in http://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/9065).
  What Dr. Raia discovered in her research revealed that the marvels of
  technology mandate the practice of Relational Medicine, i.e. the integration
  of body, science technology and personhood into one singular framework of
  practice and that this integration can mean the difference between life and
  death. For the thousands of heart failure patients that receive treatment at
  UCLA Reagan Medical Center, their often prolonged recovery can critically
  diminish their physical, mental and spiritual health.


  The Relational Medicine Foundation aims to launch an art intervention program
  that allows patients – through art and creative pursuits – to keep them
  optimistic through their recovery. Patients spend such long periods of time in
  the hospital due to their Heart Disease, and providing them with an
  opportunity to express their emotions creatively would be invaluable to their
  mental and physical health to ultimately decrease the Heart Failure burden. We
  hope that our project will serve as a model to other medical centers. It is in
  our vision to support future research that will advance Heart Failure
  knowledge and care.
