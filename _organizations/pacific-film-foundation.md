  Our vision is to support U.N. Sustainable Development Goals with documentary
  films and TV series. We have 15+ films, e.g., Prison Transformations (2009);
  With One Tied Hand (2016); and Pershingâ€™s Paths of Glory (2020). In
  development today is a new TV series: Female and Finally Free (anticipated
  release 2022). Our proposal integrates this series.
