  While yet to begin operations, we have engaged and raised the passion of many
  of our stakeholders such as local government offices, community organizations,
  property owners and individuals through presentations that demonstrate ImPact
  Farmâ€™s alignment with quality of life objectives ranging from jobs, health and
  environment to growing Local Economies. ImPact Farms is currently organized as
  a Delaware corporation and plans to become a California Benefit/Flexible
  Purpose corporation with the award.
   
   
   
   
   
   In addition, we have identified and are in discussion with 3 sites in South Los Angeles where we are considering for development.
