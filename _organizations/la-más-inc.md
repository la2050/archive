  <p>Farm on Wheels is a product of the partnership between LA-MÃ¡s and Mia
  Lehrer + Associates. Since its inception, the partnership between MÃ¡s and MLA
  has aimed to create sustainable communities comprised of innovative civic
  buildings, well-planned open spaces, and green infrastructure. In our combined
  efforts we employ a diverse method of research, planning, and design. All of
  our projects begin with a foundational immersive research phase, which
  uncovers new design considerations - leading to employable, innovative
  solutions.</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>In 2010 the founders of LA-MÃ¡s, Inc. conducted a three-week immersive research program in partnershipâ€¨with Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center in which we identified impediments to care for children with cerebral palsy.</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>Through this research we identified â€¨a need for hospital guidelines that prioritize the provision of spatial accommodations for children who had the greatest physical disabilities. This “Hierarchy of Needs” document served as a graphic outline for retrofitting children’s hospitals in the United States as well as internationally.</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>Mia Lehrer + Associates most important achievements have been their work on the Los Angeles River Revitalization Master Plan and Vista Hermosa Park. The Los Angeles River Revitalization Master Plan aims to transform 32 miles of concrete-lined river into public green space in the heart of one of America’s most populated cities. As a vital work of civic infrastructure, the river has the potential to integrate a divided city. Key civic leaders joined forces to fund a visionary and technical look at changing the river into a new amenity, a source of socio-economic revitalization and a crucial step towards re-greening the “City of Sprawl.”
   
   
   ML+A designed Vista Hermosa Park as an urban watershed demonstration project that accommodates community and school recreational programs, integrated with an extensive network of introduced natural features and ecosystems. Located at the edge of a dense residential zone, the park incorporates active recreation including a synthetic turf soccer field, trails, water features, a children’s adventure area and picnic areas in native habitat landscapes.</p>
