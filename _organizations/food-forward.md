  <p>Since its founding in 2009, Food Forward has engaged thousands of
  volunteers (who donated over 18,500 hours of service) in nearly 900 harvests,
  recovered a cumulative 1.37 million pounds (or 6.5 million servings) of fresh
  produce from public and private land, wholesale markets and farmers markets,
  and distributed it to over 50+ hunger relief and social service agencies in
  the greater Los Angeles region. In August 2012 we created the highly impactful
  Farmers Market Recovery program that is currently operating in five of LA's
  most robust Farmers Markets and has collected 83,535 lbs, engaged 195 farmers
  as donors and 414 Angelenos as volunteers in less than one year. </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>We are proud to say that our work has received considerable recognition. Executive Director Rick Nahmias was winner of the LA Social Venture Partners Fast Pitch Audience Award and Impact/Innovation Award in 2010; a speaker at 2011 TEDx Los Angeles at USC; recently selected as a "New Food Hero" of 2012 by Vegetarian Times Magazine and Ecocentric Blog; and in 2012 was chosen as one of two Southern California delegates to Slow Foodâ€™s bi-annual Terra Madre in Torino Italy. In 2011, Food Forward was also the youngest recipient of a Carl and Roberta Deutsch Foundation Halo Award for fostering outstanding volunteerism. Our accomplishments are also receiving increasing attention from dozens of media outlets including the Los Angeles Times, The Atlantic, Huffington Post, GOOD, KCRW, KPCC, KPFC, LA Daily News, and NPR's Marketplace.</p>
