      The Los Angeles Neighborhood Land Trust connects Angelenos by building and
      improving parks and gardens through a community-driven process.
    - >-
      The Land Trustâ€™s most important achievements to date are the creation of
      10 parks and gardens in the most underserved areas of LA, adding four
      acres of green space in 11 years. Our mission is to build healthier,
      stronger and safer neighborhoods through the creation of urban parks and
      community gardens. We are dedicated to bringing accessible, recreational
      green spaces to LAâ€™s most park-poor areas. Through grassroots
      organizing, community leadership development, and programming, we empower
      residents in low-income areas to transform their neighborhoods through
      action, involvement and ownership. This unique and highly effective
      business model delivers parks and gardens where they are needed most,
      eliminating bureaucracy and assuring long-term sustainability. Based on
      census tract data, we currently serve approximately 21,240 residents
      annually with our parks and gardens, and will add the equivalent of seven
      football fields of green space by 2015. 
       
       
       
       
       
       In 2012, we completed six projects, including: building two new parks (Fox & Laurel Park & Community Garden, set to open summer 2013); a new childrenâ€™s community garden (Mariposa-Nabi); a community garden at an existing park (Unidad); and a major remodel of another garden (MC Francis). Through a tax default process for non-profits, we were able to purchase an existing garden (Glazer) and protect it from public auction. We worked with committee members to hold 50 community meetings, 15 cleanups and 10 community-led events, and offered leadership training and educational and recreational programming. 
       
       
       
       
       
       In a general sense, our most important achievement is the creation and implementation of a unique methodology. We emphasize grassroots organizing and community involvement in the creation and management of our spaces. We work with the community to identify vacant land in low-income areas for future park and garden sites. Properties are acquired fee-simple or leased and held in perpetuity to ensure protection of the site. Outreach is performed in the surrounding Â¼ mile, mobilizing nonprofits, schools, parents, health clinics and community groups. Meetings are held to see if residents want a park and what facilities they desire. Community Organizers help residents create a park stewardship committee, identify neighborhood needs and train volunteers to spearhead planning, development and maintenance. Whether the goal is to grow fresh foods, provide after-school activities or create a place of beauty, projects fulfill community needs. Our management approach ensures long-term community involvement, proper maintenance and stewardship.
