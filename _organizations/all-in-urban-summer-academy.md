  Summer teachers implement intervention and project based curriculum to boost
  conceptual and social skills of 3rd-8th graders; engaging youth, empowering
  leaders, and supporting school year success.
project_proposal_description: >-
  After serving a homeless family in our inaugural summer we were introduced to
  the growing crisis that affects 63,000 Los Angeles youth. A new partnership
  with School on Wheels and Shields for Families Inc. is the perfect merge to
  have targeted academic and social intervention that mitigates traumas and
  supports youth affected by homelessness. This activation will secure our
  traditional summer camp and initiate our Jr. Counselor program to provide
  service opportunities for 9th-12th graders.

project_proposal_best_place: >-
  During the summer months, students not enrolled in an academically enriching
  summer program can lose up to 80% of the knowledge from the previous school
  year. This phenomenon, known as the summer slide, is more likely in
  underserved community and further perpetuates academic and social gaps across
  the country. All-In provides a six -week program to prevent the summer slide.
  With a core group of teachers dedicated to the individual success of each
  student, All-In has successfully helped 100% of our students master a language
  and math skill that they were struggling with before camp. We plan to do that
  and more with this activation! There are currently 63,000 youth in Los Angeles
  that can be classified as homeless. During the summer months there are very
  few programs that offer support, even fewer that are free. Summer engagement
  is directly related to high school reading levels, school year attendance, and
  school year academic success. Being able to have a consistent measure of
  student progress (Using School on Wheels data from the school year), we will
  be able to track the success of students who have the support of All-In and
  SOW!
project_proposal_engage: >-
  Our approach offers an innovative way to learn, to get non educators engaged
  by sharing their time, skills, and support to youth. We keep students engaged
  by meeting their specific needs, and supplementing with social enrichment that
  will foster homeless youth's curiosity beyond the reality they face.
