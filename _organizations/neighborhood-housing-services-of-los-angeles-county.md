  Our expected outcomes will make a vital difference for families and small
  businesses looking to increase access to neighborhood resources, improve
  community health, and expand sustainable economic redevelopment in Compton and
  South Los Angeles County. Annual goals include:

  - Providing financial education and affordable housing services to 750
  residents; 

  - Expanding Neighborhood Revitalization Institute  programming to engage 150
  residents with community leadership training; 

  - Improving job readiness by 20% among 100 youth through PCR and METRO CDC job
  training programs; 

  - Expanding small business growth by 25% and creating incubator programs to
  serve 10 entrepreneurs/businesses; 

  - Enhancing healthy food options and outcomes by building 35 gardens and
  providing 300 residents with healthy living education;

  - Providing job training to 120 residents. 


  Gauging the success and impact of the project will require tracking data among
  partners and service providers that utilize the facility. NHS will work with
  partners to consolidate and filter impact data of those taking courses,
  attending classes, and receiving training. Affiliated groups working through
  the Center will be asked to share all relevant statistics and deliverables
  data with NHS. NHS will serve as the central filter for evaluating the impacts
  and status of job training, homeowner education, senior and afterschool
  programming, and small business education programs.

  Utilizing the model of 'What Makes Community?' as our focus, NHS is working
  with the City of Compton, Pacific Coast Regional, and METRO CDC to create the
  first of several Centers for Sustainable Communities in Compton, CA. The
  Center will help low-to-middle income families in Compton deal with the
  impacts of divestiture by serving as a hub to provide access to housing,
  transit, employment, healthy living, and community food resources that make
  communities stronger and more resilient.

  The Center for Sustainable Communities is a diverse, multi-use 28,000 sq ft
  community facility in Compton, CA that will provide a broad range of
  critically needed services, information, and access to resources for
  underserved families living in blighted neighborhoods. The Center will serve
  thousands of low-to-moderate (LMI) income families annually in a region that
  has endured many of the worst impacts of the economic downturn and decades of
  blight. Of primary concern is how to deal with the growing challenges among
  these neighborhoods regarding chronic unemployment/underemployment, reduced
  capital access for small business development, the ongoing threat of food
  insecurity, substandard transit options, skyrocketing housing costs,
  educational disparities, and youth disengagement. 


  In response, the Center for Sustainable Communities will provide the people of
  Compton and South Los Angeles County a facility that will serve as a hub to
  build a solid foundation for creating neighborhood sustainability over the
  next decades. Specific impacts include 1) Improving the job readiness and
  overall skills base of local workforce; 2) Providing healthy living resources
  and medical clinic services to residents; 3) Reaching and training residents
  through the CSC Neighborhood Revitalization Institute; 4) Increasing access to
  business incubator services and originating loans for small business owners;
  5) Engaging  youth in on-site workforce and mentoring programs; 6) Assisting
  families through our Financial Opportunity Center; 7) Establishing community
  garden projects on the property and in surrounding neighborhoods; 8) Sharing
  educational resources through an on-site library; 9) Providing green education
  and conservation programs; 10) Promoting community safety with a Public Safety
  Drop In Site - Fire, Paramedic, Building & Safety; and 11) Creating healthy
  food options through an organic cafe. In addition to meeting crucial resource
  access needs for families, the Center will allow its partners to share
  sustainability concepts that drive planning approaches in other impacted
  communities throughout South Los Angeles and LA County.


  As the facility grows, the Center will expand to help hundreds of small
  business owners, neighborhood non-profit groups, and homeowners through
  on-site services and regional partnerships with community service groups,
  community development agencies, green organizations, health providers,
  technology professionals, schools, and municipalities. At least 50% of our
  tenants will be service-driven. By December 2016 we expect to partner with the
  adjacent Los Angeles Conservation Corps Campus to magnify our regional impact,
  collaborate to attract a wide range of volunteers for our municipal water and
  green projects, and reach out to the educational community as the Compton
  Creek Project evolves.
