  We have grown Dancescape into a well-known and respected event that our
  previous participants looked forward to every year. Our show now regularly
  features more than upwards of 175 performers representing a wide variety of
  dance companies, studios, individual choreographers, and even school
  programs. 
   
   
   
   
   
   The performance opportunities provided by Dancescape have helped emerging artists to gain representation, exposure, and experience as well as network with leading professionals in the industry. Numerous dancers have gotten jobs, joined companies, or been asked to dance in new works or projects as a direct result of Dancescape.
   
   
   
   
   
   The students who participate - whether from private dance studios or those who participate in school programs - are given the chance to watch professional dancers in an intimate setting, to perform in a state of the art facility outside of their usual environment, and interact with other students their age from different programs who specialize in styles of dance that are different from their own. They gain perspective on the role arts can play in the world at large, beyond the walls of the classroom, while simultaneously developing the discipline, responsibility, and self-esteem that comes with participating in a performance related activity.
   
   
   
   
   
   In 2007, we began working with DonorsChoose.org to identify the local arts and music education programs we wished to support. Since then, we have fully or partially funded 39 classroom proposals, mostly in high needs, high poverty schools. These programs have reached more than 6,000 students in Southern California.
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   In 2011, we officially incorporated, and were also awarded tax-exempt status.
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   This year, we are preparing for our 15th Dancescape production. The show will be moved to Club Nokia, downtown in the LA Live complex, and will be hosted by the most recent winner of “So You Think You Can Dance,” Chehon Wespi-Tschopp. We have the support of renowned choreographer Denise Leitner, the Bloc Dance Agency and numerous other dance studios and choreographers throughout Los Angeles. This will be our first Gala Event, and we could not be more excited for it!
   
   
   
   
   
   In 2013, we are taking our first steps toward a full fledged “Dancescape Ed” program. We are working with La Leadership Academy (LALA) to provide a one week of dance instruction to two different age groups during summer school. Dancescape will identify the dance instructor, cover the costs of all necessary background checks and clearance procedures, and also pay the salaries of both the dance instructor and the LALA staff member who will assist with the program. The curriculum will be developed together with the LALA faculty to determine what will be best suited to the students in attendance. We will be conducting careful evaluation of the student’s performance and participation during the program, and also solicit feedback from the LALA administration so that we can implement any necessary changes or improvements bef
