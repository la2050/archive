org_summary: "<p>Through our Healthy Community Program and performances of â€œFlowers Arenâ€™t Enoughâ€\x9D (see videos to see the show itself and interviews with the creators: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESG8SuW-6Eo & http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN75Od3hJf0 ) we have raised awareness of thousands of people in many communities globally to the importance of healthy relationships, respect, and the dire consequences of abusive relationships. If violence is left unchallenged and unchecked in the microcosm of the dating scene and the family home, then it will mushroom into larger conflicts. Without intervention, individuals caught in the cycle of abuse may be at risk for death, disability, injury, and involvement with the criminal justice system. Raising consciousness to the importance of healthy relationships its correlation to a healthy community and the responsibility that each and every one of us has to make sure our relationships and the ones around us are worthy, good and functioning, is one of our most important achievements.</p>\n \n \n  \n \n \n <p>Out of Flowers arenâ€™t Enough the educational curriculum Relationships 101 was born Relationships 101 has been implemented in the past 3 years all over Los-Angeles county, at public schools, private schools, summer camps and The LA County girls and boys probation facilities. Having an impact on young adults lives and teaching them the importance of healthy communications/relationships has lead to successful outcomes.</p>\n \n \n \n \n \n <p>Participants of the program articulate their success far better than we can:\n \n \n  \n \n \n <p>All of Relationships 101 was very interesting, but my favorite part was acting out the different situations, they put everyday life into a perspective, and showed where you can make clear choices, you can chose NOT to argue and make things worse, by using I messages, saying how you feel, I feel this, and I feel that or I donâ€™t like that, that makes me feel bad â€¦.that really helped !!!</p>\n \n \n Student -San Pedro High</p>\n \n \n  \n \n \n <p>I feel like I can handle certain situations in my relationships better than I did before. I feel better knowing that it isnâ€™t bad to stand up for yourself or do what you think is right, even if it is going against your boyfriend or girlfriend. Communication is key to a healthy relationship, we are all worthy of a healthy relationship! </p>\n \n \n Student - Verbum Dei High School</p>\n \n \n \n \n \n <p>I learned in relationships 101 that anything that happens to us in the real world looks better when we act it out. This program, helped me with a lot of frustrations. I learned to collaborate, be respectful, responsible, and ready. I am so happy I had the opportunity to realize that you need to think twice about what we really go through and how to work things out with every human being in the world. I learned how to accept things that I canâ€™t change and to change the things I can. </p>\n \n \n <p>Participant â€“LA County probation Camp Scudder for girls</p>\n \n \n \n \n \n <p>http://zev.lacounty.gov/spotlight-story/naomi-and-the-homeboys</p>"
