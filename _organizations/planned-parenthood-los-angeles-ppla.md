  PPLA strives to increase knowledge related to sexual and reproductive health
  and wellness, family planning, the key elements of healthy family
  communication, and the importance of seeking health services. Longer term, our
  goal is to make an impact on reducing the incidence of unintended pregnancy,
  STIs, and reproductive system cancers. PPLA uses a data management system, the
  Sex Education Knowledge System (SEKS), to track information on all of our
  educational and outreach programs, including the number of presentations,
  participants, educational contact hours, presenters, and presentation sites.

  Our innovative, age-appropriate, and culturally competent sexuality and health
  education programs educate and empower youth, families, and communities
  throughout Los Angeles to make healthy choices. As the largest community
  provider of classroom-based sex education and reproductive health services in
  Los Angeles, our programs forge the critical link between underserved
  populations and our health centers, increasing awareness of the need for
  medical care and knowledge of how to access services.

  PPLA sets the standard in sexual and reproductive health education. We deliver
  innovative, age-appropriate, and culturally competent sex education that
  empowers community members to make healthy choices. We partner with LAUSD to
  provide sexuality education to more students than any other organization in
  Los Angeles. Our curricula empower individuals to assert their rights within
  relationships, decrease risky behavior, and delay pregnancy.

  Our Sexuality Education Initiative takes learning beyond the classroom by
  wrapping around schools and communities. We know that learning happens outside
  the classroom, whether it is at home, after school, or in the community.
  That’s why our programs reach parents, communities, and health centers, as
  well as classrooms. Our Peer Advocates program trains youth to become active
  health ambassadors, disseminating health information and conducting outreach
  in their schools and communities to educate peers about the importance of
  preventive health care and positive behaviors. PPLA operates two school-based
  wellness centers to provide healthcare to students, and conducts parent
  education sessions so that the information students learn in the classroom is
  reinforced at home and in the community. 

  This year was a milestone for sex education legislation. California adopted AB
  329, a new law requiring all public schools to provide medically-accurate,
  comprehensive sex education. As schools work towards full compliance with the
  law, we will use our decade of experience providing training to youth-serving
  professionals to help shepherd in a new era of sex education. Using a “train
  the trainer” model allows PPLA to significantly extend our reach. By providing
  safe and inclusive school environments, medically accurate information, and
  ongoing support, we are empowering teens to make healthy decisions about their
  bodies and their futures.

  We know that the need for sex education is not limited to youth. Myths and
  misconceptions about sex and healthy relationships are just as prevalent in
  adult as it is in youth populations, which is why our Promotoras Comunitarias
  have provided education to the adult Latino population for over 20 years.
  Latina women are trained to provide reproductive health information in their
  communities. They create an effective link between communities and the health
  care system and provide culturally appropriate health education and
  information about health insurance options. 

  The Promotoras also implemented the first-ever LGBT Family Acceptance
  Curriculum tailored to the Latino community to address stigma, shame,
  discrimination, and familial abuse. Evaluations show that the program is
  making a great impact on increasing knowledge and behaviors that support the
  LGBT community. We are proud to help advance these conversations in our
  communities, PPLA works to empower everyone in Los Angeles County to advocate
  for their own health, receive the medical services they need, and make
  positive decisions.
