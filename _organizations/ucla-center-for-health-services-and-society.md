  Our organization seeks to launch an expansion of the B-RESILIENT
  texting/mobile app to promote resiliency and improve moderate to mild
  depression in Los Angeles, specifically under-resourced communities.

  UCLA Center for Health Services and Society collaborated with Healthy African
  American Families to develop B-RESILIENT, a resiliency-based mobile
  intervention for depression self-management using the Community-Partnered
  Participatory Approach to enhance mental health quality of life and to help
  improve patient engagement and outcomes for individuals living with mild to
  moderate depression. The B-RESILIENT texting intervention was born out of
  community and patient partners’ requests to increase the availability of
  coping resources used in Building Resiliency in Communities for Health
  (B-RICH)--a manualized, 7-week class led by lay health workers to introduce
  CBT concepts--that emerged as a key innovation in Community Partners in Care
  (CPIC). Consistent with tracking and building on community input and
  engagement in interventions, the present study uses the same community
  engagement approach to expand access and availability to core coping and
  symptom self-management resources as well as information on and encouragement
  to receive needed services, through a mobile platform (Chorus). Our
  B-RESILIENT intervention introduces and reinforces principles of
  Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) in order to support personal resiliency and
  reduce the risk for and impact of depressive symptoms and promote symptom
  self-management in response to multiple stressors in under-resourced
  communities of color. This app is a 30 day program where users will receive
  daily affirmations to start off their day and education on how to improve
  their mood ("boost"), reward themselves/enjoy activities ("break") and how to
  ask for support ("buddy") through interactive texts. After the 30 days, a user
  can convert to the mobile app to refer to as a guide if still needed. We then
  created a mobile web application in which participants followed-up on their
  experience with B-RESILIENT through surveys and also monitored their
  depression over one month to see the impact the B-RESILIENT app had. For this
  new iteration, we would like to expand the app to include content 7 days a
  week for one month instead of just doing the week. We would also like to make
  this app accessible to more populations in Los Angeles, especially
  under-resourced communities (ages 18 and over), in improving the mental health
  of more communities and how a person can better manage depressive symptoms. We
  would also like to add more features, such as creating professional videos to
  complement the text messages and provide more encouragement. We plan to add
  interactive features, such as fun games as a way to provide "breaks" and a
  simple distraction, daily mood ratings and tips for boosting low moods, and
  activity schedules. The previous piloting of the app made a positive impact on
  users, especially the daily affirmations and our biggest feedback was that
  users wanted more content.
project_proposal_engage: >-
  A healthier LA is a happier LA. Individuals living with depression have been
  presented with many barriers, from lack of resources, access to care
  (psychiatrists/therapists) to the cost of medications and therapy along with
  the uncertainty of their effectiveness, not to mention the time it takes to
  find the right therapist and medication. One of the biggest challenges,
  though, is fighting through the stigma and getting the support from family and
  friends to aid in the recovery. It is this challenge that makes it difficult
  to get help and treatment. We want to change this with the B-RESILIENT app. We
  have spent many years working with under-resourced communities and improving
  depression care in those communities, specifically South Los Angeles and the
  Hollywood Metro area. After the success of our Community Partners in Care
  study where we worked with over 95 agencies in the community and gained the
  trust of the community, we used this expertise in developing the B-RESILIENT
  texting app which we have piloted twice to positive results which included
  positive reinforcement for those experiencing low moods, educated clients on
  resources available for depression, provided mentorship on how to reach out to
  family and friends for support (“Do You Need a Buddy?”), and encouraged
  clients to reward themselves with pleasurable activities and breaks. We
  believe this app will continue to make an impact on more populations and
  communities in Los Angeles.
project_measure: >-
  Success will be measured through data obtained through using the App on: 1)
  number of users; 2) frequency of use and of interactions with specific
  features; 3) a measure of how people are doing on days of use; 4) a daily mood
  measure on days of use. Independent of use of the App, we will also field
  monthly brief mental wellness measures such as a three-item measure from prior
  studies (Wells et al., 2013). We will track how many users are "core" and use
  the App at least 5-6 times and how many are familiar with the App (used at
  least once) to be a resource for future needs. In addition, for the adapter
  work group, we will have more extensive measures of user feasibility,
  accessibility and effectiveness. We will also examine feasibility on first use
  of brief demographic measures that maintain confidentiality (e.g., age,
  gender, race/ethnicity) to allow review of uptake, reach, response and
  effectiveness for different demographic groups. In addition, we will track the
  number of people who visit the webpage about the overall project to understand
  basic awareness of the program.
project_five_years: >-
  In five years, our organization hopes we will be continuing our work in Los
  Angeles communities to improve mental health care and access in Los Angeles as
  well as implementing our community models across the nation as we begin
  collaborations with New York City and Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
