  The success of TiLA comes from the clients and their measurements of
  performance. Qualitative improvements (self-reports, sentiment surveys) 
  should occur as quickly as a week, while quantitative measures will be
  captured at those times the company releases its performance data. We track
  our efforts against those of our clients.

  The integrated Learning annex is spearheaded by strategist, Bryce Brown, and
  clinical neuropsychologist, Michelle Conover, Ph.D., to create high-impact
  learning experiences for companies, organizations, and institutions interested
  in getting the most of our their people. Our approach is 'people over policy',
  so we create options for executives, decision-makers, and managers that put
  human capabilities in the driver's seat. We deliver programming in-person or
  virtually.

  - Measures of cultural and global economic influence (“soft power”)

  Creating better business practices does not start with abstract concepts or
  theories; it starts with the people you have conducting your business. The
  integrated Learning Annex pulls practical insight from clinical
  neuropsychology and management consulting and develops curriculum that
  examines employee skill sets, leadership styles, and business aims. From this,
  we are able to instruct decision-makers on how to maximize the efforts of
  their people.


  As a human-centric professional learning center, TiLA places high value on
  conceptual and interpersonal skills, and looking at behavior as an extension
  of mental state. Rather than creating endless policies and ineffective process
  improvements, we empower the people themselves to explore their growth and the
  growth of their teammates.


  Our programming is delivered in-person and online after an exploratory period.
  We take the information we gather through interviews, assessments, surveys,
  and in-house data and deliver high-impact, improvement programming.


  As long as there are humans interacting for accomplishing goals, there is a
  TiLA learning experience. We work with school systems, nonprofits,
  corporations, small business, and even communities, to get an understanding of
  how their people work and collaborate. From there, we can deliver outstanding
  and insightful workshops tailored for their desired outcomes.
