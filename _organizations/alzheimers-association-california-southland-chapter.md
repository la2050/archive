  <p>Founded by concerned family caregivers in 1980 and incorporated in 1981,
  the Alzheimer’s Association, California Southland Chapter is an independent
  affiliate of the national voluntary health organization. The Alzheimer's
  Association, California Southland Chapter is a pioneer in the development of
  innovative programs and services specific to the needs of a diverse population
  effected by dementia. Access to care has been a long-term investment of effort
  by out organization. In 1992, the California Southland Chapter was the lead
  and originator of the nation’s first program serving Latinos with dementia, El
  Portal. This program received numerous national awards including the
  prestigious Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Community Health Leadership Award.
  El Portal has been replicated in numerous locations throughout the state and
  beyond. It has also been replicated in African American, Chinese, Vietnamese,
  Filipino, and Japanese communities. The Chapter’s program for Asian Americans
  with Alzheimer’s disease and their caregivers was awarded the 2006 Met Life
  Foundation/National Center for Caregiving award for innovation in education
  and Alzheimer’s disease and the 2011 Rosalynn and Arthur Gilbert Foundation’s
  Caregiving Legacy Award.</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>The challenge of delivering quality health care to people with dementia has also been addressed successfully by this chapter of the Association. These efforts have also led to national recognition. For example, a quality improvement project with Kaiser Permanente was awarded the American Society on Aging’s 2001 Award for Quality and Innovation in Managed Care and Aging. Our consumer activation project, Partnering with Your Doctor, was honored with the Archstone Foundation-American Public Health Association’s 2003 Award for Excellence in Program Innovation and adopted for national replication by the Alzheimer’s Association. It was also adopted in parts of Great Britain. The local chapter of the Alzheimer’s Association has led three statewide efforts to create and disseminate an evidence-based practice guideline that teaches primary care providers about quality post-diagnostic care for people with Alzheimer’s disease. This California Guideline for Alzheimer’s Disease Management became the stimulant for numerous quality improvement projects in health care organizations throughout California including Kaiser Permanente, Scripps Health Care, UC San Diego Health Care and SCAN Health Plan. This chapter also played a leadership role in the development of the State of California’s Alzheimer’s Disease Plan which was released in 2011.</p>
