  A global, multi-year campaign, starting in Los Angeles, to inspire and empower
  women (and girls) of every economic level to commit to investing in
  women-owned businesses and/or with a gender lens.

organization_activity: >-
  All we do is educate women globally at every socioeconomic level and age on
  WHY and HOW to invest in women-owned businesses and/or with a “gender lens”.
project_proposal_description: >-
  For the FIRST TIME, through a multi-year campaign, thousands of women in LA
  and millions around the world will be activated to invest an average of $1000.
  The impact will be billions moved into companies led by women. NOTHING like
  this has EVER happened. 80% of women's capital goes to their families &
  communities, men, 30%. This game-changing activation will change families,
  communities, the economy and the world!
project_areas:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
project_proposal_mobilize:
  - Digital organizing or activism
  - >-
    Influence individual behavior (e.g. change consumer spending or increase
    conservation activity)
  - 'Investing in women-led businesses, and growing wealth for all women'
project_proposal_best_place: >-
  Women-led businesses are significantly underfinanced. They receive less than
  3% of venture capital, 17% of angel investment, and 4% of commercial loans.
  Yet, women are starting businesses at 1.5 times the rate of men... even faster
  for women of color. Companies led by women, that have more women on their
  boards, or women as decision-makers outperform their competitors on EVERY
  measure of profitability...by 63%!



   We Are Enough's activation will create measures of cultural and global economic influence by changing women's mindsets. Women do not consider themselves investors and are passive with their investments BUT women control or influence 75% of consumer discretionary spending around the globe. After four sold-out and successful pilot events (which included surveys) in LA proved women were eager to learn how to activate their economic power, we concluded that we could reach all women in LA County. Where LA goes, so goes the country and the world... so it's the perfect place to launch and pilot our new global campaign.



   Why will this "make LA the best place to create"? LA is the most economically unequal place in the country. Women reinvest more of their capital back into their communities than men... by 50% more. If we really want our region to be the best place to create, we need to remove the inequities. This is what women will do if they have more wealth and their businesses more financial support. Our campaign will build wealth for all women and teach our girls to do the same.
project_proposal_engage: >-
  We Are Enough has its roots in LA and intends to launch and grow the global
  campaign from here. We believe in the power of locally engaged women to
  connect and support other women and girls across the country and around the
  world.



   The activation will engage Angelenos to make LA the best place to CREATE by encouraging participation in investing in women-owned businesses. This will be done through a PSA/video, social media, marketing campaign, and partners locally and around the world. The weareenough.biz website will house the investing challenge and directory of investment destinations.



   We do not replicate current initiatives and we do not provide investment advice or direct investments to individual companies. We do curate all the best options and make it easy for women to decide what’s right for them, based on their risk tolerance, level of participation, economic reality, investment amount, etc.



   Whether it’s $25, $25K or $25M, we believe there are ways to harness women’s investing power and align their investments with personal values and generate wealth... And a tangible way to impact LA women entrepreneurs, their businesses, and communities.
project_measure: >-
  We will inspire women (and girls) to commit a percentage of whatever amount of
  capital they choose - savings, 401K, shoe/purse budget, lunch money, etc over
  a multi-year period. We will track their commitments and create a great
  sharing platform to engage colleagues, friends and families.



   This will be measured in real time on the WAE site. Women will go to the site and enter their pledge. We will also encourage woke men to tell their daughters, sisters, mothers, wives to do the same.
project_five_years: >-
  We actually hope that We Are Enough will not be needed in 5 years. We hope by
  launching the campaign that we change the mindset of all women and they know
  their economic power.. and our job is done!
