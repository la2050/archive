  In 2000 we won a Best Practice award for our community organizing from the
  United Nations’ Huairou Commission. In our model, solutions to a problem are
  developed by those most affected. It places the community first and at the
  center of our work. We take a bottom up approach. We start with the
  community’s understanding of their problems and engage the community in
  addressing these issues. We organize block by block, neighborhood by
  neighborhood and bring this network together. We do this through reflection,
  action, analysis and start again with each phase bringing new information.
  Through this process community members learn to negotiate and prioritize their
  demands amongst themselves. Our organizing campaigns as identified by our
  community members include the following: preservation of healthy affordable
  housing; the right to clean water; the right to clean air; and the right to
  safe and healthy neighborhoods.
