project_measure: "Our project success will be measured by systematically tracking and utilizing qualitative and quantitative data on the impact of the Family Empowerment and Mentorship model on both the families and volunteers. Below are our major impact assessment tools and processes that we track in our SalesForce database.\n1.\tWe track the following data for volunteers: \na.\tNumber of volunteers engaged in program and attendance of alumni activities\nb.\tThe recruitment status of where participants are in the process (ie. waitlist, matched, graduated) and overall case progress \nc.\tDemographics for all volunteers (age, race, location, education)\nd.\tHow did volunteers hear about us?\ne.\tSatisfaction Surveys: We administer biannual surveys to volunteer mentors, to better understand what's working as well as opportunities for improvement.\n2.\tWe track the following data for family performance:\na.\tQualitative Data: tracks eight key areas of each family’s life, including: Internal Relationships, Financial Literacy, Adult Education, Youth Education, Health and External Relationships. Each area is scored from “Vulnerable” to “Thriving.” This Performance Measurement Matrix allows staff, mentors, and families to track progress over time. \nb.\tQuantitative Data: tracks Income (earned and entitlement), Adult Education, Youth Grades, Child ASQ Scores, Debt and Savings. This data, along with housing status is also tracked for alumni."

  Imagine LA has built an innovative Family Empowerment and Mentorship model
  that helps families exit homelessness and thrive. Our model creates a safe
  place to connect, engage, and empower people from different ethnic, cultural
  and socioeconomic backgrounds. In order to expand and work with 100 families
  in 2017, we need volunteers.

  According to polls, the largest issue currently plaguing LA is homelessness.
  Our project answers the question, “How can I personally be involved and help
  solve this issue?”


  Our Family Empowerment and Mentorship model connects volunteers and formerly
  homeless families to build relationships, and solid foundations of skills and
  knowledge. Imagine LA’s professional staff of Family Team Managers work with
  families to set goals, access private and public resources, and guides
  volunteers to offer one-on-one mentorship to each member of the family.


  Volunteer mentors receive training and are coached to provide one-on-one
  mentorship in areas such as budgeting, tutoring, career development, school
  support, wellness and more. Our model creates a safe place to connect, engage,
  and empower people from different ethnic, cultural and socioeconomic
  backgrounds.


  The connections between the families and volunteer mentors have a profound
  impact:

  * 100% of graduated families maintain housing - eliminating the cycle (and
  costs) of repeat homelessness. One episode of homelessness can the cost of
  family homelessness on society can range from $49,604 to $169,4311 per year
  (Berger Institute, 2013).

  * Parents are on career paths and are able to increase their incomes. On
  average Imagine LA families increase their earned income by 162%!  

  * Families learn positive parenting skills and are able to provide stable
  homes, which reduces the likelihood (and costs) of a child being placed in
  foster care.  One child in foster care costs nearly $30,000 annually.

  * 100% of youth participants are on track to finish high school and attend
  college or trade tech (our first family’s eldest son raised by a single mother
  graduated from Sacramento State University this past June).


  Through the support of LA2050, Imagine LA will supercharge its volunteer
  recruitment efforts through the creation of an impelling standalone video,
  volunteer mobile app, and savvy staff to execute our communications strategy.
  This will help us achieve our 2017 goal to work with 75-100 families and
  recruit, train and guide 400+ volunteers.
