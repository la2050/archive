  <p>Since our inception in 2010, CITYstage has served over 100 of LAâ€™s
  at-risk middle and high school youth with tuition-free performing arts
  instruction in the disciplines of dance, music and theatre. Our first pilot
  program at Manual Arts High School provided 25 students with free dance
  instruction and resulted in all program graduates going on to attend 4-year
  universities, as well as continuing to pursue the arts. </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>In 2012, we expanded our pilot program to include instruction in all three performing arts disciplines for 35 students at Dr. Maya Angelou Community High School. CITYstage also ensured high-quality instruction by employing working professionals in the LA performing arts community. During an Arts Discovery pilot, 25 students were taken to a variety of events including youth stand-up comedy at The Improv, Hubbard Street Dance Chicago at the Ahmanson Theatre and music and dance performances at the Colburn School. </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>Students who visited the Colburn School live in the shadow of Downtown LA, yet had never visited the cultural center of their own city â€“ less than 3 miles from home. They marveled at the sight of LAâ€™s skyline; the discipline and training required to develop the ballet dancer physique and enjoyed the opportunity to apply their newfound knowledge of classical ballet positions in their discussion of the performance.</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>In late 2012, CITYstage formed a partnership with All About Kids to serve 50 additional children who are victims of domestic violence and abuse. With this partnership, mental health support was made a new priority for CITYstage. </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>In a conscious effort to provide our youth with leadership opportunities, we have added a former graduate of the Manual Arts High CITYstage pilot program to our Board of Directors as the first Student Director. We believe that including students on our board empowers them to become the next generation of leaders and advocates of LA culture and art. The Student Director role also gives a powerful voice to our most important stakeholders â€“ our students. We can only ensure the viability of our programs and build a lasting foundation for the arts if we actively listen to and address the needs of the communities we serve. </p>
