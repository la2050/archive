org_summary: >-
  <p>Funded by The Annenberg Foundation, The Relational Center launched a pilot
  anti-bullying campaign in select LAUSD campuses last year in partnership with
  LifeWorks, a Project of the LA Gay and Lesbian Center. This campaign, called
  Get Empathy, focuses on spreading a culture of compassion in schools in our
  city, leveraging the same Community Action Network (CAN) model we are
  proposing for our LA2050 campaignâ€¦Camp reLAte. </p>
   
   
   <p>We were also recently awarded a grant from The JIB Fund to provide training and community capacity support to groups and organizations in LA working toward social justice and nonviolence for Angelenos who identify as transgender.</p>
   
   
   <p>Since 2007, The Relational Center has reached over 3,000 residents of Greater Los Angeles with a broad-based social health strategy that includes mental health care, workforce development for service providers and community organizers, social action campaigns, public dialogue facilitation and capacity building support. </p>
