  By being trained in trauma-informed practices in the classroom, teachers are
  better able to be effective and highly effective teachers. We rate corps
  members as 'effective' or 'highly effective' when they lead students to 1 and
  1.5 years of growth, respectively. Growth is determined holistically and based
  on academic achievement, personal growth, access to opportunities, and social,
  political, and cultural consciousness. This year, our goal is for 90% of corps
  members to be rated as effective and 57% as highly effective.


  We also expect to see our initiative positively affect the strength of our
  movement, which is internally measured as CSI (Corps Strength Index) and CALI
  (Corps and Alumni Learning Index). CSI is a survey that holistically measures
  different aspects of our corps culture. This data is a key indicator of our
  teachers’ likelihood to remain engaged as leaders in educational reform as
  alumni. On the other hand, CALI is a metric that measures mindsets/beliefs
  that are critical for our teachers and alumni to acquire and/or strengthen in
  order to maximize their impact as leaders in our movement. For the 2016-17
  school year, our CSI goal is 30% and CALI is 67%.


  Lastly, another critical component is surveying our students to better
  understand student-teacher relationships and teacher effectiveness in the
  classroom. In our most recent fall 2016 survey, 77% of students responded
  favorably when asked questions pertaining to their connection to their
  teacher.

  Teach For America operates in schools in low-income communities where
  students, who are more prone to trauma and high stress environments, have
  increased barriers to an excellent education. It is a central part of our
  mission to develop and mobilize quality teachers and leaders in education that
  can address educational inequity from all angles, including from a
  trauma-informed framework to transform classrooms, schools and entire school
  systems.

  There is an urgent need for trauma-informed professional development for
  teachers so they can be responsive to the needs of students in high-need
  communities. Teach For America-Los Angeles supports our teachers through
  teacher coaches, weekend workshops and seminars and most recently,
  trauma-informed practices. We believe trauma-informed and culturally
  responsive teaching lead to more effective instruction aimed at meeting the
  needs of students.


  Research consistently shows that providing high-quality and empathetic
  teachers to students and communities that need them the most can fundamentally
  address the education opportunity gap, and have a long-lasting impact on a
  child’s trajectory in school and in life. Students enrolled in low‐income
  schools are more likely to experience sustained trauma, which has short and
  long‐term implications in regards to their mental and physical well‐being and
  future success.  Studies demonstrate that chronic stress can change the
  chemical and physical structures of the brain, leading to severe challenges in
  schools.


  Recognizing the need to equip our teachers with the skills to help their
  students overcome the trauma of poverty and other systemic issues, we became
  one of the first Teach For America regions to launch our Trauma-Informed
  Teaching Initiative as a pilot in our teachers’ professional development in
  2015. On average, our first and second year teachers, who we call corps
  members, receive approximately 31 hours of individualized coaching, grounded
  in our research-based framework “Teaching As Leadership,” per year. Our
  professional development enhances our corps members’ learning by providing
  more than 92 hours of targeted professional development each year, including
  Trauma-Informed Workshops.


  Our Trauma-Informed Teaching Initiative benefits corps members and students.
  Corps members are provided with mindfulness tools of their own, such as
  knowing when and how to self-regulate their emotions and psychobiological
  responses to the stress that comes from working in high-need school
  environments. If teachers better self‐regulate their own emotional triggers,
  they will be more aware of and able to support students. This in turn allows
  teachers to apply trauma‐informed practices with their students, leading
  students to self‐regulate and attend to their own emotional needs.


  While educators cannot remove stress triggers from students’ environment, our
  trauma‐informed professional development will enable them to provide their
  students with coping mechanisms to better deal with the stress, allowing
  students to focus on learning. As part of the initiative, we also provide
  optional process groups for corps members through a Licensed Marriage and
  Family Therapist (LMFT). The initiative has led to favorable feedback from
  teachers and positive results in the classroom. Lastly, our trauma-informed
  work encourages teachers to persist and grow their craft in teaching in
  low-income communities.
