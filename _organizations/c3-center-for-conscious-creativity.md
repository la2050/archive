  In 2009 the c3 created a partnership with The Millennium Project
  www.millennium-project.org, a global futurists think tank, and the founder of
  c3 serves as the Chair of their Global Arts and Media Node. Together with the
  Millennium Project, we have present an annual STATE OF THE ARTS event since
  2010. In 2011 we co-presented the STATE OF THE ARTS with the PGA: Producers
  Guild of America and also hosted a think tank to address how arts and media
  professionals could help to address 15 global challenges through their work.
  The event was held in The Vortex Dome, a 50 foot immersive dome theater and
  was streamed globally. During the think tank several ideas were generated
  including an idea to create an educational program called MYTHIC CHALLENGES
  that would help to inspire youth to create modern day myths addressing the 15
  Global Challenges and create films about their stories. In 2012 the first
  class was launched and students from Grove Cleaveland High School Media Lab in
  Reseda collaborated with High School students in Afghanistan through the
  internet to create Mythic Challenges projects. Fantastic! Seven films were
  created by these students. To view these films visit the c3 site page and
  scroll down to the bottom of the page:

  did the students learn about mythic challenges storytelling and filmmaking
  they also learned about what a professional futurist is and does. In 2012 we
  were also awarded a $50,000 grant to produce an immersive ballet in the dome
  with a renowned 83 year old ballet dancer/choreographer. The piece, BLUE
  APPLE, was successfully premiered in September 2012 in the Vortex Dome to a
  very appreciative audience.
