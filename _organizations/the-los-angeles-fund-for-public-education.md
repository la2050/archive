  Since our inception in 2011, The LA Fund for Public Education worked with
  LAUSD to achieve several noteworthy accomplishments. In addition to School
  Fuel, we have made three significant investments in LAUSD to date.
   
   
   
   
   
   ARTS MATTER: is an unprecedented campaign to revitalize arts education in the nation’s second largest school district. The campaign has been developed to drive public awareness for the critical role of arts education in public schools. By bringing together leading contemporary artists, including Barbara Kruger and John Baldessari, as well as Los Angeles entertainment, civic, and education leaders, Arts Matter is focused on rebuilding arts education in the creative capital of the world. The Los Angeles Fund for Public Education was inspired to spearhead this initiative to address the creativity crisis existing in Los Angeles public schools. Today, only 2% of all instructional time is devoted to the arts in L.A. elementary schools. The purpose of Arts Matter is to develop a system that integrates arts instruction with traditional core subjects to dramatically increase creative thinking and learning for all students. All proceeds raised throughout Arts Matter will directly support an innovative R&D fund to develop arts integration programs in L.A. public schools. In addition to the successful awareness campaign, the fund raised over $850,000 to fund multi-year arts integration programs.
   
   
   
   
   
    ANTI-BULLYING CAMPAIGN
   
   
   Bullying is a pervasive problem in our schools with 71 percent of students report bullying as an on-going problem. Studies have linked bullying with anxiety, depression, and lower academic achievement. We realized that in order to create a safe school environment where every student feels free to pursue their dreams without the fear of harassment or intimidation, students must take personal responsibility and show courage to stop bullying when they see it. When individual students stand up to bullying, they can ignite a cultural change school-wide. Together with LAUSD, the LA Fund brought together close to 7,000 students from 49 different schools to the Nokia Theatre for a screening of the documentary “Bully” followed by a townhall discussion. The largest gathering of youth against bullying in California, the students that attended were given the inspiration to be the change agents to combat bullying on their campuses. The LA Fund will be providing anti-bullying grants to further support schools in their cultural transformation.
   
   
   
   
   
   BLENDED LEARNING: We have established three different exemplar “blended learning” programs that integrate online curriculum with traditional teacher-led classroom instruction. Our programs are pilots to create new instructional models to support LAUSD in its bold initiative to cross the digital divide for every student through the use of tablet computers. Each program leverages technology as part of a rotation model where students circulate between classroom instruction, online learn
