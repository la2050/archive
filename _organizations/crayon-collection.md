organization_activity: >-
  The Crayon Collection mission is to inspire a commitment to environmental
  consciousness and the infusion of art education in underfunded schools.
project_proposal_description: >-
  Crayon Collection wants to increase awareness among Angelenos that crayons do
  not decompose and can easily be donated to underfunded schools where kids need
  art supplies. We also work to increase arts education in schools by working
  with artists to develop projects using crayons that can be applied to Common
  Core standards. Students with access to the arts perform better in all
  subjects.

project_proposal_best_place: >-
  Our organization is based in Los Angeles and while we have activations all
  over the country, we tend to work with local artists for our Arts Education
  program. These artists develop art projects using crayons that are then
  applied to Common Core standards. Research shows that students who have access
  to art tend to do better in all subjects. These art projects are posted on our
  website and made available for any school or institution to download and apply
  to their classrooms.
project_proposal_engage: >-
  Our activation intends to engage all communities since anyone can get involved
  in collecting crayons. All you need is a container to collect them in and you
  can download a sign from our website here:
  http://crayoncollection.org/pdf/CrayonCollectionSign-2013.pdf. Participants
  can email us at info@crayoncollection.org to find a low income school to
  donate them to. 
   
   
   
   If kids want to get involved, we have a Color Kindness project where kids take the initiative to collect crayons. They then sort them into linen pouches that we provide and the kids write a kindness note to the recipient child that is included in the pouch. The Color Kindness project will create a global movement for change by kids, for kids, that spreads love and kindness while connecting children to one another.
project_measure: >-
  We can measure success by seeing an increase in requests from people who want
  to start their own crayon collection. We can also measure success with more
  people requesting Color Kindness pouches to sort their crayons into.
project_five_years: >-
  We hope to increase awareness of Crayon Collection's mission; we want to get
  more artists involved in our Arts Education program and develop more
  standard-compliant curricula for underserved schools; we want to involve more
  kids in our Color Kindness project to increase a sense of empathy and exercise
  social responsibility.
