  POPS provides support to teens so that they can effectively move through the
  challenges they experience as a result of having a justice-involved loved one.
  Through trauma-informed, arts-based programs, POPS creates a safe space where
  teens can transform stigma and shame and thrive academically, socially, and
  emotionally, now and as adults.
