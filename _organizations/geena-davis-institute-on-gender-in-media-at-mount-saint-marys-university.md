  GDIGM aims to:

  1) Provide scholarships for 50 girls to attend its quarterly salon series

  2) Educate and empower the scholarship recipients around issues of gender in
  media

  3) Inspire the recipients to pursue jobs in the entertainment industry and to
  lead their own creative endeavors, businesses, and arts establishments


  It will measure the success of the program based on: 

  - Total number of scholarship recipients 

  - Total number of industry partner mentorship opportunities offered

  - Percent of recipients who report gaining knowledge about issues of gender
  equality in media 

  - Percent of recipients interested in pursuing a career in the industry 

  - Number of recipients who go on to attain internships and jobs in the
  industry 

  - Number of recipients who go on to lead their own creative endeavors,
  businesses, and arts establishments


  The Institute will survey scholarship recipients before and after the program,
  and will conduct a follow-up survey two and five years after the program
  ends.  


  In 2017, the Institute also plans to survey leading entertainment companies to
  illustrate specific examples of how the Institute’s work has influenced a more
  gender-balanced media landscape in LA. This will include assessing changes in
  the number of females employed in the creative industries and the number of
  minority and women-owned arts businesses and arts establishments.

  The Institute’s quarterly See Jane Salon Series engages industry professionals
  and corporate influencers in discussions on achieving gender equity in media.
  This project will expand and enhance the 2017 series with scholarships for 50
  girls, ages 13-18, from across LA to join the conversation and connect with
  mentors in the industry. The program will empower girls around issues of
  gender in media, foster future female entertainment leaders, and help create a
  more gender-balanced media landscape.

  In LA County, the entertainment industry creates approximately 239,000 jobs
  yielding over $20 billion in labor income annually. However, for women in the
  industry, opportunities continue to be limited. 


  The Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media (GDIGM) has conducted over 25
  research studies on gender in media demonstrating that women are severely
  underrepresented in the field. In a recent study conducted with Google and
  USC’s Viterbi School of Engineering, the Institute found that only 17% of the
  top grossing films of 2015 featured female leads. USC’s Media, Diversity and
  Social Change Initiative found that only 31.4% of speaking characters in the
  top films of 2015 were female—and only 7% of those films’ directors were
  women. Additionally, women made up just 11% of the writers, 23% of the
  producers, and 5% of cinematographers in the top films of 2014 (Center for the
  Study of Women & Film at San Diego State University).


  GDIGM strives to make LA the best place to CREATE by increasing opportunities
  for women in the entertainment industry both on and off screen. Through
  research, education, and advocacy, it works to ensure that women have
  equitable access to employment opportunities within the industry—and that
  their voices are heard and their stories are featured.


  And it’s working: 68% of entertainment industry executives familiar with the
  Institute’s research have changed two or more projects to include more female
  characters that speak and have jobs and ambitions. GDIGM has influenced change
  in major feature films including Pixar’s Monster’s University, Sony’s Hotel
  Transylvania, and The Little Prince. 


  The Institute’s See Jane Salons are a key piece of this effort. Quarterly,
  they convene industry professionals and content creators to tackle topics
  critical to creating a gender-balanced media landscape. Recent salons have
  featured Victoria Alonso (Marvel), Nina Tassler (CBS), Gabrielle Carteris
  (SAG-AFTRA), Alex Cohen (KPCC), Wendy Calhoun (producer), Famke Janssen
  (actor), and Yara Shahidi (actor) in conversation on topics such as developing
  scripts with great roles for women, expanding the concept of diversity in
  Hollywood, and the portrayal of disability on screen.


  With support from LA2050, the Institute will enhance its 2017 salons,
  introducing 50 scholarships for young women ages 13-18 from throughout LA to
  participate in the program. The project will also leverage the Institute’s
  many industry partners, such as Google, CBS, and YouTube, among others, by
  providing scholarship recipients with access to their complementary women’s
  leadership programs, including select seminars and mentoring and internship
  opportunities. This initiative will empower girls around issues of gender
  equality in media and inspire their participation in the field, enriching the
  Institute’s efforts to create more opportunities for female employment in the
  industry, as well as female-led projects, businesses, and arts establishments.
