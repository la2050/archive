  The following metrics will be used:

  • Number of visitors participating in the play-based experiments.

  • Time spent by visitors simply playing for fun.

  • Number of local residents attending the events.

  • Number of schools participating.

  • Number of visitors asking questions about the research or future green alley
  proposal.

  • Number of visitors interacting with the researchers and their level of
  interest.

  • Number of visitors from different generations interacting with each other.

  • Usefulness of data collected by the researchers.


  Success will be measured throughout the project using our four PLAYlab pop-ups
  as benchmarks and using insights gained from one event to inform the next.
  Success will be measured not only by how many visitors attend the pop-up
  events but their level of engagement with the participatory research.


  Our ultimate measurement of success for this project will be: community and
  outside visitor attendance, active participation by attendees and solid
  responsiveness by developers and City Agencies to take these projects to the
  next level of permanence.

  Through the Green Alley PLAYlab we will temporarily transform a series of
  industrial alleys into playful public landscapes for the community. We
  envision these landscapes as labs for sensory driven experiments created by
  our collaborators who specialize in: healthcare, art, ecology and business
  development. This new model for community engagement builds momentum towards
  our ultimate goal of a green alley trail system that prioritizes human,
  ecological and economic health.
project_proposal_impact:
  - Number (and quality) of informal spaces for play
  - Number of parks with intergenerational play opportunities
  - Number of residents with easy access to a “vibrant” park
  - Perceived safety
project_proposal_best_place: >-
  Our proposal makes LA the best place to play because it recognizes the power
  of play to deepen our connection to the environment in which we live. This
  connection enriches the design potential for play in green alleys while
  serving as a replicable model for green alleys throughout Los Angeles. The
  expansion of the PLAYlab would significantly increase the number and quality
  of informal spaces for play, number of parks with intergenerational play
  opportunities, number of residents with easy access to a “vibrant” park and
  improve the perceived safety of neighborhoods.


  A series of four pop-up events to take place over the course of 2017 will
  highlight a set of alleys that IDG has identified as the future green alley
  trail system. These pop-up events provide a common testing ground for our
  transdisciplinary team of collaborators - specializing in healthcare, art,
  ecology and business development - who will develop inventive research tools
  for community engagement. Some examples include: native plant tracking
  stations, mobility challenges, wildlife counting corridors, biodiversity
  monitoring soundscapes & water donation buckets from businesses. The playful
  and sensory-inducing quality of these tools is the essential ingredient for
  optimizing intergenerational and community participation. The diverse
  composition of our collaborators enables us to target populations specific to
  the Industrial Neighborhoods inclusive of humans and wildlife. The inclusion
  of a business strategist as one of our collaborators is essential to our
  project as its sustainability depends on a business plan for long-term
  maintenance of the green alleys. The new insights gained through the PLAYlab
  will be used to inform the design and implementation of the future green alley
  system.


  As a partnership between IDG and Cal Poly Pomona Department of Landscape
  Architecture, the PLAYlab concept is about stimulating the public imagination
  about what the future green alleys could become. Unlike many typical community
  based greening proposals, this project does not follow conventional
  place-making formulas or participatory practice techniques; instead it
  embraces play as an engine for exchanging local and expert knowledge in a
  joint effort to ensure that human, ecological and economic health remain at
  the forefront at all times. 


  Building upon the committed efforts of IDG over the past two years, this
  project is grounded upon a wide network of support from business owners,
  developers, city administrators, local residents and environmental advocates.
  Cal Poly Pomona and IDG co-organized a green alley activation event this past
  summer as part the public art biennial CURRENT: LA Water. This effort serves
  as a launching pad for our current proposal. A 2050 grant will enable us to
  develop a full-blown pilot project intended to move IDG’s efforts to the next
  level by using the power of play as a strategy for invoking long awaited
  change.
