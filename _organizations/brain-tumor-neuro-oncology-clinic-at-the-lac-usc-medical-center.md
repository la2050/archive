  The multidisciplinary Neuro-Oncology program at LAC+USC is one of the few in
  all of Southern California to provide multidisciplinary care to complex brain
  tumor patients, and the only designated Los Angeles County facility to do the
  same. The establishment of this clinic has streamlined care for chronically
  ill patients with brain cancer, and the demands placed on accommodating
  patients within this clinic highlights the need for this integral service to
  the population of LA County as a whole. Over the past decade, we have treated
  thousands of patients with complex benign and malignant brain and spine tumors
  using various combinations of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, and have
  always strived to maintain the highest comparable standards with regard to
  quality of care as we have done for patients at our affiliated USC Norris
  Cancer Center (one of three National Cancer Institute-designated Cancer
  Centers in Southern California). Perhaps most importantly, we have maintained
  an open door policy in treating all-comer patients with brain cancer referred
  from dozens of hospitals all over Southern California, and have never turned a
  patient with the diagnosis of a brain tumor away based on insurance or
  socioeconomic status. We have enrolled hundreds of patients in some of the
  latest and most promising clinical trials available worldwide. Our program has
  been the major site of the Los Angeles County Cancer Surveillance Program, and
  chronicles information on all new cancer cases in LA County (approximately
  30,000 patients per year). The LA County Cancer Surveillance Program is now
  the largest contributing registry to the NCI-funded Surveillance,
  Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. Many of our Brain Tumor Center
  physicians are internationally recognized for their contributions to patient
  care and clinical-translational research, and have won numerous awards in
  recognition of their research contributions. Finally, clinician-scientists in
  our group have published numerous peer-reviewed research articles pertaining
  to novel treatments for brain tumors (such as inhaled therapies and vaccine
  trials), healthcare disparities and trends relating to brain tumors, and brain
  tumor genomics studies.
