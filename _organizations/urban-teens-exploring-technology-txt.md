       One of URBAN TxT's biggest achievements happened during the summer of 2012, when a 5-member student team launched YouPolitic.me. The students created a web-based platform which engages youth in the political discussion and educates them on candidates' platforms by creating mock elections. The site has now been live for close to 9 months and continues to grow.
