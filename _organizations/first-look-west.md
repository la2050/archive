  <p>FLoW was created in October of 2011, and the first mentorship program and
  competition took place in the spring of 2012. As a result of that first
  operational cycle, we were able to leverage limited government support from
  the DOE into a vehicle that has attracted widespread stakeholder support and
  partnerships of benefit to young entrepreneurs, the cleantech workforce and
  ultimately the economy. Some numbers from the first year of the competition
  best illustrate our organization’s achivements:</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>- The competition drew 83 teams from 34 universities throughout the west coast, including more than 20 from Southern California</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>- Young entrepreneurs developing energy from waste water treatment, robots for cleaning solar panels and solar cell films with 20% more efficiency took the top prizes at the regional finals competition.</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>- Fifteen teams continued after the competition to form new companies</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>- Four raised additional money, as much as $250,000, directly from their connection to FLoW.</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>- Jobs created: based on the first year exit survey, 23 of these early stage ventures, intended to add 1-10 jobs over the following 18 months, according to a survey. </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>- Teams from Flow have proceeded to join in regional and national business development programs, including the LA Cleantech Incubator, the Cleantech Open, and the UC Davis Green Technology Entrepreneurship Academy.</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>- The program established a dual track program embracing Business Ready and Transformational Idea Award tracks to ensure great student ideas don’t get lost for lack of support</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>- The program achieved a partnership with the Southern California utilities, who are looking for technologies and talent</p>
