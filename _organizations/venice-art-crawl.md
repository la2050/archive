title: Venice Art Crawl
org_type: Nonprofit
org_summary: >-
  The Venice Art Crawl has been around for more than two years now and has
  focused a lot of the artistic energy which Venice has historically been known
  for. For one night, weâ€™re able to turn so many shops and restaurants all
  across one of the biggest tourist attractions in Los Angles into an arts
  mecca. That has raised business in local shops by as much as 50% nightly,
  resulted in thousands of dollars in sales for local artists and reinvigorated
  the arts community. 
   
   
   
   
   
   Alternatively, SGA has worked a lot with rain barrels, designing and implementing the first and only rain barrel program of its kind through Mar Vista. There, they promoted and installed 600 rain barrels in the neighborhood, resulting in 33,000 gallons of water conserved every rainfall.
