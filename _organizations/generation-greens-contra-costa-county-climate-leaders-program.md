title: Generation Green's Contra Costa County Climate Leaders Program
org_type: Nonprofit
org_summary: >-
  Directly from our efforts, six Contra Costa cities have completed Climate
  Action Plans. Four other Cities are currently in the process of developing a
  Climate Action Plan and eight additional city agreements have been made to
  accept assistance from local environmental organizations to being the Climate
  Action Planning Process by focusing on energy-related emission reduction
  strategies. By viewing the interactive map on our website,
  http://www.cccclimateleaders.org/green-cities-map.html, you can see the
  progress of our county. Significant environmental progress is underway but,
  there is still much to be done.
   
   
   
   
   
   We have grown our newsletter network to over 700 people and have over 500 individuals on our social media outlets. 
   
   
   
   
   
   We have completed a dozen in-depth studies on environmental issues which have been used by several local cities.
   
   
   
   
   
   We have held over a dozen workshops, connected with individuals from every city in Contra Costa County and have made real strides with the majority of the cities we work with.
