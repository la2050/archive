project_measure: >-
  Success for us is about who we engage, motivate, and inspire.  


  The number of people we engage will be measured by how many page views we have
  on our project website, our movies, the number of attendees at our events, and
  the projected numbers for how many see our physical ads.  Our goal will be to
  engage 500,000 to 1,000,000 Los Angeles residents.


  The number of people we motivate will be measured by the number of contest
  entries we receive. Our goal is to have between 100 and 500 entries.


  The number of people we inspire will be measured by how many people vote on
  entries. Our goal is to have 5,000 to 40,000 votes.


  I Am LA's strategy is to keep running totals of all three of these numbers
  throughout the process.  If any of these numbers is falling short of our
  goals, we will adapt and find a solution.

  LA is not made of land, buildings, or streets. LA is made of people. It's time
  to bring them together.


  I Am LA is a platform that combines art, media, justice, and social networks
  allowing people to reach out and connect. We believe that it's not enough to
  say it ourselves. We want the people to use their creative voices to join us.


  That's why we will be sponsoring the 1-Minute Film Contest, giving $1,000
  prizes to original films that inspire people in LA to come together.


  We want films of all types: drama and comedy, personal stories, animation,
  documentaries and fiction. Just as long as they that inspire us to care about
  our community, and are one minute or less.


  We need to see bravery. We need to see kindness. When someone stands up for a
  neighbor who is different from themselves, we need to celebrate that courage.


  We want to live in a city where kids grow up feeling safe.  We want to live in
  a city that is clean and healthy. We want to live in a city where people look
  out for each other, no matter the color of their skin or what language they
  speak.


  We will focus our sights on the issues most pertinent to LA residents:


  - A healthy living environment

  - Ending discrimination

  - Police we can trust

  - Combatting abuse and sexual violence

  - Safety on our streets

  - Communities that look after each other


  We believe that by sharing our stories we can foster a safer, healthier,
  kinder city. 


  Add your voice. 

  Join the movement.
