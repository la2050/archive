  Knit Marketing's success will be measured both in terms of economics and
  social impact. The financial health of the company will be measured by number
  of new and repeat clients quarterly and annually. 


  The social impact will be measured by the following:

  -Number of students who complete a 12-week internship

  -Number of youth employees that work with Knit Marketing for one year or more

  -Number of students who get accepted to college

  -Number of students who complete college with mentoring from KM

  -Number of students who go on to sustainable careers

  Knit Marketing has been in operation since June 2016. We have hired two
  interns from View Park High School and are consistently managing social media
  accounts for 2 monthly clients and supporting 2 additional small business
  clients with short term projects. Knit Marketing is expanding and aims to
  create a sustainable business that will be able to hire and train at least 6
  youth employees this year, and double the number of employees each year
  thereafter.
project_proposal_impact:
  - College matriculation rates
  - District-wide graduation rates
  - Student education pipeline
  - Youth unemployment and underemployment

  Knit Marketing serves 16-22 year-olds living in marginalized neighborhoods in
  Los Angeles by providing jobs and skills training, addressing the fundamental
  issue of the need for quality jobs and/or skills training available to young
  people in low-income areas. We help beneficiaries finish high school, apply
  for college and/or jobs, and train for participation in professional meetings
  and presentations. 


  To provide mentoring and job opportunities, KM offers unmatched digital
  marketing services to customers looking to reach a teen market. Our team
  produces & manages content on all social platforms and offers a youth
  perspective direct from the source. 


  Our interns are developing technical skills not previously made available.
  They are learning how to speak in front of groups, communicate with clients,
  deliver consistent quality service, and use this job on their resumes to help
  with future opportunities. Clients and colleagues have commented on our
  interns' professionalism and how they can see apparent growth even in the
  first few months. By providing access to quality jobs, KM is bettering the
  community at large and future generations.


  Furthermore, through our research, we have found that students involved in
  similar technical training organizations have a higher high school completion
  rate and are more likely to be involved in additional extra curricular
  activities. In other words, giving students a job opportunity like this gives
  them faith that there is a better future for them, and inspires them to finish
  high school and apply to college and/or future jobs.
