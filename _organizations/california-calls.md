org_summary: "California Calls is a statewide alliance of community-based organizations working to win systemic public policy reforms to achieve progressive taxation, stable funding for public services, government responsiveness to community needs, and high-road economic growth. With 31 community groups organized in 11 strategic counties, California Calls is mounting a long-term, ambitious civic engagement program to build a powerful base of voters in low-income and immigrant communities of color, with a special focus on educating and turning out new, occasional and young voters.\n \n \n \n \n \n California Calls member organizations work on many issues: health and human services, education, immigrantâ€™s rights, environmental justice, housing, jobs, living wages. In addition to the electoral mobilization program, the member organizations employ a broad range of strategies to advance their work: grassroots community organizing, leadership development, policy research, direct action, legislative advocacy, and public policy campaigns. \n \n \n \n \n \n The long-term goal of California Calls is to develop a bottom-up statewide alliance of organizations with the power to turn out 500,000 supporters of progressive tax and fiscal reforms who normally do not participate in elections. In addition, California Calls actively works to build collaborations with other statewide organizations who share the same vision of renewing the â€œCalifornia Dreamâ€\x9D wherein the state can offer a world class public education system, a vital social safety net, and a modern public infrastructure to support dynamic and sustainable economic growth.\n \n \n \n \n \n Since 2009, California Calls has identified more than 574,000 unlikely voters in 11 counties across the state who express support for progressive tax and budget policies. In November 2012, the California Calls Action Fund supported Proposition 30 (see video), a ballot measure which has already generated over $6 billion annually for Californiaâ€™s K-12 schools and the UC/CSU higher education systems. Through a massive â€œground gameâ€\x9D of get-out-the-vote activities, California Calls contacted 293,613 voters, of which 80% made it to the polls! This compared with average statewide voter turnout of only 71%. These voters represented a crucial margin of victory, providing over 3% of the statewide vote total for new funding for education, social service and public safety programs. \n \n \n \n \n \n Key groups of historically under-represented constituencies voted at even higher margins: \n \n \n \n \n \n â€¢ Among young voters age 25 to 34, California Calls supporters voted at a rate of 72% compared to the statewide average of only 57%--a 15% point increase!\n \n \n â€¢African-American voters identified by California Calls as supporters participated at a rate of 85%, compared to 67% of African-American voters statewideâ€”an 18% point increase! \n \n \n â€¢Immigrant voters identified by California Calls as supporters participated at an average rate of 81%, compared to a statewide average of 68%--a 13% point increase"
