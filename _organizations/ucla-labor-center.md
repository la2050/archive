  In the last several years, the UCLA Labor Center has emerged as a national
  resource for undocumented immigrant students and immigrant youth leadership
  development. The Labor Center has conducted research on immigrant youth,
  actively promoted their civic engagement, taught the first courses in the
  country on undocumented students, and published two nationally acclaimed books
  written by and about undocumented students. The first, Underground Undergrads:
  UCLA Undocumented Immigrant Students Speak Out is currently in its fourth
  printing and has sold more than ten thousand copies. The second, Undocumented
  and Unafraid: Tam Tran, Cinthya Felix, and the Immigrant Youth Movement, is
  being promoted as part of a national book tour during the 2012â€”2013 academic
  school year. To drive activities in this area, the Labor Center established
  the Dream Resource Center, a project to promote equal access to education by
  developing educational resources, support, and leadership development for
  immigrant students across the country. 
   
   
   
   
   
   The Labor Center engages in other activities to address the needs of undocumented immigrant youth, including hosting Dream Summer, the first national internship program for undocumented students. This program has placed 250 students and awarded a total of $1.25 million for interns to continue their education. Through Dream Summer, interns learn skills and build the capacity of host organizations focused on specific issues or campaigns such as health and health care access, civic engagement, education, youth leadership, and LGBTQ issues. 
   
   
   
   
   
   Both Dream Summer and the Undocumented and Unafraid book publication and tour have been models for developing online resources that have connected with thousands of undocumented immigrant students throughout the country who are in need of basic information. These activities are just two among several at the Dream Resource Center that have served to create an online and in-person support network to give undocumented students the encouragement they need to pursue their dreams.
