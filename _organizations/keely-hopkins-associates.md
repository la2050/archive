  Youth 4C is a new project launched in 2013 by two young Los Angeles
  entrepreneurs. Having both grown up outside of Los Angeles, both Keely Hopkins
  and Samuel Alleyne noticed the lack of social connectedness and civic
  engagement among youth in L.A. , particularly among underserved communities.
  As a response to this, Keely Hopkins and Samuel Alleyne launched Youth 4C, a
  new initiative aimed at increasing leadership, advocacy, and volunteerism
  among youth. Instead of just focusing on preparing youth as the next
  generation of leaders, Youth 4C recognizes youth as the leaders of today that
  are capable of advocating and organizing for change in their communities.

   Youth 4C is a dynamic and rapidly growing initiative that already has two projects underway in the first few months of launching. Youth 4C has developed an entrepreneur curriculum for children aged 7-15 that will be implemented this summer at Los Angeles City College. Youth 4C has also partnered with the College of the Bahamas to develop and lead an international youth summit that will bring together youth from urban and rural areas to tackle top issues affecting their futures.

   Prior to launching Youth 4C, Keely Hopkins and Samuel Alleyne both came from non-profit and government relations backgrounds. Keely Hopkins, a government relations attorney and development specialist, has led statewide political campaigns, advocated on behalf of non-profits before state legislatures, and has led youth advocacy trainings in South Los Angeles. Samuel Alleyne, who specializes in project management and development strategy, comes from an extensive background in youth leadership and engagement. Samuel has served as a project coordinator the California Department of Public Health, has organized and led international youth campaigns, and has taught youth leadership and entrepreneurial classes at CSU and LACC.
