  dollars to support transportation investments that strengthen the Los Angeles
  region.

  We envision a Los Angeles transportation system that intentionally connects
  the travel needs of women and mothers with policymakers’ planning, funding,
  and decisions. Our activation will combine new data, new voices, and new faces
  of transportation advocacy to influence policy and investments for a
  transportation system that serves and strengthens our entire region.

  Everyone needs to get somewhere. We need to get to work, to school, to soccer
  games, to get food, everyday. In Los Angeles this is often easier said than
  done, particularly if your trips are invisible.



   Only 16 percent of daily trips are for work, yet nearly all of Los Angeles’ transportation efforts go into improving travel for commuters. So what is happening for the other 84 percent of trips?



   While we increasingly see women in the workforce, we still see traditional gender splits in different-sex parental households. Women tend to remain the primary caregivers, including making trips for school/child care, appointments, activities, and household errands.



   Our LA2050 activation will daylight these trips, faces, and voices.



   Transportation connects Angelenos with opportunity. But at its worst can prevent them from accessing resources and networks. Our activation will employ a multi-pronged strategy to ensure that women and mothers are not forgotten as we look to expand how our transportation network connects us.



   Data and groundtruthing: Analyze national and regional travel data to analyze patterns we see in women workers, caregivers, and mothers. Preliminary findings will be shared with community organizations and members to identify alignment with their lived experiences.



   Storytelling: Work with community organizations and local media to develop and distribute multilingual, multimedia stories of women’s daily needs and how transportation impacts them. This process will also teach women how to utilize film and photo to tell their own stories.



   Education and advocacy: Host online and in-person advocacy trainings to co-power community members to advocate for their own transportation needs. Groundtruthed data and stories from the first two strategies will be used to message the unaddressed needs of women with transportation policymakers at these trainings.



   We propose to utilize metrics recommended by LA2050 and our own suggested metrics we believe will measure successful impact of our activation:



   Government responsiveness to residents’ needs (LA2050): Data-driven advocacy and humanizing stories will be used to influence regional transportation policy and funding decisions.



   Transit-accessible housing and employment (LA2050): Transit improvements that serve both work and non-work trips will increase the connection between public transportation and daily origins and destinations.



   Advocacy capacity (suggested): Individuals exposed to technical assistance in advocacy tactics and storytelling development, through both online and offline platforms. Includes, but not limited to, neighborhood councils (LA2050).



   Transportation funding allocated based on non-work trip data (suggested): Formulas or metrics adopted in Metro countywide policy and funding frameworks that account for both work and non-work trips based on our data analysis and advocacy.
project_proposal_engage: >-
  Investing in Place convenes diverse stakeholders to discuss transportation
  policy and investment issues through a range of event types. The advocacy
  component of our LA2050 activation would mirror our successful City of Los
  Angeles Tripping Point summits, which bring together local elected officials
  and public agency staff with over 100 community members and organizations to
  help demystify the City process and amplify the voices of community members to
  the public officials who serve them.



   Our online engagement will anchor around digital education and storytelling formats to be distributed through our network of policymakers, published and social media, researchers, funders, and community organizations.



   We will directly engage with hundreds of community members through our policy education, advocacy technical assistance, and storytelling training. We anticipate an echoing reach from their online and offline networks, such as neighborhood councils and clubs, parent associations, faith-based and cultural affiliations, local businesses and artists, etc. We also anticipate our policy education and groundtruthed data to reach elected officials and bring awareness to thousands of their constituents around new data as well as engagement opportunities for policy advocacy.

  For our multi-pronged strategy to be considered successful, we will consider:



   Has data analysis included input and “reality checks” from community members and grassroots organizations? Our goal is to engage at least 250 surveys and event participants to develop data analysis that aligns with community members’ lived experience.



   Are stories emerging from this activation reflecting the transportation needs of women and mothers? Our goal is to support development and distribution of at least 20 multimedia stories, reaching a total of 80,000 people over two years.



   Are we increasing Angelenos informed of and engaged in their civic process? Our goal is to reach a total of 25,000 people through policy education and advocacy training over two years.



   Has the activation influenced regional transportation decisions? Our goal is to facilitate formulas or metrics adopted in Metro countywide policy and funding frameworks that serve the needs of the region’s five million women, based on our analysis and advocacy.



   Has activation influenced accessibility of transit trips? Our goal is to include travel needs of women into Metro’s transit investments, particularly the NextGen Bus Study redesign, which will impact transit accessibility for approximately 10 million Angelenos.

  We imagine a Greater Los Angeles where we bridge the gap between policy
  thinkers, decision makers, and on-the-ground community leaders to reduce
  social inequities through public policies and investments. By investing in our
  most vulnerable neighborhoods, we improve public health and exceed
  environmental goals for the whole region. We recognize that equity is not a
  special interest, but in everybody’s interest.
