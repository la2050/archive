project_proposal_description: >-
  We seek to ignite true innovation within Los Angeles County's foster care
  system, the largest child welfare system in the nation, through a radically
  different approach to improve public awareness and civic engagement. This will
  be accomplished with the expansion of our successful multi-media outreach
  campaigns, strategic collaborations in the development and roll-out of a new
  Customer Relationship Management technology system, and the application of
  best business practices and principles.

  RaiseAChild’s pioneering multi-media recruitment campaigns have been steadily
  growing. With last year’s state-of-the-art events generating well over
  1,750,000 impressions and directly reaching thousands of people, we anticipate
  successfully connecting with more than 100,000 Angelenos over the next two
  years and mobilizing them for the greater good of children in foster care.
  Through Activate L.A., we plan to expand by 50% the scope of these events and
  continue to create, produce, and manage unique outreach campaigns that promote
  family building to a broad spectrum of prospective families. Using radio,
  television, digital media, social media, and street-light banners, campaigns
  will be scheduled twice a year throughout Los Angeles. The spring campaign
  will coincide with National Foster Care Month, Mother's Day, Father's Day, and
  Gay Pride Month and the fall/winter campaign will take place during National
  Adoption Month and the holiday season. Each will prominently feature the
  LA2050 name on all related materials and its logo on 100 % of the street-light
  banners. Our innovative Parent Advocate Program, which combines the attention
  of a mentor with the technological support of a cloud-based case management
  system, will also expand to track and facilitate the progress of all
  identified prospective parents. Inspired by our participation in the 2017
  #HackFosterCareLA event (to engage the technology sector in improving the
  lives of children and families involved with the foster care system), we will
  also embark on a unique retention collaboration designed to improved methods
  of communication and support services to thousands of prospective and current
  parents. By simultaneously developing and implementing this technology, we
  will have the capacity to incorporate this additional flow of prospective
  parents into our database, and also more effectively and efficiently meet
  their needs to assure their retention.
project_proposal_engage: >-
  Our sensational outreach campaigns will feature compelling messaging in
  English and Spanish about the dire need for loving homes for foster children.
  Building on our success of inclusivity, these messages will continue to target
  both the LBGTQ and heterosexual communities, along with further expansion into
  the Spanish language speaking neighborhoods throughout the city, representing
  approximately 48% of L.A.’s population. Additional bi-lingual staff will
  enable RaiseAChild to make additional inroads into the Hispanic community. We
  also plan to expand discussions with several inclusive and welcoming
  faith-based organizations to further engage Angelenos and promote our mission.
  Fostering and adoption are slow processes, but our goal is to motivate and
  engage 100,000 Angelenos through social media, targeted outreach campaigns and
  solid business practice technology, to help to solve the foster care crisis in
  Los Angeles.
project_measure: >-
  Our technical partners and staff will closely monitor and track the number of
  prospective parents who come to us through campaigns, events, websites, word
  of mouth, etc. and the number of prospects who have begun the necessary
  orientation, training and certification steps -- or where they are in the
  process. Using the newly-created best practice business technology, we will be
  able to further customize each subsequent interaction. Analyzing information
  from the existing pool of possible resource parents will allow us to identify
  the best current prospects and allocate staff resources strategically to
  maximize returns. As the survey and messaging results are obtained, collected,
  and aggregated, the information will afford staff greater efficiencies in
  managing its thousands of prospective parents and enable them to provide more
  effective one on one attention. By using this information to proactively make
  system-wide improvements aimed at preventing drop-out, we will be able to
  increase and improve our retention success rates for potential parents who in
  turn will ultimately be able to positively impact the safety and well-being of
  the children in their care.
project_five_years: >-
  RaiseAChild has a program that has been tested and proven unlike any in the
  country, which provides measured and ongoing support and guidance to all its
  prospective parents as they navigate the foster/adoption process. Since our
  inception, we have slowly introduced innovation and groundbreaking approaches
  into the child welfare system and are now beginning to see the positive
  results of our efforts. In five years, we hope to see the system completely
  overhauled and the process for fostering and adoption taking half the time for
  prospective parents to be vetted. We anticipate increasing our retention rates
  by an additional 40%, and the foster care crisis, now fueled in part by the
  opioid epidemic and new federal policies on immigration, be significantly
  diminished. Ultimately, we look forward to finding forever homes for 15,000
  children who are the innocent victims as there is a severe shortage of foster
  homes in L.A. When we look at today’s children, we see tomorrow’s leaders, but
  for foster children to thrive in Los Angeles, we must engage Angelenos to help
  support their development, help build them loving families and promote public
  policies that work for both. In order for communities to come together
  cohesively to create a prosperous Los Angeles by 2050, we must invest in these
  children now.
