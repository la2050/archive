  The Larchmont Social Justice Alliance gives kids a platform to speak up for
  social justice and learn about the spoken word, activism, connections, youth
  politics, literature, history, and policy.
project_proposal_description: >-
  We will launch a way for ALL KIDS in Los Angeles to join a movement for social
  justice. We live in an unequal society and we see it on our streets every day.
  We walk over homeless people to get to school. We know too many of our
  classmates are hungry. As a group, we can change the forces that keep
  low-income students trapped in poverty and activate citizens for life. We, the
  kids, will build up our community, and Larchmont Social Justice Youth Alliance
  will collect our voices and set them free.

  As the world has seen, high school students in Parkland, Florida, have made
  their community, and the world, a better place. Florida is notoriously
  gun-friendly place, yet the students were able to lead common-sense gun law
  reform when their voices were raised and heard. Larchmont Charter School
  believes student voices need to be raised and heard on social justice issues
  in Los Angeles. Our student population is 40% low income, and we serve
  students from all over the city. They KNOW what poverty is, and are confronted
  by its confines every day. Larchmont Charter School, a grades K- 12 school,
  has established itself as one of the top performing public schools in Los
  Angeles. Unique among public charter networks in our focus on racial, ethnic,
  and socio-economic diversity, Larchmont Charter School aims to provide a
  richly diverse community of students with a high quality public education.
  Social justice is woven into the mission of our school, and who better to
  rally youthful members of the community to fight injustice but our students?
  The Larchmont Social Justice Alliance will pivot from this deeply held value
  system into an activist platform. Joining student voices toward social
  justice, our Poetry Slam Competition (already a prominent feature in our
  curriculum and in student life in the upper grades) will support a new level
  of community activism. Our students can reach more students through guided use
  of social media, events, civic-minded field trips, and historical perspective
  on the importance of politics. We want to empower young members of the
  community with literary avenues for their voices, as well as rallies, service
  learning, and spoken word. This alliance seeks to use the power of student
  voices for social change. Homelessness, environmental degradation, and
  immigration are 3 issues that affect our population. Those are 3 among many
  our students want to improve. We plan to measure how many new students are
  reached with a pro-change message, how many new members of the community join
  us, and what impact we have in the community through social media analytics
  and surveys. We are happy to join the initiatives of My LA2050 to drive a
  strong, united, youth-driven message for social justice.
project_proposal_engage: >-
  Our activation will require strategic effort to make student voices for social
  change heard. We plan to make use of our talented faculty, and this grant will
  allow us to deploy the brain power and leadership of our educators in service
  of the student voice. Our budget includes funds to pay our selected faculty to
  help student leaders strategize effective social change. This will include 1.)
  prioritizing top issues around which to rally, with relevant research
  (including student-led research) on what bills and local initiatives need
  ballot support or protest; we are interested in gathering youth around the
  common cause of social change and the action required to make it; timelines
  for activation need to be built; with student leaders, we will define goals
  and build a media strategy to achieve them; we will use strategic social media
  (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Snapchat, etc.) to promote our events, rallies,
  partnerships with other youth groups, issues, literary interpretations of
  events, and historical and political context for our initiatives. We will also
  build a sense of unity with tee shirts and field trips that include students
  from all over the city. We will use flyers, video, social media, and publicity
  to support the student voices.
project_measure: >-
  We will document how many students compose the founding membership of
  Larchmont Social Justice Alliance. We will then measure how many people join
  our initiatives, attend our events, see our social media impressions, and
  engage with our interpretations of our challenges (via spoken word
  performances and competitions, comments on essays or literary postings via
  Medium, Facebook, and other social channels) and the issues we plan to effect.
  We will use surveys and social media engagement to determine specifically
  whether our efforts affect change. We will also measure how many students and
  youth become connected with other My LA2050 initiatives as a result of our
  campaigns and output. Our faculty will also evaluate and support the literary
  and artistic value of the work produced.
project_five_years: >-
  In five years, all of our high school students will be able to vote. We
  anticipate that over 90% of them will be enrolled in college, where they can
  continue their social justice work. 600 students, plus their extended families
  and the other students they influence, can be part of a leadership movement
  for social justice stemming from the very heart of Los Angeles.
