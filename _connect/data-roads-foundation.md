  We provide open source software, education, and legal paperwork for nonprofit
  Local Sharing Network co-ops -- otherwise known as 501(c)(12) Utility Co-ops
  and 501(c)(4) community network providers.
project_proposal_description: >-
  *Women are still disproportionately burdened with unpaid home, child, and
  elderly care. Local Sharing Network co-ops create an opportunity for all care
  workers to both co-own and get paid for operating their neighborhood sharing
  infrastructure including Internet access, renewable power generation, and
  storage. New sharing technologies enhance existing community social sharing
  with Internet communications, logistics, paid remote work, and free all-ages
  educational resources.

project_proposal_best_place: >-
  * Access to free WiFi will be part of any partner 501(c)(4) Local Shares
  Network community welfare mission.

   * Adults, especially in unpaid care work, will get more social & emotional support in the co-ownership and operation of these networks.

   * Government responsiveness to residentsâ€™ needs will increase with more ready access to online government resources.

   * Travel time to work will be negligible for new hyperlocal and telecommuting jobs.

   * Percentage of public transit riders will increase to networked coworking hubs in each neighborhood served, and as a result of more previous vehicle commuters now working from home.

   * Participation in neighborhood councils and other local volunteerism will become more convenient as home care workers are allowed to stay nearby all day, with no long commutes between local functions.

   * Total number of local social connections among Angelenos will increase with cooperative membership.

   * Online resources and local coordination groups will allow political messages and voting process updates to be communicated more readily around each service neighborhood.

  This will make connections more affordable for all Angelenos, and bring
  connectivity where currently none is affordable or readily available. Richer
  communities will be able to afford better access, complementary services, and
  local cache offsets to remote Internet and power services. Lower income
  communities will obtain subsidies for charitable class home installations,
  co-op membership, and increased access to local and remote jobs online or in
  local network maintenance. Home care providers in particular (who are still
  disproportionately women and mothers) will be recruited and trained in routine
  network maintenance for their local cooperative, in order to both provide them
  with better paying on-call jobs and prevent the high expenses of site visits
  and truck rolls from remote service centers. These home and hyperlocal work
  forces will also act as the front line of customer service and novel service
  studies for each neighborhood cooperative, to give them each a faster lead in
  customer innovation testing and scalable demand assessments.
project_measure: >-
  We will count the number of neighborhoods adopting local cooperative sharing
  network organizing methods; total members per cooperative; and fraction of new
  local membership employed as in situ network infrastructure installers,
  maintainers, and on-call repair staff. We will specifically reach out to
  at-home care workers as existing neighborhood social leaders, with training
  opportunities as paid infrastructure installers and maintainers.
project_five_years: >-
  Every self-defined community or Neighborhood Council district within LA City,
  and major portions of LA County, will have member-owned Local Shares Network
  co-ops, operated in whole or part by neighborhood connected home care workers
  (who are no longer as disproportionately women). Thousands of new local and
  remote-online jobs will be created in these service areas, and millions more
  Angelenos will have the same or better bandwidth connections to the Internet
  at much lower aggregate service costs. About half these service areas will
  gain complementary online and local sharing logistics services in addition to
  greater Internet access capacity, and half of these regions will gain
  affordable Internet bandwidth where almost none was readily available
  previously.
