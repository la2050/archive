  Our aim is to expand upon eight successful iterations of the festival by
  building a smart phone app to improve information dissemination and sharing,
  enrich our local artist and creative community by commissioning artists to
  create unique imagery and projects that celebrate Los Angeles, and to find
  talented people to support the expansion and improvement of the festival. Our
  principal goal is to build a world-class, destination photography festival by
  2018.

project_proposal_best_place: >-
  Los Angeles has quickly become a city known for it's prominent arts and
  culture scene, and is home to the second largest community of photographers,
  outside of New York City.  Our proposal is to improve upon and expand the next
  two festivals (January 2017 and January 2018) by building a smart phone app
  that will help our audience learn more about our programming, share our
  programming with ease and make our events more accessible.  With the support
  of LA250, our organization would also be able to develop and implement a
  marketing strategy that would create more awareness about our festival. Los
  Angeles is a world-class city and photography is a language, a mode of
  communication that has become increasingly easy to disseminate and understand
  in the 21st century. The vision for Month of Photography Los Angeles is to not
  only showcase the enormous photographic talent that reside here, but also to
  engage in, and participate in the discussion and the narrative of an evolving
  art and communication form. To do this, key players in the world of
  communication and photography should attend and participate.
