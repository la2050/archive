  Synaccord is building a platform for productive online discussion of 
  polarizing issues. We do online what is done at in-person deliberative events
  so we can find the solutions to what divides us.

  Venice Neighborhood Council - At the last minute it was determined that the NC
  will have to vote on supporting this. The vote will be on 10/18. I will notify
  you of the outcome, but we have strong sponsors.

  - Westside
project_measure: >-
  Number of people engaged with the website – goal is at least as many as voted
  in NC election in 2016 


  Growth rate of the number of people engaged in the web site. – a positive
  growth rate is success


  Number of people returning to the site (repeat engagement) – we monitor this
  to enact tasks to keep it high


  Number of outcomes where there is an innovative solution enacted by the
  neighborhood with broad agreement. – this is a stretch goal – 1 would be
  awesome.


  Saving time for the neighborhood council (they are all volunteers). – We will
  poll the NC members and ask them about the time required to support this and
  the value received. Our goal to provide broader participation without
  increasing the time required. 


  Increased participation in neighborhood council voting over the 2016 election
  – though the next election is in 2018 and we won’t be able to measure this
  during the scope of the project.

  Let's empower Angelinos to engage with each other and their Neighborhood
  Councils online to solve their challenges and create their future. We’ll let
  people be heard from the time and place available to them, and collaborate
  with each other in an innovative online structure to bring out the most
  representative public input, avoid the trolls, and no public speaking
  required!  This project will work closely with one lead NC and make the tools
  and best practices will be available to all in LA.

  - Government responsiveness to residents’ needs
  - Participation in neighborhood councils

  Neighborhood councils in LA are a bold new experiment but they have challenges
  with engagement both at election time, and in their council participation. 
  Turnout in the 2016 election ranged from 0 to 7.5% participation.  Turnout at
  meetings is much less, and many people have not heard of them.

  Instead, imagine Angelinos from all over getting on their smartphones,
  tablets, and PCs to connect with each other and their neighborhood councils
  (NC’s) to define the vision they share, identify the challenges they face, and
  productively work together to bring the dream to life.

  In-person deliberation works! - There is a facilitator who organizes people
  into small diverse groups and puts a structure to the conversation that keeps
  it on track to a goal. 

  We build on existing tools that take in-person deliberation online, and work
  with a representative neighborhood and NC to define and develop new features
  to fulfill the mission: help people engage and productively work together with
  their council. And we make this is available to all NC’s in LA.

  We will work with the NC and you to define, prioritize and add features
  designed to make engagement interesting and productive, including:

  - Enabling committee members to interact with the community online while
  maintaining compliance with the many CA regulations

  - Creating a new video message based discussion format so online discussions
  can have a more personal and visual connection.

  - Allowing NCs to link to discussions from their existing web sites and
  postings so all can view and participate

  - Letting neighbors GPS check-in to show their authenticity online and share
  their stake in discussions

  - Providing neighbors with notifications of updates on (and only on) the
  topics that interest them – to stay up to date but not overwhelmed.

  - Provide Android and iPhone apps.

  This project is also about outreach – to define, implement, measure, and
  report on programs that reach out and engage neighbors and get them involved
  in the neighborhood discussions that are important to them.  And not just
  online, we work through offline and in person means as well to reach people
  where they are.

  You have seen that online discussions of controversial topics go badly. But
  with the lessons of in-person discussions these challenges can be solved:

  - Trolls - start in small, diverse groups. If others find a post to be uncivil
  they can flag it, and vote up the better posts.

  - Discussions gone wild – apply structures like pro/con, and problem/solution,
  side-by-side comparison, and list prioritization to keep discussion moving
  forward.

  - Overwhelming participation - let people vote up the comments that speak for
  them and break large groups into many small groups and hold rounds (like march
  madness) so that, for example, a thousand people could find the most
  representative comments of a community in 4 rounds of groups of 6.
