  Visitor statistics from LA Plaza Paseo will provide a generalized measurement
  of its penetration. A more targeted measurement will be the number of adults
  and children participating in LA Plaza’s ongoing community engagement
  programming. The Walkway will also serve to draw more visitors into the
  adjoining museum, and is expected to spike visitor attendance as well as
  participation in LA Plaza’s educational and public programming offerings.


  LA Plaza will also conduct user-experience surveys examining the programming
  during the installation and engagement phases. The surveys will focus on
  several themes:

  1. Users’ accessibility to park/recreation without LA Plaza Paseo.

  2. Extent to which LA Plaza Paseo increases their park/recreation
  opportunities.

  3. Feedback on experience of interacting with each element in LA Plaza's
  social media.

  The Historic Paseo Walkway is the City’s first pedestrian pathway exploring
  and celebrating the rich, multicultural history of L.A.  The pathway will
  include a mural, historical markers and monuments, street pavings, and other
  artistic interpretive elements leading visitors on a historic journey through
  Union Station, El Pueblo, LA Plaza and Fort Moore.  The Walkway will serve as
  a new gathering place for Angelenos and visitors to explore, experience and
  appreciate the city’s historical roots.

  Cultural events:  The Walkway will help direct visitors into the LA Plaza
  museum and six other museums in Olvera Street that tell the story of Los
  Angeles.  It will also expand the capacity of LA Plaza’s existing performance
  area, where a year-round schedule of concerts, family festivals, culinary
  events, film screenings are conducted.  One of the primary elements is a mural
  depicting the city’s founding, which will be erected on the wall of La Placita
  Church.  The Walkway will become an important public gathering space for
  public events produced by LA Plaza and other organizations.


  Public/open streets gatherings:   According to the Countywide Comprehensive
  Parks and Recreation Needs Assessment, La Plaza’s region contains a miniscule
  0.2 – 0.5 park acres per 1K residents. (Countywide average: 2.2 park
  acres/1K.) Open space will relieve park pressure. It will benefit those
  communities underserved by park and open space amenities. It will increase
  park and open space for those ranked lowest in the county.  Through artistic
  innovation, the content development will showcase art and artists, while LA
  Plaza’s programming will expand cultural options for the neighborhood and
  region.
    
  Public transit riders:  The Paseo will be an important central gathering place
  for all, including children and families, youth and school groups, downtown
  dwellers, daily commuters and tourists.  Union Station, part of the El Pueblo
  historic core, is a regional transportation hub for numerous rail, bus and
  shuttle services.   The Union Station “Connect US Action Plan,” was developed
  to improve historical and cultural connections in downtown Los Angeles by
  enhancing pedestrian and bicycle travel options through and between
  communities.   The Historic Paseo Walkway is fundamentally aligned with the
  Connect US Plan to create connections between Union Station and the
  cultural/historic sites in the surrounding neighborhoods by means of a clear
  primary route; promote improvements that convey the unique identity of each
  neighborhood and street; improve pedestrian and bicycle linkages to/from Union
  Station to the destinations within each neighborhood and between
  neighborhoods.


  Transit-accessible housing and employment: LA Plaza is coordinating with
  proposed projects and previous studies within the area including Plaza Paseo,
  LA Plaza Cultural Village and Metro Linkage Study to ensure a well-integrated,
  historically rich public realm.  Downtown’s historic core will soon experience
  a new resurgence of economic and residential activity with the development of
  the LA Plaza Cultural Village, a 425,000 square foot mixed used complex
  opening in 2018.  The complex will include 355 apartments, including 20%
  priced at affordable rates, and 47,000 square feet of restaurant and retail
  space.  More than 500 people will be part of this dynamic new residential
  community in the northern section of downtown and will have direct access to
  our museum, Olvera Street and Union Station.
