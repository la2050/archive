  RideLA. Rewarding Impact and Driving Engagement on LA’s Metro via a Blockchain
  based Mobile App.
project_description: >-
  The RideLA app will incentivize use of public transportation by offering a
  Blockchain based game system through which riders earn credits to exchange for
  goods and services across LA.

  Geffen Academy is an inclusive, university-affiliated school for students who
  want to develop their intellectual curiosity, leadership capabilities and
  connection to something larger than themselves.
project_proposal_description: >-
  The Geffen Academy Class of 2021 will activate a generation to use public
  transportation by developing a fun, functional mobile app. Our app, RideLA,
  will offer real time bus location updates and rider density data. The app will
  also be fun, because it will be game based and riders will earn points, stored
  in the Blockchain, that can be exchanged around the city for goods and
  services. The more you ride, the more you earn!

project_proposal_best_place: >-
  Our app will make LA the best place to CONNECT because it will be fun and it
  will have clearly measurable impacts on four mobilization paths.
   
    
   
   The app will influence individual behavior by incentivizing use of public transportation. Angelinos know that public transportation is better for the environment, but they aren’t rewarded for using it. Our app will give riders points in three ways: for ‘checking in’ to a bus (or train), for submitting ridership density data and for distance travelled. Those points will be stored in the Blockchain and through partnerships with local businesses riders will be able to exchange their points for goods and services (ex. meals, event tickets, etc…). This will be measured by rider check-ins and density reporting.
   
    
   
   Our app will encourage businesses to change practices through a Blockchain exchange. Businesses that join the exchange will gain positive PR for being supporters of public transportation and for being part of LA’s innovation economy. This will be measured by the number of business that join the exchange and by the number of rider points exchanged.
   
    
   
   Our app will also create a new tool for greater civic engagement. Public transportation projects are expensive and take a long time to complete. Incentivized, rewarded riders are more likely to support transportation projects, be patient with timelines and with possible tax increases for funding. This will be measured by suggesting pro-public transportation social media postings and user response rate.
   
    
   
   Our app will use digital tools, specifically games and Blockchain, to engage and activate Angelinos to care more about our city’s transportation infrastructure. Our generation is media-savvy, digitally literate and politically active. We know what can be accomplished through social networks. #MarchForOurLives is a recent, important example of what we can accomplish. While public transportation is not as urgent an issue as gun control, it is one that we need to tackle now so that we can have a beautiful, healthy city to live in when we are adults in 2050. Change needs to be faster and start now! This will be measured by the number of rider check-ins and the number of pro-public transportation social media postings using RideLA specific hashtags.
   
    
   
   The CONNECT metrics we target are: number of public transit riders, travel time to work, and attendance at cultural events. We will measure riders and travel time by app usage data. We will measure attendance at cultural events by the number of social media postings about events that include the RideLA hashtags.
project_proposal_engage: >-
  This project aims to target the entire region of Los Angeles, with a user base
  and map that covers the entire Metro system. Ads on social media platforms
  will be used to increase awareness, as well as promotions from people and
  celebrities with large followings. Specifically, we want to target three
  groups: Angelinos who care about the environment but don’t use public
  transportation will join because the app makes doing the right thing fun, via
  games and leaderboards. Angelinos who want to join the innovation economy but
  don’t have tech skills and/or Silicon Beach connections will join because the
  app will give them Blockchain access. Teen Angelinos who want a voice in the
  future of our city will join because the app will connect them to other teen
  riders and encourage mastery of the Metro system.

project_five_years: >-
  In five years, we hope the RideLA app is alive and running with a team of
  programmers, that continues to include high school students, regularly
  updating it with bug fixes and improvements. We want the RideLA app to be
  well-liked, functional and receive good ratings in the app store, but the
  activation is more important than the app itself. We hope that in five years
  the app will have encouraged millions of Angelinos to use the Metro system. We
  hope that more people will recognize climate change threatens our future and
  that they will act to use shared transportation for the good of everyone.
