  The success of this project will be measured by the number of community
  members participating in the program. Direct metrics of success will be the
  number of individuals attending the six community workshops; the number of
  toolkits distributed; the number of permits pulled by residents; the number of
  trees removed or pruned; and finally the number of sidewalks repaired or
  replaced. Immeasurable project outcomes include community empowerment as
  residents learn how to work with local government to initiate and complete
  improvement projects; improved safety for pedestrian, cyclists, transit users,
  the disabled community, as well as parents with strollers; increased quality
  of life and public health as people are encouraged to walk or cycle outdoors;
  and long-term revitalization benefits as communities improve.

  Cracked and broken, unattractive and dangerous, far too many sidewalks in Los
  Angeles are in severe disrepair. LANI, in collaboration with the City of Los
  Angeles Urban Forestry Division, will develop and distribute a comprehensive
  tool-kit to assist residents in navigating the process of repairing or
  replacing their own sidewalks. LANI will conduct extensive outreach,
  facilitate six neighborhood workshops, and work hands-on with local residents
  to make streets safer for all!

  The City of Los Angeles has over 11,000 linear miles of sidewalk with much of
  it in disrepair. Invasive tree roots have uplifted concrete creating cracks
  and large fissures that impede mobility and cause tremendous safety hazards.
  Nearly 40% of the city’s sidewalks are damaged based on conservative city-wide
  estimates. 


  Since 2013, LANI has been working with residents to repair and replace
  dangerous neighborhood sidewalks. LANI has reached out directly to homeowners
  to make the public right-of-way more accessible, usable and better for all,
  improving over 300 sidewalk locations to date. Through this effort, LANI has
  worked in close partnership with the City of Los Angeles, Urban Forestry
  Division to obtain the necessary permits required for these repairs. 


  Now, with considerable knowledge and understanding of the entire sidewalk
  repair and replacement process, LANI and the Urban Forestry Division are ready
  to teach local residents how to navigate the process and successfully complete
  their own repair projects.  


  LANI will develop and distribute a comprehensive tool-kit designed to walk
  community members through permitting and construction with clear, easy to
  understand steps and descriptions. LANI will conduct extensive outreach and
  facilitate six community workshops, in different Council Districts, to help
  residents understand the application process and demystify implementation. The
  Urban Forestry Division will participate at the community workshops, providing
  guidance, answering questions, and helping to break down the barrier between
  communities and local government. LANI will show community members how to take
  accurate measurements, how to secure appropriate permits, how to solicit bids
  and select a general contractor, and finally how to ensure that a thorough,
  appropriate, work product is obtained. 


  Through the process, community members will emerge from the experience with a
  renewed commitment to seeing their neighborhood improve. They will become
  active and empowered civic leaders with the tools necessary to affect local
  change.
