title: 'Intersections: The power of our common stories.'
project_description: >-
  It all begins with sharing stories. Imagine LA and L.A. Works are joining to
  empower 150,000+ Angelenos to share their own life experiences to help
  alleviate homelessness in our city.

  Imagine LA recruits teams of volunteer mentors who are trained and guided by
  professional social service staff to assist vulnerable families, ending their
  cycle of homelessness and poverty.
project_proposal_description: >-
  Sharing stories and making connections is essential to developing the trusting
  mentor/mentee relationships that pull a vulnerable family out of the cycle of
  homelessness. This fresh outreach campaign will show that disparate groups of
  Angelenos have more in common than they would ever think, evoking the fun and
  reward of these commonalities, ultimately recruiting more volunteer mentors .
  With this grant, we’ll be able to supercharge our program and make an enormous
  impact on homelessness in L.A.

  People are more likely to trust and fully engage with one another when they
  share common experiences and interests. Knowing this, Imagine LA created a
  unique onboarding process, which we use when matching volunteer mentors with
  families who’ve experienced homelessness. Our professional staff trains and
  guides the mentor/mentee pairs as they share life timelines, family genograms,
  personal values, and views on money management. These exercises evoke
  laughter, “a ha!” moments and sometimes tears. Shortly, they discover they
  have more in common than they would ever have thought. 
   
   
   
   Often used as a therapeutic intervention, the timeline project creates an intimate connection between participants as they explore their history, attitudes, circumstances, and decision-making. “It’s been said that a picture is worth a thousand words. If so, then capturing your life on paper with a timeline exercise may be worth millions.“ (Staik, 2013)
   
   
   
   Modeling this deep and barrier-busting experience, the "Intersections" campaign will significantly increase the number of mentors in the Imagine LA program. Potential volunteers need to see the foundation we create for success and be empowered with the realization that they too have what it takes to be a life-changing mentor for families emerging from homelessness — simply the ability to share. What begins with a connection ends with breaking the cycle of homelessness.
   
    
   
   Partnering with L.A. Works, the largest volunteer network in Los Angeles, Imagine LA will create a public awareness and outreach campaign, pairing social media marketing, community outreach, and events to educate and empower 150,000+ Angelenos. Ultimately, this will influence individual behavior, CONNECT 1,000 new mentors with vulnerable families in the Imagine LA program, and increase rates of volunteerism — not only as mentors, but with shorter-term volunteer roles. 
   
   
   
   A key component of our campaign is events-based. At L.A. Works’ large-scale days of service, which draw volunteers from around the county who are primed to make a deeper connection in service, we’ll lead trust-building activities like those we use during our mentor/mentee on-boarding process, educate participants, post on socials and ultimately sign up new volunteers to become mentors. 
   
   
   
   Mentorship promotes community and develops meaningful relationships full of mutual respect, love, and laughter. Showcasing this, and CONNECTing Angelenos to each other through their stories, will bring this campaign to life. Our shareable videos (live and animated), photos, and tactics like a mentor taking over our Instagram feed for a day will help increase the total number of local social media friends and connections Angelenos have. We anticipate the campaign to CONNECT Angelenos way beyond our goal of signing up mentors. It will empower them to volunteer in other ways and LEARN about those with disparate backgrounds and circumstances. It will break the cycle of homelessness for hundreds of families.
project_proposal_engage: >-
  In partnership with L.A. Works, Imagine L.A. aims to educate and engage adult
  Angelenos as mentors for families emerging from homelessness. We will CONNECT
  with more than 150,000 people, educating them about how sharing their own life
  experiences and expertise could play a significant role in alleviating the
  homeless crisis in Los Angeles, and empowering them to take action by signing
  up to volunteer. Exploring, embracing and showcasing the common ground we all
  share as Angelenos — and capitalizing on the fun of it as the cornerstone of
  our campaign — will make LA the best place to CONNECT.
   
   
   
   We will utilize short, shareable videos and GIFs, targeted social media posts and social media advertising, info sessions/workshops, community outreach in target neighborhoods throughout Los Angeles, media outreach, and crowd activation activities. These will feature current mentors or mentor prospects and individuals who have experienced homelessness sharing their common life experiences, illustrating the joy and importance of sharing these experiences through storytelling. We will showcase these stories and create related, in-person activities to educate, recruit and sign up volunteer mentors at special L.A. Works days of service tailored to address homelessness in Los Angeles.
project_measure: >-
  We will define success as meeting the following objectives: 1) Educate more
  than 150,000 people about how sharing their own life experiences and expertise
  creates common ground and could play a significant role in alleviating the
  homeless crisis in Los Angeles, empowering them to take action; 2) Recruit and
  sign up volunteer mentors using many of the same tactics in person at targeted
  L.A. Works events. Throughout the course of the campaign, we will sign up more
  than 1,000 new mentors. 
   
   
   
   A mentor makes 100 connections with his/her mentee per year. 1000 x 100 = 100,000 connections. Necessarily, our campaign’s outreach impressions will actually represent a vastly larger number of connections that also have lasting impact.
   
   
   
   We will measure success by assessing:
   
   * Analytics about impressions, views and engagement on social media platforms
   
   * Web site traffic 
   
   * Media impressions
   
   * Community engagement metrics
   
   * Event attendance
   
   * Volunteer sign ups
   
   * Imagine LA mentor applications submitted
   
   * Mentors matched with families and in the pipeline to be matched
   
   
   
   Additionally, more volunteer mentors will allow the Imagine LA program to meet its potential so an extended result of this campaign, beyond its two years, will be helping hundreds more Los Angeles families flourish, breaking their cycle of homelessness and poverty.
project_five_years: >-
  The majority of people who are homelessness have experienced homelessness
  before. Imagine LA, powered by mentors, public and private resources, and
  communities, will have ended this cycle for hundreds, perhaps thousands of
  families. This campaign will help us get there. It will also help us meet two
  goals of our five-year strategic plan: to be embedded in LA County and a
  nationally recognized model for homeless prevention and community
  mobilization.
   
   
   
   This activation has limitless possibilities for renewal as it evolves to work with more narrowly defined target audiences throughout Los Angeles, i.e. different age groups, specific professions or community groups, geographic areas. In the not-to-distant future, we know we’ll have Imagine LA program graduates (mentees) joining us as mentors themselves.
