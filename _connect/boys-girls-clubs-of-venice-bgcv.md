  Boys & Girls Clubs of Venice has filled the gap in the lives of vulnerable
  youth and families providing viable programs and services for over 50 years.
  Bridging Generations Connecting Values project will engage innovative ideas of
  LA's inner-city vulnerable youth connecting them to STEM education and The
  Arts. LA historically reflects the cultural diversity of all people and
  because of generations of its residents, LA has remained the best place to
  connect, learn, play, create and live. 
   
   
   
   BGCV will connect vulnerable youth, peers, families, educators, to intergenerational volunteers and mentors to become more integrated in shared values collaboratively. 
   
   
   
   STEM and The Arts ingratiates the need for BGCV to engage youth and intergenerational volunteers and mentors through five core areas of focus: Education & Career Development; Character & Leadership; Health & Life Skills; The Arts & Music; and Sports, Recreation & Fitness.
   
   
   
   BGCV integrates input from over 3,000 at-risk youth annually or approximately 125,000 in 50 years. 73% of Boys & Girls Clubs of Venice of the youth experience food insecurities and experience challenging, fractured home environments. Bridging Generations Connecting Values connecting STEM and The Arts is a realistic approach that will actually integrate values of young and old Angelenos. BGCV will interweave the historical nuances of all communities throughout Los Angeles connecting the grace of differences as the foundation to elevate the bridge of generations by connecting values for sustainable voices to resonate.
   
   
   
   Vulnerable youth have inherent desires to gain access to skills or support necessary to break the cycle of poverty. STEM and The Arts are two paths that offer opportunity to increase transformation of youth and their families providing the tools required and opportunity become educated and skilled to perform better in these areas. additionally, matriculation through the educational system will denote measurable outcomes to direct youth toward greater futures in LA. BGCV project will contribute to closing the gap of programs or access of vulnerable youth so they can confidently express that LA is the best place to gain STEM education, live and work. 
   
   
   
   Youth empowerment and intergenerational mentoring will have an elevated educational, cultural, and sustained generational significance for LA beyond 2050. Learning, Creating, Playing, Connecting and Living require layers of educators, community and business professionals, LA government and philanthropic personal and professional investment. 
   
   
   
   Youth and older adult or intergenerational volunteers and mentors participating in the BGCV project throughout Los Angeles County, will connect youth to long-term residency as highly skilled STEM careers or limitless artistic expression that may evoke untapped potential because our project will bridge generations together by connecting values of cultural diversity. ANGELENOS are Bridging Generations Connecting Values.
