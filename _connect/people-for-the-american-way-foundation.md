  FLLA LA has numerous measurable deliverable outcomes, the first being
  recruiting a class of 15-20 Fellows for the next cycle of FLLA LA. PFAW
  Foundation  will focus their recruitment on young people who are traditionally
  marginalized from the political process and underrepresented in public
  leadership –  including women, people of color, and LGBTQ youth. By recruiting
  a diverse pool of candidates, FLLA LA aims to make the leadership in LA County
  as diverse as the population they will represent. 


  PFAW Foundation will then train the newest class of Fellows in the areas of
  candidacy, field, finance, communications and campaign management. These
  skills will equip Fellows to pursue careers in government, nonprofits,
  campaign operations, or  elected office. FLLA LA will work with our network of
  alumni and young elected officials to create a sustained community and
  curriculum to equip the talented, ambitious and civically-minded young people
  participating in the next fellowship class. The training will culminate with
  each Fellow developing a mock individual, district-specific “campaign” plan.
  PFAW Foundation will continue to provide support to Fellows after graduating
  the program, via alumni networking opportunities and mentorship with elected
  officials.

  Building on a successful two-year pilot, Front Line Leaders Academy will
  recruit 15-20 young people who are seeking positive social change but are
  underrepresented in local leadership - such as women, people of color, and
  LGBTQ youth. Fellows participate in four three-day weekend trainings over the
  course of the six months to cover a wide range of skills and tactics. By
  graduation Fellows will have developed a wide range of organizing skills that
  will help them to be effective local leaders.

  Front Line Leaders Academy  Los Angeles (FLLA LA) will train 15-20 young
  leaders dedicated to creating lasting change in their communities throughout
  Los Angeles County. FLLA LA covers a wide range of civic participation
  leadership skills: how to be an effective campaign manager, finance director,
  communications director, field organizer, and even candidate. FLLA LA equips
  young people with the skills and confidence to become effective leaders, and
  prepares them to work on a campaign in any capacity as well as to assume key
  roles in non-profits, local government, and community leadership. In the
  application and selection process, we look for applicants who are committed
  and have the potential to create change in their communities – now and over
  the long-term. Since 2006, 161 participants have graduated from the program
  nationally – 70 percent of FLLA graduates have gone on to hold leadership
  roles in nonprofits, community groups, or in an elected official’s office; 70
  percent have increased their civic participation through work on issue or
  political campaigns; and 14 percent have run for office (65 percent of these
  won their races).


  Participants in past FLLA LA classes are already making strides toward many
  CONNECT metrics.


  Many FLLA alumni are working toward increased voting rates. A recent FLLA alum
  is serving as the Volunteer Coordinator for a southern California
  Congressional campaign, using the field and communications training from FLLA
  to increase voter turnout in the district.


  Other FLLA LA ’16 alumni hosted a meeting to sign up participants for Vote
  Allies. Vote Allies matches eligible voters with those who cannot vote
  (undocumented immigrants, citizens with a past felony, etc) to educate each
  other on the issues and process; to find common ground on the issues and
  candidates to “share” a vote. Vote Allies engages potential voters to
  critically think about issues in elections through conversations with
  ineligible persons, and increases their stake in the electoral process. 
  Through official and unofficial capacities, FLLA alumni work toward involving
  more people in the electoral process and local government.


  FLLA alumni can also contribute to building cultural and public events. A pair
  of FLLA alumni, including one working for Los Angeles County Parks and
  Recreation, partnered to host a community hike and build relationships with
  community members in their neighborhood. 


  Another significant outcome from FLLA is the development of young civic
  leaders who will go on to participate in and lead neighborhood councils. Five
  FLLA LA alumni have received appointments to their community’s public boards
  and commissions, including:


  - Cudahy Planning Commission

  - City of Artesia Planning Commission

  - City of Hawthorne Youth Commission

  - Huntington Park Health and Education Commission

  - City of Walnut Mount San Antonio College Development Task Force
