organization_activity: >-
  SBBC, now >400 members, was founded in 2009 by South Bay cyclists determined
  to connect local riders on a mission to unite the South Bay Cities in safe,
  easily accessible, fun active transportation.
project_proposal_description: >-
  A vast network of trails exists throughout the South Bay region to expand
  available space for safe cycling and pedestrian activities. ACTIVATE SOUTH BAY
  LA TRAILS! will engage residents (and visitors, communicating by every
  possible means, the activation will bring 5 Cities of Angelenos out to PLAY,
  people of all ages, with a desire to meet their neighbors. By adding mapping
  and wayfinding, residents will connect with each other to join in the
  fun--activating trails throughout the South Bay.

  Trails can transform areas, bringing diverse populations together from
  neighboring communities, and promote and support healthier lifestyles. Trails
  make regional assets available to populations that otherwise might not derive
  benefit. Physical activity becomes accessible to the widest range of people,
  including persons with disabilities and others who are known to be less
  physically active. Trails provides an amenity open to residents of every age.


  Walking, Running and Biking are fun and green, curbing our carbon footprints,
  reducing air pollution and our reliance on fossil fuels. The momentum for
  active transportation is building, thanks in no small part to completion of
  the South Bay Bicycle Master Plan. Active transportation is perceived by more
  and more as a safe way to get outdoors and have fun!


  For example, if by answering the call to join in on the fun ACTIVATE SOUTH BAY
  LA TRAILS! residents begin to support City infrastructure that supports
  pedestrian and cycling activities, then when an issue comes up in a City
  related to that, they are empowered to speak out in the public forum.


  Expanding uses of linear paths will help us meet our primary goal of
  augmenting access to space to PLAY in the our urban environment. Since we
  suffer from a low ratio of park acres per thousand residents (critically
  underserved in some South Bay Cities), trails are a component of the solution.
  Seniors, adults, families and children need the benefit of playtime. Having
  greater access to trails will expand available play spaces, regardless of age.
  The importance of intergenerational connections is generally acknowledged.
  Although not defined as park space, trails will help to increase the
  opportunities for residents of all ages to meet in their pedestrian and
  cycling activities.


  Activating the trail system will bolster the walk/bike/transit scores for
  every neighborhood along the way. The Walk Score offers an answer to two
  important questions. "What can I do to improve my personal health?" and "What
  can I do to improve the health of the planet?" Furthermore, living a walkable
  or bikable lifestyle means rush hour traffic becomes less relevant. It is well
  documented that real estate values are higher in neighborhoods with higher
  scores.


  ACTIVATE SOUTH BAY LA TRAILS! Impacts positively on CONNECT and LIVE
  activation through communication on the project website, newsletter, twitter,
  Instagram and other social media platforms this project will expand residents’
  social media contacts and connections around something that is valuable to
  all: PLAY! Social interaction can start when they join in for scheduled
  volunteer efforts. Activating the public for various events can start the
  development of social interaction among the residents of five South Cities.
  Activating the Trails for gatherings will strengthen the social fabric of the
  area.

  Median household incomes of residents of the five South Bay Cities vary a
  great deal, ranging from $144,868 in Manhattan Beach, $103,782 in Redondo
  Beach and $91,623 in El Segundo to $51,934 and $45,069 in Lawndale and
  Hawthorne respectively. This highlights disparities between communities. 


  Trails eliminate many barriers to access—no entrance fee, no cost for
  expensive equipment. 


  SBBC has helped with lowering barriers to bicycling by providing donated
  bicycles to those who lack the financial resources to purchase bikes. We will
  continue that effort through this project. By offering opportunities to access
  bicycles and helmets for fun, residents of low-income homes will not be
  deterred from joining in on the fun, and below are examples of the fun:


  IT’S OUTDOORS! By engaging with residents of the five communities, more
  residents play outside which, in turn, makes it safer. 


  EMBRACE SIMPLE ACTIVITIES: No expensive equipment, no entrance fees--the
  simpler the activity, the easier to engage. 


  SCAVENGER HUNT ANYONE? Scavenger hunts are a great way to engage people, even
  educate kids and get everyone moving. 


  We might be communicating a weekend Trail Dash running event, nature
  interpretive program, a bicycle ride from North Redondo to Lawndale, a bike
  safety program, helmet giveaway, bicycle maintenance check, or a trail cleanup
  to maintain the connection we share through the Trails.
project_measure: >-
  We will define success on several fronts: the reach and interaction that we
  experience with core collaborators, partners and other stakeholders the
  methods by which residents engage, number of residents who come out to PLAY
  and activate on the South Bay LA Trails, and the feedback that we receive. By
  monitoring key activities as they happen, we will evaluate with a constructive
  focus and assess and report in real time. The idea is that the Project can be
  improved and achieve Activation more effectively.


  After the event has started, the evaluation team will be receiving feedback
  from residents who joined the ACTIVATE SOUTH BAY LA TRAILS!--measuring the
  activation. Among other things, we will establish the extent to which the
  Project’s objectives are met and whether we can improve in any way and if so,
  how. We will learn from our mistakes.


  Volunteers are often the front-line support and experience the process and can
  often articulate what works and what could be improved in an Activation. A
  structured feedback process helps SBBC to better understand their volunteer
  experience and use the feedback to better support volunteers. We use volunteer
  feedback after each event to make modifications that contribute to a
  continuous improvement process. In this way, we identify issues quickly that
  improve volunteer experiences, and volunteers in turn are willing to share
  their perspectives.
project_five_years: >-
  SBBC envisions a vastly expanded network of trails within five years. This
  activation will raise awareness among the South Bay communities that we are
  all connected, and formal and informal trails are a way to interrelate with
  each other. Beyond this activation, we will work with our collaborators,
  partners and stakeholders and employ the lessons we have learned through this
  project to continue to activate more of the 35 miles of trails and populate
  more outdoor spaces to connect South Bay neighborhoods. 


  We also hope that our involvement and civic engagement of our members will
  continue to motivate local governments in the South Bay to accommodate safe
  active transportation within and between communities. The implementation of
  the South Bay Bicycle Master Plan will continue to provide impetus for
  improving infrastructure. With this effort to activate Trails, we will
  continue to be at the forefront of expanding various options for active
  transportation.
