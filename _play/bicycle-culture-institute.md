  Play with bikes, make friends, connect to local resources + inspire bicycle
  riding in Los Angeles!
project_is_collaboration: 'No'
project_collaborators: >-
  None - We have repeatedly reached out to other nonprofits (MCM, LACBC, ERBC,
  SM SPOKE, etc) and all of those organizations have decided to participate by
  partial sponsorship, being involved in promotion, day-of activities as
  exhibitors. Other (education, health) nonprofits have said the same thing:
  there is not enough people or money to take on additional work.
project_applying: '$50,000'
project_areas:
  - City of Los Angeles
  - LAUSD
project_measure: >-
  Because there are a lot of factors (at play!) there are a few ways we measure
  success:


  1) Number of attendees

  2) Number of exhibitors

  3) Social Media engagement 

  (facebook, instagram, twitter, online interaction: photos, comments, likes,
  etc)

  4) Exhibitor Survey

  5) Growth over previous years

  6) Profit & Loss for the event

  LA isn't yet in love with the bicycle. Education (what bike, how to get there,
  who else is riding?) is the actual #1 barrier to getting more people riding -
  which helps address the #1 perceived barrier - safety. 


  By creating a 'Disneyland' of bicycles (road mountain, city, e_bikes, family
  bikes) making it easy to learn, play and connect we can jump start a new
  excitement for bikes and get more people riding to work/school, connecting to
  METRO and enjoying how great LA is for biking.
project_proposal_impact:
  - Access to open space and park facilities
  - Number (and quality) of informal spaces for play
  - Number of children enrolled in afterschool programs
  - Perceived safety
project_proposal_best_place: >-
  People in Southern California love theme parks, so we've set out to create a
  one-day 'Bicycle Disneyland' where families can wander through the different
  'Lands' to explore bikes, resources, ride groups and nonprofits. Like speed
  dating! Get to know the kind of bikes that excite you and immediately connect
  to all the knowledge and community needed to get started or get more active no
  matter where in SoCal you live. Sure, it's probably the bike enthusiast that
  will get the tickets, but with awesome food, music and entertainment -
  everyone will enjoy a great day.
