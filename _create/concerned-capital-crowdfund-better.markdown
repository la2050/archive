  We are teaming up with Crowdfund Better (crowdfundbetter.com) on this
  proposal.  Founded in 2012 by Kathleen Minogue, Crowdfund Better provides
  crowdfunding strategy and education to entrepreneurs, creatives, nonprofits,
  and small businesses.

  It is our expectation that only 2-3 businesses will be viable candidates for
  successful crowdfunding campaigns, but all 10 businesses will reimagine their
  businesses through participation in our program.


  They will receive guidance on how to better identify their target customer,
  how to locate their target customer online, and how to engage with existing
  and potential customers via digital communications including email, social
  media and advertising. 


  We will use crowdfunding frameworks to help businesses use these new
  communications channels with the crowd to build brand awareness, develop new
  products, conduct market research, generate customer feedback, and increase
  sales. Large established companies use a similar model called “enterprise
  crowdfunding” (i.e. Indiegogo Enterprise Crowdfunding division), but until now
  this framework has not been available to smaller established companies. 


  Baseline data on existing marketing assets will be collected during the
  initial business assessment. Data will be tracked and measured over the life
  of the project.



  We will explore the impact the marketing data and direct communications with
  their target customers has on a business’s ability to reinvent via an ability
  to customize their products through user feedback, as well as what impact the
  growth of their marketing footprint may have on sales.

  Our proposal will identify 10 manufacturing companies in Los Angeles County
  that are ‘at risk’ for relocation. We seek to ‘re-tool’ these companies
  through new digital communications, enterprise crowdfunding, and/or management
  capacity so they can better understand their marketplace, increase sales and
  re-position the company to avert relocation and loss of manufacturing jobs in
  LA County.

  - Minority- and women-owned firms
  - Venture capital investment

  Manufacturing Activity: LA County has hemorrhaged manufacturing jobs in the
  last decade, losing 20% of these jobs. 


  Our proposal seeks to help stem the outflow of manufacturing jobs through the
  use of crowdfunding, digital technology, management consulting and other tools
  to re-invent older companies. Our goal is to conduct the research and
  development needed to reposition them in the marketplace AND retain their
  jobs.


  Employment in Creative Industries:  The use of digital marketing  techniques
  will require the talents of many creative industries ranging from graphic
  design to filmmaking to copywriting. 


  Video pitching is an integral part of any crowdfunding effort.  It
  demonstrates a company’s transparency, showing specific products/services; it
  can support early branding, storytelling, and customer identification;  the
  video format can entice a potential consumer in a crowdfunding campaign.


  LA County is rich in documentary filmmakers.  Older manufacturing companies
  can tell their story through the use of documentary film. 


  Jobs per Capita:  In a Forbes Magazine story ‘LA: CITY OF LOSERS?’
  Urbanologist Joel Kotkin noted that per-capita manufacturing employment in Los
  Angeles has fallen significantly.  “.. industrial job count stands at 363,900,
  down sharply from 900,000 just a decade ago.”  The Apparel industry alone lost
  45,000 jobs in LA County during the last decade. 


  The significance of this is that manufacturing jobs directly effects per
  capita income. 


  According to LAEDC, median household income in LA County is estimated to be
  $54,529, approximately 9% lower than the state median. At $27,488, per capita
  income in the county is 7% below the state average. This differential is
  directly attributable to the loss of manufacturing jobs in recent years.


  Maintaining this base is key to high per capita income for LA in the future.


  Measures of cultural & global economic influence (“soft power”):  Utilizing
  crowdfunding tools including digital storytelling and marketing, the project
  will help create a body of content on the internet that highlights LA as a
  leader in manufacturing.  


  Minority- and women-owned firms:

  Our collaboration with the Alliance of Women Directors (AWD) in the creation
  of crowdfunding campaign videos will provide creative opportunities for women
  filmmakers in LA. 

  Many small companies selected in this pilot program will be minority owned. 


  Venture Capital:  Businesses with market validation via rewards crowdfunding
  are highly attractive to VCs. VCs are discovering that the industrial sector
  offer high return potential when re-invented & married to new tech. An SBA
  study entitled “Research on the Current State of Crowdfunding: The Effect of
  Crowdfunding Performance & Outside Capital” found a relationship between
  crowdfunding success and an ability for a business to obtain outside
  financing. Crowdfunding success also “increases the probability of business
  partnerships and stronger customer base.
