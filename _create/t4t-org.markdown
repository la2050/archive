  We will conduct pre-then-post surveys with everyone who participates. Parents,
  young inventors, anyone who takes part will be asked to answer a few basic
  questions when they arrive. Questions about their level of interest in STEAM
  activities. And, when they complete their project they will answer the same
  questions. These findings will be compared to similar surveys we do in schools
  that have T4T.org inspired project based learning. The combined data will be
  available to schools, press and the educational community at large through
  open source data banks and research servers.

  T4T.org’s Pop-Up Makers’ Space will arrive in some of LA’s most underserved
  communities on a Saturday or Sunday. Our truck will pull up, drop down the
  sides, and set up the tables. Then, future inventors, scientists and
  researchers, from the local community go to work. These children are welcome
  to create, build and experiment. We will bring Laser cutters, 3D Printers and
  all the tools these young inventors need to realize whatever they can imagine.

  - Arts establishments
  - Manufacturing activity
  - Employment in the creative industries

  Our T4T.org traveling Makers Space will be filled with ReImagined Resources
  that will fill the truck and the imaginations of the young inventors who show
  up! The items we carry are colorful, open-ended materials being discarded by
  local manufacturers and would be headed for Landfill if we didn’t exist.
  Having a traveling Makers Space allows us to bring Science, Technology,
  Engineering, Art and Math (STEAM) Education to communities were this has only
  been a dream. We will have pop-up Makers Space in parks and school-yards
  around Los Angeles focusing our efforts in neighborhoods with Title 1 Schools
  with more than 80% free and reduces lunch programs. We wouldn’t be doing this
  on school-yards exclusively, it will simply be the way we identify the
  communities on our calendar. We will have Saturday and Sunday pop-up Makers
  Spaces in some of the most unlikely spots around town!
