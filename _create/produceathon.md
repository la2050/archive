  communities in creating compelling content about and technology solutions for
  pressing social challenges.

  Our approach unites civic leaders, city innovations teams, social innovation
  partners, and individual creators and changemakers. Through our events, we
  activate communities throughout LA to learn about relevant social issues and
  work together to raise awareness about and develop innovative technology
  solutions for them. We ensure systemic and sustainable activation by using the
  compelling video content and technology prototypes developed during our events
  to drive growth and progress year-round.

  Beyond fostering a sense of collaborative innovation, our events culminate
  with specific deliverables that ensuring the content and prototyped concepts
  produced live beyond a 72-hour period.



   ProduceAthon participants are divided up into teams during the event. Storytelling Teams and Tech Teams. While some team members develop actual content, videos, and prototype new technologies, other team members will be focused on strategy and growth pertaining to their projects.



   Storytelling Teams are responsible for delivering a Content Strategy Plan to ensure the cause they've worked on can use the content to (1) generate awareness (2) increase volunteerism (3) increase donations



   Tech Teams are responsible for delivering a business plan on how to fund, scale, and implement their proposed technology to address the social or city challenge they worked on.



   The best ideas are presented to a panel of judges and investors at event culmination -- during a Release Party.



   From there, the top two pitches will receive funding to implement their content strategy and business plan as well as access to resources, mentors, co-working spaces, and city officials for guidance that monitors progress and ensures sustainable and systemic growth.



   The more events we're able to host in a given year will increase and attract higher caliber participants and result in more innovative ideas and concepts.



   This, in turn, will generate greater interest among higher caliber investors and VCs.



   This is how we ultimately affect and increase the Patents per Capita, # of high growth startups, and VC investment.
project_proposal_engage: >-
  Our activation involves city-wide and county-wide impact, as we intend to
  partner with various city innovation teams across Los Angeles County who will
  act as our Social Innovation Partners.



   These partners offer insight on their most pressing social issues, along with desired success metrics they want to see directly impacted as a gauge for monitoring progress.



   By working with a county-wide range of social innovation partners, the ProduceAthon challenge prompts and themes will be relevant, current, and very specific to unique challenges that various parts of LA county face.



   We will also team up with educational and entrepreneurship institutions, who will act as mentors throughout the 72-Hour ProduceAthon duration. These experts will offer teams access to relevant tools needed in creating their deliverables, and guide them in optimizing their concepts and pitches for successful implemenation.



   ProduceAthon culminates with a release party, where team participants present their deliverables and pitch their concepts in front of a panel of judges and investors. The winning ideas will receive funding for implementation and well as access to mentors and resources to ensure and monitor progress.
