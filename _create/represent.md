  Represent School of Acting & Media Arts will work to educate diverse, aspiring
  media makers in the fields of acting, TV, screen & playwriting, & filmmaking &
  empower them by creating a pipeline for employment in the entertainment
  industry. Our goal is to place as many diverse individuals as possible in
  front of and behind the cameras.


  With these goals in mind, we will use the following as metrics for evaluating
  success of the program:

  •Number of applicants

  •Number of students that participate in the program

  •Percentage of students completing each respective course

  •Percentage of intermediate students that go on to the advanced course

  •Number of public attendees at master classes 

  •Number of agents that participate in the End of Year Showcases

  •Percentage of students gaining representation by an agent after the End of
  Year Showcases

  •Percentage of students who gain agent representation and also earn employment
  in their respective fields within 6 months to 1 year of program completion
  (i.e. book acting jobs, sell scripts, etc.)

  •Percentage of students still working in the entertainment industry 3-5 years
  post program completion


  Additionally, we will solicit feedback via surveys and interviews of students,
  instructors, & partnering agents & firms prior to, during, and post program.

  Represent School of Acting & Media Arts (RSAMA) will help make LA the best
  place to create by making the city home to the only nonprofit school focused
  on launching the careers of the next generation of diverse actors,
  screenwriters, playwrights, & filmmakers free of charge. 


  LA is the Entertainment Capitol of the World, consistently attracting talent
  from across the globe. The LA County Economic Development Corporation, in
  their 2012 analysis of the entertainment industry & the LA economy, noted that
  the entertainment industry is one of the largest & most economically
  significant industries in the county, & unique in its reliance on freelance
  talent such as actors, writers, & agents. 


  Unfortunately, according to the Media, Diversity, & Social Change Initiative
  of USC Annenburg’s September 2016 report, women, people of color, the LGBT
  community, & folks with disabilities are underrepresented & often
  misrepresented in media. This inequality is further exacerbated because costs
  to enter the industry, especially professional & technical training, are
  significant barriers to individuals from diverse backgrounds. 


  In order to diversify the entertainment industry & reach equal media
  representation in film, TV, & theater for the LGBT community, women, people of
  color, folks with disabilities, & all those living at the intersection of
  these identities, RSAMA will educate & empower the next generation of diverse
  media makers to gain employment in the creative industries. 


  As a new arts establishment, RSAMA will provide free intermediate & advanced
  courses in the fields of acting, TV, screen & playwriting, & filmmaking to
  diverse, aspiring media makers. During the 8-month course, our experienced
  instructors will deliver a top-notch curriculum & mentor students, grooming
  them for their future careers. Additionally, industry professionals will teach
  master classes on acting, TV, screen & playwriting, & filmmaking, which will
  be open to the public. 


  In order to empower our students to gain employment in the creative arts,
  RSAMA will create a pipeline to employment. We will provide students with
  professional headshots, opportunities to produce their own projects,
  representation by experienced agents at our End of Year Showcase, referrals to
  pro bono entertainment law services to help ink their first deals, & the
  promotion & community support instrumental to building & sustaining a
  successful career in the entertainment industry. 


  Each diverse graduate of RSAMA, as independent & freelance actors, writers &
  filmmakers, will have the skills & talent to employ agents & managers, build
  their brands as independent art establishments, & help change the face of
  entertainment. 


  By providing free media training & creating a pipeline to employment in the
  entertainment industry for historically underrepresented groups, RSAMA will
  help grow & diversify one of the largest industries in LA County & help make
  LA the best place to create.
