  Some quantifiable measurements that will be used to measure success of the art
  incubator will include the number of artists and students participating in
  programs, public event attendance, artworks created, cultural tourism growth,
  economic revenue to businesses, and increased creative placemaking.  These can
  be measured through qualitative surveys and interviews to students and local
  businesses assessing knowledge gained and capture economic data. 

  Metadata extraction from the Art Incubators social media accounts including
  Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, will also provide sentiment analytics:
  number of likes, shares, and visual visitors.  This real time community
  feedback and data from social media outlets is how success for our project
  will be measured.

  In the community of Pacoima, there is a growing momentum for arts & artistic
  expression with the development of the Celebrate Pacoima arts initiative. 
  This initiative will develop arts infrastructure, in the form of an arts
  incubator. Pacoima Beautiful (PB) is seeking funds to leverage an award of
  $100,000 that was provided by the National Endowment of the Arts to support
  the development of the incubator. The space is designed to connect, heal &
  inspire community members, local artists, students, businesses, civic leaders,
  & creative professionals while promoting creative environmental justice
  focused placemaking & economic development opportunities. 

  This project will make LA the best place to CREATE given the momentum & dire
  need for a safe creative space in the community. This space will play a role
  in ensuring that our community’s narrative continues to be told through the
  arts.  LA can only be the best place to CREATE when all Angelenos have
  equitable access to arts resources. 

  For over 20 years PB has worked at the intersection of land-use & safety, &
  through grassroots community engagement witnessed how the built environment
  impacts the community’s health & well being. Pacoima, a generally young
  community, where 22% of the population is under 18 years old (U.S. Census,
  2010) will have a new physical resource to ensure that the local youth have
  outlets for creative forms of self-expression and do not contribute to the
  intergenerational cycles of violence. Our youth are meaningful contributors in
  the social and economic aspects of community building, as are key adult
  stakeholders & civic leaders.  By engaging both youth and adults in the arts
  simultaneously, we will promote intergenerational communal interaction and
  foster tradition.  When youth are engaged in creative processes, they can be
  the change agent when it comes to promoting the power and preservation of
  spaces.  Therefore, when our community is reminded that they have the right to
  resources, ownership and connection to space, they develop a sense of
  stewardship which can lead to sustainability.

  To date, Pacoima does not have a formal art space that engages community at
  this level; despite the amazing talent, artistic momentum & support by
  stakeholders who have fallen in love with the colors & vibrant images that are
  present throughout our community.  The incubator will be that space.

  LA2050 support for this project will provide the community with multiple
  benefits. Tools, equipment and instructor stipends will be paid for with the
  LA2050 funds. By partnering with local organizations and artists, collectively
  we will inspire others to raise their voice and exercise a healthy form of
  self-expression while generating a creative outlet for economic advancement. 
  To advocate for & serve our monolingual Spanish population, programming will
  also be provided in Spanish, promoting multi-generational cross cultural
  connections & access to a creative dialogue.
