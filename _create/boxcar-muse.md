project_measure: "Success is significant and ongoing progress in the direction of our vision: to provide every woman with the inspiration, tools, space, and comradery she needs to live her fullest life. We measure it using an expanded form of the following dashboard:\n\nQuantitative\no\tMembers, participants\no\tMember retention\no\tReferrals\no\tActive sponsorships (20% min.)\no\tWomen we employ/contract\no\tWeb site visits converted to live visits\no\tVolunteer hours\no\tMembers within 5, 10, and 25 miles\n\nQualitative\no\tTestimonials\no\tMember-driven clubs\no\tProjects, businesses, collaborations, and hires “born in the boxcar”\no\tComparison of diversity index to local demographics\no\tPartnerships with local orgs\no\tRelationships formed\n\nWe use interview, survey, discussion, observation, and web analytics to collect data, allowing us to measure numbers but also to capture the relationships, emotion, and stories that are such strong indicators of our success.\n\nTake the bookkeeper who visits two or three times a month: she reads or builds something; she has easy conversation unrelated to work or family and even tells someone her middle name, unused since marriage; she leaves feeling healthy-minded and joyful. She doesn’t start a company or singing lessons, or write a memoir. She isn’t on a dashboard. But she’s also a success story. Because the process of creating or having a hobby “for its own sake” has healthy and transformative results, and ripple effects from a healthy community can spread across a city and beyond…"

  boxcar+muse will go from pop-up to permanent, providing its growing community
  with a year-round creative camp and learning lab, doubling its workshop series
  and club programming, and offering 130 new sponsorships for women. 


  By providing women with the inspiration, tools, space, and comradery for
  regular creative exercise and experiences, boxcar+muse hopes to democratize
  the process, making innovation and self-discovery outside of work or family a
  vital habit for Los Angeles women.

  Once our basic needs are met we graduate to deep and driving needs for
  belonging, challenge, accomplishment, and self-actualization. boxcar+muse
  exists to meet those needs by providing women with the inspiration, tools,
  space, and comradery they need to live their fullest lives.


  We envision a culture where flexing our creative muscles, innovating, and
  engaging in self-discovery is as accepted, vital, and popular a practice as is
  going to a gym or fitness class. boxcar+muse will help make LA the best place
  to CREATE by fostering this culture—welcoming women into an imaginative and
  safe space in which to work and play, providing creative tools and
  programming, and growing a diverse and inclusive community—and populating LA
  with the ideas, projects, businesses, relationships, and magical anecdotes
  that grow from it.


  As proof-of-concept in a temporary location, and in just six months,
  boxcar+muse has connected almost 100 diverse women, taking them on creative
  journeys together via expert-led workshops on subjects ranging from
  felt-making, gardening, and improv to decision-making, financial literacy, and
  goal-setting. We’ve hired over a dozen local artisans and experts and forged
  relationships with local studios and businesses. Many friendships and barters
  have sprung from the “boxcarmunity” as have several collaborations,
  professional opportunities, and at least two Etsy shops.


  We can do so much more!


  Opening our doors full time will enable us to expand membership and
  programming, to house tools and creative equipment, to set up private and
  shared work areas, and to provide members with the safe, un-programmed,
  do-whatever-you-want fallow time and space that’s necessary to both creative
  process and self-care. We’ll be able to multiply our work and play sponsorship
  and to formalize inclusion programs. We’ll also be able to increase the
  breadth and depth of our offerings when member-driven clubs like The
  Accomplices (for racial, gender, and economic anti-oppression training and
  action) or All Hands on Deck (for civic and social volunteering) have regular
  meeting space and resources, and when we can hire series leaders for the year
  rather than for a month at a time. And our curated space will allow us to both
  incubate and promote members’ work.


  boxcar+muse, itself a women-owned arts establishment, believes that inspiring
  women to regularly explore creativity and innovation like this will lead to
  gains in CREATE metrics like employment, arts establishments, women-owned
  firms, patents and manufacturing, and graduates-retention. We have already
  shown demonstrable and ongoing gains in CONNECT and PLAY metrics such as
  access to free WiFi, social and emotional support, cultural events, local
  social media friends and connections for Angelenos, and the number and quality
  of informal play spaces.


  We believe Los Angeles, and the world, will be a safer and even more
  magnificent place when women are continuously engaged in the joy of exercising
  their genius.
