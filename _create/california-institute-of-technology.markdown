  The goals of the project are to establish a pilot program that supports
  cleantech startups developing new energy and water efficiency technology, and
  introduces these new technologies into LAUSD operations faster and more
  efficiently, to provide strategic funding for these pilot trials to foster
  successful outcomes, and to develop a learning program for high school
  students who wish to explore becoming an cleantech entrepreneur.

  To measure our success Cleantech 2 Edtech will track the following: 

  •Number of cleantech companies who engage 

  •New technologies tested and their areas of application

  •Percent of tested technologies that could be adopted within the school system

  * School Engagement: number and staff

  * Student Engagement: number participating, and applicants

  •Company satisfaction with the program and percentage that will continue
  beyond the pilot phase

  •Educational institution satisfaction

  •Potential to scale the pilot and apply to the rest of the school system

  * Utility interest in expanding the program 

  •Rocket Fund impact: new funding opportunities for participating companies and
  engagement with new customers

  •Energy and water savings from piloted technologies

  Cleantech 2 Edtech will explore new clean energy and water technologies and
  work with LAUSD and the utilities to pilot them in the district. We will offer
  complementary education and internship opportunities for high school students
  interested in learning more. LAUSD and LADWP are developing pilot technologies
  for funding in a new Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”).  This project would
  complement their efforts and access funding both to educate and to develop 
  emerging efficiency technologies.

  Cleantech 2 Edtech will make LA the best place to create through nurturing the
  coming generation of cleantech innovators and the jobs they bring, helping
  schools secure cleaner energy and water more efficiently, and promoting a
  culture of energy awareness amongst the creative minds in our school system. 

  The cleantech industry is growing fast in Los Angeles.  With the opening of
  the Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator (LACI), more young companies are locating
  to Los Angeles and bringing with them diverse job opportunities, including
  software programmers and highly skilled technicians to build new cleantech
  devices.  Such jobs provide an opportunity for diverse communities to develop
  economically.  Cleantech 2 Edtech aims to support the growing cleantech boom
  and take awareness of these opportunities into LA’s schools, while helping the
  school system meet its energy efficiency goals by piloting these new
  technologies. 

  Cleantech 2 Edtech consists of three program elements.  The first comprises a
  process of identifying promising companies and their technologies suitable for
  incorporating into the school system, and helping to fulfill the energy
  efficiency and water conservation goals of the LAUSD and LADWP. These target
  technologies include advanced lighting, HVAC and building controls, and water
  and gas saving technologies, among others.  

  The second component will foster the success of these pilot trials by
  providing grant dollars through a supplement to Caltech’s existing FLoW –
  Rocket Fund program http://www.flow.caltech.edu/rocket-fund, and the
  LAUSD/LADWP pilot program, to support the development and field testing.  The
  Rocket Fund is sponsored by California’s six major utilities, including LADWP,
  as well as Caltech and the Moxie Foundation  http://www.moxiefoundation.org/
  and embraces the full range of cleantech innovation, including both energy and
  water efficiency technologies. 

  The third element incorporates an education module for motivated high school
  students focused on these efficiency technologies.  This module may feature
  on-the-job learning opportunities where students will be paired with cleantech
  startup companies. Working alongside the entrepreneurs they will learn the
  elements of entrepreneurship in a familiar setting.  This practical training
  will complement more formal high school education, with highly motivational
  real world experience and future job opportunities. 

  Cleantech 2 Edtech will allow the schools to reach their mandated energy
  efficiency goals faster, while creating an interactive and creative learning
  environment for its students. Enhancing opportunities for cleantech companies
  in Los Angeles will mean high-quality, better paying jobs for all, including
  the underserved communities.  This will also help provide a skilled workforce
  and idea pipeline for the already growing cleantech community in the region. 

  This program will be established at pilot sites within LAUSD, and if
  successful, rolled out more widely.
