  In 1978 World Famous VIP Records was opened in Long Beach , CA. In the 90s,
  founder Kelvin Anderson opened up a small studio in the back of the store to
  keep kids out of gangs. From the back of the store careers such as Snoop Dogg,
  Warren G and Nate Dogg were launched after they recorded their first demo for
  their group 213.



   For 40 year, a sign called the VIP sign sat on top of the store and most recently that sign became a Historic Landmark, making the only one of its kind in the world but the sign has been put in storage until we secure a home to open a museum.



   This has been a major loss for Long beach and tourist from around the world to came to see the sign.



   In the meantime, to keep the brand alive and to help create economic opportunities, we have secured a building on long beach blvd. which we currently need assistance in activating



    The space is about 5000 sq feet and another 2000 in the back of open space.



   Our plan is to open a business incubator and multi media center , music recording radio station and retail store in the front.



   The goal is to incubate an foster careers in the area of technology, music, non profit sector, broadcasting, writing and provide a 24 hour radio station that will deliver content through all digital platforms and that will be hosted by radio personalities from across la county.



   The space has several rooms and this is what each room will offer members.



   1. tech room with computers and printer and copiers

   2. Radio station that will air 24 hours a day through all digital platforms

   3. music recording studio

   4. Outside event and workspace

   5. Conference Room

   6. Green Screen Room

   7. Workspace room couches, tables etc

   8. Resource office



   Center Design



   The center will engage artist to create murals all over the walls to reflect the vip history and we will also work to create digital experiences throughout the center.



   Outside Design



   A replica VIP sign, from snoop doggs, first video will anchor the building, as seen in the attached image.



   Although the sign is no longer that color, the replica represents the ara that the young artists got their start in the 90s and gives the center a unique draw.



   We will be working to also assist entrepreneurs with financing through programs like Kiva and a partnership with the City of Long Beach.



   Community Engagement



   On going music, small business and other creative contests will be launched from the center to engage the community and to continue to foster engagement.



   Our open space, will be made available to non profits in our communities for meeting and event space to allow them the ability to collaborate and serve the health and well being of our communities.



   We are also located across the street from Public Transportation, metro , in a area that is undeserved with resources and small businesses.
