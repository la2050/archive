  due to the contribution of the many people, gymnasts and supporters, who are
  giving much to keep men's collegiate gymnastics viable and competitive on a
  NCAA level.  The team is not affiliated with one college, however the team
  members attend different colleges throughout LA and Southern California. As

  Four Rings will make LA the best place to create by cultivating growth for our
  vibrant and eclectic community. 


  Four Rings is preparing to become a premier facility with a sharp focus on the
  overall betterment of the human mind, body, spirit and soul through the four
  pillars in which the company is built on.  The four pillars unite to provide a
  synergetic platform, for Four Rings—a lifestyle brand dedicated to individual
  and collective growth through fitness, health, entertainment, and community.


  The company recently completed a strategic plan for the next three years. The
  next year will be focused on obtaining a facility and developing the Community
  and Entertainment pillars. 


  We have begun the process to acquire a facility that will house the Four Rings
  family.  The 35k sq.ft. facility will have a membership-based fitness gym with
  a functional movement component that is rooted in the traditions of artistic
  gymnastics.  The gym will be tandem to a beautifully designed and modern
  cafe.  The entire facility will be structured in a way that both entertainment
  and sporting events can be held. 


  Four Rings is a minority-owned company focused on supporting women and people
  of color in their growth. Four Rings, as part of the Community pillar, is
  currently focusing its energy on connecting visionaries.  We are developing a
  professional network for young entrepreneurs in the fitness and entertainment
  industries, whether the companies have been established for three years or
  three months. 


  This network will be able to attend quarterly events focused on service,
  growth, community building, and economic growth for these LA-based companies.
  Recruitment of business owners will be concentrated on business owners who are
  women and people of color and on companies serving marginalized communities. 


  We look to stimulate growth in the entertainment industry by connecting
  motivated and inspired entrepreneurs. Four Rings values innovation, and sees
  this network as a unique and refreshing way to support business development.
