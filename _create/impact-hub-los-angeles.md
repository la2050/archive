  Currently, there are 16 recruitment officers in the Recruitment and Education
  Division of the Los Angeles Police Department that work with the City of Los
  Angeles Personnel Department. We intended to provide the recruitment officers
  with the Virtual Reality modules so they can provide a wider base of
  candidates and a glimpse of how they can help make their city a safer place. 


  We will be providing the recruitment officers with a survey they can
  administrator to prospects before they try the Virtual Reality module as well
  as after the experience. Then, we will be tracking the police academy
  graduation rates of the applicants who were exposed to the virtual reality
  content. 


  We will also be implementing a new head tracking technology that will give us
  deeper insights and understanding for how users feel when they experience this
  content. This will be done by partnering with a Canadian technology company
  called Retinad

  Today, Los Angeles is one of the most ethnically and geographically diverse
  cities in the country. Its residents speak 224 languages and live in diverse
  communities. Los Angeles Police Department Officers are sworn to protect and
  to serve more than 4 million Angelenos within a sprawling 465 square mile
  jurisdiction. In order to effectively meet the needs of all of the city's
  residents, LAPD Officers work out of 18 divisions, patrolling in cars, boats,
  helicopters, bikes, horseback and on foot. 


  But perception of our nation's police force is at a historic low, potentially
  scaring off those very candidates who would be best suited for public service
  in Los Angeles. Virtual Reality In Blue will be a series of immersive stories
  that provide a glimpse into the day in the life of a officer with the hopes of
  recruiting non-traditional candidate to help upkeep the public safety of their
  community. 


  After decades of excitement, the medium of Virtual Reality has finally
  arrived. We believe it can change the way we play, work, learn, and
  communicate in the near future. Facebook/Oculus, Sony, LG, Samsung, HTC, and
  Google have all built their VR platforms, Goldman Sachs analysts predict that
  VR will be bigger than TV, and VR has helped UNICEF raise more than $1.5
  billion during fundraising events.


  It's clear that VR is here to stay. Most applications are currently being
  developed for entertainment, marketing, and gaming sectors. But how can we
  access this next generation tool today to create transformational narratives,
  more efficient protocols, and deeper connectedness that can generate valuable
  impact?


  In the form of a collaborative community project Impact Hub Los Angeles, the
  City of Los Angeles Personnel Department, Woodbury University’s
  Interdisciplinary Department and immersive technologies consultancy,
  FutureSculpt are set to explore how we can recruit the next generation of
  police officers who reflect the value of their communities and can become an
  advocate for all Angelenos.
