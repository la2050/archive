  By activating the implementation of our technology platform we will be able to
  increase our efforts and expand our bandwidth to engage and target thousands
  of LA artists. 
   
   By providing a platform for LA artists to start sol proprietorships and become a strong entrepreneur force, we will directly influence arts establishtments in LA and venture capitalist will be attracted to our technology and our market place of thriving LA artists. 
   
   
   
   Revolutionize Hollywood will position itself as a high growth start up and an incubator of fast growing LA creative companies. 
   
   
   
   During activation we will work closely in underserved communities including Watts, Willowbrook and Compton to begin to provide education on how to enter in the creative sector in LA. In addition we will curate minority and women owned creative firms to fuel economic growth amongst artist in these areas. This will result in healthy, equitable and creative communities and tackle the income inequality in LA. 
   
   
   
   We will connect LA creatives with other LA creatives, and LA creatives with LA industry professionals to help provide real opportunities for visibility for future jobs. We also will use this activation as a platform to bridge social gaps 
   
   
   
   With the new gig economy workforce, we feel education on entrepreneurship and mentorship specifically targeted for artists is essential to making LA a better place to create. 
   
   
   
   
   
   In order for creative professionals to stick around LA well after graduation, LA students must be given real life tools to manage expectations while in school. Our ArTrepreneur curriculum, will focus on developing a sustainable clear career path and will teach artist how to approach their careers with an entrepreneurial mindset so that they grow with structure, increase earning potential and sustain longevity in the creative sectors.
   
   In addition we predict we will see an increase of patent applications, small business and sol propriertor firms opening.

   We will measure this through the combined usage of facebook analytics, survey monkey, testimonials, qualitative and quantitative data to track the project, active users and community supporters.

   We will also track e-commerce sells, mentorship and internship hours.
   
    
   
   In conclusion, the steps we use to measure our success and collaborations are as follows:
