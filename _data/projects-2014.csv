4102004,Alliance Mentoring Program (AMP),"AMP is a one year, peer mentor college transition program to strengthen college matriculation and persistence of Alliance alumni.",Learn,2013005,2014,,,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,LA County,"AMP provides incoming Alliance college freshman with peer mentors who are successful second and third year Alliance college students. Through regular meetings and coaching which begin in the final semester of high school through the first year of college, mentors provide personal guidance and counseling to support the new college students' seamless transition into college, as well as success in that critical first year of college. AMP builds both mentor and mentee development by encouraging growth in the areas of leadership, communication, self-direction, and problem solving skills. In 2014-15, AMP will expand to include 700 Alliance college freshman and 100 mentors who attend 12 southern California colleges & universities.","Alliance begins by identifying mentors from Alliance alumni who are in their second or third year of college at one of the 12 largest feeder colleges for Alliance graduates. Potential mentors are nominated by Alliance teachers and administrators, interviewed and rated based on their academic success, resilience, campus involvement, time management, and willingness to commit to the program for a year. As the program expands, mentor recruitment will expand to include the existing pool of mentees who have successfully moved on to their second year of college. 
 
 After mentors are secured, mentee recruitment begins in April at 13 participating Alliance high schools. All Alliance students attending the targeted post-secondary institutions are eligible to participate and are highly encouraged to do so via an introductory program presentation that occurs during the school day at participating high school sites. Potential mentees provide personal and academic information that assists in developing the most productive mentor/mentee pairings. 
 
 The relationship between the mentor and the mentee is paramount to the success of the program. Mentees are placed in groups led by a mentor using information gathered during the recruitment process. After the group placements are completed, all AMP participants (mentors and mentees) meet at the high school site, prior to high school graduation. The purpose of these kick-off events is to enhance the bond between mentors and mentees and between mentees themselves. Mentors meet with their mentees formally four times throughout the school year to discuss specific topics related to the mentees integration into college life. Additionally, mentors and mentees are encouraged and often meet more frequently and informally throughout the year. 
 
 Mentors receive monthly professional development in a group setting to encourage collaboration and learning among mentors. Curriculum for the mentors is research-based and includes such topics as professional communication, data tracking, time management, leadership training, and problem solving skills. Additionally, professional development sessions include self-reflection, sharing of best practices, providing relevant feedback on AMP, and celebrating successes. 
 
 AMP mentors also work closely with the 12 colleges and universities, ensuring mentees are successfully integrated into existing university-based programs for first year and first generation college students.","On average, college graduates have healthier, more productive and civically engaged lives. College graduate are two times more likely to vote than those without a degree, will earn 66% more income over their lifetime, are 67% less likely to live in poverty, and are two times more likely to volunteer. 
 
 Nationally, only 8.3 percent of low-income students earn a bachelor’s degree by their mid-20s. In Los Angeles Unified School District where 77% of students live in households so poor that they qualify for the federal Free and Reduced Lunch program, the importance of increasing college going and graduation rates are important for the long-term health of the economic, civic and cultural life of Los Angeles and for all its students. 
 
 Even for those high school graduates who go to college, nearly 50% do not graduate within 5 years. Research demonstrates that the majority of college dropouts happen in the first year with more than 30% of college freshmen quitting by the end of their freshman year. For low-income, first generation college students, this first year dropout rate is even more pronounced. As striking, anywhere from 10-40% of students experience ""summer melt"", the phenomenon in which students are accepted to college, but never actually attend college. Again, low-income and first generation students experience “summer melt” at far higher rates. 
 
 While Alliance students graduate high school and are accepted to college at rates significantly higher than their peers in LAUSD and the state, first year college persistence rates for our alumni mirror national trends. For each graduating class, 65% to 70% of students persist through the first year of college into the second. 
 
 In the first two years of AMP, the ""summer melt"" rate decreased from 22% to 15% and first year persistence rates increased from 85% to 90%. 
 
  AMP provides an innovative and sustainable way to support low-income students in their transition into and through that first critical year of college, significantly increasing their likelihood of post-secondary degree attainment and as a result a healthier, more productive and civically engaged life. 
 
 AMP also offers a unique partnership model between K-12 school districts and post-secondary institutions to support the seamless and successful transition into and through the first year of college.","The immediate beneficiaries of AMP are the low-income students participating in the program -- both the incoming college freshman mentees and second and third year college peer mentors. AMP will increase mentee first year college completion rates and increase significantly their odds of graduating from college. AMP mentors also gain valuable leadership and work-readiness skills as part of the program. 
 
 AMP will also benefit the participating colleges and universities, strengthening the first year programming and persistence rates for its students. AMP students provide a systematic feedback and evaluation loop to inform universities about the efficacy of their first year and first generation programs. 
 
 Longer term, the beneficiaries will be the families and the communities of the AMP students. A college education changes more than just the life of a student, it has the power to change an entire community. Those with a college degree are more likely to be active in their neighborhoods by volunteering and voting in local elections. Most importantly, college graduates serve as role models for their families, friends and neighbors, inspiring them to follow in their footsteps.","In addition the Alliance the College Success Team at Alliance College-Ready Public Schools, the following Alliance high schools' college counseling programs participate in AMP: Alliance Dr. Olga Mohan High School, Alliance Gertz-Ressler High School, Alliance Patti & Peter Neuwirth High School, Alliance Cindy and Bill Simon Technology High School, Alliance Health Services Academy High School, Alliance Marc and Eva Stern Math Science High School, Alliance Tennenbaum Family Technology High School, Alliance Judy Ivie Burton Technology High School, Alliance Environmental Science and Technology High School, Alliance Collins Family College-Ready High School and Alliance Media Arts and Entertainment Design. In 2014-15, Alliance College-Ready Academy High School 16 will join the program. 
 
 Participating community colleges include East Los Angeles College, Pasadena City College, El Camino College, Santa Monica College, and Los Angeles City College. Participating four year universities include Cal State Los Angeles, Cal State Dominguez Hills, Cal State Northridge, Cal Poly Pomona, UCLA, UC Riverside, and UC Irvine. 
 
 The colleges and universities provide vital first year services to incoming freshman, including academic preparedness resources (via tutoring services, counseling, workshops and school orientation programs) and financial hardship resources (via financial aid, financial counseling, and work study). Additionally, several participating colleges visit Alliance high school campuses to educate and enroll incoming Alliance freshman in first year, university-based support programs and placement exams. Others have hosted orientation days specifically for Alliance alumni and incoming Alliance freshman, including discussion of the peer mentoring program. 
 
 Alliance through its college counselors, AMP coordinators and, most importantly, AMP mentors provide the necessary social and cultural capital to leverage the resources provided by the colleges and universities. Alliance mentors serve as extended outreach for college and university first-year completion programs.",0
4102005,Connecting Voices Building Power: Resident Led Community Planning,ACT-LA is bringing Angelenos together to vision a well connected Los Angeles through transit and healthy neighborhoods.,Connect,2013007,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050connect/projects/ConnectingVoices.html,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,"ACT-LA will make LA the best place to Connect because we will develop a cadre of Angelenos with skills and ability to shape the future of development around transit. Los Angeles is undergoing a significant transformation with an aggressive light rail expansion and growing movement of getting people of their cars and using active transportation. The investment in public transportation will have a direct effect to the built environment and if directed well can support improvement 6 of the 8 LA2050 indicators, in particular housing, health, environmental quality, and social connectedness.","ACT-LA seeks to advance a citywide transit equity campaign that will ensure the new transit system will work as planned – encourage healthy lifestyles, lowering environmental and climate impacts, and driving economic opportunity that benefits everyone in Los Angeles including those communities already located around transit corridors. 
 
 Currently, ACT-LA has a community working on developing curriculum to build collective resident leadership. The sessions are being held in various neighborhoods throughout the city along with community transit tours. ACT-LA membership groups bring people together at a neighborhood level and are working to build resident relationships across neighborhoods to develop a citywide policy which will enhance the unique character of each neighborhood while providing for the necessary neighborhood improvements. With the support of LA2050 we will build on our work and expand the platforms in which residents can be involved in the campaign. 
 
 ACT-LA will build popular momentum for equitable transit development by:
 1) Having resident organizing committees in at least three council districts.
 2) Hosting quarterly community transit tours for residents and elected officials.
 
 In addition to creating the spaces for in person dialogue and discussion and increase opportunities for residents to connect, ACT-LA will:
 1) Develop and implement a marketing and communications plan to increase knowledge of transit oriented development.
 2) Host at least two twitter parties as a space to gather qualitative data for the transit oriented development policy.
 3) Increase the use of social media to engage supporters and allies in the policy development.","Imagine a Los Angeles where residents are coming together to dialogue and develop solutions with the intention of solving the most challenging issues facing Los Angeles. Spaces where competing interests are put on the table and worked through to create policies which will support the people in most need. Through this project and the work of our coalition partners ACT-LA is working to transform how decision making is made in Los Angeles. We are creating spaces for people who have been cast to the sidelines of government processes to engage. 
 
 An ACT-LA value is that all people have the right to participate in the political decisions that affect their lives, and the low-income communities and communities of color who ride our buses, live along our rail lines, and work in our businesses should have priority in deciding our future. We believe in strong leadership development for those who are most affected by decisions. This starts with key member organizations who have an engaged based of community residents. Those member organizations have regular convening for their constituents to engage in educational, skill building and strategy sessions.","ACT-LA will benefit all Angelenos by creating space and momentum for a citywide equitable transit development policy. Our coalition is turning the trickle-down theory upside down by having the heart of the community engagement efforts focus on the most vulnerable populations. By engaging, strengthening, and fostering opportunities for the largest segment of Angelenos, we believe we will make Los Angeles a better place for everyone. 
  
 We will be focused on connecting people who live around transit and use transit in discussions of how transit development can support a healthy environment for everyone. Our primary constituents through our member organizations are low-income renters of color. Los Angeles’ highly transit-impacted neighborhoods are 96% or more people of color. In Los Angeles, workers earning less than $25,000 use transit more than twice as often as higher earners and make up 75% of all riders. Our member organizations are deliberate in organizing and reaching all ages, gender and sexual orientation. Our base includes families with young children, young adults, and seniors. 
 
 ACT-LA’s members work with low-income community members who depend on a strong public transportation system to reach work, recreation, home and other daily needs. More transit options such as rail stops and improvements in bike and pedestrian infrastructure can help these residents only if they are able to remain living around these amenities. ACT-LA members have seen firsthand the effects of smart growth policies being enacted without equity in mind: resident displacement, business destruction, increases in eviction, loss of affordable housing, and a host of other related issues connected to transit impacts. It is because of these first-hand experiences at the neighborhood level that ACT-LA members have come together to encourage passage of a Citywide equitable TOD ordinance that will help prevent displacement and maintain and strengthen the economic and cultural fabric of these communities.","Alliance for Community Transit-LA (ACT-LA) was formed by organizations in Los Angeles with policy advocacy, grassroots organizing, and community economic development expertise to unite separate neighborhood voices into a citywide voice for equitable transit investment. In 2010, we hosted two summits where over 40 organizations from diverse sectors participated including representation from labor, community organizing, environmental justice, transit equity, and affordable housing developers. Founding organizations remain active host committee members today and the coalition has 22 active member organizations.
 Since its inception, ACT-LA has served as the primary vehicle for regional collaboration amongst grassroots organizations and advocacy organizations to convene around the intersection of transportation, housing, public health, and environmental issues in Los Angeles. Three areas critical to our existing and continued success are:
 • Coalition values: ACT-LA spent time developing values for our work and all member organizations sign on to the values. We use them in our program and policy development as well as how we operate as a coalition. 
 • Strong internal communication: Ensuring all members are informed and connected to the work is critical to successful collaboration.
 • Holding the whole: Each partner brings strengths and different areas of focus. As a coalition we hold everyone’s priorities and work to move issues together because of their interconnectedness.",

 We plan to host the first major festival over two days in fall 2015, with the core event in Grand Park in DTLA. The event will feature three stages of live entertainment & speakers, with interactive technology integrated into the lifeblood of the event.","We're going to be working with a variety of partners to coordinate the capstone event of LA Innovation Week 2014 on October 11th of this year. That event will bring together partners from around LA to connect and celebrate a successful week of events highlighting and celebrating innovation and creativity in our city, and will kick off the planning stages for Innovation Week and the capstone Creative Capital Fest in fall 2015.
 
 With the LA2050 grant, we will host a series of convenings with LA creative and civic leaders to refine our shared vision and develop a common agenda for the citywide event we'll host together, as well as create content for a citywide crowdfunding campaign alongside core partners to raise grassroots funds and build serious buzz behind our movement. We'll also use some of these initial funds to formalize a relationship with a major festival production company that will work with us throughout the planning process and help to bring in large sponsors that will make this event even more viable.
 
 We've had conversations with multiple major festival production companies that have bought into our vision and will be invaluable partners as we aim to quickly scale up this event. We've quickly realized that this is an idea that sells itself, and with a major event production company as a partner and a large-scale, inclusive, and collaborative strategic planning process we know that this vision will scale quickly.","It's no secret that LA is home to more innovators, entrepreneurs, entertainers, creators, visionaries, and dreamers than just about any place on earth. But while we have had great success exporting our dreams to the world, we aren't yet home to a single world class event (think SXSW, Disrupt) that brings people together to celebrate innovation and creativity happening right here in LA - to attract investors and entrepreneurs from around the world, to inspire and retain young and talented Angelenos, to facilitate cross-sector connection and collaboration, to give back to orgs making our city better - and to have way too much fun.
 
 It's time to shine the spotlight on LA.
 
 Creative Capital Fest will be a world class, citywide event that shows off LA as a global creative capital, facilitates greater collaboration between LA's creative industries, and attracts the best and brightest investors and entrepreneurs to our city. Angelenos are yearning for a world class showcase event - let's create it together.","This event will connect LA startups and social entrepreneurs to capital. Founders to talent. Creative leaders in LA's diverse creative industries to one another. It will play a major role in branding LA as a ""creative capital"" - as a place for dreamers and doers to accomplish big things. Today, we are forced to look outside our home, to Austin, to the Bay, to Chicago, or New York to showcase our projects. This limits the opportunity to only those who can make the journey, while providing outsized benefit to the people in those towns. SXSW alone contributed over $200M to the Austin economy in 2014. Think of what that revenue would do for business owners in Los Angeles.
 
 Beneficiaries of this event will include:
 
 Existing LA companies - a chance to show off LA companies and products to the world.
 
 Young entrepreneurs and college students in Los Angeles - an opportunity to connect with, be inspired by, and identify employment opportunities with innovative companies, organizations, and thought leaders that are based right here in LA. 
 
 LA's startup community - Silicon Beach LA, Bixel Exchange, and other organizations are already doing amazing work to build up and connect LA's startup community, and this event will represent a complementary opportunity.
 
 Up-and-coming LA musicians and entertainers - major showcase opportunity
 
 Creative Los Angeles nonprofits and social enterprises - a large percentage of revenue from the event will be allocated in the form of Creative Capital Grants to organizations making our city a better place to live and create, and the festival will be a fantastic showcase opportunity for LA's creative do-gooders.
 
 Investors in LA and elsewhere - an event that attracts investors and consumers to LA, and an opportunity for investors to connect with startups and companies in Los Angeles
 
 Los Angeles entertainment lovers - a world class music and entertainment event

While many of the historic and diverse homes and apartments in the neighborhood are being lovingly restored, the same cannot be said for the commercial enterprises on these key boulevards. We want to revitalize the commercial nature of the boulevards by attracting new types of businesses to better serve the needs of the residents. We want to create a neighborhood-serving commercial zone that is pedestrian friendly and easily accessible to local residents in one of the most diverse and dynamic communities in Los Angeles.","The project is going to be a grass roots effort of volunteers and stakeholders who are residents, business operators and property owners in the neighborhood. It will be a collaboration of residents, artists, merchants and owners who share a common vision of an improved and better neighborhood. It will be a bottom up effort to get individuals to take action to improve their properties and to own the improvements. It will rely on sweat equity and donations to plant trees, renovate or install street landscaping, paint buildings and beautify signage to provide an esthetically pleasing environment that serves the needs of the adjacent residents.","The current businesses do not reflect the diversity of the current residents and serve only a narrow spectrum of the population. There is ample space available to provide incubator space at affordable rents and to broaden the offering of services, provide creative spaces for artists and vary the types of businesses present. This is the critical combination necessary to create dynamic and attractive city environments as described by Jane Jacobs in her landmark book ""The life and death of great American cities"". The objective is not to ""gentrify"" the neighborhood by displacing current residents and merchants but to enhance what is already here by using vacant or underutilized commercial space and vacant properties to expand services and the types of economic activities and employment opportunities currently available in order to reflect the diversity of the residents to its fullest extent.","The residents, both current and future, will benefit from the greater diversity and beauty of these key corridors that are adjacent to downtown LA and serve as connectors to the West Side. It will enhance and expand revitalization efforts occurring in downtown, South Park and La Brea Ave. Greater presence of people and foot traffic also enhances safety and the sense of community of the residents. The City of LA will benefit as the volunteers will perform many of the services the City can no longer afford to provide at adequate service levels and will result in a better tax base for the City as well. It will also provide more employment opportunities for residents and greater incomes for the merchants. We also expect to enhance the cultural offerings of the neighborhood with the attraction of additional artists and artisans to the neighborhood.","There are a number of organizations and individuals currently active in the types of endeavors we intend to foster as a grassroots incubator and provider of information, talent and support for the improvement efforts. The West Adams Heritage Association has been active in the area for 30+ years, we have a very strong neighborhood council presence in the community and many individuals are already sponsoring and/or paying out of their own pocket for key preservation, restoration and revitalization activities. The idea of our organization is to bring all of these groups together who have until now not acted in concert. In particular there has not been a conscious and organized effort to reach out to merchants and the owners of the properties. Most revitalization and restoration efforts have focused on the residential aspects of the neighborhood and have not forged the critical link to the business community and commercial property owners, both groups whom we intend to integrate into these projects. As a grassroots effort, we intend to rely on the sweat equity of those in the community. This is to be a bottoms-up effort that will gain momentum from actions taken by others that will inspire new efforts by others. We want the participants to ""own"" the improvements and to inspire others to do their small part that will make an enormous contribution to the community.",1
4102003,Disrupt Violence: Hot Zones into Play Zones,"Disrupt Violence trains former gang members to disrupt the deadly cycle of gang violence, creating family and neighborhood safety in L.A.",Play,2014003,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050play/projects/DisruptViolence.html,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,Antelope Valley,"In L.A.’s gang violence hot zones people are too afraid to play, or ride their bikes, or go to the park. But there are unexpected neighborhood heroes that disrupt the deadly cycle of violence: former gang members who have had enough. When there’s a 3 am shooting, a gang interventionist is there to comfort the survivors, control rumors, stop retaliation, broker peace, and connect families to much-needed services. Advancement Project’s Urban Peace Academy partners with them to effectively disrupt violence through a rigorous training program. The Academy also trains other frontline people in hot zones, such as social workers, hospital staffers, and therapists – all necessary to change the future of gang-involved youth and their families.","Advancement Project’s Urban Peace Academy will train at least 60 gang interventionists in cutting-edge violence disruption. There will be seven training sessions over 12 months: two 12-week training sessions for entry-level gang interventionists; and five one-day intensive workshops provided with our partner gang intervention organization, V2K HELPER Foundation, for at least 250 professionals who want to build skills in engaging gang-involved youth and families. 
 
 Launched in 2008, the Urban Peace Academy focuses on relationship-based gang intervention: using a worker’s “License to Operate”, or street credibility, to intervene in a neighborhood to reduce violence. Interventionists can only serve communities in which they have a License to Operate, and through this project the Urban Peace Academy will develop interventionists from neighborhoods in need across L.A.
 
 The trainings for gang interventionists will focus on a wide array of topics: Mediation & Conflict Resolution; Incident Response; Interaction with Law Enforcement; Victim Services; Experiences with Trauma; Ethnic Dynamics; Hospital- and School-Based Intervention; Gangs, Technology & Social Media; and more.
 
 The training also emphasizes working in collaboration with professionals in other sectors to maximize violence reduction efforts, e.g., community-based organizations, emergency room personnel, mental health providers. The second set of trainings in this project will address these and other stakeholders. Working with our partner, V2K HELPER Foundation, we will recruit and train diverse groups of professionals to understand gangs in L.A., with a strong emphasis on building the skills needed to engage gang-involved youth and their families. Successful disruption of the cycle of violence will require understanding multiple cultures: racial/ethnic, gang, and interfamilial.
 
 For both sets of trainees, the Urban Peace Academy’s teaching methodology blends street-level and practitioner-based knowledge with academic literature. Participants learn about gang intervention conceptually, through hands-on practice, and in relation to their own individual experiences. Our training methods are creative, collaborative, and emphasize equality between teacher and learner, especially important when engaging non-traditional learners such as formerly incarcerated gang members. They range from group discussion, lecture, multi-media presentations, to role play, the Socratic Method, and team-building activities.","The greenest park, newest playground, or highest-quality program can’t make a difference in the lives of Angelenos unless they feel safe enough to use them. Gang interventionists work in “hot zones” - communities with particularly high levels of gang violence, especially as compared to surrounding neighborhoods. In a hot zone, even walking to school is a battle. As one youth in Watts described in a focus group we conducted: “It’s not even about learning anymore. It’s about survival. Just get there and get back home.”
 
 The Urban Peace Academy helps make L.A. the best place to play today by working immediately to reduce and prevent violence, making poor neighborhoods safer so that children can learn, families can thrive, and communities can prosper. As we plan for 2050, Advancement Project knows that when violence is reduced, more and more resources become available, families become stronger over the years due to the efforts of local service providers, and neighborhoods can be revitalized. 
 
 Many communities are isolated because of high levels of violence. After gang interventionists work to establish or restore peace in an area, community-based organizations can provide services – to individuals, as well as their families. The Urban Peace Academy will have trained these professionals how to coordinate with gang interventionists, helping to strengthen youth and their family members, breaking the intergenerational cycle of violence that is present in many gang-entrenched neighborhoods. Breaking that cycle is a step toward bringing crime down, and bringing people out from behind their locked doors to interact with each other and enjoy their community. 
 
 The Urban Peace Academy has worked extensively with the L.A. Mayor’s Office of Gang Reduction & Youth Development (GRYD) to train gang intervention workers in Summer Night Lights, GRYD’s summer violence reduction strategy. It provides evening and late-night family-friendly programming in parks in hot zones during the critical months when much crime is committed by and against youth. The results have been transformative in Summer Night Lights neighborhoods: gang-related crime reduced by over 15%; 35% fewer gang-related homicides. We have also observed that after GRYD launched the program and it became apparent that the parks were safe spaces, more and more service providers joined the effort and provided their programming as part of the strategy, and increasingly, throughout the year as their regular work.","The Urban Peace Academy will benefit the communities most impacted by violence throughout Los Angeles County, as many interventionists grew up and hold a License to Operate in these places. In a hot zone community, even walking to school is a battle. In our research report, “Community Safety Scorecard: Los Angeles”, published in 2011, the least safe ZIP codes in the city generally experienced two times the gang related crime as the city as a whole, and almost twice the rate of violent crime and child abuse.
 
 We expect that the project would benefit multiple communities in the City of Los Angeles, unincorporated areas of LA County, and cities from San Fernando in the north to Long Beach in the south. Our partner, V2K HELPER Foundation, will leverage its relationship with a mental health services provider that works with gang-involved youth and their families in Torrance, Downtown Los Angeles, Hollywood, Compton, and Carson to recruit professionals to participate in the training to improve their effectiveness in working with these families. Lastly, the Urban Peace Academy has a direct benefit on the gang interventionists and community professionals who successfully complete the training, and learn the role that they can play in ensuring the safety of children and families.","Advancement Project has confirmed its partnership with V2K HELPER Foundation to implement the Urban Peace Academy for the My LA 2050 Grants Challenge. V2K HELPER Foundation brings the added benefit of extensive knowledge and experience in engaging families of gang-involved youth in high-violence communities. Founded in 1999, V2K HELPER Foundation (formerly known as Venice 2000) is a nonprofit organization originally established to provide gang intervention and prevention services. Since that time, the organization has come to view “community-intervention” services as a critical need to combat gang-related violence, the destruction of our communities, and the loss of our young people to the lure of the underground economy. The goal of V2K HELPER Foundation is to provide the resources and guidance to help struggling youth and community members of all ages make the transition from negative, anti-social behavior to positive, value-centered alternatives. 
 
 As instructors and consultants, their staff provide the necessary practical expertise to educate service providers, especially social workers and mental health professionals, about gang intervention to support these vulnerable families. They excel at helping these professionals become more knowledgeable about gang dynamics, and thus, more effective in their service provision. As mentioned previously, they have a relationship with a large mental health services provider in LA County that works with gang-involved youth and their families. V2K HELPER Foundation will use that relationship to recruit participants for the trainings.
 
 Our two organizations have worked together since 2008, essentially since the launch of the Urban Peace Academy, which V2K HELPER leadership helped to start. We regularly partner with them to conduct trainings on gang intervention in communities throughout California; and they support the periodic revision and improvements to the Urban Peace Academy curriculum.
 
 Three factors critical to the success of our proposal collaboration are:
 V2K HELPER Foundation’s demonstrated ability to collaborate
 Our long history of working together

 The impact of ABF with its seasoned staff proposes real solutions to the growing problems of California’s overcrowded prisons and food injustice in LA’s low-income neighborhoods. 
 
 ABF aims to grow the scale of its operations by forging partnerships with existing reentry housing programs for the formerly incarcerated throughout the region of LA in order to create more urban farms for growing organic food, training and employing urban farmers, and gathering and synergizing community members around this effort.","ABF supports the formerly incarcerated in their transition from prison isolation to community integration. In order to successfully reintegrate, people require the chance for community, productivity and the experience of self-worth. 
 
 Through ABF, women and men have an opportunity to develop a variety of job and life skills as urban farmers. They serve the community by growing food for families in need and for restaurants providing locally sourced and organic food. They serve their own families through education about healthy nutrition and through developing strong work ethic and habits in an organization that prioritizes ethical business practices and excellence in the work we deliver. 
 
 The manifestation of this idea to create an LA of reintegration through urban farming is a dynamic process of DIALOGUING, DIGGING, and DELIVERING. This project of creating opportunities for the formerly incarcerated begins with dialogue between ABF and its partner-organizations and partner-landowners. Mindful of the particular and distinct roles among organizations that work with and for the formerly incarcerated, ABF listens carefully to its partners’ needs. This ensures careful planning for the creation of a sustainable urban farm. 
 
 Following dialogue is digging – the process of turning over soil and uncovering the potential of the land. This project phase of digging includes designing and implementing the edible landscape and water-wise irrigation made up of raised beds for vegetables, pollinator beds with California-friendly plants, and drip irrigation systems for efficient watering. 
 
 The third phase of project implementation is delivering harvest for two primary reasons, outreach and revenue. A portion of the harvest from these urban farms will provide individuals and families in low-income neighborhoods with affordable and healthy seasonal food while an allotment supplies seasonal ingredients to restaurants for revenue to sustain this endeavor. 
 
 This project of community-supported reintegration of the formerly incarcerated is a reminder that all in LA are stakeholders for making LA the best place in the world to create, learn, play, connect and be the healthiest place to live. The interdependence of lives and landscapes in LA consolidates a collective voice that exclaims a sense of shared ownership that this is OUR LA.","With its partner-organizations, ABF will make LA the best place to create today because its collaborative urban farming project proactively engages and empowers the diversity of lives and landscapes to hold a stake in making LA the best place to create a better tomorrow. 
 
 Today’s headlines of the ever-increasing levels of incarceration and overcrowded prisons, the escalating health challenges of overweight and obese children and adults, and the proliferation of food deserts that lack ready access to fresh, healthy and affordable foods in LA’s urban neighborhoods are intertwined symptoms stemming from the devastation of human isolation. 
 
 Like preparing soil for seed sowing, ABF and its partners work to integrate the formerly incarcerated into the larger community by continually amending the attitude of the larger community through opportunities for interaction around the activity of urban farming, food delivery and nutrition education in addition to continuing advocacy efforts. 
 
 This is a necessary step taken for preparing the larger community to extend its welcome. ABF, along with our urban farmers and partners, will also be transforming landscapes within communities, helping to shift the relationships between residents and the spaces they inhabit. 
 
 Through urban farming today, persons – formerly incarcerated and not – integrate into renewed spaces: backyards re-created into urban farms and drought-tolerant landscapes that welcome home birds, bees, and bugs that we all rely upon for LA’s well being.
 
 The LA of 2050 holds promise as LA today participates actively and consciously in the process of reintegrating and welcoming home the prisoner, re-purposing backyards into urban farms and, ultimately, creating an ecology of interdependence. 
 
 According to James Jiler in Doing Time in the Garden, “Many of the ‘pristine’ forests in the Central American jungles are nothing more than overgrown kitchen gardens established by the Mayan Indians centuries ago.” LA today could leave its legacy for the LA in 2050 and future generations by integrating the diversity of life and installing urban farms that will provide for LA’s fruitful future. Reintegrating the formerly incarcerated creates greater diversity in the LA community while repurposing backyards into urban farms is the beginning to the 2050 LA food forest.","The complexity of interdependent relationships connected to ABF’s vision for LA speaks to some of the beneficiaries. We anticipate the primary beneficiaries of this project will include the diverse population of the formerly incarcerated who, with the support of ABF and its partners, have a new opportunity as urban farmers to pursue their dreams of becoming productive, creative members of the community on their return home. The urban farmers participating in ABF will bring benefits to their families and neighbors through setting alternate examples for behavior, productivity and creativity within the community. 
 
 While this opportunity in urban farming provides immediate job and life skills, this project gradually unlocks the potential of persons once in the custody of the criminal justice system to serve as custodians and caretakers of the communities in which they live. The ripple effect of reintegrating those who were formerly incarcerated restores their identity as family members and community contributors.
 
 Extending benefits beyond the personal lives of the formerly incarcerated, this project has a larger and direct impact within the communities that welcome urban farming. More specifically, there is an outreach component of this project that impacts low-income neighborhoods. 
 
 Additionally, the impact of this project benefits local chefs and restaurants by supplying restaurants with locally sourced, organic seasonal ingredients. Chefs will get to know their grower personally, source their ingredients locally, and more importantly participate in the promotion of this project to a wider audience. One example of the long-term benefits of more restaurants sourcing locally and organically grown produce is the generation of more urban farming jobs in LA. 
 
 The organic method of growing food honors the social contract between our life and the land. Introducing organic amendments to nourish the soil creates another world or beneficial microbes that, in turn, make soil healthy and fertile for plant growth. The organic method of managing pests with companion planting and habitat restoration for birds, bees, and bugs pays attention to the smaller life forms often overlooked but crucially relied upon for the healthy growth of plants. 
 
 This project honors the complex of interdependent relationships between life in its many diverse forms and landscapes.","ABF has both confirmed and pending collaborators on this project. These partner organizations include restorative justice ministries, reentry housing programs, local businesses, schools and churches. 
 
 Notably, ABF’s new partnership with The Francisco Homes (TFH), a transitional housing for the formerly incarcerated, provides an opportunity for a larger impact. The singular impact of this collaboration between ABF and TFH rests upon these three factors that ensure the success of this endeavor: 1) combination of resources, 2) complementary services for the formerly incarcerated, and 3) consolidation of support to reintegrate the formerly incarcerated into community.
 
 While ABF emphasizes reintegration through urban farming, and TFH places emphasis on reentry housing, both ABF and TFH work complementarily. The work of reintegration through this collaboration mutually strengthens our respective missions and creates greater impact for those who were locked up to become productive members of our communities. 
 
 Both ABF and TFH have supportive networks to help address both immediate and long-term needs of those recently released from prison. Working collaboratively and sharing these supportive networks consolidates support services to ensure successful reentry while preserving public safety, and further, promoting the overall public health. The ABF and TFH collaboration creates a larger impact by empowering those who were incarcerated to restart their lives in the setting of a new home and to reintegrate their lives into communities through urban farming.
 
 ABF continues to collaborate with local businesses. Most notably, we collaborate with local restaurant Good Girl Dinette in Highland Park by identifying and growing vegetables for seasonal specials on their menu. 
 
 ABF also collaborates with schools and churches. Most notably, ABF’s collaboration with staff and students from Cal Poly Pomona’s Department of Landscape Architecture has developed a system for chicken coop installations that will increase the variety of food produced in ABF’s urban farms. 
 
 ABF’s partnerships with reentry housing programs, local restaurants and businesses, schools and churches create more opportunities to scale up the scope of support services for the reintegration of the lives of those who were locked up and the empowerment of communities where urban farming takes place.",1

We have the Compassion Technology & the brain science behind serotonin. 
 Our project is a cornerstone of a major campaign to aggregate, celebrate & share stories of Good in LA. It’s guaranteed to make participants happier, healthier, better students & better employees.
 First, we build an app to make it easier to share acts of good, then we work with existing & new partners to reach a broad spectrum of Angelenos. Between non-profits, media, faith communities, youth programs, & business- Angelenos will share 50k stories of LAGood","AG launches LAGood posts 50K Acts of Good 4 LA2050 
 1- AG will work with existing and new partners to create a grassroots campaign that seeds and shares the story of Good in LA creating a ripple effect of good throughout LA. 
 2- AG will build an app to make it easier for users to post. 
 3- AG will work with individuals & organizations to use our ‘Compassion Technology’ in ways that work for them; to reach out to their constituents & customers, to build employee engagement, use the stories of good in their community while gathering great metrics. AG has a low bar of entry and its equally available and beneficial to anyone. 
 4- AG will get the Acts of Good sponsored so anyone who posts becomes an instant philanthropist. We want all of us to feel connected to people in our own communities & to the global community.
 LAGood will be a collaborative effort (specific partner details in partner section) 
 1. Months 1-3: Build a mobile app and strengthen the website to make it even easier for people to post. 
 2. Work with current partners (signed up and ready to hit the ground running) to amplify Good & inspire more Angelenos to volunteer formally & informally as they post Acts of Good. 
 o Collaborations with current partners projected to drive 35K Goods in LA 
 • Examples: 
 • Agape Community AG Program. 
 • Jason Mraz- Singer campaign to his 20m social media fans
 3. Finalize partnerships being developed. 
 o 5K acts and posts to emerge from forthcoming partnerships 
 • Big Sunday 
 • Funny or Die 
 • I Am That Girl 
 4. Develop new collaborations 
 o Initiate community challenges resulting in 10K Act of Good posted: 
 • Outreach & partnerships with 5 more diverse non-profits 
 • Outreach to 98 Neighborhood Councils – goal 20 councils involved 
 • Outreach to Charter Management Orgs, individual schools & after school programs 
 • Strategy meetings with 3 of LA’s major employers- initiate employee engagement 
 • LA Govt- target elected official’s constituent relations so that Acts of Good being done in government are surfaced. 
 • LA-based brands- brand sponsorship is a pillar of our strength in paying it forward with our Allies4Good","What better way to connect than around doing Good for one another? Scientific research is clear - doing Good impacts individuals & communities in expected & unexpected ways. Imagine what happens when people all over the city really learn that in helping others there is an added benefit of helping yourself!
 This is the critical beginning of LAGood. We will continue with more partnerships so that story of LA Good will be celebrated everywhere – in schools, faith communities, businesses & on billboards or busses. The work of great non-profits will be amplified as the Good they do is told & shared.
 LA is the largest microphone & most powerful trendsetter in the world. Let’s use it to inspire local & global Good. 
 This is just the first step in LAGood. AG will continue to grow and iterate with scientific studies of impact in the workplace, the classroom, prisons & other populations often invisible to the general public.
 OVERALL: Empirical research shows:
 • Committing conscious acts of kindness makes people happy. ‘200 studies on nearly 275,000 people found that happiness leads to success in nearly every domain of our lives, including marriage, health, friendship, community involvement, creativity, and in particular, our jobs, careers and businesses’. Happy people even have better peripheral vision.
 Shawn Achor [Harvard],
 • Consciously recalling & writing a good memory fools the brain into dropping more serotonin. Overall, this leads to greater life satisfaction and meaning. Fun fact: Studies have shown that women who wrote about positive experiences were 40 percent more likely to live to age 94 than their negative peers. Shawn Achor [Harvard]. So for every act you do & post you get a double dose of happiness.
 • The ‘helper’s high’ experienced when doing good for others boosts the immune system, enhances our feelings of joyfulness, emotional resilience, vigor, and can reduce the unhealthy sense of isolation. 
 • Feeling ‘connected’ or part of a community is the single biggest factor on longevity. AG makes it easy for people to create & build their own communities.
 • The practice of caring for strangers or establishing an “affinitive connection”– friendship, love, or positive bonding – those emotions translate to immense healing benefits. 
 • AG captures altruism that is already in action. The US Department of Labor reports Americans increasingly describe their sense of responsibility to help those in need. In 2009, 27% or 64 million Americans volunteered.","Anonymous Good is based on science and common sense – it works for everyone, if they work it. So the universal applications are endless although this may sound overly ambitious, there is even more data to demonstrate who can benefit from AG. We will do strategic outreach to non-profits, youth organizations, faith communities, neighborhood councils, businesses.
 
 General Population: 
 • Doing good, even watching movies of others doing good helps reduce stress. In one study, students were simply asked to watch a film of Mother Teresa's work with the poor in Calcutta. They had significant increases in antibodies associated with improved immunity -- and antibody levels remained high for an hour afterward. AG is getting similar reports of well-being after users read goods posted on the site. [Post. Bioethicist, Case Western Reserve]
 • Ripple effect – Human behavior is contagious. Our actions extend to people within three degrees. Each of us can ‘infect’ 1,000 people with our acts of good. [Connection, Christakis & Fowler]
 Youth
 • In one study, children who did 3 acts of kindness per day for a month were not only happier but became more popular, gaining an average 1.5 friends. 
 • US students, ages 8 to 22, spend 7.5 to 9.5 hrs/day on tech gadgets. AG meets them on the screen where they live, helps them feel good & connected with service & global awareness. 
 • GenY searches for meaning by helping others. They volunteer more than any previous generation. 
 • Social Emotional Learning: Two of the core competencies of SEL are Social Awareness & Relationship Skills. Practicing acts of good off-line then coming on-line to share can create a virtuous cycle that supports SEL.
 Business | Govt
 • “Halo Effect” – According to a study by Cone Communications & Echo Research, 82 percent of U.S. consumers consider corporate social responsibility when deciding which products or services to buy & where to shop.
 • Employee Engagement - Gallup research shows that engaged employees are more productive, profitable, safer, create stronger customer relationships, & stay longer with their company. Doing service projects & good acts for each other increased employee engagement. 
 • A report by Harris Interactive, found that the No. 1 factor that young adults ages 21 to 31 wanted in a successful career was a sense of meaning.
 • We will strategize with local gov’t officials to implement AG in their offices. Angelenos could read authentic stories of gov’t actually responding to citizens.","Anonymous Good is anchored in partnerships/collaborations as individuals & groups use AG to reinforce or amplify their own community’s sense of well-being & connectedness.
 Each partner will do a combination of: 
 1-Educate & inspire their communities to post on AG & share across social media 
 2-Invite their communities to join the Campaign for LAGood 50K

4102011,App of Life transforms people and communities by challenging us to play real life as a game.,We will a) Fine tune and finish development of App of Life tool set & b) Get people on board improving themselves & their communities.,Connect,2014007,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050connect/projects/AppofLife.html,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,"In our initial launch, App of Life players are earning points for eating well, exercising, experiencing local culture, being social and taking on socially responsible projects. More importantly we’ve found that users are sharing these experiences and inviting friends to join in the gamification of their lives.
 
 a) We will complete our buildout with API connections to wearables and fitness apps; finetune the look and function of App of Life; finish development of team building tools; and build an Android version of the app. 
 
 b) We will get players on board through digital marketing campaigns and partnering with local organizations and companies to run wellness challenges.","The first thing we would do if we win will be to issue a press release telling our LA story. This traction will result in thousands of people doing good while using App of Life - right away!
 
 1) Connect to Wearables and Fitness Apps using APIs
 We are working to connect people using wearables with App of Life so that they can track a balanced lifestyle beyond fitness. We’ll allow players to connect App of Life with Fitbit, Jawbone Up, Strava Run & Bike, and MyFitnessPal. Players will be able to automatically earn points in App of Life for using a fitness tracker or app. Since these players are already earning points via fitness, they’ll feel motivated to work on earning points in our other categories of a balanced life: culture and social.
 
 2) Fine Tuning
 By the time judging begins Version 1.0 user surveys will be complete, additional research will be finished. Our design and development team will be using this information to inform a fine tuning of the the look and function of App of Life.
 
 3) Teams and Contests
 We will finish the development of our team building and contest tools that will allow organizations to compete in wellness challenges and contests.
 
 4) Expand with Android
 App of Life launched first on iOS, and we are working on the Android version to launch later this year. By building and marketing an Android version of App of Life, we can reach twice as many potential players, and create a seamless experience for iOS users who want to share the app with their friends on Android. This build will take about four to five months, including testing and app store submission. 
 
 6) Wellness Challenges with Partners
 Our contests give organizations new opportunities to engage, mobilize and grow their communities. The app allows contest organizers to add a custom move tailored to their specific goals. People who try more new exercises will earn more points via App of Life, and thus could win prizes such as fitness gear for their favorite new routine. Contests will typically run for one month. It’s a win-win as everyone who participates will feel healthier and have fun trying new exercises, while the athletic club engages more members and App of Life gains more players.
 
 7) Build user base through targeted advertising and marketing
 We will target potential players of App of Life via strategic marketing and advertising campaigns, such as targeted Facebook mobile ads, to grow our user base of Angelenos who will benefit the most from the app.","App of Life is a social media app that challenges its players to share their progress toward a balanced and sustainable life. Based in LA, we are growing the app’s user base locally to help improve Angelenos’ lives and the community around us. As more friends get on board with App of Life and engage each other with comments and likes, the message will spread via social channels that it’s GOOD to improve yourself and your community. As App of Life grows and connects more players now and into 2050, its impact on Los Angeles will continue to grow. 
 
 More than 10 million people live in LA County, and we’d like App of Life to improve the lives of each of these Angelenos, whether they’re avid players or they’re affected by the GOOD that our players do.","As an LA-based company, our goal is to first build a solid base in Los Angeles. Initially individual players will benefit from App of Life by getting more physically fit and becoming more socially and culturally tuned. As groups of friends use the app together, communities will benefit indirectly from a healthier and happier citizen base and directly through our app’s moves such as more volunteering, better voter turnout and better use of alternative transportation (just to name a few). Organizations will benefit through wellness programs. Everybody wins :)
 
 Our audience includes every Angeleno who is old enough to use social media - everyone around them will benefit.","Collaboration is our game plan, here is where we are starting:
 Office of Los Angeles Mayor Garcetti
 Mayor Garcetti’s office contacted our founders about working on a community engagement program. We have proposed a campaign to engage citizens to volunteer throughout the city. App of Life will serve as the framework of this program, which will help us gain new players who care about improving our community. 
 Success will be measured on the number of new players, number of times each person volunteers, and the amount of time each person stays engaged.
 We have worked with the Mayor’s office many times. Currently our creative team is developing the branding for LA Promise Zone and the Mayor’s residence Getty House.
 
 Los Angeles Athletic Club
 As the city’s oldest health and fitness organization, LAAC is where Olympic and pro athletes train next to regular citizens. The club hosts the Wooden Awards, presented to the most outstanding college basketball players. 
 A fitness contest will engage members at the club while onboarding players for both LAAC and App of Life. Players will achieve a balanced lifestyle and compete for fitness-related prizes. 
 Success will be measured on number of new players, number of times each person posts about exercising to App of Life, and the number of friends each player has gained.
 We have confirmed this partnership with the LAAC and have worked with them in the past.
 
 DIGDEEP
 DIGDEEP is an LA-based water rights organization that works to secure clean water access for every human being.
 App of Life will run a contest with DIGDEEP awarding points to people who join their 4Liters program, promoting water rights awareness and conservation, as well as raising money for water access. The challenge will grow DIGDEEP and App of Life. Success will be measured on number of new players, number of days each player participates in and by the degree to which these players continue to use App of Life.
 We have a longstanding relationship with DIGDEEP and have confirmed partnership.
 
 LA Works
 We will partner with LA Works to award points for volunteering. People who take on LA Works’ challenge will earn points each time they volunteer and will also earn points for trying new projects. Through this challenge, volunteers will help improve LA while earning points and prizes, while App of Life will benefit from gaining new players who are focused on giving back.
 We have volunteered with LA Works for more than a decade and have proposed a partnership.",
4102014,ShareLA,"We want to make Los Angeles a sharing city model, connected by time banking, and empowered to share resources, knowledge and solutions.",Connect,2014008,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050connect/projects/ShareLA.html,,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,"Through our work we know that sharing leads to more connected, resilient and sustainable communities. As part of Shareable’s Sharing Cities Network, we seek to make LA a model sharing city by 2050 with a Sharing City Blueprint and a ShareFest kick-off event. Featuring sharing strategies and solutions at every level of civic life - from neighbor to community, local government, education, business and finance, this open source guide will demonstrate how to enrich our social fabric through sharing. Our ShareFest will promote the blueprint’s completion and offer hands-on programming, workshops, panels, skillshares, vendors and entertainment designed to galvanize community leaders around a shared vision of a more connected LA.","To draft a blueprint of this scale, we will work closely with our partner Shareable and the Sharing Cities Network, as well as community collaborators, experts and consultants. We will research, conduct interviews, hold focus groups and brainstorm with the community. We will include what has been successful from our own work and can be expanded. We will champion best practices from other innovators, solicit diverse interests and input, and look for opportunities to connect with other groups that are aligned with our vision. We will pay close attention to the unique opportunities in Los Angeles and look for the most agile and effective tools. Finally we will work with a creative team to produce an accessible and transformative document that offers a community-based strategy for helping LA evolve into a sharing city model. We will then work with Shareable to promote the blueprint internationally as an open source guide.
 
 We will also plan a one-day ShareFest drawing on the social capital of our existing community of changemakers, sharing economy pioneers and local emerging leaders. We will design programming that offers something for the novice, the inducted and the devotee with sharing strategies that are affordable, do-able and effective. We will coordinate educators, speakers, entertainment, vendors, volunteers and security. We will secure the appropriate event permits and insurance. Will will invite everyone in the community to participate, including our local elected officials. 
 
 We will secure the necessary administration to support both arms of the project, as well as develop the partnerships critical for blueprint research, ShareFest planning and programming. We will work with city and neighborhood officials to grow time banking in the city in our continued effort to empower the local community leaders who will carry forward this ambitious but achievable vision.","Several recently published studies and articles highlight the importance of social connections in regards to health and happiness. The basis for any form of social connection is sharing: sharing a moment, sharing a meal, sharing a purpose. But according to The Atlantic, as a society, “We volunteer less. We entertain guests at our homes less...And we have fewer and fewer close friends with whom we’d share the intimate details of our lives.” 
 
 It is increasingly more difficult to form the relationships that lead to meaningful connections in our over-scheduled, high stress urban lives, or to create the trust needed to ask for help or share with another person. Too often we struggle with financial pressures; the high cost of housing, food, and transportation in LA can overshadow our basic human need for social connection and can lead to great isolation. 
 
 For the past 6 years, we have actively worked to build the relationships that lead to deep and meaningful social connections through sharing time, resources, and knowledge. Through time banking we increase connectedness as well as access to resources in creative ways:
 ● Neighborhood Fruit Harvest
 ● Garden Groups and Barnraisings
 ● Metro Group (that promotes mass transit)
 ● Craft Club
 ● Cookbook Club 
 ● Dog Cooperative
 ● Community Revolving Loan Fund 
 ● Local Economy Incubator
 ● Parent Support Network
 ● Film Screenings
 ● Dance Parties
 ● Monthly Neighborhood Potlucks
 ● Salons and Lectures
 
 The basis of our work is already trying to make LA the best place to connect. Our blueprint is the roadmap for achieving this goal. 
 
 Our project will expand the reach of our successful sharing strategies, grow our network of time banks and strengthen communities where our programs already exist. It will teach communities how to create meaningful work, share helpful resources that increase quality of life and pathways to civic engagement. With our Sharefest as a welcoming party we will create a place for all Angelenos to embrace the city we envision by 2050: a more connected and collaborative place, with equal opportunities for shared housing, food, transportation, work, education, and finance. By cultivating inspiration and nurturing emerging leaders at this event we are investing in the renewable resources needed to power our movement for years to come. And as more people understand and come to value the effects of sharing as they learn how to connect the dots, they will in turn seek even more opportunities to connect.","Our project has the potential to benefit each and every community in Los Angeles and this is our long term goal. 
 
 In six years we have grown from a handful of neighborhoods to 21, organically and at the consistent request of community members who are disillusioned with business as usual. Because sharing strategies of this nature are often informal, require very little infrastructure for impact and can be implemented by average men, women and children, we see enormous opportunities to transform the fabric of LA one neighborhood at a time. 
 
 We want this blueprint to offer solutions for neighborhoods struggling with access to food and employment, communities that have historically been told they do not have a place at the social decision making table, for the kids who need meaningful after school activities to avoid delinquency, for the small businesses that benefit from a strong local economy, for the nonprofit organizations that desperately need volunteers to serve their clients, for our local elected officials who need innovative solutions to persistent community problems, for visitors who come to this great city with the preconceived notion that we move too fast, care only about money and have no soul. 
 
 This blueprint will address a lion share of the complex social issues our city faces through incredibly organic and simple strategies and help guide “the powers that be” towards them so we can effectively move this vision forward together.","Our confirmed collaborators are the Arroyo Seco Network of Time Banks members (www.asntb.com), Shareable (www.shareable.net), The Sharing Cities Network (www.shareable.net/sharing-cities), and Cooperative Development consultant and expert, Sarah Manski (www.PosiPair.com).
 
 The ASNTB is the foundation of our work and infuses everything we do with social capital. Drawing on our 1,300 individual members and over 40 organizational and nonprofit members for expertise, experience and manpower, we will leverage thousands of volunteer hours for time credits. We will call on them heavily as stakeholders during the blueprint process and as volunteers, vendors, speakers, panelists and leaders at ShareFest. 
 
 Shareable provides us with inspiration and network support from other experienced sharing advocates. We have worked with them on map jams, ShareFests, and a series of workshops for our Local Economy Incubator. We will work closely with them and the Sharing Cities Network for blueprint development so our framework is flexible enough to serve cities everywhere. They will help us promote the blueprint and ShareFest.
 
 Sarah Manski brings years of activism, research and implementation to our project. She will lead the development of a cooperative strategy for Los Angeles, incorporating both grassroots and high-level partnership models such as the Cleveland Model to our blueprint as a means of democratizing wealth and greater access to more sustaining work for Angelenos. 
 
 We also hope to consult with the Sustainable Economies Legal Center (www.theselc.org) in our continued work with them to making sharing economy solutions available to all who want them. Critical to the success of our 501c3 paperwork, SELC is currently working on an economic blueprint for the Bay Area. They will help us navigate sharing law. 
 
 We will also reach out to local community leaders and our network of sharing economy pioneers, consultants and experts for input on the blueprint.
 
 The factors critical to our collaborative success are: shared vision, respect and reciprocity. Shared vision ensures we are pulling in the same direction - towards an interconnected, livable city where people from all walks of life can thrive.

4102016,Educating traditionally underserved youth about working in the entertainment industry,The idea is to create an institution that will groom the next generation of entertainment industry professionals in film and radio.,Create,2014009,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050create/projects/AIM.html,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,"We will teach youth from all over the Los Angeles area about the business of the entertainment industry, including workshops introducing all of the various jobs both on the set, on location, and behind the scenes. We will also continue our intensive workshops on story telling, radio producing, and film production, but extended to youth from all over the L.A. area.
  
 Using volunteers from the industry, we will acquaint students with what it is like to work in the entertainment field, how to apply for a job, and what training is necessary. We will also assist in job or internship placement.
 
 These activities will be integrated with our film festival, San Pedro International Film Festival. Student films will be screened during the annual festival and students will meet with and interview active professionals. This provides the participants with a full experience from creation of a film or documentary to the end user experience. Students will also come to understand the differences between old school filmmaking and the evolving online video culture.
  
 Art in Motion, Inc. (AIM), which organizes the San Pedro International Film Festival (SPIFF) and the youth training programs, is in the LA harbor area. We have access to several theatres including the historic Warner Grand. We also have access to harbor area locations, including the Battleship Iowa and the ""tall ship"" sailing vessels owned by the Los Angeles Maritime Institute. Students develop a new found fascination with location filming when trying to figure out how to shoot a scene on the upper deck of a battleship.
  
 Students from all over the Los Angeles area will be invited to come to San Pedro to participate in our programs. 
  
 One thing that sets AIM apart is our access to entertainment industry professionals. In fact, we have television actors, directors, and film editors who work on an unpaid, volunteer basis. We are also unique in having collaborated on a low power FM radio license, won in a recent FCC sponsored competition, and allowing us to teach radio broadcast skills in a live setting.
  
 We believe that traditionally underserved youth have a right to believe in their own futures. It is our job to assist them to discover their own creativity and to develop their own expressive skills.","By creating the next generation of world class storytellers.
 With this program, we will be establishing a learning space for underserved youth who cannot afford or are not yet ready to go to film school. Much of what we will be teaching does not require an expensive film school education, and was traditionally absorbed as an element of studio employment. Those days are gone, but we can emulate the original process as much as possible. It’s learning by doing.
 
 The future of the entertainment industry depends on how well the creators of tomorrow can adapt to ever changing technology and the decreasing amount of time available to keep an audience interested. Los Angeles has historically been the film and media capital of the world, but in order for it to retain this distinction, we must utilize the talent of the professionals to train our next generation of world-class storytellers who come from all parts of LA and from different socio-economic backgrounds and ethnicities. For the last decade, Los Angeles has been losing jobs and productions to other parts of the US and to other countries, to the point that we must stop the outflow of jobs and retain our talent and money right here in LA. Los Angeles needs to be and remain the film capital. We hope to make this workshop/institute into a sought after program not only for local youth but for international students as well.","The most direct beneficiaries of the program are the students themselves, but we hope that in addition, the local economy will ultimately benefit as well. One effect of bringing students to culture is to stimulate them to become consumers of culture. The fallout of this is to benefit museums, the live theater, and serious films. We are also hopeful that the local entertainment industry will benefit by finding a pool of talented professionals who come from traditionally underserved and minority communities. The ultimate effect is on those communities themselves, as they have suffered high levels of unemployment historically. Of course we also expect that the local community will benefit immediately from the creative works made by the students which will be presented in public showings. The ultimate beneficiary of an industry that remains robust and authentically local over the next 4 decades is our entire economy.","We have a history of collaboration with the Boys and Girls Club of San Pedro, which has joined us in our Youth Intensive Filmmaking Workshops. We work with entertainment industry professionals who enjoy teaching and coaching. We have concentrated on accentuating the story telling aspect of the creative endeavor, which is new to these students. We intend to extend our collaboration to youth organizations and schools from other, traditionally underserved areas of the city. The LA2050 grant will allow us to extend training to these students, and will provide a modest amount of seed money which we will use to develop a permanent presence.
 
 We have also collaborated with local organizations including the Pacific Battleship Foundation, which has graciously allowed us to use the Battleship Iowa for student training. We also have a collaboration with the L.A. Maritime Institute, a group which owns two sailing ships and which trains students in how to sail them. They have also graciously allowed us to use their ships.
 
 Art in Motion runs an annual film festival and has an ongoing relationship with the Grand Vision Foundation, which allows us use of the Grand Annex Theater for doing student training and for presenting formal screenings.
 
 We are currently in the process of recruiting a radio professional to do teaching of the FM production and broadcast curriculum, should we develop the funding to acquire equipment. 
 
 In our collaboration with the Boys and Girls Club, it is critical that our schedules mesh properly. This seems like it ought to be an easy thing to deal with, but we find that we have to be careful about planning well in advance. We also find that when two organizations each supply different pieces of equipment, we have to make sure in advance that all items will mesh properly. This isn’t exactly deep sociology, but when a whole class is depending on the faculty getting things right, we have to be sure to get them right.
 
 There are different factors when it comes to owners of sailing ships and other nautical items. Most importantly, we cannot schedule training on a ship if it is out to sea on the day of our class.
 
 The most critical issue with regard to collaborations is that both sides are aiming towards the same goals, and that both sides are able to agree to the overall process. We have concentrated on collaborations with organizations that are genuinely interested in youth education, and we find that it has worked well for all of us",1,
4102017,WildLAParks,Teens from across Los Angeles will teach us how birds connect us to wild nature in Los Angeles city parks.,Play,2014010,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050play/projects/wildlaparks.html,,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,,"Our project will take a three part approach to making LA the best place for people to play and birds to thrive in 2050.
 
 First, we will continue our work at five nature locations around Los Angeles, at Debs Park, Baldwin Hills Scenic Overlook, Kenneth Hahn Park, Los Angeles River, and Harbor Park. Our work at these locations focuses on engaging teens through three popular and effective programs: The Arroyo Green Team (Debs), Audubon Youth Environmental Stewards (Harbor Park and LA River), and the Environmental Stewardship Program (Baldwin Hills). At these locations, teens monitor wildlife populations, restore native habitats, and create fun nature activities that educate and enlighten park visitors and younger people from their communities. These young environmentalists will be essential to the second step of this project.
 
 Second, taking what we have learned from the network programs, we will engage people of all ages at neighborhood parks and other open spaces to observe the birds in their area and to celebrate their local parks as places to explore, play and gain an appreciation of nature. We will work with a GIS (Geographic Information System) specialist, to train our youth to identify and map park space that meet a series of social and natural criteria (developed by the youth). Through this process, we will identify new potential partners, in the form of recreation centers or social service NGOs who work near these parks. Our teens and our chapter members will inventory the parks using Audubon’s Citizen Science approach and new technologies. Here is an opportunity for the varied skill sets of the young and older people to share their knowledge - teens may teach older chapter members about technology, while chapter members help teach the teens bird identification skills. There are many exciting new apps that can be used for bird identification and recording information. Using social media is a fun and easy way for the program participants and the public to communicate the natural wonders found in our city parks.
 
 Finally, we’ll work with new partners to host events in these parks. Events may consist of bird watching walks, conducted in English and Spanish, arts and cultural activities, health and passive recreation connections, and environmental action projects. Our hope is to help people understand that our parks and our birds are our connection to health and well-being in our communities and that finding birds is a great way to play in L.A.","Audubon youth will help people gain a better understanding and appreciation of nature in their urban parks, the value of native plants, water conservation, wildlife and habitat preservation. We will connect people of all ages to the great outdoors in recreational activities and fun restoration/conservation events and show that nature in LA thrives!
 
 We will take what we have learned to create a guide for shaping Bird-friendly Parks. Greater bird diversity is better for the parks and better for the people that live there. The Guide to Bird Friendly Parks will help communities advocate for new parks and to make their existing parks sanctuaries for people and birds. Being in nature has health and developmental benefits that have been shown and summarized in works such as Louv’s Last Child in the Woods. In many cases, our parks may be one of our only outlets to the natural world, and urban youth in particular may suffer from what has been called “nature-deficit disorder,” with no backyards or areas to play in. Parks, green space, and open space are vital to combat obesity and type 2 diabetes, help children develop motor skills and contribute to civic engagement. 
 
 We envision, in 2050, youth participating in this project holding the reins of city and regional government, fully convinced of the importance of nature to young people, of the joy of finding birds in their parks, and committed to prioritizing efforts to ensure that every person in Los Angeles has access to nature nearby to play in, discover, grow, feel safe.","This project has a few target audiences. First the project will benefit teens that are involved in our after-school programs. These programs provide a pathway to higher educational and career opportunities for under-served youth. The Audubon Center at Debs Park program serves youth primarily from northeast Los Angeles communities. Students are predominantly Latino, ages 12-18. Audubon YES participants consist of both middle and high school students from throughout the South Bay. High School student interns in Los Angeles Audubon’s Greenhouse & Environmental Stewardship Program are from Dorsey High whose student body identifies as 57% African-American and 42% Hispanic. All of these programs serve economically disadvantaged youth. Nearly all the graduates from these programs go on to four-year colleges, and many are the first in their families to do so.
 
 The project will also benefit our older chapter membership. They will lend their organizational and life skills, working with youth from our programs to help create the report that identifies targeted parks. We believe that this type of inter-generational learning will benefit all participants.
 
 People residing near these parks will benefit from learning new skills (bird identification, water-wise native plant species) and seeing their parks as both a recreational place and a wildlife habitat. Increased activity at parks will help remove real and perceived barriers to participation, for example, is the park safe? With more planned activities, parks can be a beacon for families to gather and to enjoy and learn about nature. 
 
 Finally, the birds of LA will benefit from more public conservation awareness that will lead to community action to improve our parks.","We have confirmed collaboration with the Los Angeles Audubon Society and Palos Verdes/South Bay Audubon Society and partnerships with San Fernando Valley Audubon Society, and Santa Monica Bay Audubon Society. These separate Audubon chapters have worked together in sharing research and have been working for the past year to bring youth from their environmental education programs together to build support networks, advocate for conservation, and share ideas. All of these entities are their own non-profit organizations, operating independently, but with similar goals and missions. 
 
 The Chapters bring skills and expertise in bird identification and environmental science. Each of the chapters take a community based approach to conservation and youth engagement. For example, Los Angeles Audubon through its partnership with California State Parks, and The Baldwin Hills Conservancy will provide access to people of all ages to learn more about the parks at student-led environmental restoration events, and bird walks that provide insight to the unique ecology, geology, wildlife, and plantlife found in these urban oases.
 The project hopes to identify new collaborators where we can add value to their work and they can provide skills and expertise to enhance the project.
 
 Audubon has been working in Los Angeles since 1910, advocating for birds and nature, and providing opportunities for people to connect with nature. In the City of Los Angeles, four, independent, local chapters – Los Angeles Audubon, Palos Verdes / South Bay Audubon, San Fernando Audubon, and Santa Monica Bay Audubon- work with local schools, advocate for nature, and engage all ages with birds, wildlife and LA’s natural places. Additionally, the Audubon Center at Debs Park, operated by Audubon California, takes on these roles in the neighborhoods in northeast Los Angeles. Working together, we have the entire city covered.",1,
4102018,Poesia Para La Gente & Writ Large Press Present: The Neighborhood Literary-scape Project,"Our project cultivates local businesses, public service facilities and non-traditional spaces into a Neighborhood Literary-scape.",Create,2014011,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050create/projects/NEIGHBORHOODLITSCAPE.html,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,"The project will facilitate a series of 7 three-part programs. 
 
 Each program will begin with a 5-day poetry workshop held at a service
 facility/organization typically lacking in opportunities for literary participation - e.g. women’s shelter, foster care facility, day laborers center. These workshops will be facilitated by a published and acclaimed poet, feature a guest poet speaker for inspiration, and result in preparation of participants' poems for publication.
 
 The second phase will result in the publication of the work created during the workshop. The books will be published by Writ Large Press, the proceeds of which will go to support future literary projects, and/or for fundraising purposes for the organization where the workshop was held.
 
 In the final phase, both workshop participants (and/or their families) and a selection of acclaimed poets, who are local to the specific neighborhood, will read their published work at an open mic book launch at a selected local business as a means of attracting new customers, - e.g. a small produce market, a laundromat, or a bakery. The local business will then have the option of selling the book at their facility.
 
 At the culmination of the year-long project, we will celebrate the publication of the entire 7 book series at larger book launch event(s), to be held at a public space(s), venue(s) and bookstore(s). The series of 7 books will be made available for purchase individually or as a complete series box set, to be sold at local bookstores, and possibly state and nation-wide.","First, The Neighborhood Literary-scape Project prompts residents and visitors to think about literary talent and inspiration as lying deep but unseen within a city neighborhood, rather than merely imported to performance venues or bookstores. We would especially like to unearth and highlight the expressive traditions of local communities of color, whose members engage in spoken word and other oral genres.
 
 Second, we would like to make poetry a resource for finding and publishing the voices, of individuals within organizations such as women’s shelters that lack educational and artistic resources that may also prove to validate their artistic expressions through published works.
 
 This project utilizes and builds upon Avenue 50 Studio and Writ Large Press’ on-going partnerships within the visual, musical, and literary arts communities of Los Angeles, creating a sustainable network of collaborations that could change the entire scope of the literary community of Los Angeles.","Our project seeks to highlight and legitimize local literary voices as a means for sparking public discourse and energizing the authentic spaces of the city. The neighborhood becomes, in effect, a literary event space, a literary-scape. The goal therefore is to not only continue drawing new visitors to the underserved neighborhoods of Los Angeles, but to draw their attention to overlooked or unusual spaces and to explore the idea that art can be everywhere and benefit everyone. In lieu of economic development being tied solely to new outsider business, this project cultivates and highlights the rich resources, everyday sites, and traditions of the existing community, enabling residents, local artists, and established businesses to benefit from the area’s increasing economic vitality, rather than being replaced.
 
 In addition, much research has been done on the benefits of writing poetry. For instance, in his book, “Opening Up: The Healing Power of Expressing Emotions,” acclaimed psychologist and researcher on the benefits of writing, Dr. James W. Pennebaker, suggests that writing about emotional topics improves the immune system by reducing “stress, anxiety and depression…” Poetry has long been used in support groups for people coping with grief, mental illness, cancer, and other illnesses. The poets who will facilitate the workshops, who we’ve received commitments from, have experience in teaching poetry to this advantage. 
 
 Specifically, this project would benefit the residents of 7 service facilities typically lacking in opportunities for literary participation - e.g. women’s shelter, foster care facility, day laborers center. It would also benefit their families, friends and neighbors who will take part in the celebrating of their published work through the book launch events. The events will be promoted in a way that would encourage and inspire the community-at-large to celebrate literary arts, and to recognize it as a much-needed, accessible and expressive art form. 
 
 The project would benefit the local businesses that would host the events. By promoting the business as a sponsoring partner, they will not only draw new visitors, but we would also help to establish the place of business as a “friend” of the art community, thereby helping to build a sustainable marketplace. Teachers, facilitators, educators and local vendors would also be utilized in the production of the workshops, publications and events.","The Neighborhood Literary-scape Project brings together the following confirmed and committed partners: 1) Avenue 50 Studio’s Poesia Para La Gente program and 2) Writ Large Press.
 
 Poesia Para La Gente (Poetry for the People) is a program that brings poetry to the people of the community in non-traditional spaces/places. Economic hardship or various forms of social stigmas have affected some of these places, in one way or another, all locations are unique in providing a safe setting for artistic expression. Some of the places that Poesia Para La Gente has collaborated with and/or performed at have
 been the Metro train, Home Depot Day Laborer Job Centers, Guerrero’s Produce Market, Homeboy Industries, Grand Park Book Fest (poetry on demand), the local laundromat, etc. http://avenue50studio.org/poesia-para-la-gente
 
 Writ Large Press is an independent publisher, which has partnered with Poesia Para La Gente since 2013 to produce free literary events throughout Los Angeles, including Libros Para La Gente, which brings free books to low-income neighborhoods. This project adds targeted educational and business development dimensions to these efforts. www.writlargepress.com 
 
 Avenue 50 Studio and it’s Poesia Para La Gente staff will market, produce, and document the project, and engage acclaimed poets from L.A. and throughout California to facilitate 5-day workshops and perform their work at book launches. They will also organize visual artists, and assist in the production of the events. Writ Large Press will commit staff resources for publication and distribution of the new work in a series of 7
 books, and will organize musicians, sound, and projection equipment for the book launch events. www.avenue50studio.org",1,
4102019,BRIDGE-ing Cultures and Cultivating Change in LA through Original Youth & Community Theatre,"Connect and unite diverse LA youth through collaborative playwriting & performance workshops, generating actions to address local problems.",Connect,2014012,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050connect/projects/bridgetheatre.html,,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,"BRIDGE Theatre Project began in 2009 as an international theatre program offering worldwide exchange opportunities for youth to connect through original plays. Our name, BRIDGE, is an acronym for Building Relationships and Inspiring Dialogue through Global (or Grassroots) Exchange. We have had hugely successful programs here in LA and in severely impoverished areas of Ecuador and Nepal.
 
 We have been offered an opportunity to further develop our mission with the Lynwood Unified School District. With LA2050 support, we will expand our program goals to connect LA youth of different cultural backgrounds while promoting change within their communities by exploring solutions to local problems, all through storytelling and original theatre.","Our first goal is to connect students to themselves. Through writing prompts and sharing personal stories in a supportive environment, students explore their own dreams and struggles on a deeper level. Identifying commonalities among one another breaks down perceived barriers and preconceived notions among the group, leading to the important understanding that we are all more alike than different. We deepen this idea by learning about the cultural diversity found all around Los Angeles, demystifying stereotypes and gaining appreciation for the unique qualities we all possess.
 
 Through this process of writing, open sharing, and interactive theatre activities, we also begin creating an awareness of students’ own personal struggles, as well as those in the community at-large. Through theatre, we engage students to imagine: What would our lives look like without these struggles? And how do we make that happen? We also impart the importance of setting attainable goals, challenge students how to manage long-term problems and consider compromises that may be necessary (give and take).
 
 The next step is collaboration: How do we work together to make a better community? How do we unite our commonalities and utilize our unique and wonderful differences to do that? To that end, students work in small groups to combine their individual stories and solutions to create a collaborative work of art: an original, group-written play. The students then have an opportunity to perform one of the other small groups’ plays, allowing them to “try on” and “act out” other solutions that may differ from their own. This further demonstrates that there is no one way to tackle a problem – there are many great ideas, and by working together we can develop practical solutions to attain them.
 
 From there we invite the community to participate in the change-making process. Students perform their plays and share their stories in a culminating production for their families, teachers and other members of the community. We engage the audience in discussion and even bring them on stage to “perform” their ideas for creating a better society. We invite neighborhood councils, civic leaders and social service agencies to facilitate the conversation of how to make real change right now. Sustainable efforts provide the community with tools to continue the conversation after the program ends and brainstorm ways to continue motivating one another to move forward with their goals.","Despite the myriad of diverse cultures in Los Angeles, we are surprisingly disconnected. BRIDGE Theatre Project offers an artistic means to correct this. We target the youth community, because children are the key to creating lasting change.
 
 First and foremost, we must have a deeper understanding of who we are as individuals. Once we attain that, we can then identify what we have in common with those around us. BRIDGE expands this idea further by facilitating conversation about the diverse people and cultures prevalent in LA County, even if they have little to no current interaction with them. Opening their world view and allowing them to identify and connect with others outside their culture is a crucial component to our program. Through that means, the students can begin working together. It also prepares them for future cross-cultural interactions. The idea that we are more alike than different is paramount to unifying our society and creating positive change on the macro level.
 
 Once students foster a stronger connection to themselves, then to one another, then to other populations within LA, they connect on a working level by collaborating with their peers in small groups to write a play. They gain an understanding of the democratic process (not every idea will be used, but the group will decide as a whole). Then, to gain an appreciation for other collaborative ideas, each small group rehearses and performs another group’s play. Through this connection, each student gains a broader perspective of how society can tackle different problems.
 
 Children inspire us, and we rely on that for a successful culmination of the BRIDGE program. Families, teachers and other adults in the community will see the tangible connections made between the youth. Their progress and ability to dissolve barriers will inspire them to make a change, right here and now. Connecting them with civic leaders and service providers makes it possible for them to build a better community for themselves immediately. And the lasting effects are evident. By working with children, we plant the seeds for building a better future. We encourage students to get involved in their communities and civic processes now, and educate them how to do so even more in their adult years. BRIDGE nurtures in our youth the desire and know-how to make a change. By 2050, these students will be leaders in the community and active participants in local decision-making.","This BRIDGE project will benefit the Lynwood community of Los Angeles County, particularly elementary (grades 4 & 5), middle and high school youth in the Lynwood Unified School District (LUSD). The potential for expanding to other areas of LA County is very viable, with the only factors being capital and greater teaching artist support. BRIDGE programs in other LA regions are part of our strategic plan over the next 2-3 years.
 
 There are 12 elementary, 3 middle and 3 high schools in LUSD. With LA2050 support, we will be able to conduct a 10-week BRIDGE program (2 after-school workshops per week) at each of Lynwood’s 18 schools. We anticipate that 25-35 students will participate at each school site, for an estimated total of 500-600 students served in the 2014-15 school year. An integral part of the program is also involving parents, teachers and other members of the community, linking them with civic leaders and empowering them to make positive changes.
 
 Every school in LUSD is Title I, the majority of all students coming from low-income families. Lynwood High and Lynwood Middle Schools are both in the lowest-achieving 5% for all of California, according to the CA Department of Education. Demographically, the Lynwood region is 86% Latino, 10% African American, 1% Native American, 1% Asian/Pacific Islander, and 2% White, with 24% living below the federal poverty line (2010 US Census). Bordering other high-crime neighborhoods Compton and South Gate, Lynwood also has a prevalence of gang activity. Extracurricular programs like BRIDGE, geared to making a lasting change in the community, would be of tremendous benefit, and could cause a positive ripple-effect in surrounding communities.","Lynwood Unified School District is a confirmed collaborator on this project. BRIDGE was approached by LUSD’s Assistant Superintendent of Educational Services to implement this program in all 18 schools within the district. It will mark our first collaboration with LUSD.
 
 The great benefit of working directly with the school district is the ability to swiftly begin our program at each individual school without having to first establish in-roads at every site. Another advantage in our partnership with LUSD is access to limited district funding allocated for arts programming. (Please note, however, that this district funding alone is not sufficient enough to execute the full scope of our program as described here.)
 
 Our chief administrative staff includes myself, Adam Kalesperis, and Joe Quintero, co-founding directors of BRIDGE Theatre Project. We have both worked as professional artists and educators, with over 20 years combined teaching and arts management experience. As co-founding directors of BRIDGE Theatre Project, we have worked together since 2009 (and since 2008 in previous teaching capacities), sharing responsibility for all BRIDGE program decisions both here in LA and abroad.
 
 Additional partners will include teaching artists needed to execute the program at the schools. Having worked alongside many teaching artists with a variety of other LA arts organizations, we have a large pool of colleagues whom we’ve known for several years. We can attest to the quality and caliber of our network of teaching artists, and we will only approach the best of the best to be a part of this program.
 
 The following guideposts are critical to a successful collaboration with all aforementioned partners:
 1. A comprehensive understanding of our programmatic goals and benchmarks.
 2. A strong passion for working with underserved youth.
 3. A shared vision in shaping a positive future for all communities in Los Angeles.",
4102021,Beautify LA!,"Beautify Earth will create 50 murals to help empower, uplift and connect residents, communities and businesses in South LA and beyond.",Connect,2014013,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050connect/projects/beautifyla.html,,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Beautify Earth’s vision is to create 50 murals in one year throughout South Los Angeles, initially targeting 3 neighborhoods: Crenshaw, Central Avenue/84th Street and La Brea/Slauson. One potential project includes a space large enough to accommodate several murals along with art structures and can be used to host community events, workshops, classes and even an outdoor café or farmer’s market. 
 
 We have already created four murals in South Los Angeles. These murals were painted on walls in the Crenshaw district that were being tagged nightly. Since the murals have been installed, these walls have gone untouched—some for a full year. The community is proud, and building owners are ecstatic, calling them life changing for their businesses.","All Beautify projects begin with location scouting, followed by outreach to building or wall owners. Once the owner is identified and approves the project, Beautify’s volunteer artists develop an artistic concept and rendering. 
 
 Community building is an integral component of our process. Project leaders identify neighborhood councils, schools and local nonprofits in order to build awareness and engage local volunteers. Next, a crew of volunteers is assembled to execute the project. They create a work plan and approach vendors for donations/discounts on supplies. 
 Murals form the focal point to connect communities. Beautify also offers free dance and arts education programs to local communities in tandem with mural creation. Other activities will be determined in partnership with the local community and may include:
 
 • Greening, gardening and landscaping 
 • Cultural events
 • Civic engagement activities
 • Street gatherings
 • Street clean-up 
 
 In recognition that creating great streets transforms neighborhoods and businesses, Mayor Garcetti established a Great Streets initiative to attract pedestrians and new businesses to revitalize streets that need help. Two of the 15 initial thoroughfares slated for improvements are in South Los Angeles (one on Crenshaw and one on Central Avenue). As part of our efforts in the next 12 months, we will be meeting with the Great Streets team to discuss incorporating Beautify’s mural painting and community development work into the Great Streets program. We will also meet with the new General Manager for Cultural Affairs about bringing our program to more neighborhoods. 
 
 Because Beautify’s program has been developed to identify and mentor neighborhood champions and inexpensively help them implement their vision for their community, Beautify can have a significant impact throughout the region within a very short timeframe. Adding two part-time staff members will allow us to accomplish the goals set out for this project and lay a firm foundation for Beautify’s future growth.","Beautify’s murals serve as vehicles of business improvement and community pride and inspire a connection to one’s neighborhood, one’s history and oneself. Murals give residents, business owners and passersby ways to identify neighborhoods, and serve as community gathering places. The creation and placement of murals has an immediate effect on the daily lives of Los Angeles residents and businesses. The process of the community coming together to create and support each mural starts building connections between neighbors even before the mural is created.
 
 The broken windows theory states that “maintaining and monitoring urban environments in a well-ordered condition may stop further vandalism and escalation into more serious crime.” Neglect creates a sense of hopelessness and despair. Conversely, “perceived beauty or aesthetic character of a location has a positive and significant effect on perceived community satisfaction. It is one of the most significant factors alongside economic security, good schools, and the perceived capacity for social interaction.” (Florida, Mellander and Stolarick, 2009). Aesthetic negligence is also correlated with high crime and poverty. Whether a symptom of depressed economic times, insufficient economic development or natural disaster, lack of public attention and investment leaves its stain on local residents and businesses.
 
 As neglect is viral, so is beautification. Murals empower residents and communities, and connect them with one another. Businesses that have participated in other Beautify Earth projects have reported up to a 50% increase in revenue in less than a year’s time as a result of our contribution to their otherwise blank and blighted walls. Countless residents and patrons have commented about their delight in seeing otherwise unsightly areas virtually transformed as a result of our work.
 
 Our project will infuse South Los Angeles with the same benefits. By 2050, we believe that our impact will be citywide. We will have brought art and beauty to every neglected wall and neighborhood, inspiring others to showcase their creativity and making LA one of the most inspiring cities in the world – a city that values the voice of each individual, and connects them to one another through meaningful artistic and civic engagement activities. Often forgotten, South Los Angeles will have moved past its blighted history and begin a transformation worthy of its tremendous potential.","This project will directly benefit and impact local residents, business owners and artists in South Los Angeles. While the immediate effects are improved community pride and a sense of inspiration and transformation, Beautify’s efforts develop the local economy by improving local business revenue, attracting new investment and generating interest for tourists and visitors. This in turn leads to job creation across multiple industries and sectors. We will be helped in these efforts by our collaborators, which include two non-profits that focus on economic development and a local marketing firm that hosts an internet talk show with 300,000 monthly viewers. 
 
 According to Americans for the Arts, “communities that invest in the arts reap the additional benefits of jobs, economic growth, and a quality of life that positions those communities to compete in our 21st-century creative economy.” In other words, “Investments in public art are not just for cultural or aesthetic purposes; they also can have a positive bottom-line economic impact, with material financial benefits to their owners. Good art is good business.” (Rosenfeld, 2012).
 
 Beautification also impacts the individual. Public art projects inspire; they open minds and hearts. The mural process is both a demonstration of support and a call to action. Murals can empower youth to use their creativity to join in a sense of ownership and pride instead of following an impulse for destruction or isolation. Murals connect individuals to their neighborhoods and serve as an example that anyone can become engaged, take responsible action and lend to the richness of their own community. 
 
 Individuals who have the privilege of living and working in beautiful settings feel valued. And when people feel valued, they recognize the importance of their own voice and ability to create change in their communities. Enhancing and beautifying neighborhoods therefore paves the way for greater civic participation, including neighborhood council representation, elected official outreach and voter turnout.","Our work is collaborative in nature. We bring together artists, community members, businesses, employees, property owners, government officials, their staff and other government workers, and philanthropic sources to volunteer time and/or donate goods, services or funds for mural painting, street fairs, arts education, outreach and other community-building activities that increase connections between people of varied races, backgrounds, interests, and socioeconomic groups.
 
 Home Depot and Sherwin William are currently collaborators providing supplies and volunteers. Project leaders live and/or work in the area and are deeply connected to their community. The project leader begins by connecting with local organizations and businesses to find walls and volunteers.
 
 In just a short time, we have interest in collaborating from: West Angeles Community Development Corporation (connected with West Angeles Church, which is a cornerstone of the Crenshaw community and involved in economic development activities in the area); George Crenshaw Development Corp. (facilitating transit-oriented development); Dan Rosenfeld, who has worked extensively in South LA, is former deputy to Supervisor Mark Ridley Thomas and President of George Crenshaw Development Corp.; and Starlett Quarles of urban X marketing (branding, urban marketing, and community PR services), who hosts an Internet talk show with 300,000 viewers and was honored as one of Los Angeles’ Most Influential African American Movers and Shakers by the LA Wave Newspaper. 
 
 We have also had conversations with area neighborhood council presidents who are excited to work with us and will include us on agendas to obtain official support in the near future. We have also reached out to the Greater LA African-American Chamber and the LA Latino Chamber. 
 
 Other potential collaborators that we have reached out to but not confirmed:
 
 Knox Presbyterian Church (volunteers); 
 St. James Armenian Apostolic Church (volunteers); 
 Park Mesa Heights Community Council (volunteers, engaging the community, outreach); Crenshaw High School (volunteers); 
 Southeast Neighborhood Council (volunteers, engaging the community, outreach); 
 CANNDU (Neighborhood Council) (volunteers, engaging the community, outreach); 
 Fremont High School (volunteers); and
 Charles Drew Middle School (volunteers).
 
 When funding is secured all collaborators will be confirmed.",

For the past five years, Beauty Bus volunteers have provided so many moments of hope and respite to clients and caregivers. It is now time to create the optimal volunteer experience. Every aspect of our three core programs (In-Home Visits, Pop-Up Salons and Bag of Beauty) depend on the time and commitment of our trained volunteers. We do not exist without them. By streamlining our system and minimizing any barrier to entry – this will ensure that we can capture potential volunteer excitement and convert them to volunteers quickly. Resulting in an increase in the number of clients, services and bags we deliver.","After five years we recognize that our volunteers come to Beauty Bus because they are drawn to our mission. It is time to create a volunteer program that is easy to use and in line with how so many are already scheduling their time. Currently, the In-Home Program centers on the date requested by the patient/caregiver and can be long for both staff and volunteers.
 We have started looking into purchasing salon systems. There are a few that allow us a quick fix. However, a salon system would be a stand-alone system. We currently house our client and volunteer in excel sheets and in our database. In a perfect world, adapting our current database and/or finding a way to make the salon systems work with our database would provide a solution for scheduling and evolve our unique volunteer program from a hand-holding endeavor to one ready for growth and the 21st century.
 With current tools and automation, we believe we can switch this entire process and serve more people. We are also looking to this system to support future growth. We believe that the system should actually revolve around the availability of the beauty professional and beauty buddy – our volunteers!","In addition to our clients, Beauty Bus develops a deep and mutually beneficial relationship with our volunteers. The interaction that takes place on a Beauty Bus Foundation visit is unique. Clients and volunteers develop new perspectives about what living with a chronic or terminal illness looks like. The subtle change that happens is raising social awareness about the populations we serve. Our volunteers are changing their community as they work toward a more inclusive society focused on opportunity for those caring for and living with a chronic or terminal condition. Since our founding we have seen 5,000 clients, provided 4,000 services and delivered 16,000 bags. And we have only begun to scratch the surface of the nearly 50,000 Angelenos living with chronic or terminal conditions, who qualify for our services. Success in 2050 would mean that Beauty Bus is an integrated part of the pallative care services that hospital and social service agencies recommend to clients and caregivers across Los Angeles County. Perhaps our most profound accomplishment is in generating connection and the show of support in the forms of referrals we receive from those in the healthcare fields. Nurses, doctors and social workers are telling their patients and families about Beauty Bus because they have seen first hand the powerful transformation that comes from the human interaction during a hair cut or a manicure.","When we started Beauty Bus, it was clear to us that, disease does not discriminate. We see a gap between ""quality of care"" and ""quality of life."" It is in this gap that we work.
 
 Beauty Bus serves chronically or terminally ill men, women and children with the following diseases or conditions: ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease), Cancer, Muscular Dystrophy, Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's Disease, Spinal Cord Injuries, Stroke, Other Select Neuromuscular or Motor Neuron Diseases…AND their caregivers.
 
 Beauty Bus programs benefit a multitude of individuals. Our programs will benefit the clients and caregivers we serve, their family members, as well as our social service and hospital partners.","Beauty Bus Foundation benefits from strong collaboration and volunteer support in many areas of operation. Beauty Bus currently works with over twenty social service partners including: 
 ALS Association Golden West Chapter, National MS Society, Ronald McDonald House Charities, UCLA Mattel Children’s Hospital, UCLA Radiation Oncology, USC Keck Hospital, City of Hope, Glendale Adventist Medical Center, Rose Room Hospice, Pomona Valley Medical Center, Leeza’s Care Connection, Los Angeles Caregiver Resource Center, No Worries Now, VITAS Hospice, Parkinson’s Resource Organization, The Stroke Association, Concern Foundation and We Spark.
 
 Every year we are deepening our relationships with current partners and adding new partners. Collaboration with these partners is critical because we are able to:
 1) Reach more individuals who would otherwise not know about Beauty Bus
 2) Add value to our partners programs by making interactions with clients and caregivers more meaningful
 3) Build community among all the individuals involved in the process of caring for and advocating for those living with chronic or terminal conditions. In addition, to the tremendous partnerships in our program area, Beauty Bus has successful collaborations with a number of beauty companies and the Professional Beauty Association. These relationships are responsible for the million dollars in product donations which are used at all of our events, visits and our Bag of Beauty Program.",
4102023,An Arts Commons for Everyone,We propose to build a multi-use indoor/outdoor Arts Commons on the grounds of the Old Venice City Hall.,Play,2014015,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050play/projects/Beyondbaroque.html,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"Many visitors to our center come from Ventura, San Bernardino, Riverside, and Orange Counties","The Arts Commons will include:
 
 1) An outdoor stage and gathering space for performances.
 
 2) A children’s playground and garden.
 
 3) An outdoor oven and communal table.
 
 4) Numerous park benches.
 
 5) Public murals by local artists.
 
 6) Extensive upgrades to the indoor black box theater, allowing for more diverse and higher-quality literary readings, theatrical and musical perfomances, film festivals, and other community events.
 
 7) A refurbished central lobby in which community members can socialize and enjoy refreshments after attending an event or participating in a workshop.
 
 8) A redesigned literary space and small-press bookstore for free community writing workshops.
 
 9) An upgraded art gallery in which local artists can display their work.
 
 10) Upgrades to the existing bathroom facilities.
 
 11) The creation of an outdoor workshop space in our backyard poet’s garden, allowing us to offer an increased number of free writing workshops and literary seminars that cover a wider array of genres and themes. 
 
 12) A community vegetable garden (this portion of the project is already under construction, and will be completed regardless of whether or not we receive funding).
 
 A master plan for the outdoor portion of the Arts Commons has already been prepared by the noted design firm Rios Clementi Hale. One major portion of the project – the community vegetable garden – has already commenced under the direction of our partner organization, Kiss the Ground. Given funding, community volunteers organized by ourselves and Kiss the Ground, will begin construction on the rest of the proposed Arts Commons. Most of the landscaping, as well as construction of the outdoor performance space and community table,will be done by volunteers. Professionals will be used to wire the outdoor performance space for sound and lighting, to upgrade the indoor theater, and to improve restroom facilities. We and our partner organizations hold a lease on the land and have secured all necessary permits, so all that we require is the necessary funding to begin construction.","In an era of increasing inequality, there are few venues in which people of all backgrounds share space, let alone interact. Los Angeles has a particular lack of public spaces in which people from different walks of life are encouraged to engage in dialogue with each other.
 
 Beyond Baroque has long combatted this radical shrinking of the public sphere by offering high-quality weekly writing workshops that are free of charge to the community. In these workshops, creative professionals working on their novels often come in contact with with restaurant servers looking to tell their own stories, lawyers receive feedback on their poetry from nannies, and the elderly exchange drafts of short-stories with teens. 
 
 Our proposed Arts Commons carries both the spirit and content of this programming out into the open air by creating an arts park along Venice boulevard in Venice. This park will provide a beautiful outdoor space in which people can gather for outdoor workshops and performances, collaborate on growing vegetables in a community garden, have fun in a playground, or just relax over a nice picnic. In turn, visitors to the park can wander inside to Beyond Baroque to enjoy a reading or concert in our refurbished indoor theater, socialize over a refreshment in our lobby, or peruse our small-press bookstore. Or they can move next door to take in the art presented by our sister organization, the Social and Public Art Resource Center (SPARC).
 
 The Venice Arts Commons takes the virtues of the traditional public park – a safe space in which different kinds of people can relax and mingle – and reimagines the park as a participatory venue for people to engage in artistic and educational dialog with their community. By bringing performances, readings, concerts, interactive writing workshops, and other kinds of art-making out into the open alongside a community garden, playground, and picnic area, the Venice Arts Commons will serve as a vital civic space not only for the Venice community, but for arts audiences from across the city. We believe it will serve as a model for other community arts centers and public spaces across the city, making Los Angeles in 2050 a city in which the arts are are interwoven into the public and civic life of the city.","1) People in the communities of Venice, Mar Vista, Santa Monica, Culver City, Palms, Playa Vista, and Marina del Rey.
 
 2) Literary audiences from across Southern California who attend readings and performances in either the outdoor or indoor theaters.
 
 3) Arts audiences who come to enjoy the outdoor murals in the garden, the art on display in our art gallery, or who visit Social and Public Art Resource Center next door.
 
 4) Aspiring writers of all ages who participate in our workshops.
 
 5) Teen writers who participate in writing programs for youth.
 
 6) Elderly writers who participate in our writing workshops for seniors.
 
 7) Children in the community looking for a playground.
 
 8) Dog walkers.
 
 9) Community members interested in learning about sustainable growing practices in the community garden planted by Kiss the Ground.
 
 10) Local artists and writers.","-Kiss the Ground
 Kiss the Ground is dedicated to rebuilding the soils in order to improve human and planetary health. They have spearheaded the idea to transform the outdoor grounds into a public space, and are currently digging a community vegetable garden that will be the first component of the proposed Arts Commons.

4102037,The Wellbeing Project: Working together to create a city of wellbeing,"Through The Wellbeing Project we will work together to define, measure, and actively improve wellbeing in our community.",Connect,2014016,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050connect/projects/wellbeingproject.html,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"The Wellbeing Project is a game-changing update to the way a community understands its strengths and challenges. The Local Wellbeing Index will harness the power of data to drive action. By reflecting a community back to itself in a genuine, dynamic, data-driven way, city government will have information needed to make better decisions, allow social impact service providers to directly address community needs, and empower residents to take charge of their own wellbeing. This common platform will make it easier to work together to create a city of wellbeing by strengthening community health, cohesion, trust, accountability, and connections. Ultimately, we hope this collective impact strategy will be open and scalable to other cities.","1: Define community wellbeing and the Local Wellbeing Index. Under the advisement of an international, interdisciplinary panel of experts, the City is working with RAND and the New Economics Foundation (nef) to create the analytic framework for the Local Wellbeing Index, a new science-based measurement tool with real-world use. This framework is directly informed by needs expressed by primary end users (City staff). The framework outlines specific things we want to know about our community. Grouped into 5 dimensions (Community, Place, Learning, Health, and Opportunity), these things will tell us who Santa Monica is and how Santa Monica is doing. Through deep listening, we will work with Daylight Design to determine how users might engage with the data, resulting in wireframes for the platform that will bring the index to life online.
 2: Measure community wellbeing. The index will be fed by a blend of administrative and subjective data. Using the framework, indicators will be mapped to data collected by the City and other sources, and from people via a new survey instrument. We will also explore the potential of social media as a viable source of data. RAND researchers will analyze the data and refine as needed, and develop the backend data management system. We will also build out the wireframes for the MVP version of the platform that will visualize the data, give it meaning, and engage users. 
 3: Actively improve community wellbeing. The City project team will work with RAND, nef, and Daylight Design to engage primary end users (City staff) and other user groups (community partners and residents) to identify uses for the index. The goal is to use the index to strengthen community connections, trust, accountability, and cohesion. We anticipate that the index will aid City decision-makers; assist change agents identify and provide services that meet community needs; and empower residents to take charge of improving their own wellbeing and connections with each other. The successful uptake of The Wellbeing Project and sustained use of the index will require building momentum within the community through innovative engagement strategies, including the regularly refreshed and enhanced platform that will bring the index to life online. Ultimately, we envision The Wellbeing Project as being open and scalable to other cities interested in gaining a deeper understanding of their community in order to drive collective impact strategies to improve wellbeing.","Santa Monica is a community facing change. Without a common understanding of who the community is and how we connect with one another, fear of change has created artificial barriers between people. Local government is uniquely positioned to make decisions and provide information that could directly facilitate partnerships and improve connections, yet we currently lack the information needed to do so. By creating a way to reflect a community back to itself in a genuine, data-driven way we believe we can begin to move beyond perception and anecdotal information; and that having a better understanding of ourselves in relation to our community will surface similarities and common concerns that will encourage people to work together to improve connections with each other and the world around them. In the short term, The Wellbeing Project is a way to recalibrate the conversation from reactive to proactive, to focus on collective impact and positive change. By 2050, we hope that The Wellbeing Project and the Local Wellbeing Index will have spread to communities beyond Santa Monica, creating a network of like-minded cities bonded by a similar approach to identifying and addressing community needs. Having information needed to promote positive communication, and a platform that engages and connects city staff, service providers, and residents, will strengthen our community, our collective resilience, and our ability to manage change together.","The Local Wellbeing Index will not be a static report that sits in a drawer. It will be a dynamically-refreshed tool with real-world use. While Local Wellbeing Index will no doubt have broad application, there are three primary end user groups for The Wellbeing Project:
 > City staff (to guide decision-making and resource allocation)
 > Local nonprofit organizations (to help identify needs and guide development of social impact programs) 
 > Community members (to empower people to take charge of improving their own wellbeing)
 The way in which people access, understand, and plug into the Index will be critical to the success of The Wellbeing Project. Central to this will be an engagement platform that brings the Index to life online. The north star vision for this platform includes features that will make data-driven decision making possible; give data meaning; and engage the community. Ensuring the successful uptake of the platform will require outreach strategies that will build awareness and momentum among the primary end user groups. These strategies should go beyond local government’s traditional one-way approach to outreach. By tapping into the local creative and tech sectors for ideas and implementation, outreach for The Wellbeing Project will become a community-driven effort with a broad base of support. While the ways in which end user groups are engaged may vary, they will be based on the same principles of deep listening and do-it-together collective impact.","City Project Team: This interdepartmental group brings diverse interests and expertise to guide the successful implementation and uptake of the project. Participants come from the City Managers Office, Community & Cultural Services, Information Systems, Santa Monica Public Library, Office of Sustainability & the Environment, and Planning & Community Development. In addition, staff from all Departments have been actively engaged in the project, ensuring that the end result will be representative of the broad range of work done by our full service city. This collaborative approach is helping us connect the dots between our work through the lends of wellbeing, setting us up for effective use of the index once it's ready.
 RAND Corporation & New Economics Foundation: These partners are leading development of the index, including the analytic framework, survey instrument, and backend data management system. As one of the world's leading think tanks, RAND brings a depth of expertise in research, data collection & analysis. Based in the UK, the New Economics Foundation has been working at the epicenter of wellbeing research, measurement & application for decades. Working together, this team has helped the City assemble and convene an international panel of experts to advise on the project. 
 Panel of Experts: This advisory group allows us to tap into the international wellbeing knowledge bank. Panel participants represent a broad range of disciplines, including economics, behavioral science, public health, public policy, sustainability, and technology/data science.
 Daylight Design: This team has been engaged to apply human centered design principles to tease out critical questions, challenges, and opportunities inherent to this project. Through deep listening, research, and synthesis, Daylight helped us create the guiding principles and vision for how and why users would engage with the index. During the user experience visioning process, Daylight's work had a catalytic impact, helping all aspects of the project move from 'what' toward 'how.'
 Bloomberg Philanthropies: The project was conceived of thanks to Bloomberg Philanthropies Mayors Challenge, a contest to ignite innovation in local government. As 1 of 5 winning cities, Santa Monica continues to benefit from guidance and advice of this expert team.",

The goal is to help generate and facilitate solutions to problems facing communities through the engagement of their respective members; Civic LA will equip residents and organizations with the tools they need to expand economic opportunity and social mobility through their participation in civic life.","The IUPUI Task Force on Civic Engagement broadly defines the term civic life and civic engagement interchangeably as a concept that generally includes activities that build on the collective resources, skills, expertise and knowledge of citizens to improve the quality of life in communities. The aim of Civic LA is to (with that definition in mind) fully support all five goals of LA2050 -- making Los Angeles the best and healthiest place to live, play, create, learn and especially connect. The project will help Angelenos address the concerns of their communities by serving as a conduit for information and resources. Civic LA will put everyday people in touch with their capacity to make a difference and create more fulfilling lives for themselves, their families and their neighbors. 
 
 Civic LA will gather and disseminate information from the nonprofit and public sector as well as private organizations on ways to participate in civic life across Los Angeles County. The initiative will offer a centralized mechanism to enlist, receive and coordinate support -- whether time and talent, financial resources, or political voice -- for civic engagement activities which may include: public meetings, forums, special events and community activities; skill and leadership training opportunities; service & volunteerism, governing board participation or other ways to contribute value to the community.
 
 As a convener, Civic LA will partner to host neighborhood based workshops and resource fairs where attendees can learn about enrollment/participation in eligible programs, services and public benefits for which they qualify. Examples may include early childhood education enrollment fairs, parent education classes, higher education and adult learning information sessions, employment fairs and career training, community issue education, and assistance for special populations (e.g. English language learners; small, minority or women owned businesses; veterans and military families, etc.). As an aggregator of content, Civic LA will provide online resources via the web and mobile technology that help Angelenos find and pursue engagement opportunities.","Whether your interest is in alleviating poverty by addressing homelessness and hunger, you’d like to see a better prepared workforce for emerging labor market needs, or just want to find a fun community activity to take your family to on a Thursday night, Civic LA will be the hub for you to access information on the many great assets Los Angeles has to offer. 
 
 The online platform will allow you use your voice to express opinions, tell your story, and share your world view. Find deeper connectivity to neighbors who share your interests. Learn about, contribute to, and enlist others to support the causes you believe in. 
 
 Imagine what the world would be like if every time you were inspired to help someone or something, you found a great way to do it. What if you better knew how to use, manage, assess, and understand the resources within your reach (human and otherwise) to enjoy a better life? In 2050, Civic LA could be the destination with a 35 year history for those desires to be achieved.","Civic LA will benefit all stakeholders who wish to stay up to date on what matters most to them in their your community. Residents and visitors; leaders, law-makers and developers of public policy; employers and employment seekers; parents and learners of all ages; activists, volunteers, philanthropists, agents of change and the providers of human services would all get value out of having a one-stop-shop specific to the interrelated networks that comprise the social fabric of Los Angeles County.","Opportunity Nation is a bipartisan, national campaign comprised of more than 300 businesses, educational institutions, nonprofits and civic organizations working together to expand economic mobility and close the opportunity gap in America of which Community Centered is a member.

The smaller events will take place in new locations and will be scheduled leading up to and after the main event in April 2015. 
 
 During September and October of 2014 and January 2015, we will work on details of the first 4 events to take place in November and December 2014, and February and March 2015. We will work with existing and new partners to determine the locations of these events and to plan educational programming and artistic content. This time will also be used to create a detailed outreach plan in the neighborhoods surrounding the event venues.
 
 EDSLA 2015 in April will be used as an ideal opportunity to showcase the artists and other partners with whom the mini events were created as well as details of the mini events already held. A dedicated booth will have displays slide shows etc. showcasing these events and materials soliciting partnerships for the remaining four events. In addition EDSLA’15 will be the official launch of re-vamped outreach strategy for CSU’s Village Market Place, featuring wraps around our vehicles including our Produce delivery bikes and visually arresting community postcards and posters. 
 
 May 2015 will be used to work on details of the last 3 events to take place in June, July and August 2015. We will work with existing and new partners to determine the locations of these events and to plan educational programming and artistic content. This time will also be used to create a detailed outreach plan in the neighborhoods surrounding the event venues.
 
 In September 2015 we will launch the new permanent Produce Stand/s created as a result of this project and we will use the opportunity to launch an expanded Produce Bag bike delivery service to meet the needs of our growing subscribers.","By creating a series of events that will offer ongoing opportunities for collaborative creativity in educational, artistic, artisanal and food related programming, this project will make LA the best place to create now! Over the past six years, CSU’s annual event, Earth Day South LA has become a showcase of local skills, talents and innovation in community driven solutions to the everyday problems around us. 
 
 We have shown that community residents can come together and create a safe environment to have fun, celebrate our foods and cultures, learn about and participate in sustainable practices, and connect with each other and organizations working to make positive change in our neighborhood. The success of EDSLA has demonstrated that there is a thirst for information about and for opportunities to participate in the numerous and exciting projects taking place in our communities. We are proud that EDSLA has served as a catalyst for residents to become agents of sustainable change, improving the quality of our lives, and advancing a more just society.
 
 The event has taken spaces that already exist in our neighborhood, a school playground and a parking lot, and for one day of the year, with multiple partnerships we have transformed dull concrete into an amazing community space. Leaving behind permanent green spaces, adorned by beautiful art.
 
 This project will build upon the foundation created by leveraging the EDSLA brand to extend the creative space to a number of smaller events at various locations in South LA. The new venues and more localized nature of these mini EDSLA events will provide an opportunity to build new partnerships and transform new spaces.
 
 Just as EDSLA has done, these mini events will:
 *Cultivate, support, promote and provide a venue for local and earth friendly artists, performers, entreupreuneurs etc, to participate in, reflect, inspire and envision our movement for sustainable change.
 *Increase community residents’ awareness of organizations and individuals doing transformative work in our community.
 *Cultivate and nurture a culture and environment for collaboration among organizations and individuals working to advance sustainable change.
 This project will thus help to lay the foundation of a solid body of work for a creative and inspired LA in 2050.","The project directly benefits SCLA families by increasing access to high quality, affordable fresh produce. Liquor stores, fast-food chains, and corner/convenience stores comprise 94% of food retail outlets in SCLA. Only 75% of food retail outlets sell fresh produce, compared to over 90% in wealthier areas of LA. Only 28% of adults in SCLA report that produce where they shop is high quality, the lowest in the county. This toxic food environment dramatically affects our community’s health. Residents have the highest rates of obesity in the county, adults 36% and children 29%. Adults have the highest rate of diabetes 12% and hypertension 29%. One in 4 households are without a vehicle (compared to 8% in West LA), leaving residents dependent on the food retail nearest their homes. 
 
 This project directly benefits youth ages 13–19. Youth in SCLA face many personal and community barriers to obtaining and holding jobs. An alarming 74% of adults’ have not completed high school, and only 3% have earned a college degree. Worse yet jobs in SCLA are few in number and offer extremely low wages. Council District 8, where CSU operates, ranks last among LA’s 15 districts in total # of jobs and average wages. Through participation in CSU’s programs youth build confidence and are empowered to create change in their community and in their own lives. They leave with a broad set of skills in areas of urban agriculture, nutrition, cooking, community organizing and advocacy, poising them for future success. These youth are in integral part of our operations and receive on going opportunities for further internships, apprentiships and ultimately jobs, 5 of our current staff began with CSU as youth interns.
 
 This project directly benefits small farmers, we purchase almost exclusively from farmers of color with family operations who sell at the few farmers markets in our area, which are smaller and less profitable than other markets in the city. By purchasing from these growers we make the trip into town more profitable, hopefully ensuring that they will continue to sell at the markets in our community. In 2013 we spent $56,000 purchasing from small farmers. As the VMP expands we will increase these expenditures by an average of 20% annually, reaching $80,000 in 2015.","EMH Creative Group and GREEDY City: Have co-hosted food-centered educational, arts and community events, including EDSLA’14 with CSU. Both bring extensive experience, will be co-hosts of EDSLA ’15 and mini events organized as part of this project.

4102046,Meet Me @the Metro: Theater/In/Transit (M3TNT),Meet Me @the Metro: Theatre/In/Transit (M3TNT) is an innovative theatrical extravaganza staged on and around the LA Metro Gold line.,Connect,2014019,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050connect/projects/M3TNT.html,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,"M3TNT is a community based arts project performed on the Metro Gold line. It is the most innovative transit-oriented “Happening” in Los Angeles, featuring music, dance, theatre and puppets along the various stops between Union Station and Memorial Park. The production seeks to connect people to areas they would not otherwise go and to offer an alternative to sometimes inaccessible and expensive art venues. M3TNT with performances in communities along strategically selected station stops. Audiences will travel from station to station in mixed groups while experiencing a communal journey.","The work to make M3TNT a reality has already begun and though there is still much to do we are on pace to a successful opening. To date we have identified and secured a core group of theatre artists to consult and collaborate on the project including Guillermo Aviles-Rodriguez the creator of Meet Me @Metro and an authority on transit-oriented performances in Los Angeles. In March of 2014 we reached out to the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) and started the negotiations with Diane Dominguez, Senior Real Estate Officer at Metro for the use of selected stops along the Gold line, including Union Station, China Town, Highland Park, Mission, Del Mar, and Memorial Park. We have also reached out to the Metro Art Docent Council to secure metro volunteers during our performances. We will also begin strategic outreach to government officials who oversee the areas in which the show happens, such as City Council members José Huizar (District 14) and Gilbert Cedillo (District 1). 
 Another key component of making this project a reality is the community councils and other organizations found along the Gold line route, they will most accurately know the hidden treasures of their community. Ideally, we want to have these groups collaborate in the development of the logistics of the project. Currently our M3TNT production and artistic teams are assembling a strategic project plan to disseminate to potential community and artistic collaborators. It is after this that our artistic collaborators will be selected and oriented to Metro rules and regulations. It is a goal of Company of Angels that all support staff attend a Metro safety training and so we have met with Richard Morallo of Metro’s Community Relations Office to secure spots for all our volunteers and staff well in advance of the technical rehearsal in April of 2015. In addition, it is our goal to secure all permits for performing spaces by November of 2014. All artistic collaborators and performers will need to develop and rehearse their pieces while marketing and outreach plans are designed and executed. During April 2015, we will go into tech rehearsals and performances for key stakeholders and community members. We are working on including a live feed of the opening performance as well as producing short commercials to advertise M3TNT on Metro’s Bus TV channel. During May – July 2015, the surveys distributed during performances will be analyzed and results presented to Metro.","Considering the unacceptably high level of segregation in Los Angeles, both geographic and economic, between poor communities (mostly of color) and more affluent communities (mostly White) a project like Meet Me @the Metro: Theatre/In/Transit strategically and sensitively provides a safe and creative context for these two groups to undertake an interactive and creative journey. M3TNT has a unique ability to bring people to view public transportation as a familiar and even pleasurable means of transportation as well as holding the potential to increase ridership among the artistic community and art attendance among the transit using community. A potential long-term effect of this brand of art is that people will decide to return to some of the communities they visited for the first time during our show, this may even provide some of the more economically depressed areas along our shows route to experience added income. One strategy we will employ to facilitate this is to have merchants along the Gold line offer discount coupons to any M3TNT audience members who return to the neighborhood to shop or eat within a month of the production. A transit-oriented project like this can also go a long way to providing a “hip factor” to public transportation amongst an art going public that like, Los Angeles as a whole, is car-centric. 
 For some time now, the art and performance community in Los Angeles has been searching for a model to produce work that is sustainable, accessible and relevant; M3TNT offers a model that achieves these goals effectively. Too many low-income communities are left out of the equation when it comes to interactions with quality arts and performance. Often times, issues of geography prevent people from venturing too far outside their neighborhood. Knowing this, we have the responsibility to assure that the artist of the future will look for new and creative ways to collaborate with non-arts organizations to bring theater to the masses. M3TNT represents a new fusion between art and transit, transporting audience members through LA using a variety of site-specific artistic experiences along Metro. People need this project because it connects them to quality art where they live and work, rather than requiring them to come to it. This project is participatory, encourages audiences to be an active part of the performances, and directly influences the shape and the trajectory of their experiences.","Through Meet Me @the Metro: Theatre/In/Transit, Company of Angels (CoA) seeks to reach people who would not otherwise be able to experience art and connect them with communities that offer art and culture. Our vision is to serve both artists and audiences from all of Los Angeles’ communities. Some key populations we want to reach out to include under-represented groups from downtown skid row with plans to incorporate a group of skid row performers who have taken some of our theatre workshops into the show. We will also set aside a portion of our tickets for audience members from key zip codes that have a high concentration of low income residents and we will have bilingual marketing to reach out to the Spanish speaking community along the Gold line. Historically the more affluent and theatre going community has been well represented in this brand of work so we are confident that our goal to reach out to the less fortunate will not preclude us from marketing to all of Los Angeles. In fact, the mixture and connecting of different races and economic levels is one of the main goals of M3TNT. The artists - writers, designers, actors, directors, stage managers whose work we will exhibit will all represent the communities that make up Los Angeles’ diverse landscape and so they too are beneficiaries of this project's magic. It should be noted, that CoA has a long record of multicultural work. Out of the last 37 main stage productions since 2007, 35 have depicted under-represented communities, including the LGBTQ, Thai, Mexican immigrant, African-American, Japanese, and South Asian communities (The other two plays, which depicted the White community, were directed by artists of color).
 The participants in our projects typically range in age from late teen to adult and we will assure a high level of participation from this group in the staging of M3TNT. In the last 2 years, we have produced 10 original works exclusively by theater artists from under-represented groups in Los Angeles, including Latino, African-American, Asian, and LGBTQ and the make up of our M3TNT will be consistent with this trend.","CoA plans to reach out to Los Angeles city and county government, DOT, civic organizations, small and large businesses, nonprofit agencies, artists and individuals. Thus far, CoA has confirmed collaborations with the following organizations all of which have collaborated in the production of site-specific work in the past. 
 
 *Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro): http://www.metro.net/
 A fundamental component of Meet Me @the Metro is the smooth travel of our audience from station to station. Metro is the most important organization to help with this. They will provide permits, a group of key volunteers and help with the visibility of the project.
 
 *Opera Del Espacio (ODE): http://www.operadelespacio.org/
 Assuring artistic diversity is important to this production and ODE brings just that, they are a movement based company and have participated in many site-specific transit-oriented projects on Metro trains. 
 
 *Rick Burkhardt: http://princemyshkins.com/rickburkhardt2.html
 Rick is an Obie-award-winning playwright, performer, composer, and songwriter whose original chamber music, theater, and text pieces have been performed all over the world. Rick has unparalleled experience composing music for site-specific transit-oriented projects on Metro trains.
 
 *Vox Box Arts Collective (VAC): http://www.voxboxarts.com/home.html
 VAC is a nonprofit multi-cultural interdisciplinary arts group dedicated to presenting live performance, film, and visual arts to children and adults of diverse incomes, cultures, and abilities. The Artistic Director has experience with Site-specific transit-oriented work. 
 
 *Teatro Arollo//Theater Stream (TA): http://www.teatroarroyo.com/
 TA is the only theatre producing work in the Highland Park area and so they are vital to the artistic and geographic integrity of the project. 
 
 Three factors that are critical to the success of our proposed collaboration with new collaborators are experience with site-specific work, availability of artists and coordination of scheduling. When it comes to non-confirmed collaborators who have not experienced the power of transit-oriented site-specific work these three factors often come up.",

An initial site will be based on visibility, site suitability, and safety. The potential sculpture themes will be developed by Conant-Moran Design and Fabrication. The Sculptures will be designed, fabricated and installed by Conant-Moran Inc.. The themes for the sculptures will be contemporary and will be readily recognized as things the community recognizes. Potential sculptures include Nintendo controller, Etch-a-sketch, Lego Man, Jacks, Light Bright, Tetris and similar ideas. The sculpture are approximately 10 times actual size. Implementation is not complex. The decisions needed are straight forward. Fabrication of the metal structures is a one person job. It is important that this application does not imply more complexity than there will be.","Presently, there is an obvious lack of public art and likewise lack of appreciation of art. The grantee has experimented with placement of artistic pieces in public areas and has noted the inquisitiveness, attention, and curiosity of those who live and work in the neighborhood. Revitalization of a neighborhood must include instilling or creating pride in the neighborhood. The sculpture pieces are intended to be the focal point of neighborhood pride. The sculptures are intended as a seed for the future. Any change in the culture of a community is preceded by a change in the environment. A piece of art occupying a small space can have a big role in changing perspectives of individuals who otherwise may not have their artistic inquisitiveness piqued. Whether someone is walking by, riding by in a personal vehicle or mass transit, or on a bike or skate board, a glance which captures an art piece can transform thoughts from day to day concerns to ""what if"". The sculptures are being presented as a first step and not an end-all. We cannot pretend to predict the future, but we can guide the change by contributing positive changed to the urban environment. Installing a simple piece of art on a street corner has changed one neighborhood at Broadway and 58th, and can be replicated to change more communities. Like the story of the person throwing small starfish into the ocean, small action, but it makes a big difference to the starfish.","The project is intended to benefit those who live and work in the community. The benefits are quality of life issues that are improved by positive changes to the environment. Those positively affected by the addition of art to the environment runs the gamut from old to young, male and female, business owner to the unemployed, rich and poor. Any positive change in the environment or culture directly or indirectly changes things for the good - for everyone.","The collaborators for this project are local leaders and District 9 staff who will assist with site selection and the unveiling BBQ's. These collaborators are not specifically named. They will be contacted as sculpture projects are developed. The number of collaboration participants will be small because the primary beneficiaries live and work in the immediate neighborhood.

4102048,Practicing Good CITYzenship: Today’s Civic Action Project Builds Prosocial Connections for LA2050,High school students in the Civic Action Project practice civic skills and carry values of civic engagement and connectedness into LA2050.,Connect,2014021,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050connect/projects/CivicActionProject.html,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,"We imagine a vibrant LA2050 where strong social connectedness joins citizens who work together to solve problems and improve communities. The LA2050 we envision is a place where civic engagement, voter participation and social trust are high because people understand the power of their voice and claim their right to be heard in our democracy. Research shows that education is one of strongest ways to overcome low levels of social trust and stimulate civic engagement. Thus, our idea for increasing social connectedness in LA2050 is to equip tomorrow’s voters with the skills and knowledge to lead positive change in their communities by expanding our Civic Action Project (CAP) into 50 additional high school classrooms in LA over the next year.","A city’s youth are key allies in building a strong future. Third Century Greek philosopher Diogenes was one of the first to say this, and may have said it best when he said, “[t]he foundation of every state is the education of its youth.” This ancient and enduring truth motivates CRF’s work today. Modern research confirms that civic learning in school is critical to students’ becoming prepared and willing to contribute meaningfully to community and political life. Youth who participate in civic learning today gain the skills and experience to become leaders who will ensure that LA2050 is the most civically engaged region in the U.S. While our project takes an educational approach, our ultimate aim is a citywide increase in social connectedness across LA. We equip high schoolers near graduation with confidence, leadership skills and knowledge so that they are prepared to lead ripple-effect increases in civic engagement and positive change in their communities throughout LA. By teaching high school students skills for civic engagement, we give them the tools to actively build a stronger LA both now, and in the future.
 Civic Action Project (CAP) turns the content of the traditional, public school US Government class into a learning experience that embraces the ideal of connectivity on many levels. CAP connects students to their communities and to their own ideals by asking them to identify issues that matter to them, and to back up their beliefs with focused action. CAP students identify a policy-related issue in their community that they want to impact. Students work with peers, get feedback from their teacher, and reach out to local government to create real change around the issue of their choice.
 The issues CAP students choose to work on envision positive changes across a vast range of social issues including: environmental protection, child abuse, homelessness, public transportation, animal welfare, reproductive rights, cyberbullying, and traffic safety. Students learn the content of a traditional government course through the research they must do to determine the best way to tackle their real-world problem. 150 high school teachers in LA high schools currently teach CAP. By recruiting an additional 50 LA teachers, we will connect 5,000 more students to civic engagement via CAP each school year. CAP is a proven program with high teacher retention, so the benefits of our initiative would reach far beyond the 12 month grant timeline.","Civic education today is an essential part of ensuring that the citizens of LA2050 are prepared and willing to engage in public life. Schools have a critical role to play in ensuring that every LA resident gets the type of civic learning opportunities that will empower him or her with the lifelong skills to contribute meaningfully to civic processes. Research backs up the positive impact that curriculum emphasizing civic engagement has on students’ attitudes about participating in democracy such as their level of political interest, and the strength of their intention to vote. Additionally, there is a positive correlation between exposure to civic education and attendance at a four-year college. The LA2050 Report notes that this positive cycle comes full circle as higher educational attainment is, in turn, linked to greater social connectedness. Conversely, students who do not get opportunities for civic learning in school are unlikely to come across such opportunities elsewhere. They are disproportionately less likely to vote or engage in public life in other ways.
 In 2005, a statewide coalition of non-profit organizations, business, and government-affiliated groups worked with funding from the Carnegie Corporation of New York, the Annenberg Foundation, and the W.R. Hearst Foundation to conduct an indepth survey on the impact of civic education in California on graduating seniors. The study surveyed 2,366 high school seniors who had completed the 12th grade government course mandated by the California History/ Social Science Framework and Standards. Students were selected from a range of schools to reflect California’s socioeconomic differences and racial diversity, and the study took differences in students’ classroom experiences in government and civics into account.
 The findings demonstrated that students whose classroom experience included interactive learning, exposure to diversity, and opportunities to practice civic skills were increasingly likely to become adults who prioritize civic participation, are committed to informed voting, and confident in their political knowledge. Citizens with these attitudes have greater social and political trust. By engaging students in project-based learning and requiring collaboration between peers, CAP is a program that not only helps students build prosocial connections today by making real improvements in their communities, but also sets young citizens on a path towards meaningful lifelong civic participation.","The LA2050 Report is clear that LA’s low “connectedness indicators are perhaps the most concrete (and disheartening) manifestation of LA’s inadequate education system.” By providing teachers with free, standards-aligned resources to facilitate better social studies education, CAP strikes at one of the root causes of low connectedness in LA. By giving students the opportunity to see the impact their volunteer work can have, CAP instils prosocial values like volunteerism, caring, and community involvement – values these students will carry into our future LA. This dual approach makes CAP a strong partner for LA2050’s strategy of raising LA2050’s connectedness indicators through improved educational outcomes that will generate greater civic engagement and social trust. Connectedness, the LA2050 Report notes, is fundamental to the human experience. Thus, by improving connectedness, implementing CAP on a broader scale stands to benefit all Angelenos, now and in 2050.
 The positive changes student volunteers have already created through CAP show the tremendous power of students to shape our communities for the better today. Recent CAP student achievements include:
 -Collaborating with the Public Works Department to improve city bus routes to increase efficiency and reduce traffic congestion;
 -Working with an LA City Council Member to orchestrate a South LA neighborhood clean-up;
 -Working within students’ own high-schools to craft policies that embody students’ voices on campus issues including discipline, tardy policies, student health issues, and recycling.
 These student quotes shows how CAP transforms students’ outlooks, preparing them to become adults with the skills and knowledge to make meaningful contributions to civic society and their communities:
 “I was surprised to realize that some problems and policies can be solved by students and there is no reason to sit and wait for change. Even students have the power to make a difference.”
 “I learned that it is important take opportunities to study governmental policy in the first person, as is provided through the completion of a Civic Action Project, so that students may understand the necessity for citizens to participate in their government. The government cannot take care of every aspect, as it has limited awareness. It is therefore the responsibility of the citizens to finally bring forth the changes they need. Experiencing such a civic action project gives students the experience to do so.""","CAP participants work on any policy-related issue that is important to them. This means that high school students in the program form their own connections throughout LA. 
 
 Past partners for student-initiated collaborations include: 
 
 -Bernard Parks, member of the LA City Council, representing the 8th District in South LA;
 -Public Works Department of the City of Bell Gardens;
 -Mayor of Bell Gardens, Daniel Crespo.
 -Roosevelt High School in East LA
 
 LA City Hall, Dodger Stadium, and the California African American Museum have been past key collaborators for CAP by providing locations for CAP Showcases where students have shared their civic actions with the community and media.
 
 CRF has also recently begun collaboration with Heal the Bay and the CA Coastal Commission to equip students with skills to address environmental concerns. In these partnerships, Heal the Bay and the Coastal Commission will provide students and teachers with scientifically accurate information and opportunities to study, observe, and interact with the LA coast. CRF will provide teacher trainings for environmental science teachers and other educators recruited by HtB and the Coastal Commission, and will provide classroom support for implementing CAP with a focus on environmental issues. Three factors critical to the success of these collaborations are as follows: 
 (1) clear communication between organizations; (2) defined roles for each partner specific to that organization’s expertise – for CRF this is providing civic engagement education via CAP, for the environmental groups, this is providing their expertise on environmental stewardship and issues specific to our region; (3) mutual respect for and understanding of each partner’s mission.
 
 These collaborations resulted from a middle school teacher and environmental advocate contacting CRF based on the strength of our reputation for balanced, impactful curricula that teach students how to respectfully engage with peers, opponents, and policymakers to effectively advocate for the issues they care about. The results of this interdisciplinary initiative have the potential to make LA2050 not only one of the most civically engaged regions in the U.S., but also to help ensure that the next generation of environmental stewards are prepared to defend our LA coastline. The future health of our water and of the many different communities that depend on this unique ecosystem depends on the civic engagement skills CAP students develop today.",
4102049,L Creativo - A Latin Indie Music Community,"Model for LA's Latin indie music industry - creativity as foundation, connecting LA scene w/ creativos in Latin America organizing events.",Create,2014022,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050create/projects/LCreativo.html,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,"L Creativo is already working towards the goals of the project outlined in this proposal. The team is ready to continue working with the same intensity and dedication that have made our accomplishments possible so far. 
 
 The team is already in place, the ideas are developed and the system is working. 
 
 L Creativo will take every step necessary to make this vision come into fruition, while maintaining the guiding core values and mission. Elevating the Latin indie music community of Los Angeles is our purpose.","Latinos are changing the cultural and political landscape of America, and Los Angeles has a very important role in shaping the discussion. What will Latinos relate to and identify with? What will they listen to? Who will they vote for? LA has the potential of capturing the imaginations of an ever growing population and inspire them to be creative and to have a meaningful say in the globalized world. Los Angeles’ influence in 2050 will be in part determined by the state of the Latino and the foundation supporting them to enable their expression.
 
 L Creativo is a company founded by Angelenos who have real connections to the Latin American music scene Los Angeles, as well as in Latin American countries. After years of working their way into the LA music scene, the realization that Los Angeles was missing a cohesive support structure for independent artists, especially in the Latin market, inspired the founders to seek these solutions to fill this void. L Creativo believes it is important for Latinos in LA to be connected with their heritage.
 
 So why is L.A., arguably one of the most important Latin cities in the world, not the birthplace of artists like Bomba Estéreo, Ana Tijoux, and Carla Morrison? Of course, there are some great LA based artists, like Ozomatli and La Santa Cecilia, but those bands seemed to be the exceptions rather than the natural outcome of a fertile scene. L Creativo sees this as a result of an old paradigm for the role of the Latino in Los Angeles that confines Latinos to the stereotype. L Creativo is here to provide the platform for the new Latinos to express themselves without the pressure of abiding to a role in order to fit a market, and therefore helping Los Angeles change its views on the Latino and start recognizing us more as equally contributing factors to the Angeleno culture.
 
 In the near future, L Creativo's proposal will provide a boost in creative energy and projects by the Latin independent music and art scenes of Los Angeles. By facilitating real connections to the traditional music and film industries in Los Angeles, artists will find ways of producing their art and start opening business opportunities. 
 
 L Creativo long-term goal is ensure that the creative community finds a subsistence mode, which is the ultimate way of supporting creative artists and projects.","L Creativo believes in the avenues in this proposal as ways to facilitate creative projects, initially for the immediate community, but holding a constant expansion with aims of catapulting LA into a more influential role in the Latin indie music and art industries and becoming the best place to create! 
 
 Los Angeles consumers of culture, Latinos or otherwise, who seek stimulation from a positive source of creativity will welcome the unique experiences that L Creativo events offer. Bringing artists from Latin America and talent from Los Angeles together, sets the groundwork for collaboration and cross pollination. The creative community will benefit greatly.","All collaborators are confirmed and active. It is key that they all contribute what they are good at and love, that they are in for the long-run and that they have a sense of belonging with LA.
 
 Andres Ospina - A cultural innovator and entrepreneur, with the vision of inspiring a new generation of Latinos to have a connection with the character values of their culture by way of creativity and artistic expression.

 Additionally, the women we work with our self-taught dancers because of the economic challenges they’ve experienced. Our dancers have encountered financial obstacles growing up and/or in young adulthood that have prevented them from receiving extensive dance training. Having low-income has created an economic barrier to becoming a working dancer in Los Angeles.
 
 CMDC seeks to provide economic growth opportunities to our participants that increase their income. By training our participants to become professional dancers with CMDC and by paying our dancers for their ongoing rehearsal and performance time, we hope to provide one model of what it looks like to help dancers thrive. 
 
 Additionally, CMDC's Dance Leadership Program offers young dancers the opportunity to receive holistic professional development training that supports them as leaders in whatever job or field they choose:
 
 As one dancer states: ""CMDC gives me a comfortable space to explore that outlet and grow... It is constantly challenging me to be the best version of myself and pushes me to move outside of my own comfort zone. Dancing with CMDC has been transformative, healing, and radiantly inspiring. CMDC is a safe space where I have stepped into my power and gained confidence in my abilities. "" ~Ginger Alleyne
 
 To meet the dancers and learn more about the program, please watch our video: http://www.criticalmassdancecompany.org/dance-leadership-program.html","We work with a diverse group of women from Los Angeles, ages 20-40. Our participants are a diverse group of LGBT, low-income, and/or women of color. Many are self-taught dancers who have had limited dance experience or training. Due to financial barriers growing up and/or in young adulthood, most of our dancers come to us with little to no formal dance training. Yet all possess a love for dance, a natural gift for movement and a passion for dance as a tool for healing and transformation. 
 
 CMDC's Dance Leadership Program helps women develop themselves as dancers, leaders, and agents of social change. Through our Dance Leadership Program, CMDC works with two diverse cohorts of women annually to:
 • Improve their creative expression as dancers
 • Support their personal growth as leaders
 • Increase their social impact as community activists","From 2010-2013, we partnered with Immanuel Presbyterian Church in Koreatown. Through our residency there, we practiced at their studio in exchange for offering free classes and performing for their congregants. CMDC was able to pilot our Dance Leadership Program due to the incredible in-kind donation of space provided to us by IPC. In 2013, due to financial challenges, the church could no longer continue our partnership. In looking for new space, we reached out to Studio A Dance in Silverlake. We began holding our self-produced shows at Studio A in 2011. Finding an appropriate theater venue that was affordable was our biggest challenge. Unless a dance company is booking or touring, it must self-produce its own work and self-producing can be a very expensive undertaking in Los Angeles. Studio A was affordable and the studio owner worked with us on a low-cost rate. We decided to partner up again with Studio A this year to and now hold all our classes and rehearsals there. Although we must now rent space, Studio A has made it possible to continue our program and develop our work for our upcoming debut performance of Amaterra this Fall.",1,
4102051,Fallen Fruit from Rising Women: Empowering Women through Food Justice and Social Entrepreneurship,The Fallen Fruit from Rising Women enterprise will establish a Social Entrepreneurs Academy and co-op for formerly incarcerated women.,Create,2014024,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050create/projects/FFFRW.html,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,East Los Angeles County,"FFFRW is an established program and has been running successfully since 2010. Currently, Crossroads residents work with Claremont College students enrolled in the Political Economy of Food course at Scripps College to build the FFFRW enterprise. The enterprise funds the women and students who participate in a weekly Meatless Mondays program, in which they prepare and share a home-cooked meal at the Crossroads house. The enterprise has also funded two flourishing vegetable gardens at the Crossroads residences that provide fresh healthy produce and help the women and students learn gardening skills in a supportive therapeutic environment.
 
 In the next year, our project will invest in programming and equipment to build capacity for the social enterprise. 
 
 We will begin by establishing a co-op that Crossroads graduates can elect to join. We will expand production to two days per week and pay the graduates an hourly wage in addition to sweat equity. As part of their membership and participation in the co-op, the women will be enrolled in the Social Entrepreneurs Academy with 4 hours of instruction per week. To enable participation in the academy, we will pay the women a stipend for completion of the course. 
 
 In addition, we will work with students and faculty at the Claremont Colleges in the fall semester to develop a curriculum for the Social Entrepreneurs Academy. The curriculum will include instruction in accounting, marketing, alternative business models, and other business skills as well as guest lectures and case studies.
 
 Finally, we plan to invest in needed infrastructure to help make our enterprise more efficient. Crossroads women and students learn a lot from their work together in the kitchen, including how to produce and handle food, provide excellent customer service, and support coworkers. By investing in equipment and streamlining our process, we will be able to spend more time teaching the “big picture,” like what it takes to manage a business and what it means to be a social entrepreneur.","Bell Hooks says: To be truly visionary we have to root our imagination in our concrete reality while simultaneously imagining possibilities beyond that reality.
 
 One third of the California prison population comes from Los Angeles County and about 85% of convictions are for non-violent crimes. These statistics clearly indicate that a significant number of formerly incarcerated persons will be returning to Los Angeles County at some point in time. To overcome the stigma and stereotypes of incarceration, an evening of the playing field is necessary for a person to become a productive member of the community. A better LA means a community building relationships socially, economically, politically, environmentally, and academically. These relationships embrace each person, regardless of his/her background, with the encouragement, support, and opportunity to reach their full potential. Support provides hope for change. Opportunity makes change possible. LA becomes a thriving environment where individuals are empowered and the community becomes more cohesive.
 
 Providing services for formerly incarcerated women for over 40 years has taught Crossroads to see the bigger picture that addresses systemic change and compels us to further action. It has been said that working with one woman affects seven generations. Teaching soft skills like how to keep a job while managing sobriety, family, work and self, empowers women as they move from surviving in their environment to thriving in the community.
 
 Universities have an anchoring power unlike practically any other for-profit or nonprofit institution. By building strong ties between the Claremont Colleges and the surrounding region, we are creating a culture of collaboration that is designed to last well past 2050. The coupling of education and community involvement is what makes our program so special. 
 
 In 2050, there will be problems we haven’t anticipated. Our project will equip people from all walks of life to be able to think creatively and adapt to the needs of a changing world.","Our project directly benefits three groups: the Crossroads residents and graduates, the Claremont College community, and the larger community of Los Angeles County.
 
 
 1. Crossroads Residents and Graduates: 
 Since 1974, Crossroads has been providing services to women in Los Angeles County recently released from prison. Our primary goal is to empower formerly incarcerated women by teaching new skills and helping them achieve economic self-sufficiency. Formerly incarcerated women are a group of homeless women with significant and multi-layered needs. In terms of socioeconomic status, the women who come to Crossroads are generally destitute. In the past five years, almost all of our residents have served a life sentence. The average length of stay for our residents who served a life sentence was 23.4 years and their average age is 52 years. Our six-month Residential Program serves about 34 formerly incarcerated women per year. Our graduates enthusiastically keep in contact with Crossroads, and continue to work and live in Los Angeles County. Many have reunited with family and many now have significant work experience (even those women who served over 20 years in prison.) Graduates reach success in their chosen field of employment. Most graduates have worked multiple years in their jobs and many have been promoted to management positions. One graduate shared that she has worked as office manager in a doctor’s office for three years and completed her bachelor’s degree. With the help from this grant, we will expand our services to include more support for the women who have graduated from the residential program.
 
 
 2. Claremont College Community:
 College students are future change-makers. They will go on to lead non-profit organizations and businesses, advocate for policy and reform, and become engaged members of our community. Some students who have participated in FFFRW have changed their major as a result of their experience with Crossroads. One 2013 graduate remarked that “when we first began, we did not realize that the heart and soul of our internship, and perhaps of all food and social justice issues, was the community that we were able to create.”
 
 
 3. LA County Community:
 The backdrop of everything we do is educating the larger community about the incarcerated. We connect the public to the faces of the criminal justice system and demonstrate that people who have been incarcerated can become productive, engaged members of society.","Established in 2010, FFFRW is an existing collaboration between Crossroads and Scripps College. Crossroads has been collaborating with Scripps College in various capacities for over a decade. The FFFRW collaboration has institutional support from Scripps College, which includes administrative and managerial support from the Sustainable Entrepreneurship Fellow, as well as internship credit granted for the course practicum component of the Political Economy of Food course.
 
 In the past, Crossroads has collaborated with marketing students from the Drucker School of Management. We plan to deepen our collaboration with Drucker through the development of the Social Entrepreneurs Academy; however, a formal collaboration with Drucker has not yet been established. We have also collaborated with faculty from the Claremont Colleges. Dr. Nancy Neiman Auerbach teaches the Political Economy of Food course and serves as the creative director of FFFRW. In addition, Kim Drake, a Scripps English professor, taught writing workshops for the Crossroads residents and compiled their stories into a book published in 2013 titled Stinging for their Suppers. The possibility of connecting with additional resources and accessing expertise from the Claremont College community is significant. 
 In addition, we have active partnerships with the local Claremont community. Fred and Julianne Baumann generously donate fresh fruit from their 2.5 acre backyard on a weekly basis to create our jams. We have also established relationships with the Prison Library Project, Uncommon Good, and Randy Beckendam, the owner of Amy’s Farm, a social justice oriented farm. 
  
 There are several factors critical to the continued success of these collaborations. First, continued support from Scripps College is key. The collaboration with Scripps College has been institutionalized and made a core part of the curriculum and educational mission of the college, receiving significant funding from the office of the President. In addition, we rely on community involvement and fruit donations for our jams. Finally, Crossroads has made FFFRW part of their comprehensive reentry program and the core of their food justice initiative.",1,
4102053,Deaf West Theatre Performing Arts Center and Educational Outreach Program Residency,"DWT will establish a residency for its productions, training and outreach programs for both deaf and hearing artists and audiences.",Create,2014025,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050create/projects/deafwest.html,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,Deaf West Theatre draws artists and audiences from around the world. We also work with numerous schools in the area including Marlton School for the Deaf.,"Deaf West Theatre will establish a 3-5 production per year subscription season. Productions will be developed and performed at this location and occasional other venues in L.A. County, perhaps include national tours and Broadway (case history - ""Big River"" Two Tony Award Nominations) - bringing more awareness to Deaf West and CSUN as co-presenters and to the LACA 2050 Grant Program. 
 
 Deaf West Theatre will conduct four 13-week educational outreach programs at culturally underserved schools (K-12) in L.A. County where both deaf and hearing students and faculty will benefit. The participating classes will be brought to Deaf West Theatre's performance space to enjoy a sho , engage in Q&A with artists and crew and tour the facilities for further inspiration. 
 
 During the Summer, Deaf West Theatre will conduct a 4-week intensive Professional Training Program for deaf and hard of hearing artists, selected from both Los Angeles County and a nation-wide talent pool. The instructors and guest speakers will be established deaf and hearing entertainment industry professionals. 
 
 Interns from nearly every degree program at such an institute will be encouraged to join us (theater, film, tv, new technology, accounting, marketing, legal, etc.) Exposing our community to every aspect of show 'business' will better their chances of attaining gainful entertainment industry employment outside the limitations of non-profit theater. 
 Conversely, every hearing student or intern who interacts with us, will have their 'eyes, ears and hearts' opened to the notion that if they are in a position some day to consider a deaf candidate for job, they would need not hesitate to hire that person. 
 
 With the increasing popularity of sign language, DWT will offer free workshops in advance of our productions, to give students on campus and general audiences the fun of learning specific signs from each stage production, thereby making their visit to the theater, even more exciting as they proudly 'catch' the signs they recognize in dialogue and/or song. 
 
 A documentary behind-the-scenes web series for our youtube channel, depicting the journey of our productions and our residency will further enlighten and benefit all. 
 
 An annual ""Signing in the Streets"" event will continue the tradition started at Disneyland in March, 2012, where thousands joined from across the southland in celebration of Deaf culture.","Through Deaf West Theatre's continued and expanded… 1) multi-award winning dramas, comedies and musicals, presented in both sign language and voice 2) educational outreach programs that journey to schools K-12 and back to the CSUN campus and 3) professional deaf and hard of hearing artists training program in summer months… boundaries and stereotypes will be obliterated, communication between deaf and hearing people will be enhanced, employment opportunities increased, and both deaf and hearing entrepreneurs will be inspired to create new innovations to further level the playing field.
 
 New technology has made the auditory world visual across many platforms. A deaf director can wear glasses that scroll voice-to-text so they are privy to whatever audio is being heard over the hearing crew's headphones. Sony has made glasses that scroll captions for deaf audiences at certain cinemas. New technologies are being invented every day, and a Deaf West Theatre residency, putting sign language artistry together with the latest technologies being created by students, together, we may discover new innovations so that both deaf and hearing audiences can benefit from and share. 
 
 Educational outreach in theater arts can be critically important for deaf and hard of hearing children in schools (K-12), their language development (both sign language and English) can depend on it, as well as building a sense of cultural identity and the self esteem required to express themselves fully in any language. Deaf West Theater was founded via a 12-year old deaf child's dream a very long time ago, sitting alone and isolated in a theater with his hearing family watching a show he could barely grasp a word of. He envisioned a theater where deaf children could experience theater in their native visual sign language as well as spoken language, to be enjoyed with both deaf and hearing families and friends. A Deaf West Theatre residency amid institutional role models that are thriving examples of diversity, inclusion and equality, will be a microcosm of what we hope the future will be for our children.","To be deaf or hard of hearing is to be one of 22.4 million Americans often denied - as individuals and as a community - the enrichment offered only by the arts. According to the California Department of Rehabilitation, the core community we serve has an unemployment rate of 45% and a mean income of $17,549. In LA schools, 90% of deaf students in mainstream programs are offered little or no contact with deaf peers. 60% of deaf seniors upon graduation remain largely illiterate with a grade 2.8 reading level.
 
 In recent years, social networking, texting, and cochlear implants are breakthroughs that have made communication easier for deaf people. Despite these advances, younger deaf people risk not having the opportunity to participate meaningfully in Deaf culture. Previously, when enrollment in deaf-only schools was more common, participation in deaf clubs and social organizations fostered a defined culture that emerged among peers and mentors. A DWT residency would be the best of both worlds and would allow Deaf West Theater to become a vibrant point of interest in Los Angeles County.
 
 The following figures are projected based conservatively on Deaf West Theatre's production and program history between 1990 to the present:
 
 1) Mainstage Productions
 
 Audience - average 4 six-week productions per year at conservative 75% theater capacity = 9000
 
 Performers, Crew, Staff - average 50 people x 4 productions = 200
 
 2) Children's Theatre Educational Outreach Workshops
 
 30 students (K-12) x 4 schools = 120 children
 
 5 performances at Deaf West Theatre = 5 shows x 99 seats = 495 children
 
 DWT instructors and interpreters = 16
 
 3) Professional Deaf and Hard of Hearing Artists Training Program
 
 Students (age 18+) = 150 
 Instructors and Guest Speakers = 15
 
 4) Documentary Filming / Video of DWT productions & Behind The Scenes- 
 
 Crews, interns, interpreters, volunteers = 100 
 
 5) Free Sign Lanaguage Theater Workshops for Audiences before each week of production
 
 Average 30 participants x 6 wks x 4 productions = 940 
 
 6) 'Signing In The Streets' at CSUN (conservative estimate) = 1000 
 
 Total projected number of deaf, hard of hearing and hearing children and adults (directly) benefiting from this project = 12,036","*Cal State Northridge (CSUN): 
 Status: Active dialogue in progress
 Benefit: CSUN has a terrific theater department and the most highly regarded Deaf Studies program in the country, supported by the National Center on Deafness on its campus. 
 
 National Center on Deafness (NCOD): 
 Status: Part of the CSUN / DWT dialogue
 Benefit: NCOD is on campus at CSUN and is a resource center for everything deaf and hard of hearing related. 
 
 Center Theatre Group: 
 Status: Likely production-specific partner. 
 Benefit: CTG has co-produced three sign language musical theater productions with DWT: ""Big River"" (2 Tony Award nominations and a special Tony for Artistic Excellence, a national tour and command performance for the Princess of Japan), ""Sleeping Beauty Wakes"" and ""Pippin."" We would be building on prior successes.
 
 LA COUNTY SCHOOLS 
 Status: The full scope of our previously successful children's educational outreach program would be reinstated. 
 Benefit: LAUSD and other LA County school districts will help us identify where deaf youth are most at risk and in need of inclusion in the arts.
 
 *NOTE - In the event that a DWT Residency at CSUN does not come to full fruition, the following schools known to have significant deaf / hard of hearing attendees and a popular sign language interpreter program on campus are: Pierce College, Santa Monica College, Pasadena City College, El Camino College and as their student population and sign language teachers are all in DWT's long-standing circle of friends, artists, audiences and some board members as well, we will likely find a residency at one of these L.A. County higher-education learning centers as an alternative. CSULA, UCLA, USC, and CalArts are other strong possibilities. There are also other non-profit theatres throughout the county that would benefit equally from a DWT residency under their auspices, sharing space and equipment (as DWT has with The Antaeus Company). 
 
 Until a residency agreement with any organization is finalized, our budget does not assume financial obligation (cash or in-kind) from any potential partner.",1,
4102055,Do Good Bus,We are a party bus with a purpose to do GOOD in Los Angeles and to connect people to one another with a common goal in mind.,Connect,2014026,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050connect/projects/dogoodbus.html,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,"Hop on the bus and we’ll do the rest! Here at the Do Good Bus, we deliver an exciting and engaging opportunity to get involved with your community and to do GOOD in the city of Los Angeles. Each trip is different and the location/cause is kept a secret until we arrive. We currently host a monthly community ride to give Los Angelenos the opportunity to learn about local causes, experience giving back and most importantly, connect with other people in their city. Over the past three years, we’ve visited dozens of causes and connected hundreds of volunteers and are proud to say each passenger left feeling accomplished and connected to one another.","With the word spreading about our project, we need funding to keep up with the demand and implement our additional ideas.
 
 OUR OWN BUS!
 We recently purchased our own bus but have some final repairs and upgrades to make before we can get it on the road. We will also have new costs to cover (ie. maintenance, fuel, driver training, storage, etc.).
 
 FREE RIDES
 We believe there is true value in a Do Good Bus ticket, but we know purchasing a ticket can be a barrier for some, so we would like the opportunity to provide a free community ride every other month and get more people on the bus.
 
 KIDS AND GIVING BACK
 In line with the LA2050 report about the direct connection between education and social connectedness, we’ve been working on ideas to engage students via the Do Good Bus. We are committed to teaching our youth the importance of giving back and connecting with their community. In fact, we’ve hosted FAMILY RIDES to give families access to kid-friendly volunteer activities and teach kids the vocabulary and concepts of giving back. We would love to offer the same experience to students in Los Angeles schools - giving teachers an opportunity to incorporate volunteerism into their curriculums.
 
 The LA2050 report also suggests education levels are directly related to social connectedness levels. While we don’t have the resources to ensure kids make it to their senior year, we think exposing kids to unique experiences on a Do Good Field Trip, will give them a chance to connect with each other and with a world outside of the classroom. In addition, a Do Good Field Trip would expose students to unique career options (ie. Non-profit CEO or Do Good Bus tour guide) - potentially giving them new motivation to make it through school.
 
 There are two important factors to ensure we can implement our idea: hire a part-time staff member and finish outfitting our bus. Specifically, outfitting the bus includes: registration, permitting, insurance, final mechanical tune up, new seating, driver training and storage.","Today, there are numerous ways that the Do Good Bus will help make LA the best place to connect. With our busy schedules and hectic lives, taking the time to volunteer and do good by others is not always factored in. Our engaging and unique approach to volunteering truly sets us apart and attracts many Los Angelenos who may have not considered getting involved in their community before. 
  
 Another way that our efforts will help connect is through one of our goals on the bus, encouraging continued support. For us, that doesn’t always mean returning to the same cause we may have just visited. During a ride, passengers are not only exposed to meaningful causes they are also introduced to what it FEELS like to give back. We encourage them to harness that feeling and search for ways to find it again in their everyday lives. We strongly believe that inspiration in people will continue to shape Los Angeles into a more connected place.
  
 By 2050, we see the future of the Do Good Bus much bigger than before. One of our goals is to collaborate with schools to implement Do Good Bus field trips for students. Children will be exposed to our unique and different way of doing good as well as understanding the importance of getting involved in their community. With that said, we can expect that the future generation of doGOODers will use what they’ve learned and create more innovative ways to connect to one another in Los Angeles.","The wonderful thing about our project is that it will benefit so many other causes who are also committed to making LA the best it can be by 2050. By transporting volunteers to causes all over LA and bringing awareness to those causes - we’re collaborating with potentially hundreds of charitable foundations! We saw this first hand this year when Do Good Bus collaborated with No Right Brain Left Behind by bringing multiple groups of volunteers to help complete their LA2050 Grant Project (2013). In addition to No Right Brain Left Behind, some of the causes our project has and will benefit are: MEND Poverty, the LA Food Bank, Best Friends Animal Society, EnrichLA and so many more. 
 
 If Do Good Bus can host multiple rides per month and offer a handful of free rides, we can give more Los Angelenos an opportunity to connect and give back. In one year, over 1,000 people will be newly connected and if we add Do Good Field Trips to that number, we end up with over 1,000 newly connected kids as well.
 
 In addition to free rides and Do Good Field Trips, with our own bus we now have a unique opportunity to help Los Angeles in a hyper-local capacity. With 24-hour access to a vehicle equipped with supplies and enough seats for 30 willing volunteers, we’d have the capability to coordinate last minute trips to help our neighbors in a time of emergency or disaster relief. This might be the most exciting element of owning our own vehicle.
 
 Not only does our project benefit the causes we visit, but each and every passenger on the Do Good Bus is also benefited through the relationships they build during the ride. We ensure a captivating and interactive experience that brings like-minded individuals together in a city where it can be challenging to connect with one another. We’re a party bus with a purpose and there is no better alternative to make new friends than by taking this journey with us! 
 
 One ride at a time, Do Good Bus can begin to shape Los Angeles into a more connected city; one with informed and inspired residents who can help one another.","One of our confirmed overall collaborators is Dogeared Jewelry, who has been a supporter of the Do Good Bus since the beginning. They are a B Corp and are extremely committed to giving back. The added benefit provided is their help retrofitting our new bus and their ability to build our awareness.
 
 Some other partnerships who will be working with us are:
 
 BUS PARTNERS
 For the nitty gritty logistics, Townride, Inc. is interested in using their expertise to help us through the refurbishing process of creating the coolest Do Good Bus possible. We are also working on a plan to partner with Townride for storage and maintenance.
 
 EDUCATION PARTNERS
 As for causes and organizations who can help us make Do Good Field Trips a reality, we’re looking forward to working with No Right Brain Left Behind, Green Dot Schools, Breakaway Education and Zimmer Children’s Museum.",
4102058,Droplabs,"Droplabs is bursting at the seams. We want to expand our services to include more space, maker offerings, and more classes.",Create,2014027,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050create/projects/droplabs.html,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"Our central location is in Lincoln Heights, but we take our programs to many of our partners’ locations throughout LA County.","Droplabs is bursting at the seams. Where other coworking spaces cost from $250 - $450 for a monthly membership & up, we charge $25 for a monthly membership, $150 for 24/7 access, or $5 per day. We need to scale without raising prices. 
 
 We currently have a self-led video mentoring program where visitors can choose from our extensive video library to learn different and advanced web programming skills. We’ve seen people come to Droplabs with the most basic computer skills take on new clients after a couple of months. We would expand this program to include more disciplines.
 
 We’re also an incubator. There’s a community at Droplabs to support budding entrepreneurs while they navigate all of the tricky aspects of running their own business, from motivation to how to price their skills. We’ve had about 50 startups run through Droplabs. We’re a natural choice for bootstrapping startups. We would offer more programs for startups, as well as find funding opportunities for them. 
 
 Another program that we’re particularly fond of is our Barnraisings with Coders with a Cause. For a non-profit we’ll gather a team of developers at different experience levels & from start to finish build or improve the non-profit’s website. 
 
 We break up into teams pairing experienced developers with less experienced developers, & use the opportunity to teach aspects of how to build a large website, from requirements gathering to deployment, using open source tools, using professional workflows, in a professional team. Everyone benefits. We would expand this program. 
 
 While we’ve taught electronics classes at Droplabs & have had members build everything from a hands-free mouse to drones that can go 80 miles an hour, we’re really not set up as a fully fledged makerspace yet, but getting maker equipment is at the top of our wishlist. We already have people who can teach CAD, circuitry, & robotics. We have some of the brightest minds in LA willing to teach all sorts of things in a friendly, fun way.","Droplabs helps people remove the boundaries that stop them from changing their lives. I wish this were something that we could claim as our intention when we started, but it happened as a by-product of growing our community organically. We nurture this whenever we can.
 
 It’s a lot of little things. 
 
 It’s giving each member adult responsibility for the environment they’re working in, and responsibility for what they learn, and sitting back while people take responsibility for the directions of their own lives. It’s respecting the decisions they make.
 
 It’s trusting people to put money in a fishbowl when they get snacks. 
 
 It’s one member getting too much lunch on purpose and sharing it with people he knows don’t have a lot of money. 
 
 It’s making sure people feel comfortable and welcome when they arrive, and making sure that people feel good about where they are on their journey no matter what their skill level. 
 
 It’s showing each other that we all have something to teach, as well as learn.
 
 It’s taking our programs on the road to people in other neighborhoods. 
 
 It’s partnering with great organizations with shared values.
 
 It’s having people there who have already accomplished a lot who are there to help others gain the necessary skills to operate as a freelancer or run a business. 
 
 It’s providing a great environment to work, so that the skilled and the curious come.
 
 It’s letting people know that there are free tools out there to help them build or learn what they need. 
 
 It's making decisions by consensus.
 
 It’s providing a safe place where people can feel comfortable enough to unleash their imaginations. 
 
 It’s nurturing a culture of innovation recognizing the wealth that we have around us, just by being alive right now.","Droplabs started out as a way for freelance & open source programmers to learn from each other & collaborate on projects that were larger & more lucrative than the ones that they could take on alone. We still do this, but Droplabs has grown beyond that in many ways. 
 
 We want to continue our focus on open source & free tools, where we have had enormous success. From hosting open source meetups & classes to coordinating groups taking free online classes to job & career fairs. We have found that leveraging these in combination & in community to be a huge multiplier for learning effort. 
 
 Next, the startups came. Droplabs is a no-brainer for entrepreneurs. The cost of most coworking spaces is too luxurious for most bootstrapping startups – especially in the early stage. We are decidedly no-frills. We don’t have Aeron chairs or consciously placed rough granite. We do have free parking & a great community of innovative thinkers who are helpful & kind. 
 
 The big thing missing from the free university classes offered online is the motivation & persistence that comes from personal experience with other classmembers. (One of our members’ teams beat out 20,000 other students in the Stanford Entrepreneurship class for their Entrepreneurship challenge. We couldn’t be more proud.)
 
 After that, the unemployed found it. There isn’t a big leap between being unemployed & being an entrepreneur. It’s more of a mindset. Some use their unemployment checks as seed funding to build their startups. Others learned new skills & took on clients. Many have been abused by a harsh system, & find confidence & comradeship in a safe environment, blossoming as individuals. 
 
 After that, the crowdfunders found it. & the business people. & Droplabs became a full-fledged incubator, with a constellation of supportive advisors, attorneys & others. 
 
 People who come to Droplabs have basic computer skills already, & bring their own laptops. 
 
 We want to exp& our services to grow our meager makerspace facilities (we have equipment for electronics) & purchase classroom computers. We already have close partnerships with machine & fabrication shops. We already hold job fairs & career fairs for the software industry. We would like to do the same for other industries as we are able to offer more diversity in skills training, & as we grow our community.
 
 Droplabs is for community minded individuals who wish to put effort into growing professionally & personally.","*Founding partners*

Tour Specialists can also offer transportation & lodging by linking existing accounts with AirBnb, Uber, or similar apps. We would incorporate social networking as a tool to bridge Travelers & Tour Specialists based on mutual interests & friends. Users can create profiles on themselves & what makes LA special - from lists of their favorite restaurants to beaches.","To implement this idea, we will first develop the mobile app so that it is accessible, aesthetically pleasing & easy to use. As a User Experience / User Interface Designer & Developer, Ray has experience in designing & building small-scale to large-scale consumer & enterprise applications, which will help with the development of the technology. 
 
 Once we have a working product, we will then start marketing the product & build our user base. Mitchel is experienced in video marketing & digital content, which will help promote the product to LA locals & tourists, & make it easy for users to understand the capabilities & benefits of using MyCity. Also, we will reach out to the tourism department of LA to get support from the city & help bring more revenue to local businesses & residents. 
 
 Technically, we would implement this project by using a leading edge tech stack for both web & mobile application. Since Ray is also a full-stack engineer, we can rapidly deploy this on a Ruby on Rails stack which can include Node.JS, PostgresSQL, & Backbone.JS front-end. Alternatively, we're open to using a different tech stack such a Go, Erlang, Scala, etc. For mobile development, we can deploy using Android & Swift. We have many options.","MyCity can help make LA the best place to connect today by bridging Tourists with Angelenos in more deep & diverse experiences around the city. Locals will have the ability to share their favorite places in LA & give travelers a more immersive experience with the city. This type of interaction between tourists & locals would provide breadth that brings more awareness about the local areas in Los Angeles that mass commercialized tour packages & buses do not do. Thus, promoting small LA businesses to eager travelers & connecting tourists with the city’s diverse cultures & communities.","MyCity would benefit Angelenos & anyone living in Los Angeles. Angelenos would make money as Tour Specialists by providing phenomenal & personalized experiences to Travelers. Additionally, locals can also pair up with other locals who have new ideas to share, since there's always something new that Angelenos can learn from each other about this city.
 
 Angelenos & Locals would also benefit by making money full time or part time by rendering their services as Tour Specialists. Also, tourists would benefit immensely from this app by getting diverse & personalized tours of Los Angeles through the simplicity of a mobile app - as well as the opportunity to meet new friends. This in turn benefits Los Angeles by bringing in more tourism into the city & helping local businesses. Though, just as important as generating revenue in LA, we are showing travelers from around the world a deeper & more authentic look of the City of Angels.","Mitchel Dumlao has worked in the entertainment industry for more than 9 years & is currently running his own digital marketing & video production company.

We will provide start-up funds and the development to ensure leagues are sustainable and are actualizing The Yacht Club vision.
 
 During Stage 1 of our project, ambassadors will conduct strategic community outreach and build social trust to understand the current needs of new neighborhoods. As they begin leagues in Stage 2, ambassadors will develop programs and events aligned to current neighborhood need. Ambassadors will invest players to volunteer and lead community development efforts. Our leagues will be known for using dodgeball as a means to connect and pursue the common good.","We will hold a planning meeting in early October to outline the scope of work needed to roll out Stage 1 successfully. Later, in late November, a second planning meeting will be held to ensure we are ready to roll out Stage 2. Our project coordinator, board committee (formed to focus on LA2050 efforts from existing Yacht Club board members) and Yacht Club founders will participate in each planning meeting. Planning meetings will provide the project coordinator with input to build out stage-specific project plans. 
 
 The Stage 1 project plan will include targets and milestones to drive our a) recruitment campaign for league ambassadors, and b) the development of resources and support. In addition to participating in monthly oversight meetings with our board committee, our project coordinator will provide weekly status updates to The Yacht Club board chair. The Stage 2 project plan will include targets and milestones to support league ambassadors with their a) community outreach, b) recruitment of players and c) community development efforts.
 
 Monthly progress check-ins will be held between league ambassadors and the project coordinator. League ambassadors will report out on targets, milestones and identify support needed. The project coordinator will share best practices and help match resources to areas of need or support identified by the league ambassador.
 
 Monthly board committee check-ins will be held between the project coordinator and board committee. The project coordinator will report out on project targets, milestones and success measures. For example, at the end of each league during Stage 2, the project coordinator will compile data from player surveys to provide a general review of each league and league ambassador. The board committee will then support the project coordinator to identify ways to maintain and improve a healthy and successful project implementation.","The Yacht Club believes civic engagement-- feelings of responsibility toward the common good-- is inherent in all of us. We believe Angelenos will get more involved when they’re provided with opportunities that not only help solve community issues and improve the well-being of neighborhoods, but are also down-right fun.
 
 Everybody wants to belong, feel like part of a group, community, or team-- it’s an essential human need. We aim to get people hooked on The Yacht Club by increasing their social well-being and connectedness through dodgeball, weekly meetups and social gatherings. Once hooked, we provide the initial opportunities for our players to become active citizens and volunteer. Over time, our players become more invested in the neighborhoods where they play and want to do more good for them… it’s our flywheel toward common good. When our players actively participate and do good for Los Angeles, they feel more invested in Los Angeles. When our players feel more invested in Los Angeles, they want to work toward greater common good. Yes, we recognize dodgeball is fun, but we’re not just a team of players; we are an army of do-gooders. We want Los Angeles to be a better city for everyone and believe that dodgeball is a great entry point for good work in service of LA.
 
 League ambassadors will be charged with creating and managing dodgeball leagues that recruit players who want to have fun and actively do good. We aren’t interested in passive civic engagement-- players who simply donate money. Instead our league ambassadors will recruit and invest players to volunteer at Kids Dodgeball because they understand our kids need safe and fun activities in their neighborhood. League ambassadors will steer players toward opportunities of civic engagement like beach cleanups or encourage and support players to coordinate movies-at-the-park (with proceeds going to rec center programming).
 
 When the quality of life raises for our players, the quality of life raise for all Angelenos. By 2050, we want to see The Yacht Club running dodgeball leagues in rec centers across Los Angeles. In 2050, we continue to play in under-resourced neighborhoods, we have players on neighborhood councils and The Yacht Club is a consistent presence at civic events across Los Angeles.","Our project will benefit the communities we are working to support and all The Yacht Club do-gooders. Our approach to developing programming options for rec centers has always been to start with kids—Yacht Grub (kids cooking), Yacht Plot (community gardening), Yacht Pix (kids photography) and our flagship program, Yacht Crew (Kids Dodgeball), have been built to provide kids with fun, safe and creative experiences that go beyond what they might have access to at school. 
 
 What we’ve found over the years is that our players’ social well-being and desire to do good increases when we provide opportunities to volunteer and serve the community. When our players come out to our LA River Cleanup or volunteer at Kids Dodgeball they feel more invested in participating in other Yacht Club events and many eventually expand our civic engagement efforts. For example, when players in our Venice league decided to coordinate a beach cleanup, players from Glassell Park and North Hollywood joined the “player-based” community effort. The event was created and coordinated by players who were inspired to do more.","Los Angeles Department of Recreation & Parks:
 Directors and staff at the rec centers where we play are vital partners in our project. Their commitment and understanding of the positive impact The Yacht Club can have are essential to our success. We will work to identify the specific needs of each park, design programs to match these needs, and gain community investment and feedback to ensure these programs become a sustainable and consistent part of regular programming. (ie. In Glassell Park this summer, when parents found out Kids Dodgeball was not part of Summer Night Lights programming, they petitioned to incorporate it and The Yacht Club pulled 20 committed volunteers to support 8 Friday nights of Kids Dodgeball.)
 
 Community-based organization and leaders:
 Our leadership team and league ambassadors will work to identify and build strategic relationships with community-based organizations and leaders in each new neighborhood we intend to serve. 
 
 Leadership consultants:
 Our leadership team has secured committed time from consultants to design of tools and development programming for our league ambassadors. We’ll also work with our current league ambassadors and our board to leverage established best practices.

We will use our existing social media outreach and our existing artists community to plan and execute the outreach to enroll artists starting with the film industry and engaging leaders, nonprofits, higher education and creative businesses as the conduits to engage the artists. We will create incentive and reward programs to encourage participation and a ongoing communication program. Once we have a core number of artists we will create a launch event to announce the A4S Hub intended to gain interest, creative projects, funding and help to grow the participating artists creations and influence sustainable living. This will be done so LA gains additional recognition for its global leadership in arts and sustainability.","LA is THE global leader in the film industry, has some of the most beautiful natural environment in the world and has taken a lead in moving to sustainable living. Artists of all types are drawn to the County and many use their art to advance causes including achieving a sustainable future. Maggie Q supports animal welfare and conservation, James Cameron produces the TV series The Years of Living Dangerously, G2Gallery offers wildlife art and donates all proceeds to animal causes, Connie Samaras has a retrospective at The Armory Center For the Arts. Her images capture the banal nightmares of manmade landscapes. In an article on May 10, 2013 Robby Herbst asked the question, Who Makes Art About Climate Change? He concludes with this hope and prediction re the future in LA with climate change, ""We'll see it in our changed environments, in species decline and extinctions, and in the rise of global instability as many old ways of living are drowned or toasted. Perhaps in the future too, when somebody asks ""who's making art about climate change in Los Angeles,"" the response won't be a head-scratch and a ""geez, I dunno."" KCET
 
 With Earth Protect's ARTISTS4SUSTAINABILITY, LA and the world will have an answer not only for climate change but all aspects of sustainability across all art forms. We can anticipate that this will further distinguish LA and bring business, funding and global attention as its leadership in arts and sustainability are brought to light

The first phase is our research and discovery stage. In this phase we will work with our partners to refine the concept and design of our app. We will also solicit feedback from the community. The second phase is development. Here our tech partner will build the app. The third phase is the release, where we will begin to roll out the app to the community and work with our media partners to get the word out.","As the largest demographic and drivers of new business growth, the success of Latin@s is paramount to ensuring Los Angeles County is the best place to create today and in 2050. Despite this favorable trend there are innumerable obstacles deterring Latin@ advancement such as high unemployment rates among others. For those finding relief within the informal economy creation is an indispensable necessity for survival. By placing language accessible technological tools & resources at a finger’s touch our project will serve to support current entrepreneurial activity and stimulate future formal business ownership.
 
 As the current largest demographic in the county, and drivers of new business growth, Latin@s are poised to become tomorrow’s largest workforce and business owners. According to the 2013 census Latin@s make up 48.3% of the population in Los Angeles County. By 2050 Latin@s will surely continue to have an overwhelming presence in the county. It has also been noted that Latin@ owned businesses in Los Angeles are increasing in number at three times the national rate. 
 
 This project will digitize and thus amplify existing local Latin@ networks resulting in greater connectivity throughout Los Angeles County. Expanding these networks will facilitate and stimulate a greater volume of reciprocal exchanges and activities among its members both on and offline. Economic activity will be multiplied as access to a digital marketplace will provide greater market reach and thus increase the likelihood of increased earnings. Increased earnings for Latin@ marginal workers will serve to provide greater economic sustainability and provide a possible pathway from informal to formal business ownership.","This project can benefit anybody but it’s particularly intended for Los Angeles County’s Latin@ marginal workers. In a 2005 Economic Roundtable study, Los Angeles County’s informal labor force has a low estimate of 322,400 to a high of 972,500. They are independent and self-sufficient. They are not necessarily tied to a particular industry but often make use of social networks and kinship ties for work. They are “millennials” and older folks. Some only speak Spanish while others are bilingual or speak only English. They are citizens and the undocumented. Some lack formal employment but are still generating income through various activities in the informal economy. These folks are domestic workers and day laborers. They include women setting up pop-up taco shops and pupuserias on San Fernando Valley sidewalks to men selling leather belts down central LA streets. They are seamstresses who offer clothing alterations from home and the countless mechanics fixing cars wherever they stand. They include the senoras and senores selling tamales in front of supermarkets; sobadoras and sobadores straightening out backs in shacks. This project will also benefit Latin@ artists wanting to make available their paintings, prints, buttons, books, CDs, videos, films, and other works of art for purchase. Or musicians such as mariachis and DJ’s looking to advertise their services, including young hip hop heads, punks, and bandas. Tiangius is a cause, linking and sharing creative ideas, products, new media, and stories.","Our development partner is Arroyo Labs, www.arroyolabs.com. They have worked with companies such as peet's cofee and k-swiss among others. They will be providing the technical leadership and expertise on the project.

4102065,75 School Gardens in Los Angeles Schools!,"EnrichLA will reach our goal of building 75 school gardens, and will offer our Garden Ranger Program to at least 5,500 additional students!",Play,2014032,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050play/projects/enrichla.html,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,"EnrichLA has a significant track record for designing, building, and providing programming at schools across Los Angeles. Within the last 3 years, EnrichLA has built over 60 gardens in Los Angeles schools, and in the 2013-2014 school year, we offered our Garden Ranger Program at 25 schools.
 
 To implement this project, we will identify 11 schools that want an edible school garden within their schoolyard. We already have a wait-list of schools so this will not be a problem. Once the needs of the individual school have been identified, and a garden design created, we work with a crew of volunteers to transform the garden space in the span of a single day! Our volunteer groups are made up of students, staff, and parents, local community members, as well as volunteer groups such as Gay 4 Good, Do Good Bus, UCLA Volunteers, USC Helenes, and more!
 
 The next step will be to hire additional Garden Rangers that serve at these sites. These Garden Rangers are educated and experienced, and they are thoroughly trained in our Garden Ranger curriculum and EnrichLA standards so as to offer the best possible experience to students. The Garden Rangers will then provide weekly garden classes and garden maintenance at these schools, as well as organize community workshops and work days.","Our motto is to put “A Garden in Every School” and thereby with every school garden we create, we are offering students, parents, teachers, and community members the opportunity to play, and with that play, to live and learn. The beauty of our endeavor is that with every garden we create, we are in effect establishing an incubator for new opportunities; for communities to come together over a garden work day, for teachers to become stewards of the environment, and for children to become acquainted, by the sweat of their own brow, with those fruits and vegetables that will most nourish them. 
 
 In less than three years EnrichLA has converted over 60 parcels of unused open space into productive gardens at Los Angeles’ most needy schools. Over the course of the next school year EnrichLA plans to build 11 new gardens at 11 schools, making our total number of school gardens built 75. That means acres of asphalt removed, acres of green space available to families otherwise unable to access parks, and acres of crops to nourish thousands of families otherwise without access to healthy options. 
 
 Beyond the immediate benefit of creating garden space, EnrichLA fosters lasting connections with the schools it partners with--through community workshops, providing consistent garden maintenance, and through the implementation of our “Garden Ranger” program. Slated for 35 schools in the 2014-2015 school year, the “Garden Ranger” program engages whole classrooms in garden-based education. Students become acquainted with healthy foods (some of which, like beets and artichokes, students had prior never been exposed to) and concepts of environmental stewardship, all the while pursuing a curriculum that meets the standards of a California education.
 
 In 2050, LA will have a garden in every single one of its schools. Many schools will maintain urban farms, the produce from which will supplement greatly the food available through school lunches. In 2050, every single one of these schools will maintain a robust garden-based educational curriculum, with home-grown and EnrichLA Garden Rangers working side by side to acquaint the next generation of Angelenos with the food that sustains a healthy and robust society. By the end of their secondary education, Angelenos of the 2050’s will be environmentally conscious and environmentally active horticulturalists, nutritionists, ecologists, and socially responsible members of their community.","The expansion of our Garden Ranger Program to eleven new schools will offer the program to a minimum of 5,500 students who previously lacked access to a school garden and to our Garden Ranger Program. 
 
 Although the Garden Ranger Program primarily targets youth in schools, the gardens we create are available to the entire community as a launching pad for further collaboration. We have seen how parents, teachers, teens, and children of all backgrounds will come together to build a garden from scratch within a single day. 
 
 By building new edible gardens and green spaces in these 11 schools, thousands of school students, teachers, staff, and parents will have access to an outdoor space where they can live, learn, and play. These green spaces offer people in park-poor communities with access to green space. 
 
 Schools themselves benefit from the garden; the Garden Ranger Program improves their campus aesthetic and has the ability to improve their academic standing. We have seen firsthand how the installation of a garden at Thomas Starr King Middle School brought about such a change in the school environment and morale that school’s API jumped from the 600’s to well over 800 in a matter of 5 years. Science classes gain an outdoor laboratory with which they can conduct real-world experiments, children have a new outdoor area to play during recess, some teachers take their lunches to the garden, and neighbors help maintain the space. In short, the entire community benefits.","EnrichLA has worked with partners such as Kaiser Permanente, St. Johns Wellness Center, LAUSD Facilities, Whole Foods, Whole Kids Foundation, Tree People, and more. EnrichLA is open to new and continuing partnerships as we hope to partner with like-minded organizations concerned with offering edible education and green spaces to local students.",1,

 From Griffith Park to Downtown Los Angeles the LA River provides a diverse range of active and passive recreation with trails, pocket parks, kayaking and opportunities for recreation. We propose to include combinations of activities and art and expand and enhance our play at the river. 
 
 We aspire to high quality and rewarding opportunities for play. Play can be simple, but can challenge and build our bodies, minds, spirits and communities. Play involves and encourages us to be curious, social and healthy. Play is an essential element of the education of our children. Arts and culture experience and education are essential to 21st Century success. 
 “Arts learning experiences play a vital role in developing students’ capacities for critical thinking, creativity, imagination and innovation. These capacities are increasingly recognized as core skills and competencies that all students need as part of a high-quality and complete 21st-century education….one that includes learning in and through the arts…”2 --The National Task Force on the Arts in Education
 
 An inclusionary approach to park and open space planning, as envisioned in the Cultural Master Plan, will avoid segmentation, compartmentalization, and single purpose definitions of nature, art and play. We can transform habitat restoration and traditional recreation into an environment that makes us brighter, healthier and economically successful. A well developed plan for integration of art and cultural programming into public and private revitalization will ensure that we stimulate curiosity, bring forward the unique qualities of the river communities and create resources to inspire our creative community and attract world class tourism.

The creative play spirit in all of us will benefit from a dynamic, intergenerational outdoor art environment. 
 
 The Cultural Master Plan will contribute to the revitalization of the LA River zone by leveraging substantial public and private investment to strengthen the arts community, river neighborhoods, local fabricators, and educators. A well curated program of arts and culture along the river will enhance the public realm, and fuel our creative and innovative communities. 
  
 Local river communities will benefit from a more vibrant arts and recreation zone, mentorship and arts education programs, and fabrication incentives in the industrial areas. It will deepen community ties to the riverfront. Regionally, the people Los Angeles benefit from a sustainable, urban resource. 
 
 The Cultural Master Plan will establish pilot programs in the public school art programs. A commitment to arts education and mentorship programs inspires success in our next-gen artists and makers.

4102068,Los Angeles Media Lab,Start a media lab that functions as a hybrid between a public access TV station and an A/V production facility that fosters community.,Create,2014034,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050create/projects/LAmedialab.html,,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,"We have already began to implement the foundation of our plan through building a mobile studio, hosting live television tapings, teaching A/V workshops, and collaborating with local artists. We are adept with both the professional equipment and support skills needed to create a public forum accessible to children, artists, and people from the local community interested in working with media and video. 
 
 We will select a centrally-located space in Los Angeles to serve as a broadcast center. Our vision is to build two TV studios: one housing a traditional three-camera setup, which allows more complex tapings and visual effects. The other will be a smaller studio serving more intimate video tapings. Several adjacent multi-use rooms will serve as classrooms for youth education and training for emerging and established professionals, with public workshops, and in-house artist studios and residencies. Through the media lab’s outreach and workshops, community members will be trained in how to operate equipment and develop the audiovisual storytelling techniques necessary to realize their vision.
 
 Geographic selection of the space will focus on the eastside of Los Angeles, a region underserved with local resources, rich with cost-effective space, and located at a demographic cross-section. Within our rental budget we can procure a space both proportionate to meet the needs of our facility and centrally accessible to the diverse communities we will serve.","By creating a publicly-available media lab we will enrich the community through active participation in events, tapings, and broadcasting. The lab will serve as a hub for Los Angeles audio and video culture both through providing the end-product, and through serving as a central meeting point placing exhibition space and artistic disciplines in context with a larger community.
 
 It will reconnect the community to lacking resources by providing a facility specialized to meet a number of activities. Hosting residencies for guest artists will further aid in diversifying our growing creative community - allowing interaction with and exposure to working artists in Los Angeles as well as international artists working in alternative media. Giving the local community exposure to artists and resources has a myriad of beneficial social, cultural and economic effects. The center we propose to establish will enable local community members and children to gain valuable skills and resources to prepare them for a lifetime of creative work in digital media. Additionally, our media lab would allow skilled artists to employ their professional training for use on a community level.
 
 There is a lack of access to public media resources to an ever technological oriented culture that we hope to account for through our center. Our media labs will fill a broad variety of needs: as a way for people to inform each other and express their specific voices about their local community needs; as a way for people to engage with their own community on a grassroots level; as a way to give marginalized voices in the community a sense of agency; and as a way for the community to produce work using professional media equipment that is otherwise out of range. Our center will help to produce videos that community members want to share with the rest of LA.","Through the establishment of a media lab we will take what our city is notorious for— media production— and decentralize it into an everyday act artists from across Los Angeles can participate in. By moving media production away from only being in the realm of large corporations and into the hands of the artistic and local community we will establish LA as a vanguard for multimedia art production and groundbreaking exhibitions.
 
 Our center will positively reach a range of people. It will benefit local artists through allowing access to video technology that is otherwise limited to institutions or commercial ventures. It will provide a space for them to experiment with new ideas and work. It will benefit community members curious to further their knowledge of video and digitized forms - those interested to produce their own media, whether it’s a vlog, television show or video installation. It will positively impact the local youth because it will offer an inspiring, exciting, and professional environment where one can be exposed to the infinite possibilities that video technologies and multimedia artists have to offer.","Pasadena Arts Council

 We have worked with each of the partners listed above and each brings a unique element to the project through their individual strengths. The Pasadena Arts Council will serve as the fiscal sponsor for this project and is the current fiscal sponsor for Experimental Half-Hour. Ghosting.TV is LA’s premier monthly artist hang-out and screening series of cutting edge video art and animation. Through the use of our media lab’s space they will be able to expand their reach to a growing audience and continue to host visiting artists to present their work. Through our collaborations with DJs at LA based FM radio station KXLU, we look forward to having a more consolidated space to host events and remote broadcasts. Dublab is a non-profit web radio collective that has been broadcasting independently since 1999. They curate shows and host video screenings - sharing a vision very much aligned to ours. A broader space for us would facilitate more productions for our collaboration[s] and would benefit not only the scope of their programming, but the local television and media platforms in LA. For the UCLA Hammer Museum’s 2014 Made in L.A. biennial exhibition, KChung Radio launched its subsidiary television network KChung TV and hired Experimental Half-Hour as video technical producers to help realize their project. We loaned them our mobile studio system and trained KChung volunteers to use the equipment so they could produce their own series of variety shows. GYST Ink is an artist-run company providing information, technology and solutions created by artists for artists. GYST would be able to use the video technologies to broaden their journalistic coverage of the arts community.",1,
4102072,FORT (Resident Makers Program to help creatives start their own companies).,"FORT plans to expand its current operation and launch Resident Maker Programs (complete with DIY workshops, 3D Printing & Ted-like talks).",Create,2014035,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050create/projects/FORT.html,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,"Currently FORT operates as a company that leverages reclaimed materials to create beautiful pieces of furniture. We also host DIY workshops, where community members learn from prominent artists/makers, make goods from reclaimed materials, and organize monthly events focused on community and design. Our inventory is available through our website and by appointment. FORT would like to evolve this established base into a new creative paradigm for social impact, empowering Los Angeles and creative industries/businesses at large. 
 
 Implementation would consist of 5 integrated components:
  
 • Rolling out our FORT Resident Maker Program. This unprecedented element would consist of selecting local makers each month and giving them the tools they need to launch their creative product. We would provide necessary allotted space for them to work in our workshop, required machinery including 3D printers, professional photography for their piece, space in our online marketplace, as well as the mentorship and resources needed to make it in the world as a newfound artisan entrepreneur. 
 
 • Acquisition and build-out of new location. FORT is currently housed out of a 1,650 sq loft in DTLA. A bigger space with more accessibility and visibility would be a great help to us in this endeavor. 
 
 • Fulfill already secured partnerships (elaborated upon in a subsequent question below). FORT has collaborated with some incredible organizations in our time of operation. In our efforts to make LA the best place to create in 2050 we will partner with the following:
 
 o No Right Brain Left Behind
 o Habitat for Humanity- 
 o Good Planet
 o VEDC (Valley Economic Development Center)- 
 o Mentor Matchmaker
 
 • Enhance our DIY WORKSHOPS by recruiting the most talented makers and designers from all over the world to share their craft with locals. We are modeling this after Restaurant 57 who takes visiting chefs in from all over. We will do the same by inviting worldly makers who come through LA. 
 
 • Establish Pop-up workshops and DIY seminars in various neighborhoods across LA to distribute the knowledge, skills, and a platform to Angelenos from all different economic levels.","It is the age-old adage, “Give a man a fish…teach a man to fish...” Through the reverberating effects of our Resident Makers selling their products and acquiring the tools to become entrepreneurs themselves, FORT will facilitate an environment in which creatives can flourish in Los Angeles for years to come. In exchange for the platform to learn, refine, and launch their creative products through FORT, Makers will agree to give workshops themselves in a ‘pay it forward’ like fashion. Many of such workshops will be given in a pop-up like fashion in underserved areas of LA. This feature will grant children from struggling communities activities that will allow them to explore creative potentials. We will show them that through the usage of reclaimed materials they too can build and create things with very little to start.
 As for the future, 2050 will become a year in which all people in LA have the community resources to make financial means through their own creative endeavors. Given the community that we are building with the workshops and events centered around design, it will be much more commonplace for Angelenos to congregate on these common grounds. The divide of East LA and West LA will blur as we all gather mid-point in DTLA to remember that young, playful spirit of building forts. In addition to the social impact FORT will have, we will also have an environmental impact as the increased usage of reclaimed materials will correspondingly decrease the waste accumulating in landfills. In the year 2050, building with all new materials will become a thing of the past. Our population will have made the realization that most of what we need to build with, both intellect and material, is already here…just waiting for us to behold. That by reclaiming the goods and materials we already have readily available, we can make anew through great design and ingenuity. Expanding the current operations of FORT would be an incredible step towards such a reality.","• The children of the Salamander Project (last year's recipient of LA 2050) as well as youth from other underserved communities will learn skills and explore their creative potentials through free workshops from FORT. 
 
 • Creatives who are chosen for the FORT Resident Maker Program will launch their product and be given resources to embark on their businesses.
 
 • Adult participants of the DIY WORKSHOPS given at FORT will build connections as well as pieces they get to take home with them.
 
 • Audiences of the FORT ‘Ted’-like talks from great creative thinkers and designers will leave inspired and excited about new perspectives.
 
 • Participants of our monthly round table dinner party will enjoy one another and provocative questions/table discussions about how to foster a better LA culture.
 
 • Older generations (as we will seek out retired craftsmen and makers to give talks and workshops) will pass on their incredibly valuable knowledge and experience the joy of knowing they are a necessary component of our society.
 
 • Local colleges, Jacqueline Sharp (FORT founder) through speaking engagements will give talks about entrepreneurialism and creating your own job in this new economy.
 
 Overall however FORT (Resident Makers Program) will help the LA community at large because it incredibly integrated with all of the 5 categories of LA2050.
 
 • LEARN- Education of the arts for all ages through the DIY workshops and lectures given at FORT.
 
 • CONNECT- FORT hosts community events, dinners, talks, and a monthly event that features a creative elderly who has much to share…bridging the gap between the young and the old.
 
 • LIVE- The environmental impact that FORT would have would come from diverting materials away from the landfills through the primary use of reclaimed materials.
 
 • PLAY- What better way to play than to build with new friends?","Yes, all of the following mentioned collaborators are confirmed:
 
 
 • No Right Brain Left Behind- FORT will build up and off of the success of past and future recipients of LA2050. We are partnering with NRBLB by giving free DIY workshops to kids of the Salamander Project who struggle with challenging circumstances. Such workshops will go hand in hand with their educational curriculum (ie if they are learning about electricity/Thomas Edison FORT will give a workshop to them on wiring lamps). 
 
 • Habitat for Humanity- will help supply us with reclaimed materials from which we build in return we help build homes and give workshops.
 
 • Good Planet- will also provide FORT with building materials. The supply from Good Planet comes directly from recycling the wasted wood, rope, metal, ect. that is ever flowing from commercial and movie set productions.
 
 • VEDC (Valley Economic Development Center)- will take special care of our FORT Resident Makers with one on one sessions with expert professionals who will help them start their own business after launching their product through FORT.
 
 • Mentor Matchmaker- will provide our FORT Resident Makers with experienced mentors to guide them in their journey of creating a career out of their creative passion.",1,
4102075,Farmers Market- Public Space Usage Plan,"Returning to its roots, our project involves using farmers markets (Open marketplaces) as public spaces for civic and social engagement.",Connect,2014036,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050connect/projects/LASPIRIT.html,,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,"Angelenos have long standing reputation of being disconnected from each other, (not knowing your nextdoor neighbor) our project involves taking farmers markets to their roots; once known as Agoras in Ancient Greece, and present throughout the globe and in every culture. Today, these public spaces have largely lost the cultural and social significant role they played in developing society, cultivating community and establish social norms especially in major cities such as Los Angeles at a time when technology is increasingly replacing real human interaction. Our project will host open public philosophical inquiry to collectively help educate and develop critical thinking skills of angelenos of all ages, races, and cultural backrounds.","Our model is using Farmers Markets as public spaces to socially engage Angelenos at a time when real human interaction is becoming more and more rare, the need for public spaces to promote healthy lifestyles, preserve and cultivate humanity, nurture community and teach consideration of others; we believe is paramount.
 
 Personal connections; we believe is the most powerful force in humanity, it can be as simple as a smile, making a new friend on the first day of school, a great conversation or an instant shared in the company of strangers, moments that pass in seconds but stay with us forever, and help us to feel that we are not alone. For youth as well as adults these are the building blocks to the rest of their lives, providing a sense of security, and a since of value, and an identity that we all can connect with and feel a part of. This is what community should be, FHL helps cultivate community by developing farmers market public spaces from unused and underused public and private lands and repurposes them to create market spaces that operate around the concept of healthy eating, active living, and social engagement. 
 
 For social engagement, we incorporate the concept of using dialectical discourse to coordinate facilitated thoughtful discussions with the aim of harnessing the collective wisdom and knowledge of everyday people to confront important questions and issues facing society, and seek a collective resolve or create a better understanding of the problem.
  
 We will implement pilot programs in challenged market areas, markets facing largely minority low to middle income communities in Service Plan Areas 6 & 8 (SPA 6 & SPA8).
 
 We will enlist the help of local and national scholars to assist in facilitating discussions in the method of Dialectic Discourse.
 
 We will also enlist the support of local government officials, the business community, artist and professionals to generate a collaborative effort to harness social capital.","Our project will make los Angeles a more open, connected and understanding city that grows through its wealth of diversity when more people are given a voice and their knowledge and experiences are shared. The process of dialogue and the space of human interaction are good for us as individuals and essential for us as a society. For youth who will be the adults, professionals, and policy makers in 2050 it will inspire curiosity and wonder, nurture self-discovery, openness, empathy.","Our project will benefits Angelenos of all ages, races, cultures and backgrounds.","Christopher Phillips- Scholar, Author Educator, founder of Socrates Cafe.

4102076,Connecting LA to its River,FoLAR connects people to the River through the Great LA River CleanUp and further engages the public to create a constituency for change.,Connect,2014037,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050connect/projects/rover.html,,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Inspired by the hymn,“Shall We Gather at the River?” FoLAR's founders united to influence public opinion by bringing individuals, reporters, decision-makers – anyone who would listen – down to the Los Angeles River. Our 38' mobile visitor and education center, the Los Angeles River Rover,hails a new era of public engagement and advocacy. Interpretive and interactive exhibits for all ages connect the River's past and present to its possible future. Through programs and events, FoLAR and its partners connect individuals to the River and to one another to create a constituency for change. Docent and citizen science activities increase volunteerism. At the Rover ideas are exchanged and dreams are shared. A better LA is sure to follow.","Exchanging information is easy at the River Rover. With an internet connection, a high resolution projector inside and a 40” monitor on the outside of the Rover there are multiple ways to communicate and connect. DVDs and slide shows play in the background or speakers can make presentations on myriad topics.
 
 On the weekends the River Rover will park near natural-bottom sections at lease once a month in each of these three service areas:
 1. The San Fernando Valley from Canoga Park to Burbank,
 2. The Glendale Narrows from Griffith Park through downtown, 
 3. The lower River from Vernon to Long Beach. 
 
 Bring the River to the People: By visiting schools, festivals, neighborhood council meetings, libraries, senior centers – anywhere we can park provides the opportunity to inform and engage people of all ages, cultures connecting communities and residents to the issues that impact their neighborhoods and the River so their voices can be heard.
 
 Activities Connect People to the River and to One Another: 
 FoLAR educators and experts from our partner organizations conduct walks along the River calling attention to bird and plant life, sharing current information and engaging participants in conversations. Bicycle rides, kayaking trips, fishing lessons and tournaments, poetry readings, live music and food trucks, these are just some of the ways to connect people to the River not only as a place for recreation and celebration but also as an ecosystem in the heart of our built environment.
 
 Citizen Science and Trained Docent Opportunities
 With an increasing demand for volunteer opportunities both citizen science and docent programs provide meaningful ways for the public to engage. Assessing the River's biological health, testing water quality and conducting trash surveys provide both volunteer opportunities and useful data that can be used to influence policy decisions that affect the River's future. Trained docents provide guided tours through the Rover, answer questions and engage the public in numerous other ways. Individuals and high school students representing each of the three regions gain knowledge and experience while increasing FoLAR's capacity to foster connections.","A Better LA Now
 How do you convince the public, politicians, city, state and federal government agencies that there is value to restoring a concrete River? In 1986 Lewis MacAdams and two friends cut a hole in the fence and started what he called a 40-year artwork to bring the River back to life. Now the once maligned River is a place for recreation, education and restoration. This year FoLAR rallied for the most ambitious plan to remove concrete, restore wetland habitat and connect communities to a natural environment while increasing flood-control capacity; Alternative 20. 
 
 First, we raised and donated $1,000,000 to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to complete an Ecosystem Feasibility Study seven years in the making; a first in the Corps' history. Next, Lewis, Mayor Eric Garcetti, and others traveled to Washington DC meeting with Senators Boxer and Feinstein, and top-ranking Army Corps and Obama Administration officials. We pressed for a town-hall at the LA River Center and mobilized politicians and community leaders; over 200 people voiced support for the most ambitious plan- Alternative 20. In a precedent-setting action, the City agreed to share costs for the plan that will remove X miles of concrete and an 11-mile stretch through the heart of our region.
 
 A Better LA in 2050
 By touring the Rover's interior, children and adults are introduced to the pre-channelized River's natural and human history in the Past Gallery where animal pelts, native plant scents, bird calls and frog croaks bring the River alive. The Present Gallery includes an aquarium where aquatic insects and fish from the River give guests a look into its waters. A counter with microscopes and a sink turns the area into a mobile laboratory. A true/false game and interpretive panels provide an overview of the River as it is today. In the Future Gallery images of future plans are projected onto a screen. A game allows visitors to place hexagonal tiles depicting bike paths, wetlands and other amenities onto a concrete channel to create the River of their dreams.The vehicle's vibrant exterior artwork provides additional opportunity to engage the public.
 
 With the River Rover FoLAR's visibility and effectiveness will grow exponentially. Programming is limitless and partnerships abundant. As William Carlos Williams noted, “A new world is a new mind.” A new River is possible. By 2050 the possible will be realized.","FoLAR’s work benefits all; near and far, young and old, nature lovers and urbanites alike. Because the Los Angeles River is one of the few elements that cross geographical, economic and social boundaries in Los Angeles, FoLAR is in a unique position to CONNECT Angelenos in ways no other civic project can.Though our work is for everyone’s benefit habitat restoration of the River will first and foremost impact the hundreds of thousands of, mostly low-income, families and business owners who’ve have made the banks of the LA River their home for generations. 
 The LA River runs through some of the most densely populated, and ethnically diverse communities in the country where access to nature and open space is virtually non-existent for millions. According to the City Project there are 7.2 total acres of green space per thousand residents along the River corridor, compared to 89.8 countywide and 1,343.5 statewide.
 Communities along the River corridor are disproportionately Latino: 52% along the River, compared to 48% for the city, 47% for the county, and 37% statewide.
 And 18% of the people live in poverty, compared to 20% citywide, 16% countywide, and 14% statewide. Designed for all ages, the Rover is also equipped with an ADA wheelchair lift, allowing people of all abilities to enter, experience and exit the vehicle with ease. FoLAR's bilingual staff speak Spanish, Korean and Farsi and many of our partners advocate for other diverse cultures – Chinese, Vietnamese.
 
 FoLAR’s current school program focuses on students and their teachers in grades 3 through 6. A pilot program for high school students begins in Fall 2014.The goal is to provide opportunities for students from Kindergarten through college with curriculum and connections to the LA River. On weekends, students have the opportunity to bring their friends and family to the River to see the LA River Rover that visited their school and to explore the River together through family-friendly progams and activities.
 Neighborhood council meetings, libraries, summer day camps, places of worship; anywhere we can safely park is a place to engage people of all ages, all nationalities, all socio-economic backgrounds and all abilities. Staging near the River introduces members of park-poor communities to an oasis in their backyard; a place for recreation, respite and open expanses. Connecting Angelenos to its River has never been more feasible. FoLAR is connecting us all to a better future.","The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service: With a new directive to encourage and nurture an appreciation of wildlife conservation in new urban audiences who are often disconnected from nature and wildlife, the USFWS created the Urban Wildlife Refuge Partnership. Recognizing the ability to connect with diverse populations in an urban environment the River Rover was selected as one of eight partners. Through our connection we are building a new conservation constituency to engage new and different peoplein meaningful, collaborative ways that build sustainable, broad-based support. We've collaborated on a technical support grant to develop an LA River map emphasizing recreation and ecological diversity that will be distributed from the River Rover.
 The Los Angeles County Natural History Museum:The first grant FoLAR received was to compile a Biota for the Los Angeles River in partnership with the Natural History Museum. The majority of the data used to document the biological diversity on the LA River was gleaned from the Museum’s vast collection. With a commitment from both the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the city of Los Angeles to share costs associated with the most ambitious plan EVER PROPOSED to restore 11 miles of wetland habitat we’ve again joined forces with the Natural History Museum. Experts from the Museum on birds, fish, reptiles, amphibians and mammals are at the ready to lend their knowledge and expertise to our programs. The LA River Rover will stage numerous events in the Museum’s habitat garden and we’re working together on an exhibit and lecture series, utilizing the Museum’s vast collections, to focus on the River’s historic and possible future bio-diversity. We’re also working closely with the Museum’s mobile education staff on ways to share education materials and expertise.
 The Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority: The Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority (MRCA) has worked for decades to create and maintain small pocket parks on the Los Angeles River corridor and FoLAR has championed their efforts. With funding from the MRCA FoLAR created the first decorative gates -the Heron Gates- to declare the River open to the public. We’ve worked together to reimagine a railyard, owned by Union Pacific across the River from Union Station, as a location for restored wetlands and water retention that is included in the ecosystem restoration plan. We partner with MRCA’s trained naturalists whose knowledge, expertise and programmin",
4102078,Leimert Park Village Studios,"World famous Leimert Park Village launches LPVR Studios, a neighborhood cultural collaboration anchored at the Vision TheateR.",Create,2014038,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050create/projects/LPVStudios.html,,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,Leimert Park,"Within the existing framework of the LPV 20/20 Vision Initiative, a grassroots community effort to shape the neighborhood’s economic development around its cultural and artistic identity, we will flesh out a year-long calendar of cultural events: the Summer Arts Program of the Manchester Junior Arts Center; a Village-wide Music Caravan to be held every few months with themes like Jazz, Blues, Mardi Gras, and World Music; a monthly Art Walk centered in the People’s Street Plaza; MLK Day Festival; Kwanza Festival; African-American Arts & Music Festival; and, in December the massive street festival CicLAvia.
 
 This event calendar, already in place, will provide us with the production calendar for LPV Studios. Around each event, we will produce original programming: recording performances, readings, and public art. Second, our signature events will be used as deadlines for the production of documentary material (film, audio, and literary) as part of our Artistic & Cultural Heritage Program--to be sold during the events, generating income for the local creative economy, and passing on our living arts to the broader community. 
 
 The event calendar will also structure our youth education efforts. We will use youth involvement in performance, planning and production to create a curriculum in arts history, media literary, in documenting cultural heritage, and in technical skills needed in the creative industry. This curriculum will be designed along the lines of the STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts & Math) educational framework, positioning us to establish an accredited academic program. 
 
 We will conduct an assessment of the current technical capacity of anchor venues, and make necessary upgrades. We plan to target The World Stage, KAOS Network, Barbara Morrison and Fernando Pullum for temporary sound-proofing; to acquire portable green screens that can be used to film in all of the above, and at Youth n Motion; and to acquire a pool of cameras, audio and video recording equipment, and editing equipment to be shared amongst the partner venues. 
 
 Finally, we will build a comprehensive Creative Directory. The talent base will include those directly connected to our anchor venues, independent producers and artists whose involvement in our events can be a springboard for additional ventures. The People’s Street Plaza will in essence serve as an open-air co-working space nurturing connection and collaboration.","There is already a renaissance in Leimert Park Village, widely recognized as a hub of African-American cultural in Los Angeles. The socio-economic circumstances of the community belie its artistic wealth. Five MacArthur Genius Awards have been bestowed on artists with a history in the neighborhood--including Mark Bradford, who is investing in a major new arts education initiative. The ongoing effort of the Village to survive as an iconic American community is at the heart of our project.
 
 In the short term, existing cultural venues, joined in December by the newly approved Peoples Street Plaza, are a ready infrastructure for performance, education, and creative innovation. Our event calendar assures sustainable performance opportunities, while the LiveStream TV station and online cultural journal offer access to an expanded local (and later national and international) market. Venues with a long history creating more with less will be bolstered by new sources of income, as will independent producers and artists. The involvement of youth in all facets--from planning and performance to documenting the neighborhood’s artistic heritage--will train a new generation of creative industry professionals. The arrival of CicLAvia in December will bring a fresh new audience. 
 
 In the long term, the foundation established in the first year will allow us to fully take advantage of a series of opportunities ahead. The 750-seat Vision Theater will reopen in 2016, dramatically expanding capacity. The creative infrastructure we plan to have in place when the LPV Metro stop opens in 2020 will open up new markets. With a straight link to the airport and national and international travelers, LVP Studios will have access to the global travel market and creative economy. Capturing that market requires a core of cultural, business and artistic activities that will make LPV a 'must see' destination.
 
 By 2050, Leimert Park Village promises to be a fully developed magnet for cultural enrichment and artistic innovation. A homegrown Studio, based in local cultural establishments and anchored by the Vision Theater and People’s Street Plaza, will offer a new generation of creative professionals training, employment, and structure for ongoing collaboration. As the local hub for the culture and arts of the African Diaspora, Leimert Park Village will be both an international destination, and a portal for national and international distribution of film and music.","LPV Studios will give a dynamic community the tools to build a sustainable creative infrastructure, ensuring that future economic development is guided by the area’s rich artistic heritage. 
 
 A major beneficiary will be the local African-American community and those who have come to cherish its cultural legacy. Across the country, traditional centers of black culture have been disrupted and dispersed. Los Angeles has witnessed the dissolution of the famed Central Avenue jazz & blues scene, and the dislocation of the literary revival in Watts in the late 60s. Leimert Park remains the best hope for a permanent safe haven for that living history.
 
 Venues that for decades have learned to do more with less will be on solid footing. A shared pool of state-of-the-art equipment, modest facility upgrades, and paid coordinators will ground a thriving local creative industry. An enhanced schedule of cultural events will substantially expand the market for local creative production. Without this foundation, the community will be ill-equipped to capture the new traffic that the coming subway station will surely draw. With it, the possibilities are endless.
 
 Local venues will be able to provide regular work for artists, instructors, and producers who have for years volunteered their time. Anchored by the open-air co-working space of the People’s Plaza, our cultural calendar will be an incubator for artistic innovation. This activity will be a growing source of varied employment in the creative industry.
 
 Area youth, who have for years faced a dearth of school arts and after-school programs, will have exciting new options. Youth participants will be given hands-on experience connecting them with their own cultural heritage, and providing practical skills for the future. We have the opportunity to nurture a whole new generation of artist-entrepreneurs. 
 
 The training component of the Studio will offer skills, structure and a second chance to the previously incarcerated, emancipated minors, foster youth, and young people who have difficulty finding a place in mainstream educational institutions. By providing a safe public space for youth and their families, we will enhance the social fabric of the area and prevent young people from getting into trouble in the first place.
 
 Finally, the historical archiving projects of the Studio will give our neighborhood’s elders a meaningful role in preserving our history and in passing it on to the next generation.","Our core collaborators are the anchor cultural venues that will form the foundation of the Studio: all of whom are committed to the mission of the LPV 20/20 Vision Initiative; have begun coordinating a year-long schedule of festivals and cultural events, most recently a Village-wide Music Caravan; and have begun joint marketing through a shared website, cultural calendar, and LiveStream TV Station.

 2. Putting in place an organizational infrastructure that establishes a shared set of values and practices; clarifies benefits and obligations of partners; implements a long-term strategic plan.
 
 3. Building in a broad-based sense of ownership and investment in the Studio: Leimert Park Village is a small area with limited resources; to meet the full scope of our ambitions, we will have to make Leimert a magnet for cultural education, training, and enrichment; and a center for creative innovation.",1,
4102082,GYST Cloud for Art,"GYST Cloud connects diverse creative professionals through comprehensive cloud-based technology, tools, and resources.",Create,2014039,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050create/projects/GYSTCloud4Art.html,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,,"We are currently talking with artists and mobile/online application developers in Los Angeles to find competitive bids for the development of a completely cloud-based artist software system modeled after the our current GYSTPro software. Combining 15 years of research, product development, program enrichment, and software, the GYST infrastructure already exists, however we feel that a cloud-based platform is essential for the future.
 
 We will hire artist researchers to ensure that our resources are up-to-date, providing a list of arts institutions and resources building on our current lists. We will expand our existing 500+ pages of vital professional practices information currently on our website, printed manuals, and in the GYSTPro software. This expansion will help to disseminate this vast knowledge to a wider and more diverse audience. Unlike many other artwork/gallery management systems, GYST Cloud is a comprehensive one-stop-shop for every artist, not just a product inventory for traditional galleries. We specifically focus on underrepresented artists in Los Angeles emphasizing gender equality, racial/cultural diversities, and artists of any age. 
 
 In addition, GYST Cloud will provide low-cost and high-quality backups of all user data. Connecting to other preexisting successful networking, accounting and social media apps will also be integrated. Existing GYST users will have the option to migrate to the new GYST Cloud and/or keep their data local. 
 
 The GYST Cloud will be delivered to any artist through remote access from any computer. We will also continue to grow our network of creative professionals, administrators, educators, lawyers, and fabricators. This ultimately ensures a robust and thriving online network that connects creatives from the digital art community into its physical counterpart. We plan to host scheduled workshops and free information sessions throughout the city. GYST will raise awareness and educate the public about GYST Cloud that will be readily available at income-based pricing.","GYST has respect for the wide-ranging diversity of the arts in Los Angeles by makes life better for all artists and creative professionals. There are multiple obstacles to overcome to achieve a successful career in the arts such as: income, knowledge, resources, organization, access to gatekeepers, collaborators and communication. GYST Cloud will be a vital contributor to helping artists navigate these professional challenges. 
 
 Our organization and the GYST Cloud will simply create better artists. Ultimately creating Los Angeles as the best place for all artists to flourish. GYST provides art business education and resources so that all art communities that reside within LA can directly benefit. GYST Cloud will generate a more organized, prepared, and business-ready artist that will be hirable and thrive in the Los Angeles workforce with our income-based subscriptions. The art world is not currently functioning and communicating on current technology available today. Although companies, organizations, and programs exist to facilitate professional practices for artists, many fail to reach and connect ALL types of artists. The GYST Cloud will be a comprehensive and intuitive software platform that will bridge the gap between artists and the professionals that want to exhibit, review, consult, and/or hire them. 
  
 While many other cities have a clearly defined city center or “art hub”, Los Angeles lacks a central location where the art world(s) reside. Conversely, art communities exist across the vast Los Angeles Basin from Bergamot Station, Culver City, Downtown, Venice, to Chinatown and the Arts District. The GYST Cloud will provide a universal platform for all Los Angeles art communities to connect, learn, share, and hire any artist, anywhere. 
   
 In 2050, with the help of GYST Cloud and its ever-growing network of creative professionals, we want all artists to have their sh*t together. Artists will be valued and respected along with any other profession, leading sustaining art practices and careers. Simply, all Angelino artists and art professionals will have access to professional practices. They will be educated and informed to make the right and smart decisions for their careers in the arts. Furthermore, the public will benefit with immersive exposure and understanding of the arts.","Artists need tools to streamline the process of the exchange of information to create sustainability, knowledge and income for all involved. GYST Cloud will benefit all individuals, academic institutions, organizations, and businesses through universal technology, current relevant content, pedagogy and networking. 
 
 ARTISTS will benefit from learning professional strategies, understand how business professionals work with artists, and get their studio practice organized. They will have the means to professionally present their work and skills to others. Artists benefit from being prepared for hybrid careers, business strategies/systems and estate planning. 
 
 GALLERIES can keep track of work sold, connect with collectors and always have information ready to find for presentation or sale. Galleries will communicate with their artists through intergraded cloud-based networks. They will be able to communicate with other galleries to share contacts and data.
 
 CURATORS will have direct access to more artists in LA. Exchanging information and contacts will be easy to curate exhibitions through the GYST Cloud. Not only will they have the ability to organize artists but they will also keep track of exhibition information and writing samples. 
 
 COLLECTORS can effortlessly keep track of their collections. The GYST Cloud archives important information such as current retail values, insurance, exhibition records, and storage. 
 
 MUSEUMS will be able to catalog collections, communicate with curators and trustees, and promote museum programming and cultural events to their patrons.
 
 ARTS ORGANIZATIONS can keep track of programming, exhibitions, monetary donations/contributions, and research. Beyond historical archiving, posting opportunities, open-calls, and promoting the institution will be included.
 
 EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS can teach professional practices to their students by giving them access to the GYST Cloud. Using GYST to catalog their artwork, create artist statements, resumes, mailing lists etc. GYST Cloud provides real-world resources to help all schools educate artists in a visual way.
 
 THE GENERAL PUBLIC can find work/programs and connect with artists directly. GYST Cloud can be used as an educational tool for audiences who seek to understand more about an artists’ work as well as cultural institutions. GYST Cloud will expand art audiences in Los Angeles and generate new collectors in the process.","We have been collaborating for 15 years with arts professionals to get to this point. Moving forward we will collaborate with:
 
 TECH ARTISTS: We will be working with artists who have the technical experience to migrate the existing local GYSTPro software to GYST Cloud. Since the design and infrastructure is already complete, we can spend our energy on new technologies, mobile platforms, and how the interface will work with our diverse clientele.
 
 ARTIST RESEARCHERS: We will be working with artist researchers to create fresh content, resources, and information for arts professionals. Meeting directly with art administrators, curators, non-profits, educators, lawyers, healthcare professionals, and studio artists allows GYST Cloud to stay current, up-to-date, relevant in the ever-changing art world.
 
 USERS (YOU): We will invite our existing individual and organization users (over 2,350) and new clients to beta test GYST Cloud. Further funding from others who donate towards the support of low-income artists, as well as the income-based subscription model will allow this project to be sustainable for future generations. Establishing responsibility within the art community, we will invite users to self-determine their own level of income and therefore their subscription price.",1,

 There is no program currently operating in LA that delivers the kind of service that GFS LA does: free, rigorous, high-quality creative education for diverse teenage storytellers, grounded in cinema studies and real-world production training. 
 
 Our commitment is to deliver programming to our community in MacArthur Park (the most densely populated region in the US west of the Mississippi), and to students throughout all of LA County, and to connect homegrown talent in LA to lifelong creative and professional opportunities in the film, media and entertainment industries that are based here. 
 
 DIVERSITY
 The current industry-wide lack of diversity is a root problem both for the creative industries and for underrepresented groups seeking authentic access to professional opportunities in a wide variety of creative fields, particularly in Los Angeles. 
 
 We believe that the quality of our student work and the quality of our programming enables substantive change by connecting two populations that lack the ability to connect with each other: a vast pool of eager creative talent throughout Los Angeles and film and media businesses that are eager to recruit new voices from underrepresented backgrounds.","Over the course of its first three years, GFS LA will work with 75 diverse young storytellers, each completing a 30-month college-level pre-professional immersion in cinematic storytelling and production training. GFS LA annually works with 25 young filmmakers, ages 14-19. 
 
 Without exception, no GFS student has had the experience, training, family connections or financial ability to independently pursue a career in filmmaking. Enrollment is free for all students.
 
 Ghetto Film School is the only creative education organization in LA with the stated goal of connecting emerging filmmakers of color to careers in film, media and creative industries.","HOLA
 Heart of Los Angeles (HOLA) is GFS’ key local partner, an acclaimed 
 nonprofit with a 25-year history in MacArthur Park delivering exceptional programs in academics, arts and athletics to 2400 youth annually. HOLA's knowledge of Los Angeles and experience working with young people in MacArthur Park is critical for GFS LA's first season in Los Angeles, as Ghetto Film School brings 15 years of experience in the South Bronx to the west coast for the first time. 
 
 Specific to GFS LA, HOLA provides the following:
 - Direct referrals to 70+ feeder schools for student recruitment
 - Marketing support through digital/social media and PR channels
 - Classroom and computer lab space for daily instruction
 - Access to 4 major facilities and neighboring Lafayette Park for 
 production exercises, screenings and guest speaker visits. 
 
 LA FILM INDUSTRY
 Collaboration with 21st Century Fox, along with other LA based film studios and partners in the film industry, is essential to the success of GFS LA. GFS LA students will participate in regular site visits to studio lots, development offices and post houses, weekly trips to top LA cinemas, museums and art galleries, and an international production trip during the annual GFS LA Thesis Project.",1,
4102089,Seeds the Game: Community Jams,Seeds the Game apps & event series grow food in LA through game design hackathons and garden playtesting across communities & food centers,Play,2014041,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050play/projects/seeds.html,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,Includes Southern California towns in LA County and beyond for 2015,"We are creating a game jam series of hack events and building a creative team based in Los Angeles and Vista, CA to make SEEDS the Game, a social action ecosystem of games for mobile devices. SEEDS the Game encourages players to tackle real life food security challenges by going outside and creating gardens at home and with their community. 
 
 Our work starts with a series of game jams - experimental hacklabs in California to design and develop the best game mechanics for mapping seed exchanges, pest challenges, food deserts and potential centers for community actions. We begin in September with this series of events and will be working throughout the school year with development teams from schools and community centers in the Los Angeles area. Events are a mix of game hackathon for data integration with real seed, soil and plant tests in the field at gardens, markets, and permaculture centers.
 
 Developers, alpha testers and players track and share their progress while bonding with neighbors and making friends across garden guilds. The game jam series includes integrated profiles for community organizing and organic gameplay experiments across the network of game hack teams.
 
 We dedicate our human resources to build the Grow Games community to include artists, musicians, software developers, engineers, permaculture educators and programmers in Southern California. Our implementation with the support and funds would allow us to begin the community-building and testing process starting with the alpha stage.
 
 We are scheduling the Los Angeles area to be the first in line to Alpha and Beta test SEEDS the Game. Local participants that sign up as a beta tester in Los Angeles will be first in line to provide feedback and suggestions through our feedback system while enjoying actions in community and school gardens, farmers markets and at home growing food and sharing seeds. When SEEDS the Game first round is completed, users will also have the ability to redeem vouchers for garden-related prizes at local participating markets. 
 
 Los Angeles, Pasadena and Riverside locations have been secured for first events in September and we are expanding to work with community and school gardens throughout the fall of 2014. We are looking for great school gardens to work with on playtesting, especially with youth over age 13 who can give us feedback on gameplay from new perspectives.","Los Angeles already has some of the most beautiful parks, gardens, and farmers’ markets in the world. Our project will get more citizens outside and interacting with the beauty we know is already there, as well as teaming up to create more green spaces and transform problem areas.
 
 In the coming year we can improve co-learning and connectedness between people and their environment while beautifying public spaces together through growing food and beneficial plants. We will map food resiliency needs while making it fun for people to grow food together and level up their skills.
 
 SEEDS the Game is a location-based game for mobile devices that can be played with GPS and data connection. We offer in-game incentives for SEEDS the Game players that are in Los Angeles including advancement in the local Leadership Board and In-Game Achievements that connect people to local actions and gameplay centers such as community and school gardens. Citizens can earn points while volunteering at participating locations or picking up gardening tools through partners that have signed up to be in our SEEDS the Game Partnership Network. 
 
 Our goal is to work with community based organizations, businesses, government and local garden leaders to identify great actions and opportunities to incentivize through gameplay. Over the coming year we expect thousands of players to engage in community volunteerism through Seeds the Game apps.
 
 Not only is SEEDS the Game beneficial to people but our games also stimulate the economy. We aim to maken Los Angeles a global innovation leader for technology addressing food/water/climate issues. By 2050, we will have created a dynamic network connecting local organizations and businesses with player/members who are also consumers. Our community will use the most cutting edge technology available to maximize our land and water use, while participants compete to create the most beautiful and inspiring gardens and public spaces. The market and gameplay are fully integrated and it is easy to see on a map where resources are needed for resiliency, disaster mitigation and food security. 
 
 We are establishing a safe connection to share real seeds around the world to promote healthy heirloom plants, biodiversity and organic solutions to pest control for our soil and water health. We anticipate a total of 3 Billion downloads by 2050, with participants cooperatively playing with players in every other country on earth.","Our goal is to encourage grandmas and kids to play together to grow food, share seeds, improve water conservation and energy/climate resiliency for people of all ages and backgrounds. At the farm we playtest with all ages and our team comes from 4 ethnic backgrounds with diverse experience in food/climate intervention for disaster relief.
 
 The SEEDS Game Jam series of events will bring together Los Angeles designers and developers with economists, game strategists, media market leaders, nonprofit organizations, youth and master gardeners aligned to connect people to food and seeds through mobile play starting in September of 2014. 
 
 SEEDS the Game as a series of apps will benefit just about everyone of all ages from diverse backgrounds, from grandmas to any kid with a phone or iPad at school. Our focus for this project is to encourage everyone who has action and adventure interest to tackle real challenges and quests to benefit the community. 
 
 SEEDS the Game not only encourages players to participate but communities as well. Nonprofit organizations can sponsor actions in the game and communities are incentivized to grow their own community garden and host farmers market. Players can earn points and skill points along the way.
 
 Communities that are heavily impacted by gang violence and youth that are raised in poverty would benefit gradually from SEEDS the Game. We cater our game to be actively engaging and will offer a special bundle for education and non-profit organizations. Other communities that are in middle income and upper middle class can also benefit by participating the quest and challenges that promote a safe and better community. 
 
 SEEDS The Game is also disguised as a gardening tool and game that allows parents to teach their kids how to grow their own food. When it is night time, players can also earn points by playing mini-games to earn more points.
 
 We have prototyped this project at an ecovillage with a food forest now growing in Vista, CA, at home gardens in Glendale, CA and at a handful of aligned hackathons and conferences with industry leaders. Our partners include NGO allies in 6 countries eager to test with us in 2015 and become global connection zones for Los Angeles players to share their insights and what’s working to grow great food in LA.","Collaborators that are confirmed include Growcology (a nonprofit organization for permaculture education based in Southern California), Southern California Permaculture Guild, the global Seed Libraries network, Project Nuevo Mundo (community food growth nonprofit) along with project partnerships at school gardens, Burners without Borders and development allies at major universities: USC Games for talent in game design, UC Riverside for talent in animation and storytelling for games, JMU for data/climate integration and allies from the CalTech innovation community currently assisting with engineering and backend design.
 
 In 2015 we are lining up to trade seeds and growing experience with communities rebuilding in Haiti and Philippines through Communitare, an international NGO connecting local talent with opportunities to volunteer in rebuilding and relief efforts. We will also be connecting the LA #seedsthegame community to our allies in Central and South America for seedsharing challenges and knowledge sharing and we will be sharing some of our indigenous community work at social impact and social entrepreneurship conferences in California as an example of social benefit corporations incubated within the networked community.
 
 Additional allies include Ron Finley and his work to grow food with youth in Los Angeles, UrbanTXT working with youth and mobile development, Vortex Immersion hosting events with us in Los Angeles near LAUSD and La Loma, a local permaculture development company providing playtesting space for people to grow food for the first time during our game jam series. Some of these are now confirming for the next round and we have worked with Vortex in the past on the State of the Arts immersion experience.
 
 We are currently considering collaborating within the LA Technology community (business and government-focused) along with talent from local game companies, schools and hacker/maker community groups. We have shared #SeedstheGame at the Verge conference for green solutions for business and government and with the Federal Games Guild which is informally helping us position for federal and international NGO funding in 2015.",1,
4102091,Its About Good Interfaith Block Parties: Where Playing Becomes Praying,A series of interfaith block parties that bring together the Los Angeles faith community in celebration of our similarities and differences,Play,2014042,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050play/projects/itsaboutgood.html,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,Hollywood,"Partnering with the Interfaith Religious Council of Los Angeles, the Office of Religious Life at USC, and local places of worship across Los Angeles, each event will require a diverse body of actors to plan it, promote it, and execute it. In highlighting the spiritual elements of each community it is in, It's About Good Interfaith Block Parties will be family friendly opportunities to come together, be educated, dance, have a great time, and celebrate religious diversity and pluralism of Los Angeles. The intention behind each event will be to mobilize community service across faith-lines in that community, as well as educate the local community about different expressions of faith and worship. For instance, the Hollywood event would enable a Christian church like Mosaic, the Self-Realization Fellowship, Temple of Israel Hollywood, and other places of faith to have a common purpose and learn from one another. Holy Ghost Global has experience executing such events in unique venues like the Burning Man Art Festival, South by Southwest in Austin, on the Venice Beach Boardwalk, and other places. 
  
 Holy Ghost Global will serve as the relationship broker and visionary for each event, work to secure venues, artists, vendors, and others that will make the event a success. Each event will be based around a universal concept - Hollywood will celebrate the free flow of information, innovation, social media, and use of technology through a media hackathon and scavenger hunt for filmmakers, technologists, and entrepreneurs across Hollywood Blvd.; Echo Park will focus on creativity, arts, and freedom of expression expressed through a music festival that highlights dance, music, art, and poetry in Echo Park; Wilmington/South Bay will focus on youth involvement, cross-cultural learning, and sports with a kind of spiritual olympics held near the Korean Bell with teachers, parents, and students in the South Bay; Santa Monica will host a healing arts exposition near the Pier to highlight alternative therapies, educate Los Angelenos on health care choices, and hear Ted Talks from Health Care professionals and experts. The Prayer Day event will be on May 7th. Faith leaders on staff at the Office of Religious Life, and many others from across Los Angeles, will join with students and faculty together with city officials, public servants, and citizens for musically-based intercessory prayer for Los Angeles and the globe.","This project will unite Los Angeles around faith, rather than divide it. Most of the world, especially the Middle East and the continent of Africa, is increasingly at war because of religious belief. As the most religiously diverse city on the face of the earth, Los Angeles has the privilege and opportunity to show the broad spectrum of faith expressions. Every human asks questions about the existence of God - but we all express this question differently. Using geographic location and different mediums, we open up the question to individual expression rather than suppress it, ignore it, or belittle it. The center of all religion is truth and love. It's About Good Interfaith Block Parties help to embolden the conversation and expression of faith in Los Angeles for the purpose of serving others and promoting universal good. 
 
 The millenial generation is the least religiously involved generation of American history, but the most civically engaged. There are fewer and fewer venues for real, open, honest conversations about faith in God. While religious differences are portrayed more starkly, religious moderates who use their faith to empower their service to the community are marginalized. 
 
 The purpose of these block parties is to bridge generations - baby boomers who were raised in places of worships and are becoming more and more religious as they grow older due to health and other reasons, and millenials who are not in traditional houses of worship, but want to live their faith by their works. 
 
 Furthermore, the context of faith will guarantee family friendly content, supportive and positive energy, and a spirit of brotherly love. We have the opportunity to prepare the next generation, those who will be running the city in 2050, to not abandon faith, but rather see it as necessarily entwined in every aspect of the social and civic spheres of Los Angeles. These events open up the opportunity for morals, ethics, and mores to be instilled in a relevant way rather than through legalistic, deadening codes and creeds. 
 
 Faith has traditionally been at the center of civilization's progress since the beginning of time. It still belongs in the center of Los Angeles whether it is technology, film, education, health care, or community service. Giving people exposure to different faiths enables them to make their own decisions and by doing it out in the open, in public spaces, the people take back the power of a relationship with God.","It's About Good Interfaith Block Parties will most benefit Angelenos of faith in the specific communities where each event will be held (Santa Monica, San Pedro, Hollywood, Echo Park, USC). However, the benefit does not end there. Having these events will have a ripple effect that will empower other local communities to have similar events. 
 
 Also, these events will benefit local faith-organizations that may be struggling in a time of religious decline and technological innovation. This will help to breathe new life into traditional faith-based organizations and give them a reason to rally and move forward. 
 
 This project will also benefit families in the communities since each event will be tailored to be family friendly and intergenerational. 
 
 Law enforcement will be benefitted because of the peaceful, substance-free basis for community gathering and relationship building. 
 
 Local businesses will benefit since these events will attract new people into new districts and encourage participation in the local economy. 
 
 Due to the nature of social events - especially those that are clean and open and accessible to those across generations - interfaith block parties will greatly benefit the entire community.","The Founder of Holy Ghost Global is a member of the Interfaith Religious Council's Future50, a select number of Los Angeles' top faith leaders. This organization is committed to promoting peace and harmony across faiths in Los Angeles and have pledged to support any project that members of the Future50 cohort implement. There has been a collaboration with the USC Office of Religious Life for several years for Holy Ghost Global projects and they are a wonderful flag-bearer for relevant, faith-based expression. As the largest private employer in Los Angeles, having USC involved offers an unprecedented reach across the Los Angeles community. Because many of its faculty and student body are proclaimers of faith, they are a wonderful symbol for the power of faith to do good in our city and across the world. The New Theological Seminary of the West, the newest Christian seminary in Los Angeles, is a great partner for unifying and mobilizing the Los Angeles Christian community. Because they are less traditional in structure, they afford the ability to connect with houses of faith. American Jewish University is another potential supporter along with dozens of places of worship across Los Angeles. 
 
 The company Visual.ly will support the project through info graphics and other promotional materials. 
 
 The first factor that is critical to the success of this collaboration is a willingness to work across faiths and with others from different backgrounds. No prejudices, superiority complexes, or hidden agendas allowed! There must be a real openness to learn and listen from others, to look through different lenses and perspectives, and to experiment and set aside assumptions like a scientist. 
 
 The second factor is innovative use of resources and outreach strategies. Translating techniques through social media to reach immigrant populations and non-English speakers, willingness to try bold approaches to connect with local places of faith, savvy use of film and media, and access to celebrities, faith leaders, and other successful individuals will be required to drive attendance to the events. 
 
 The third factor is availability and boldness. Anyone involved should be available to knock on doors, make calls, and attend the actual block parties. In many ways, this is like a series of campaigns for God in Los Angeles. Partners need to be comfortable with their faith, not on the fence, and be willing to stand up and share it with the world!",1,

 EDUCATION: We will focus on high-tech skills-based education. We will provide classes and workshops in coding, app development, robotics, product design, 3D printing, prototyping, web development, graphic design, entrepreneurship and business plan formation. 
 
 MENTORSHIP: We will provide a forum for mentorship between local aspiring entrepreneurs and experienced business experts. Through will.i.am’s support, our team is well-connected to the worlds of entertainment, technology, philanthropy, and investment not just in Los Angeles but on an international level. We can attract world-class experts to share their knowledge with our i.am Makers. 
 
 CREATIVE SPACE: Our space will be a creative studio that fosters local innovation. We will provide coworking space to locally-focused startups, as well as studio space to promising local artists and artisans. We will also dedicate space for K-12 students to play and learn through STEM activities, host several neighborhood FIRST robotics teams, and host hackathons. It will be a space for the cross-pollination of ideas that leads to innovation. 
 
 OPPORTUNITY: We aim to create a network of skilled professionals who are capable of creating jobs in tech and startups, not just in Boyle Heights but for the entire city of Los Angeles.","An i.am Makerspace in Boyle Heights will benefit ALL of Los Angeles, not just the east side. 
 
 Here’s why: 
 
 This space improves the creative ecosystem for the entire city of Los Angeles, by fostering a larger and more diverse pool of entrepreneurial talent. The future needs solutions that involve innovation from everyone.
 
 This space will foster entrepreneurship in a struggling community that is burdened with crime, violence, and unemployment. By providing education and opportunity, we will empower local residents to gain the high-demand and high-paying skills needed to work in tech, or even create their own tech companies.
 
 This has a halo effect on many other factors. Not only could it boost the local economy, creating jobs for local young people, but they will also be more likely to stay in the neighborhoods and continue to improve them. It could reduce crime and violence, and increase safety in these struggling neighborhoods and surrounding areas. 
 
 Our mission is for the i.am Makerspace to be a model for other similar communities around the world.","Our most immediate goal is serving the people of Boyle Heights and surrounding neighborhoods. We want to turn Boyle Heights into a model community, with ideas and practices that could be adapted by similar underserved neighborhoods around the country. 
 
 Boyle Heights is a working-class, mostly immigrant, youthful neighborhood of almost 100,000 residents. The district has over 20 public schools, many of which have a reputation of being “dropout factories.” Just 5% of Boyle Heights residents aged 25 and older had earned a four-year degree by 2000, an abysmally low percentage for the city. 
 
 The conditions are grim for the youth of Boyle Heights, so we aim to serve primarily students and young adults including: 
 - K-12 students 
 - Young adults (18-30) who are not in college or have 4-year degrees
 - Recent graduates who are struggling to find jobs 
 - Veterans 
 - Local makers, artisans, and artists","The i.am.angel Foundation has existing partnerships with leading tech companies and organizations, who are all ready to expand and take our programs to the next level. Here are some of our confirmed collaborators who have an excellent track record of supporting creators: 
 
 FIRST Robotics: FIRST Robotics is the premier, international robotics competition for K-12 students founded by inventor Dean Kamen. i.am.angel recently founded and sponsored the first ever FIRST Robotics team at Roosevelt High School, and we have the structure and fundraising power to sponsor and support several more teams in Boyle Heights and surrounding neighborhoods.

4102102,Trail City LA: Connecting the city through a community authored network of digitally enabled trails.,To create a web-based tool for collective authoring of digitally-enhanced urban walking trails in partnership with LA-based community groups,Connect,2014044,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050connect/projects/trailcity.html,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,"A city-wide, community-based urban trails authoring platform. This web-based tool enables community organizations, interest groups, and the public to create a network of connected trails revealing new perspectives on LA and its people. Accessible as a mobile website the resulting web of walking paths and site specific content enable engagement with the city’s past, present, and future.
  
 Creation of this community-supplied, location-based content experienced when walking stimulates discovery and promote new forms of collaborative, self-reflexive, space-oriented storytelling.
  
 The city becomes an open walkable book, an exploratory public space archive, a playful gallery about itself. Let’s fill it with content and narratives that connect us","Employing participatory design approaches, our experienced UCLA-based creative team will build a web-based trail creation tool utilizing an iterative process that includes an ongoing dialogue with a core set of diverse community stakeholders. Participants will design trails while the technology is being developed, using prototypes, while outlining the features that will best enable them to construct meaningful urban walking experiences. Our confirmed community collaborators (LA Commons, CityLife-LA, and Franklin High School’s Arroyo Seco Academy) represent a diversity of perspectives and geographies in the city. To ground and enrich the development experience, each group will be tasked with creating a neighborhood-based interactive trail expressive of their own collective identity. Each group will also be asked to consider the possible thematic interconnections with the other groups and connect to each others' trails.
 
 A strong foundation for Trail City LA exists through our recent project at the Los Angeles State Historic Park (LASHP). Inspired by the work of students from Franklin High School in Highland Park and through collaboration with institutions based in Northeast Downtown LA, the predecessor LASHP Trails project consists of a mobile website experience featuring three loop trails emanating from LASHP. We will draw on this experience and the technology created for the LASHP Trails project to develop an open source toolset allowing for other community organizations and interest groups to generate and interconnect their own trails. In addition, we will expand the successfully designed and tested LASHP Trails user experience to include social media capabilities that enable personalization, annotation, and dialog between users.
 
 In the one year period of LA2050 funding we expect to engage in three cycles of development, community authoring, and navigation experience. This participatory, dialogic process will permit the development of a tool which integrates the real interests and experiences of each layer of future users.
 
 While LASHP Trails focuses on a centralized content archive and a set of predefined paths, Trail City LA will expand the possibilities to an open content/dynamic pathways approach. Each community group will be able to upload their own site-specific media and connect it to related hotspots in the city. Hotspots will initially be able to contain sequences of images and text, but eventually sounds and videos as well.","A “trail” is a rough path worn through woods, mountains, or other geographies. It is also a stream of things--dust, light, people, ideas, memories, stories--that flows behind something moving. We embrace both of these meanings, asking Angelenos to blaze new trails by examining the flow of history and experience that surrounds us all. By sharpening our sensory experience, opening ourselves to our surroundings, and unearthing the stories embedded in the world around us, we can learn to be present, engaged, and connected with our communities. Trail City LA encourages users to break with their everyday relationship to space, challenging them to open their minds and bodies to the wealth of culture hidden in plain sight.
 
 We are building a platform through which Angelenos can connect to each other through the medium of place. To author a trail is to embed stories and ideas in space, transforming the seemingly mundane into material for dialogue and creative thinking.
 
 Our proposal is an opportunity to invite new members, youth in particular, into existing community groups, sustain their interest, scaffold their participation, and support the development of a critical understanding of community issues and relate them to larger political and institutional arrangements. Our collaborative work with diverse community groups on the creation of a trail authoring platform ensures a truly user-generated and user-friendly tool which will allow community groups to creatively express their perspective on Los Angeles, furthering their understanding of the world around them and their agency within it. Users will emerge as neighborhood advocates, rooted in their communities and empowered by the interactive public demonstration of their research and their creativity.
 
 Through Trail City, Los Angeles will be a living laboratory, vibrating with the voices and forms of its past, present, and potential future. Our dream outcome of Angelenos’ collective use of the trail authoring platform is the entire city connected through a web of community-authored content. It is a dynamic network of nodal content dancing within Los Angeles, turning any walk into a trail. A trail that is not static, but alive and awaiting your input or augmentation. We believe the best way to connect with the city is on two feet, Trail City LA will be a powerful tool for encouraging walking as an exploratory activity and enhancing our connection to place through engagement and creativity.","We are building a tool that will benefit all Angelenos. Once built, the trail authoring platform could be used by high school history teachers as part of class assignments: “let’s build trails that encourage our fellow students to walk to school while exposing them to the unique stories of our neighborhood’s past” or “lets interview our community elders and build trails connecting their stories”. Urban planners could broaden community participation in the planning process by asking stakeholders to build trails that reveal the aspects they love about their neighborhood, but also its challenges. The planners themselves could build trails which explain their priorities and expertise. The trail authoring platform is a way to connect ideas and dialogue with movement through physical space. It is a tool that, once built, can be appropriated for an endless array of uses, all of which will contribute to the making of Trail City.
 
 Trail City LA is an open toolset. By embracing the power of place and encouraging engagement with the here and now, the platform allows a dynamic and flexible authoring environment that can serve many different purposes and simultaneously enable connectivity among an amazing diversity of interests and approaches. Just about any community organization, interest group, cultural institution, or educational project will be able to use Trail City in its own unique, self-empowering, and engaging way.
 
 During the next year of development, our collaborating community groups and the communities they represent will benefit the most from our project. These groups will be integral members of the team that is creating the technology; their ideas and experience building trails will be integrated into the design/structure of the technology itself. Through the collective process of building trails, participants will deeply consider their connections to place in Los Angeles. They will closely investigate their surroundings and their identity within them. All trails will be publicly available, providing an empowering venue for expressing the groups’ unique perspectives.
 
 We are building a tool for the active creation of trails, but our project also benefits all physically present Angelenos who would like to experience the urban walks created by others. By encouraging Angelenos to walk and exposing them to hidden, place-based content and narratives we are benefiting all Angelenos who want to live in a livable, connected, and socially just city.","Successful collaboration with our partners requires a genuine participatory design process, of which we identify three critical factors:
 1) A dynamic and consistent participation, not only by the leadership of each collaborating group, but most importantly by their target neighborhood constituency.
 2) Facilitation of creativity that our collaborators find to be significant and truly reflective of their communities' unique identities. 
 3) Production of a tool that is broad and inclusive, reflecting the amazing diversity of our city.
 
 We are collaborating with a select group of community organizations that share our passion for creating a more walkable, civically engaged, and equitable Los Angeles. All of the collaborators identified have confirmed their participation.
 
 LA Commons works to enhance Angelenos’ connection to place through highly visible public art projects that tell dynamic neighborhood stories. In a previous project with LA Commons we engaged a group of high school students from Highland Park to explore unfamiliar neighborhoods, collect images, and create interactive maps sharing their findings. LA Commons brings experience leading walking tours and connections to many different communities around the city such as Leimert Park, MacArthur Park, and East Hollywood.
 
 CityLife works with young people from diverse backgrounds, utilizing the arts to explore culture, history, and politics in Los Angeles. In the Spring of 2013 we collaborated with CityLife, then based at Lincoln High School, in a National Science Foundation funded project that employed participatory design to build a tool for authoring “CyberMurals”: physically interactive digital murals that change based on conceptual parameters. CityLife brings an expertise in working with youth to explore urban issues and deep ties to the neighborhood of Lincoln Heights and Downtown more broadly.
 
 We are particularly excited to be continuing our collaboration with Franklin High School’s Arroyo Seco Academy, because it was the work of their students in 2010 that inspired the Trail City LA concept. Assisted by staff from the National Parks Service, Franklin students designed 30 unique trails that required them to conduct in-depth and on-site research. The trail program has continued each year since then and our trail authoring platform will enhance the process they have already developed and enable the trails they create to contain dynamic media content and reach a wide audience.",
4102105,Los Angeles Free Income Tax Project,Bringing $46 million back to low-income working families in Los Angeles through volunteer-driven free tax preparation services.,Connect,2014045,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050connect/projects/FREETAXPREP.html,,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,"Did you know that thousands of volunteers throughout the United States drive one of the most effective anti-poverty strategies in the country? Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program utilizes IRS trained and certified volunteers to provide free income tax filing to low- and moderate-income taxpayers, connecting these working families with deductions and refundable tax credits without losing a single cent to tax preparation fees. In our vision of a civically engaged and connected Los Angeles in 2050, Koreatown Youth and Community Center (KYCC) will work with schools, corporations, nonprofit organizations and government entities to build a VITA collaborative in Los Angeles and work with over 500 volunteers for the 2015 tax season.","KYCC has been a successful VITA provider since 2006, serving over 20,000 low-income families throughout Central Los Angeles and returning more than $17.5 million in refunds back to the families that we serve. Although these are impressive numbers, there is more that KYCC can and will do. In Los Angeles County, there were 2.6 million tax returns filed with the IRS in 2012. Among them, 28.13% were self prepared, 70.28% were paid prepared, and 1.56% were volunteer prepared. The last figure is telling. Of all of the taxpayers eligible for free VITA services in Los Angeles County, only 1.56% took advantage of the program. Why is this the case? Unlike San Francisco or New York where there are coordinated VITA infrastructures, Los Angeles lacks such coordination. Through our proposed collaborative, KYCC will bring such unified services and structure to the VITA programs throughout Los Angeles County.
 
 Most importantly, KYCC will implement a coordinated volunteer management program with our VITA collaborative. First, KYCC and the collaborative will coordinate the recruitment of volunteers by working with local schools such as UCLA Extension and Cal State Long Beach, local banks and other corporations, youth, and retirees. Second, once volunteers have committed to work with VITA, KYCC will coordinate the training. IRS requires VITA volunteers to receive tax preparation trainings. KYCC will provide both online and in-class training opportunities. The VITA collaborative partners will also be trained and in turn provide training to volunteers who come to their organizations. Third, KYCC and the VITA collaborative will manage the assignment of volunteer opportunities with trained volunteers. In the past, some VITA sites had an over abundance of volunteers while other sites had tremendous difficulty even finding one. By recruiting volunteers from throughout Los Angeles County, KYCC will facilitate placement of volunteers at sites near where they work, live or play, reducing some of the barriers to volunteering. Finally, the volunteer retention strategy for KYCC and the VITA collaborative is based on ensuring that volunteers are supported, guided and engaged consistently throughout all VITA sites. In addition to adequate training, KYCC and the VITA collaborative will ensure that all logistics are prepared for volunteers to do their work without interruptions or distractions (e.g., appointment scheduling, adequate staff presence, necessary technology and supplies).","Envision a Los Angeles where Angelenos care about one another – today and in 2050. Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program is about more than free tax preparation. Volunteers who commit to VITA go through rigorous training and dedicate many hours from January to April to work with low-income working families, helping them connect with hundreds and thousands of dollars in refunds that not only help the families financially but also feed the local economy. By inspiring over 500 volunteers to commit to VITA in 2015, KYCC will begin the process of bringing a culture of compassion and helping one another to Los Angeles. Through our VITA collaborative’s volunteer program, each VITA volunteer will know the impact that they are making in the lives of each of the low-income, working families who receive VITA services. For example, each volunteer will learn that, in 2014, VITA volunteers completed 44,575 tax returns in Los Angeles County for a refund of almost $46 million back to our families (and the local economy). Volunteers will feel good about the difference that they are making in the lives of their neighbors and continue to make VITA an annual volunteer commitment. 
 
 By 2050, the work and dedication begun by the first 500 VITA volunteers in 2015 will have made an impact in Los Angeles and the decades of fostering a culture of compassion and helping one another will have born fruit. Each year following 2015, KYCC will have increased the number of Angelenos volunteering with VITA, and that means more and more low-income, working families eligible for VITA services will have known about it and have taken advantage of the free tax preparation. In turn, that means that the amount of refunds to our families each year will have exceeded the $46 million returned in 2014 and that more eligible working families will have received the Earned Income Tax Credit. And by receiving larger refunds including the EITC, research indicates that children of such recipients do better in school, are likelier to attend college, and earn more as adults. All these benefits will also spur spending and development in our local economy. Finally, with more volunteers each year, the VITA collaborative will add new partner organizations and grow into a stronger network. So by 2050, through KYCC’s VITA collaborative, Angelenos of different socioeconomic backgrounds will have come together to help one another and to develop a sense that we are all Angelenos.","KYCC and our VITA collaborative will directly benefit low- and very low-income residents of Los Angeles, who are oftentimes linguistically isolated (monolingual Spanish, Korean or Chinese speakers) or have other barriers (cultural, educational, etc.) hindering access to basic and/or mainstream financial services. For example, KYCC and our partner VITA organizations work primarily within Los Angeles’ low-income areas such as Koreatown, Boyle Heights, East Los Angeles, South Los Angeles, Chinatown, El Sereno, and Lincoln Heights. These areas are home primarily to a majority of Latino residents as well as other immigrant groups such as Koreans and Chinese; as immigrant communities, many of these residents speak little to no English and have difficulty accessing mainstream services such as banking and even government benefits. Additionally, these neighborhoods tend to have much higher poverty rate than the rest of Los Angeles County. For example, in Koreatown, the estimated median household income in 2008 was $27,438 with 45% of residents falling below the federal poverty line. In Boyle Heights, for another example, the family poverty level is nearly three times the state average (28.4% vs. 9.8%) with high incidences of foreclosures and low homeownership rates compared with Los Angeles County (23% vs. 47.8%). Moreover, City of Los Angeles FamilySource Centers are located in the most economically distressed areas of the city and specifically provide comprehensive academic and economic development services to low-income residents of those areas. Overall, most of the residents are working poor that live paycheck to paycheck and are not ready for any financial emergencies. 
 
 In addition, KYCC’s VITA collaborative will specifically benefit working low-income families in Los Angeles County who fail to claim Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) refunds every year. According to the New America Foundation, EITC is widely regarded as the nation’s most effective and efficient anti-poverty program. But in Los Angeles County, the IRS estimates that 21% of all eligible families who qualify for EITC do not file a federal tax return to claim the credit. That means residents are leaving behind at least $300 million in EITC in Los Angeles County each year. That is money that could have helped low-income families save for emergencies, pay for higher education or child care, and many other things to improve their lives.","For 2015 and beyond, KYCC will lead a VITA collaborative with Chinatown Service Center (CSC), East LA Community Corporation (ELACC), Mexican American Opportunity Foundation (MAOF), Children’s Institute (CII), and 19 City of Los Angeles FamilySource Centers (FSCs). This collaborative is confirmed, and we have been working together as an informal VITA collaborative for the past few years.
 
 Each VITA partner organization brings its cultural and linguistic capacity to serve low-income, linguistically isolated populations. Culturally, immigrant communities are very reluctant to seek help, even if they are eligible for it (either government or social support services). The decades of service provided by KYCC, CSC, ELACC, MAOF, CII and FSCs within their communities have enabled each organization to build trust and good reputation necessary to lower barriers for clients to seek out our assistance. Together, the collaborative has the cultural, linguistic and organizational capacity to provide high quality VITA programs to a very large number of clients in the Latino, Korean, and Chinese communities – more than other nonprofits in the greater Los Angeles area. Very few organizations offer free tax preparation for Korean and Chinese communities and none has the same volume capacity and longstanding successful track record as KYCC and CSC. In addition, our sites are located centrally to the geographic areas where these immigrant communities meet and congregate, and these areas are easily accessible by public transportation – further lowering barriers for accessing our programs. 
 
 Finally, three factors critical to the success of KYCC’s VITA collaborative include (1) buy-in from each organization, (2) effective volunteer engagement and (3) ability to sync with other anti-poverty initiatives. Although KYCC has been working informally with the partner organizations, each VITA partner’s commitment to the collaborative is key. Moreover, volunteers are the most important component of VITA services since they provide the actual tax preparation that brings refunds and credits back to our low-income communities. To ensure that volunteers enjoy their experience, the VITA collaborative must provide effective volunteer management. Finally, VITA services alone cannot combat poverty in Los Angeles. The collaborative must partner with other anti-poverty initiatives in the city such as the Mayor’s Working Families, City of Los Angeles Office of Financial Empowerment, and others.",

 LA Bike Trains are regular group rides along the safest routes, led by trained 'conductors.' But it gets better. We've built in education, rider support and are working on a mobile app to become a major transportation alternative and ""first mile/last mile"" solution. Everyone wants to “beat the traffic” or avoid parking and L.A. Bike Trains is a fun solution that’s easy to talk about or participate in","#1 Promotion: print materials, signage and traditional media

 #3 Create new routes based on need as determined by the Commuter Survey http://labiketrains.com/commuter-survey/
 #4 Connect current efforts into a web based (mobile) app that suggests routes at all times and provides real-time tracking of live routes for anyone to ""hop on/hop off.""
 #5 Connect LA Bike Trains to major educational and employment organizations to help facilitate bicycling to major commuter destinations.
 
 Right now we have the benefit of being almost 2(!) years old. We've got a solid team, program and lots of community support - even internationally! Cities from San Francisco to London have asked ""how do you do it? We want Bike Trains in our city!"" But even in LA few people who would benefit the most have heard of us or know how we can make their commute and their life better. 
 
 We also need a huge increase in commuter survey responses. The tactic we've taken is that in addition to our own collection, we are working with major transportation and city agencies to get access to their data as well. 
 
 Everything is about breaking down barriers - from helping people learn how to safely and comfortably bike commute on their own or with us. No topic is too silly; most are worried about sweating and not looking professional enough, or too serious.. we are always addressing safety and helping people get over real safety concerns. We do that by showing up, running on time and being generous with everything we know. 
 
 Being an LA Bike Trains conductor is a big job and only the most kind hearted, energetic and wonderful people can do it. Conductors are unpaid volunteers who spend a lot of time making sure their communication is great, that riders feel safe and have a good time and participate in any number of other development or advocacy work. 
 
 That means that even beyond the Bike Trains, we're developing an incredible volunteer network across Los Angeles. After primary conductors, we have 'back up' conductors. We are always looking for volunteer web/mobile developers, event coordinators, community organizers, educators and happy people. Right now our volunteer list is 100+ strong and growing.
 
 We've got an unreleased app 'beta' but we need funding and specific development talent to get it to the point where we can release it into the wilds of LA city streets safely.","Today, L.A. Bike Trains is a novel approach using a fun social experience to educate Angelinos about bicycles for transportation. We primarily address crude concerns, from safety fears to a total lack of knowledge on how to navigate the city without a car and what stuff is needed. We answer a lot of the same questions again, and again. All of these questions can be found online, but we have discovered that the most important element in creating behavior change is emotional, via 1:1 human experience. We provide that and inspiration for taking the next steps.
 
 We’re also at an exciting intersection – helping define what multi-modal transportation looks like. From using our experience to assist with Open Streets events, collaborate with major transportation/urban development projects and the creation of innovative bike friendly routes via a mobile app… there’s no limit to where we can grow in the future.
 
 Right now the biggest need is basic education and advocating for infrastructure developments, while creating an authentic bicycle culture that makes Angelinos more resilient. As infrastructure improves and social acceptance of bicycling for transport gains, we’ll be able to focus on bicycle specific innovation within LA’s ever changing urban transit mix. Having built a massive network of volunteers, participants, collaborators and channels of communication we’ll be able to facilitate an evolution that may bring us to work more closely with mass transit, urban planning, the bicycle industry itself or any number of potential avenues.
 
 What doesn’t change between now and 2050 is our commitment to using the bicycle as the greatest tool we have for connecting individuals and communities in Los Angeles. The bicycle is a great equalizer between rich and poor, languages and backgrounds. Transportation equality and access is one of the greatest projects the city must undertake to allow all of its’ citizens access to educational, recreation and occupational opportunity.","Like most start-up projects, we’ve had to begin in communities that are naturally receptive to what we’re doing. It’s no surprise that we’re popular in the young, affluent and very Caucasian neighborhood of Silverlake, but the real promise is in the Latino communities of East LA and beyond. Reaching diverse and low income populations – the ones who stand to gain the most from this project – requires a lot more effort. From being able to faithfully offer communication, assistance and service in multiple languages. It’s also important to have the resources necessary to reach those populations in meaningful ways. 
 
 In more affluent neighborhoods we can simply promote online and begin rides at local cafes. In traditionally poor neighborhoods, the barriers are much higher. That means we need to spend a lot more time and money to bring the same spirit of service; by providing free coffee at a local park and being present at community events. Conductors bear a huge responsibility, not only in taking on the responsibility and potential liability of leading regular rides, but also educating, encouraging and connecting people to a broader community, bicycling resources and providing an empathetic window into what their specific neighborhood requires to become receptive to community adoption of a ‘bike train.’
 
 Too many projects attempt to reach out to Spanish speaking community by simply offering a website in Spanish. We understand that we need to be able to fully support communities that are predominantly Spanish speaking. That means working with existing groups, recruiting existing leaders and research into what is most needed. Having the time, thoughtfulness and creativity to bridge the project into a different framework is how we plan to be successful in positively impacting divers populations in Los Angeles. Incremental, rather than blanket progress. To do that faithfully it has to happen organically and that is extremely difficult to predict.
 
 L.A. Bike Trains is in the position to most positively impact disadvantaged and low-income communities. By making the bicycle (often in combination with public transport) a reliable and desirable transportation option, individuals stand to gain mobility, save a significant percentage of their income and begin to solve some of the most pressing health issues seriously affecting low-income populations. We address this goal through an all-inclusive, holistic approach.","· Los Angeles County Bicycle Coalition

 These organizational collaborators range from organizations that we can rely on to help us promote our work to their audiences, to those that provide more in-depth assistance with knowledge or professional connections to being able to support us financially or with ‘in-kind’ donations. These are the organizations that are our “first tier” whenever we need anything or just want to explore possibilities.
  
 The primary collaborations that we want to develop are with university bicycle coalitions. A successful test run and development of 2 new routes going to UCLA was launched during bike week May 2014. We now want to deepen that relationship so that more staff and students will utilize L.A. Bike Trains as their transportation resource. L.A. Bike Trains would like UCLA to support those routes via funding, promotion and technical assistance – such as data collection and research.

Phones are their Internet! Out the Window will foster a multi-directional nexus of ideas, images and thought-based entertainment accessible to nearly all, regardless of economic status, neighborhood of residence or cultural affiliation. Functioning across social media and “live” screenings on the buses, a powerful and almost infinitely expandable vector for vital dialogs by, about and in Los Angeles will be created. 
  
 In 2013-14 Out the Window presented videos, (6 per week) each with an open-ended, pointed question in English and Spanish to which viewers responded via social media. In 2015 Freewaves will spearhead a multicultural, multi-aesthetic, county-wide coalition to bring a little media sunshine to all L.A. Metro buses. These videos will be: 
  • 1/3 by artists on the full breadth of issues of concern to them; 
  • 1/3 about community health such as access to nutritious food,  obesity amelioration, and promotion of healthful lifestyles; 
  • 1/3 about other issues, such as environmental, educational and social, produced by LA nonprofit organizations; 
  • heavily represented with creative videos by LA youth enrolled in video programs;
  • available for viewing on out-the-window.org and Freewaves’ Facebook page daily for viewers’ comments and sharing. 
 
 Out the Window uses Transit TV’s video system on all 2,000 L.A. Metro buses, reaching Los Angeles’s residents with creative and essential messages while providing free culture on the largest art distribution system in the country to the nation’s most populous county. 
 
 This program is ready to be fully established this year. It launched in 2010 with a MacArthur grant; it tested technologies, networks, programming, and surveyed viewers in 2011. It gathered resources in 2012 and now is ready to expand with all elements in place!","Today: 
  • Create a network of video across the County.
  • Communication of urgent and long-term issues in hard to reach communities.
  • Develop an interactive video and social media network.
 
 2050
  • Firmly establish a cohesive system in which community members and artists can exchange visual ideas, images and information impacting life in Los Angeles County.
 • Creation of a network capable of adapting to the quickly  evolving platforms and aesthetics of social media and image- making.
  • Add to the cool factor of riding the bus. 
 
 Art is passing from isolation, to intervention, to participation, to engagement, to a glorious ubiquity in which currently accepted and recognized disciplines and aesthetics evolve into new forms of public communication. With the blazingly fast developments in technology, we have witnessed an integration of disciplines, in which computing and telecommunication devices have fostered a new hybrid of public and private art, one that, by 2050, will have taken forms beyond prediction. Art will be everywhere, an integrated member of society for all. 
 
 Out the Window will play a significant role in that evolution, hastening the democratization of art and communication through its daily dissemination to the bus riding public and, in the future, to other constituencies whose daily lives bring them into contact with videos, mobile devices and means of sound and image distribution birthed by today’s technologies.","Out the Window will reach a bus riding demographic that is 66% Latino, equally divided in gender, 50% under 30 and 66% low income. Freewaves current web activities reach an international core of media artists, aficionados, curiosity seekers and curators seeking the latest in artist-made videos. Out the Window will democratize that web to input from a demographic rarely included in the media world’s discussions, to the benefit of all. 
 
 Freewaves’ Multicultural Curatorial Process brings together media artists and activists from many of the County’s diverse arts and media organizations, plus independent artists and curators from diverse social, economic, ethnic, sexual orientation, aesthetic and age demographics. This has been made possible by Freewaves’ 25-year commitment to an all-inclusive media democracy, created and maintained by vigorous, ongoing outreach throughout our community. 
 
 Freewaves is no newcomer to outreach through media arts. In 2001, as part of its festival, it produced three half-hour educational videos, elucidating media arts in Los Angeles over the last ten years from Freewaves’ perspective. These documentaries aired on KCET-TV at the beginning and middle of the festival, providing audiences and students with background material for the festival. These programs were also donated to 250 high school art and media teachers throughout the Los Angeles Unified School District and the 75 Los Angeles City and County libraries. Curriculum Guides were written to facilitate classroom presentations by teachers. 
 
 Freewaves also responds to its constituencies’ needs with ongoing workshops designed to bring technology to media artists and activists in underserved communities. In 1999, the fruits of its workshops in Internet use and web design premiered on dozens of artists’ and arts organization web sites throughout the region. Along with the workshops, technical support facilitated their going on line and, if desired, they also received a free web site and eMail accounts for one year.","Freewaves will continue its partnership with Transit TV whose video monitors display a continuous one-hour loop on all L.A. Metro buses. Transit TV is in contract with Metro through 2015.

4102109,Arts & Culture Infrastructure Initiative,"Our Arts and Culture Infrastructure Initiative strengthens support for the arts community with a focus on diversity, inclusion and access.",Create,2014048,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050create/projects/infrastructure.html,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,All of LA County,"1. Arts & Business Conduit/Network
 We will serve as the conduit between the arts and business community. Referencing our studies of cultural board participation, we will approach and build relationships with the top fifty institutions with demonstrated arts board participation. We will interview key leadership and corporate social responsibility officers on their formal and informal board placement, leadership development and community outreach strategies. Our goal is for the talented employees of top industries in the region to be trained about arts board service and to be placed with a cultural organization that matches their interests and expands their understanding of the cultural infrastructure of Greater Los Angeles. Engaging Angelenos with cultural board service by itself is not enough. We will create ongoing networks between board members at cultural organizations for mutual support (similar to support networks in other fields) through surveys, communications, convenings and networking events. Arts non-profits often run into challenges that their boards do not have knowledge to combat, and many feel at a loss on how to effectively address this issue. By creating networks between board members — including mentor-mentee relationships and periodic gatherings of board members/board chairs, etc. — major decision-making challenges can be addressed with the knowledge base and community support of leaders from across the region. Additionally, we will contract Arts for LA to provide their nationally recognized advocacy-training academy for our Board network to amplify the reach of nonprofit arts organizations throughout the region.
 
 2. Region-wide Arts Fund 
 We will develop a plan to create a region-wide Arts Fund through workplace giving, employee-driven corporate sponsorship support, individual donations from high-net-worth individuals and crowd sourced methodologies. By engaging with the businesses of Greater LA through the Board Placement and Development process, we expect that many LA citizens will be identified who are interested in the cultural landscape of LA, but who are not in a place to engage immediately through Board service. This component of the program will provide a pathway for those who want to support the LA cultural infrastructure without board service. The funds raised will be distributed through an inclusive re-granting to support parts of LA’s cultural landscape that are often overlooked or underfunded.","In the short term, our project enables stronger and more connected boards of directors of arts nonprofits in the region. The United Arts Fund approach will identify and distribute new grants dollars into the arts ecosystem, allowing for a deepening of support for current working artists.
 In terms of LA in 2050:
 1) Multi-use community arts centers exist in every neighborhood with multi-lingual, around-the-clock programs composed of participatory, professionally produced, or presented productions
 2) The LA region enjoys the highest per capita investment in the arts from Government, Individuals AND the Corporate Sector.
 3) Business leaders from every sector are clamoring to join Arts and Culture Nonprofit Boards – Arts groups enjoy a waiting list for potential Board members.
 4) All artists are making a living wage.
 5) Artists of every discipline are in residence at the top 200 businesses in the region and every major municipal agency.
 6) Low income residents enjoy free access to and feel welcomed at any arts experience they choose at all arts organization in the region.
 
 The Board and Giving networks will become a core group of LA’s ecology and civic engagement that engagement will become a given. Once you reach a certain level of career progression in any field in Los Angeles, it will be socially presumed that you join your peers in Board service within LA’s cultural nonprofit sector.
 
 After 30+ years of these mutually beneficial relationships taking root, it will be hard to see where ‘for profit’ businesses end and ‘nonprofit’ organizations begin. You will find more for- and non-profit businesses fusing into cooperative ventures beyond sharing board members. For example, it will become a standard practice for arts experiences to be incorporated into the business activities of a store or restaurant.
 
 Participation in our Regional Arts Fund will be so commonplace that it will feel like a tithing at church to all those above the poverty line in the region.
 
 Los Angeles will be known as the Cultural Capital of America — the ‘Creative Powerhouse’- where a vast economy is driven by creative activities at every level; where business acumen is tightly woven with art to reach higher levels of community impact and artistry. New generations of cultural innovation will springboard from LA. The best and brightest minds of Los Angeles will collaborate effortlessly, propel our region forward, and help the LA arts sector grow economically and culturally.","Our project benefits all of Los Angeles by enabling a stronger, more robust arts and culture sector, contributing to the quality of life, economic vitality and social connectedness of the region; making LA the best play to CREATE, LEARN, PLAY and CONNECT. Specifically, our project will directly improve the lives of artists, volunteers and arts administrators by fortifying their foundation of support within the communities they serve.
 
 We seek to ensure a robust and diverse constituent base with programs and services that meet their needs and allow them to further connect with their audiences. We see a gap between those performing arts organizations who are reaching underserved communities and/or communities of color and our current roster of programming. Our goal is to refocus our efforts to ensure greater access to the arts while enabling a more diverse and inclusive group of organizations benefitting from our services. To accomplish this we will leverage our Arts Census, which contains arts participation information on nearly four million unique households provided by nearly 400 local arts organizations.
 
 This work will leverage our NEA and LA County Arts Commission grants focusing on training and networking the boards of our local companies around issues of diversity, inclusion and access while strengthening our tech infrastructure to support increased access to the arts. The technology focus will look at modeling the access initiative of Theater Development Fund as a model to extend our discount ticket program to underserved audiences throughout the region. The Inclusion aspect will look at services to the field provided by Culture Works in Philadelphia as a model for programmatic efficiencies and sustainability. We anticipate that this committee will also provide a blueprint with best practices and recommendations to the community to address issues of Diversity among boards, administration, artists and audiences throughout the region.","As an alliance, we exist through partnership and collaboration. We’ll activate the 1000+ arts organizations we currently serve and develop this initiative with our local, regional and national partner organizations who work in this connectivity-collaboration space, including the LA Chamber of Commerce, Arts for LA, municipal cultural agencies, arts funders, service providers and others. We will also leverage individuals serving on cultural boards and the networks of philanthropists and business leaders who support the cultural life of Los Angeles. We have strong relationships with national partners who have encouraged us to pursue this Initiative including both Americans for the Arts (their network of Arts & Business Councils, Business Committees for the Arts and United Arts Funds) and National Arts Strategies, which develops non-profit arts leaders. As previously mentioned, we have confirmed with the staff of Arts for LA that, if funded, we would contract with them to provide advocacy training over a six-month period with our Board Network.",1,
4102111,Liberate Arts! Intersect Our Communities! Create a Liberation Arts Institute to make our own stories,CREATE Liberation Arts Institute to strategically support use of Liberation Arts among progressive organizations & to intersect communities,Create,2014049,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050create/projects/LACECenter.html,,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,Downtown- Skid Row Community; Watts and surrounding unincorporated regions,"LACE Center currently has 4 community partners, and is developing one more: 
 GENDER JUSTICE LA (a transgender rights and racial justice organization)
 TRUST SOUTH LA (a community land trust for affordable housing) 
 CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL (Mar Vista Gardens in Culver City, a continuation high school) 
 CHANGING WAYS (a theatre troupe of ex-lifers and formerly incarcerated youth workers).
 Each partner represents a different underheard experience in L.A., and each voice is represented on a Planning Team body that guides the path of the LACE Center. Each of these sites has ongoing Liberation Arts programs, and each program reaches different communities. For developing a LACE Institute, we are also partnered with Dignity and Power Now’s Freedom Harvest Arts Collective to gain from their experience of community curriculum development (Dandelions Rising Institute, #riseofthedandelions art series). Our primary team is made of 15 people, mostly from these organizations, who will carry out visioning, planning, logistically organizing, and team management as our Planning and Curriculum (PC) Team. 
 
 1) MONTH 1: SOLIDIFY PLANNING AND CURRICULUM (PC) TEAM, made of members and leaders from community partner organizations, community-based artists & educators, and other stakeholders as defined by our Planning Team.
 
 2) MONTH 2: PLAN CURRICULUM AND GROUP PRIORITIES We have a couple classes in motion already, with a couple in progress. Theatre of the Oppressed Theory and Praxis Class (led by Brent Blair), and Playback Theatre Class (led by Joyce Lu), which will begin this fall, the PC Team will pick 2 other classes to be taught on a biweekly basis, that the PC team will help implement, and potentially teach a 3rd class about strategies.
 
 3) MONTH 2-3: OUTREACH AND ENROLLMENT. Outreach to other progressive and forward-thinking orgs to be students/ co-participants. Our dream is to give some participant stipends so we can enhance working-class cultural work leadership, knowing that many folks cannot prioritize critical art and expressive work due to economic access.
 
 4) MONTHS 3-6, 8-11: IMPLEMENT CLASSES. We will have evaluations after every class so we can stay up-to-date with the needs of the participants. The outcomes for participants will be certificates of completion for each, along with 2 public performances for the year. 
 
 5) MONTHS 7 AND 12: PERFORMANCE AND EVALUATION. Period to assess previous gains, and implement best process for upcoming period.","All humans are creative-- creative arts are a vital way that we can be human. Media and images are all around us-- billboards, magazines, films and music, art is in our consciousness every day, shaped by powerful industries many based in L.A. However, access to creative arts resources is at an all time low among underserved communities-- namely, low-income people of color, LGBT community, immigrant communities, youth and mothers. LAUSD has cut arts funding 76% in the last 5 years, and the industry of Hollywood is inaccessible to the majority of people in L.A.. Many other people (who have access and resource to do so) are telling stories about marginalized people in L.A., people who may have no experience LIVING in these communities, and as such, continue narratives of violence, poverty and trauma. 
 
 At LACE Center, we know that underserved communities are creative and resilient. We are part of these communities. The true stories about us are already there, but how do we learn how to share them with each other? How can we develop our aesthetic around our stories? And ultimately, how do we make systemic change possible through our visions and imaginations? Liberation Arts and Community Engagement (LACE) is not only about art-resources-- it is a path through which we connect our struggles towards collective liberation. The LACE Institute is a way to spread seeds of tools, our communities make up the beautiful branches of experiences, and our visions, work, art make up the fragrance of the fruit and flowers of transformed conditions.
 LACE is playing games to devise theater. LACE is building a collective narrative through poetry lines. LACE is having dialogue not just through debate-like words, but also through embodied images that communicate on multiple layers. LACE Center is conscious of the power structures that exist, and learning how we are not only individually affected, but actually collectively affected. LACE is inclusive, seeking to build leaders in communities that are underrepresented, prioritizing sustainability through stipends. LACE is intersectional, bringing multiple experiences, identities and languages to create together. With LACE multiplied through LA, we will find common language and vision for a new LA in 2050, where play is encouraged, creativity is central to everyone’s daily life, and where we live in community with each other across borders and identities.","Our project will benefit a few regions: Southeast L.A., South L.A., Culver City, Mid-City, Downtown L.A. (specifically Skid Row community). 
 
 Ultimately, LACE Center believes collective liberation is possible, where all people have basic needs met, and are able to grow, learn, thrive, connect, love, and express themselves according to their self-determined ways of being. LACE aims to shape individual and collective consciousness towards building a world that includes many worlds, by resisting oppression through the process of art-making, as well as through the resulting art piece. As such, we see that Liberation Arts and Community Engagement framework is for everyone so we may achieve collective liberation together. 
 
 We are a multi-racial, multi-gendered, multi-generational coalition of artists, organizers, activists, students and educators.
 
 While our vision of collective liberation includes everyone, we also see a dire need for creative resources among particular communities. As such, we see ourselves as filling a gap, so our priorities in terms of the communities we serve will be- low-income communities, African-American communities, Latino communities, Asian Pacific Islander communities, LGBT community (specifically the under-resourced Transgender community), immigrant communities, community-based artists, community organizers, educators in our regions, counselors in our regions. 
 
 We see the impact of this grant reaching well beyond the institute participants. Each participant is part of a larger community, and part of their training is to create a Liberation Arts group in their own community using the skills they have learned in the institute. This allows even broader communities of people to be connected through the LACE Institute. We particular hope that families, classmates, spiritual communities, campaign-based organizations, grassroots organizations, people working in public schools build a firm grasp on Liberation Arts skills through the students/co-participants. 
 
 Our hope is that this project encourages more collaboration and co-investigation of people's conditions. It is important to build the power of local communities in expressive arts, while also connecting people with different experiences. This question ultimately determines the way we decide what and with whom we build. By building a strong core of Liberation Artists from the bottom-up, we see an LA transformed for and by the people who are most affected.","The heart of the LACE Center is collaboration, these are relationships of 2 yrs:
 
 Gender Justice L.A.: Collaboration confirmed, through Theatre of the Oppressed program; GJLA represents the grassroots voice of the transgender and gender non-conforming community in L.A., particularly of trans people of color.
 
 Changing Ways: Confirmed; Represents theatre troupe of ex-lifers, formerly incarcerated peoples with long-term sentences, who work with incarcerated and impacted youth along with outreach to other ex-lifers.
 
 TRUST South L.A.: Confirmed, through their affordable housing campaigns, and Escuelita program; TRUST South LA is a land trust committed to developing affordable housing for South LA residents
 
 Central High School, Mar Vista Gardens site: Confirmed with educator sponsor, Vitaly; Central High School represents low-income youth of color who are excluded from the Culver City School District-- Central is a safe, supportive and self-directed learning environment.
 
 Dignity and Power Now: Confirmed with Freedom Harvest Art Collective program; DPN is an organization fighting for the rights and dignity of people impacted by incarceration, particularly around the L.A. jail system, the world's largest jail. 
 
 Other Partners:
 Southern California Library: Confirmed space for classes in South L.A. and curriculum development support with librarians and historical archives. 
 
 Chucos Justice Center: Space in Inglewood, currently home to Changing Ways.
 
 Asian Americans Advancing Justice: Unconfirmed, Space, through LDIR program
 
 Three things to determining successful collaborations:
 1) Culture of diversity, inclusion, and working through problems. We believe that diversity of experience, language, class, cultural background, gender, race, & age are essential to creating vibrant and effective programs, especially for a landscape of L.A. that holds so many stories. As such, part of our culture is inclusion and working through problems together, knowing there are certain things that we might not agree, but that being together and working through it is the most important.
 
 2) Communication and consensus building. Because we honor so many people's stories, Spanish translation & funds transparency is important. We also work through building consensus so that all voices are heard in decisions
 
 3) Consistency to core vision of collective liberation and generating intersecting spaces to build our stories. Big-picture keeps us united.",1,
4102114,Law Soup LA,Law Soup LA is a web-based resource that provides L.A. County residents with a fun way to understand the law and participate in democracy.,Connect,2014050,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050connect/projects/LawSoupLA.html,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"Law Soup LA is a web-based resource that provides news and information for L.A. County residents and visitors about their legal rights and responsibilities, and empowers the public to participate in the democratic process. Primarily, it involves a website which contains L.A. County focused news stories and blog posts related to law and government; a database of key laws that affect L.A. area residents most, and useful information about such laws; as well as interactive features. One such feature allows users of the site to draft and post a law they believe should be enacted, and others in the community can “like” the proposed law and comment on it. Proposed laws are ranked by ""likes"" and those with the most likes are prominently displayed!","We have already taken preliminary steps to implement the project, including creating a sample of the basic structure of the website and much of the content, and developing a detailed plan to complete the initial implementation. To fully implement the project, we will hire a web designer, a communications/community outreach director, and content editors. We will then finish the initial design and content of the website, and begin outreach, using social media and print media, as well as local events to create buzz about the project. We will continue to add content to the website indefinitely.
 
 Towards the goal of promoting access to justice for all, most of the content will be free and will be easily accessible to anyone who can access an internet connection. The content will be written in an accessible and engaging format, in plain language.
 
 To sustain the project beyond September 2015, advertisements will be displayed, and revenue will be collected from companies or organizations that advertise on the site. We may also later establish a subscription-based portion of the site geared towards professionals, which would provide more extensive information for a small fee.","Law Soup LA will help people quickly understand what the law entitles them to and what the law expects of them, as well as how they can take action to exercise their rights and advocate for an expansion of rights. By providing this information in an easily accessible, fun and engaging way, and empowering people to take part in proposing and advancing their own ideas about laws for their community, the project is likely to have great success in making LA the best place to connect, today and in the future.
 
 People want to participate, but often feel it is difficult to do so when they don’t know the basics, especially when it comes to local government which can be opaque and complex, and receives less coverage by the media. Law Soup LA can quickly get people up to speed, and build community discussions based around facts rather than rhetoric, so that discussions are as civil and productive as possible. While online interaction can be very productive and make people feel connected to the community, we know face to face interaction is even better. Law Soup LA will encourage users to take the conversation offline and to show up at community events and neighborhood council meetings to discuss important issues. 
 
 Also, the website will enable people to be creative and take ownership of their society by proposing their own laws. The feedback they will get from the community will certainly be a great learning experience, and the potential support from the community of one’s proposed laws can truly be an exciting and affirming experience. In addition, the interactive facebook page and twitter account, and other social media will all work towards the goal of engaging with people to help them understand their rights and responsibilities, and to feel connected to their community and their government. 
 
 All of this will help make LA the best place to connect today, and will allow this connectivity to expand over the years, as people become more comfortable and confident with their understanding of the laws and legal and political system. Law Soup LA intends to create the conditions that spawn a new way of thinking that is passed down to future generations, so that by 2050 most people in LA County will have the knowledge and confidence to assert their rights and participate in their communities more fully. 
 
 In addition, the project is designed to be dynamic and self-sustaining to endure through 2050 and beyond.","Law Soup LA is designed to benefit all people within L.A. County, and does so by making its information about the law and government free and accessible to all those who can access an internet connection. However, because lower-income and lesser-educated people often have minimal access to justice and have less information about their rights, Law Soup LA stands to benefit these groups the most.
 
 The project is also designed to benefit society as a whole, so that as people begin to feel more empowered and connected to their community and government, they will be inspired to work to make it a better place. We will continually evaluate the project to ensure that it is indeed benefiting all possible people, and if we find it is not, will make the changes necessary to achieve this goal.","We are open to working with any and all partners who share our values of promoting access to justice and providing accurate, useful legal information to the public.",
4102115,Re-Ignite Lincoln Heights,"LEAD will facilitate a community needs assessment, voter education and registration campaign, and ignite civic engagement in Lincoln Heights",Connect,2014051,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050connect/projects/ReigniteLH.html,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Lincoln Heights has a rich history of activism and civic engagement. LEAD will re-ignite Lincoln Heights. LEAD will develop a Community Needs Assessment to better understand priorities and social needs of Angelenos in Lincoln Heights. The results of the assessment will give the community, elected officials, and the local neighborhood council quantitative and qualitative data of community priorities, needs, and the social issues where most services and resources are needed. This is the first step in bringing more attention to Lincoln Heights and helping Angelenos shed light on what they really care about. We then will empower the community to become more civically active through voting and participation in their local neighborhood council.","By reaching out to local organizations, churches, neighborhood councils, and community centers, we will survey a minimum of 300 people. Through our existing program LEAD YouthBuild, a leadership development program that empowers youth ages 18-24 to finish their high school diplomas and connect them to meaningful careers and post-secondary education, we will incorporate community outreach and organizing into our curriculums and give them service-learning experiences that will include surveying people in the community. This project will serve many purposes that include: gathering of important community data, leadership opportunities for young people through hands-on organizational and community outreach experience, and it will shed a positive light on young people who would otherwise be seen as disengaged and at-risk. In partnership with UCLA's Urban Planning Department, the surveys will be analyzed and data will be compiled together to serve as documented research describing community needs and the gaps between current conditions and desired conditions. The results will then be presented to the community through educational forums where dialogues will be facilitated about civic responsibility and engagement in order to address community needs. LEAD will then launch a voter registration campaign that will register a minimum of 200 people to vote. We will then host a series of workshops and educational forums with the goal of empowering people to become active voters and active participants in local neighborhood council meetings and city council meetings. This is the first step in trying to impact community change is by defining community needs and creating leadership opportunities that will ignite dialogues with those that have the power to make the changes happen. But civic participation does not stop there. LEAD will facilitate and organize working groups between Angelenos of Lincoln Heights, local elected officials, and the local neighborhood council to find common grounds and create strategies and plans that would address community needs. The goal would also be to identify services and resources that currently exist in the community and identify gaps where services and resources are needed.","When politics and voting is brought up in the community, we commonly hear things like “My vote does not matter,” “One person can’t make a difference,” and “Politicians don’t care about me and what I think about.” Part of the sentiment may derive from the community feeling not fully represented when decision are being made about their community. When you begin to ask people what they personally care about and what solutions they would propose, many times you receive genuine and innovative responses. What if we can restore a voice to the community of Lincoln Heights? What if we can gather enough people together and create dialogues where people begin to discover that they are not alone in wanting community change? What if we can build bridges between elected officials and the neighborhood council and changes begin to happen? Small changes and small victories can lead to big changes and big victories. The community will feel represented. This project will begin to pull out information from the community and make that information carry value. By creating dialogues between community members, the neighborhood council, and elected officials, commonalities can be discovered or produced and evidence of changes happening will ignite the community to want to stay connected and stay active.","This project will benefit the community of Lincoln Heights which has a population of about 31,500 people. The community is predominantly Hispanic/Latino with the next largest group of people is Chinese/Asian. The unemployment level is 12.7% and 36% of the population there is living at or below the poverty level. The high school dropout rate in Lincoln Heights is 33%. This project will aim to impact the following groups of people: 
 Young people ages 18 – 24: In addition to the services offered by LEAD YouthBuild, the organizational skills they will develop and community outreach training and experience they will obtain through this project will serve as work experience and leadership experience benefiting them in future employment and/or college enrollment. 
 People ages 25 – 40: This population will be targeted for the community needs assessment, educational forums, and dialogues that will be facilitated. 
 People ages 40 – 75: This population will also be targeted for the community needs assessment, educational forums, and dialogues that will be facilitated. 
 Each of these groups of people have needs and priorities that may be different from other age ranges. For real and long lasting connectedness to happen, all sides need to be heard and all sides need to be part of the dialogues that will take place with local elected officials and the neighborhood council.","The following is a list potential partners and collaborations: 
 Lincoln Heights Neighborhood Council is the body representing the community we currently serve. We will gain support for our LEAD YouthBuild and invite them to become thought partners in the implementation of this project. Our goal is to build a good relationship with the neighborhood council, share their goals with the community and build a bridge for more community participation to happen. 
 L.A. WORKS is a non-profit organization that manages a volunteer action center out of Lincoln Heights. Their goal is to empower Angelenos to address pressing social issues through volunteerism and community collaborations. In partnership, we can create a community volunteer project where people would conduct the community needs assessment surveys. 
 Metro North WorkSource Center serves the area of Northeast Los Angeles. Their facility will be a great place for surveying people. They have on average 30-50 visitors per day. 
 YouthBuild Charter School of California currently serves as our educational partner for LEAD YouthBuild. We will work with them to incorporate a service-learning piece into our educational curriculum that would allow students to gain experience and training in community outreach. 
 UCLA is an existing partner of LEAD YouthBuild and will be helping us build a “College Career Center” for the community. Because of our existing relationship, we are able to reach out to the Urban Planning Department and partner with them in order to compile and analyzing the data generated by the community needs assessment surveys. 
 YouthBuild USA is a national organization comprised of 200+ youth development programs whose mission is to unleash the intelligence and positive energy of low-income youth to rebuild their communities and their lives. We are an affiliate of YouthBuild USA and are able to access and leverage pass-through grants that enhance our educational services, case management services, and leadership development. 
 We will also reach out to local churches and ask for support in getting the needs assessment surveys filled out by their members.",

We will serve Kindergarten through High School. Elementary students will greatly benefit from programs of this nature and it is necessary to cultivate this understanding at early stages of child development. This will also gain the interest of a larger number of educators and families.,"The Los Angeles public school system is in dire need of this program. Inadequate resources and information to educate youth on the culture and the history of the Middle East serve to perpetuate a cycle of misunderstanding that is a key component of many of the problems that America and the world at large face today.
 
 The contemporary Arab and Muslim world is generally associated with the selective images of war, terrorism or oil fields. The majority of Los Angeles youth grow up with negative, and often false, images and stereotypes of Arabs/Muslims. These stereotypes are perpetuated through films and television, creating an environment of distrust towards Middle Eastern American communities. After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 Los Angeles County experienced a fifteen-fold increase in anti-Arab/Muslim hate crimes. Racial profiling and acts of violence are generally perpetrated by individuals ignorant of Arab and Muslim heritage, who often mistake other Americans for Middle Easterners (ie Sikh community).
 
 In order to promote a deeper understanding of the Middle Eastern American community, schools need to educate youth on the positive cultural contributions people from the Middle East bring to the world. In order for harmful negative stereotypes to be eradicated, Middle Easterners themselves need to take initiative, but also Americans need to see the world situation with clear and educated eyes in order to not perpetuate an endless cycle of distrust. Education is the key.
 
 The Arab/Middle East is in fact a diverse region that includes for example Iranian Bahais, Palestinian Christians and Arab Jews, along with a wide range of other minority communities.The greater Middle East isa complex quilt of cultures and ethnicities (Berbers, Kurds, Armenians, Assyrians, Chaldeans, Druze etc.), each with a unique history and contribution to the host society.
 
 
 Through our programs, this mosaic quilt will be unfolded for Los Angeles youth through face-to-face encounters with guest speakers/performers from the region and hands-on workshops and classes.
 
 The wars and occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan have sparked a public interest

The development of cultural enrichment programs like MECAY is necessary for today’s youth.","UP to 10,000 K-12 youth and their parents in Los Angeles County.","We will partner with multiple community organizations, such as Muslims for Progressive Values, and the Craft and Folk Art Museum, as well as LAUSD.",1,
4102118,Bicycle Libraries: The Class of 2050,Libros Schmibros will roll out bicycle libraries to irrigate the book deserts of Los Angeles!,Connect,2014053,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050connect/projects/BicycleLibraries.html,,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,"""...final adoption of Newspeak had been fixed for so late a date as 2050.” -- last words, George Orwell’s 1984
 
 Libros Schmibros proposes to roll out a fleet of “bespoke"" Bicycle Libraries to circulate books citywide at farmers markets, grocery stores, loncheras and other Metro-adjacent congregating spaces, all staffed by the Class of 2050, a specially fielded cadre of student interns and volunteers. In collaboration with several local schools, bicycle experts, Metro, and Homeboy Industries, we aim to mentor a replenishable squadron of young cyclists, riding hard for literature against the forces of disconnection and loneliness.","Each Bicycle Library will carry a carefully curated precious cargo of approximately 25 books reflecting our most popular Boyle Heights inventory. This selection will emphasize books about Los Angeles, children’s books, genre fiction, counterculture staples, classic syllabus mainstays, and Latin American literature -- in both translation and the original language wherever possible. As with the foodtruck phenomenon, Bicycle Library appearances will be heavily promoted via social media. The bicycles will be powered by a team of 20 student volunteers. 
 
 In Fall 2014, we’ll field our Class of 2050 from our partner schools and refine protocols for the program. In Winter, these students will learn to work knowledgeably with our active collection and reserve stacks, talk about books with us, and interact with patrons. Before Spring, they’ll be ready to organize: each student will work with our coordinator to select a Metro-friendly itinerary, handpick stock, and venture into the public realm, where he or she will lend books, start conversations around them, and offer subsidized Libros Schmibros memberships. At least 50% of these rides will be in Boyle Heights and the greater Eastside, ultimately building on that base to reach the city beyond.","Bicycle Libraries will help make LA the best place to connect by:
 
 1) conferring all the well-documented social benefits of voting, volunteering and civic-mindedness that reading uniquely promotes, and 
 
 2) fostering conversations among neighborhoods and people that would otherwise have little occasion to meet.
 
 There aren’t many places where Angelenos are happy to see each other. Strangers may exchange smiles while walking on the beach, if it’s not too crowded, or on hiking trails. Maybe at Dodger Stadium too, provided we’re winning. Overall, though, the list of places in L.A. where we can make a thoughtful, innocent, face-to-face connection with our neighbors isn’t getting any longer. 
 
 Enter Bicycle Libraries. Stocked with 20-30 good books, yet small enough to fit snugly under a student volunteer, Bicycle Libraries can go where Libros Schmibros can’t, propping its custom kickstand wherever books aren’t sold – or even readily available. These sturdy ambassadors of Libros will create outposts of intelligent conversation in public spaces, and also beckon new borrowers back to our lively mothership on Mariachi Plaza. 
 
 By 2050, the web of connections engendered by the original Bicycle Libraries and their successors will be proliferating more than ever. Neighborhoods that once knew each other only from traffic reports will hold no terrors for their crosstown neighbors. Immigrant writers fired with the inspiration to be found in books and bookish conversation will have found a broad readership, just as immigrants to America a hundred years ago -- in rough neighborhoods not so different from Boyle Heights -- created much of what we cherish in 20th-century American literature.
 
 If 1984 teaches us anything, it’s that the good guys aren’t the only ones looking ahead to 2050. Powerful forces would love nothing more than a Los Angeles full of docile, disconnected nonvoters, easily manipulated consumers, and suspicious door-bolters. A cynic might say such a city is already here. But every book shared -- and every friendship forged around it -- is a stay of execution against that future. Bicycle Libraries can become the emblem of an alternate future for Los Angeles: intelligent, convivial, green, gregarious and, yes, connected.","“It was expected that Newspeak would have finally superseded Oldspeak (or standard English, as we should call it) by about the year
 2050...Shakespeare, Milton, Swift, Byron, Dickens, and some others were therefore in process of translation: when the task had been completed, their original writings, with all else that survived of the literature of the past, would be destroyed.”
 -- George Orwell’s 1984
 
 Our Bicycle Libraries project will benefit:
 
 1) new Libros Schmibros borrowers around the Greater Eastside who haven’t discovered us yet
 2) lapsed readers in other book deserts citywide with limited access to good books
 3) less working-class, more wired neighborhoods who nevertheless lack both ready access to browsable printed books and, arguably more important, a sense of connectedness to Boyle Heights and other less fortunate offramps
 4) Libros Schmibros itself, with a virtuous circle of increased reading rates and connectedness leading to increased support, leading in turn to increased service hours and inventory, leading back to even more increased reading rates and connectedness 
 5) our Class of 2050, the cadre of 20 initial Bicycle Library student volunteers, who will absorb more deeply the social good of reading even as they help instill it in their fellow Angelenos.
 
 Underlying all this are census studies from the decennial Survey of Public Participation in the Arts, which correlate both educational and personal satisfaction with one factor above any other: books in the home. 
 
 Yet ours remains a city of book deserts as deprived as any food desert. The Class of 2050 will seek to avert the disconnected, debased public discourse portended for that year in Orwell’s dystopian future. Instead, we mean to seed a book garden nourished by the intelligence, civility and creativity that good books engender, and begin to make it bloom.
 
 The paramount benefit will be to put more books into people’s hands, to knit up the bones of a too often disconnected, fragmented metropolis through the transformative power of good reading. By serving as a social catalyst and perpetuating our initiative beyond our proudly Boyle Heights-centric example, the Class of 2050 will model the Los Angeles we have been waiting for -- one blessedly free of book deserts.","So far, Libros Schmibros has laid considerable groundwork for partners and/or collaborators around Los Angeles. We have already confirmed the participation of:
 
 1) Homeboy Industries, to park bikes next to their farmer’s market tables
 2) Metro, where we are a Destination Discount partner, thus providing in-kind advertising benefits to the program
 3) Roosevelt High School, among others, and their Academy of Environmental & Social Policy (ESP), which will help identify qualified students as volunteers
 4) Loyola High School, which will adapt a portion of our initiative to suit their remarkable 80-hour service commitment for seniors, as well as additional appropriate roles for sophomores and juniors
 5) Pasadena City College, with further coordination coming from its Puente Program focusing on Spanish and Latin American literature
 6) East Los Angeles Community College, which has already recommended several students -- drawn especially from their resurgent literary magazine, Milestone
 7) UCLA Volunteer Services, which has agreed to post the opportunity prominently, with the additional possibility of a Service Learning component
 8) the Pomona College English Department
 9) Flying Pigeon LA, our bike consultant, purveyor, and connector to the larger bike community for this project. 
 
 Critical to the success of our collaboration will be:
 1) clear, timely communication among all partners, 
 2) written protocols for volunteering and service hours, and 
 3) getting the word out so that enthusiastic students will apply. 
 
 Fortunately, Libros Schmibros is already connected to every named partner either through teaching experience, current staff, past programs, or agreements and relationships with Libros advisory committee members.",

 In generations past, kids turned to creative toys such as Lego and Erector Set. But recently kids have been adopting more advanced toys such as Arduinos and Raspberry Pis. We want to take this further and introduce more young people to biotech as a hobby.
 
 We will expand our current ability to serve the community with more space and more tools for kids and adults alike to learn and have fun together.","While kids of the past may have tinkered with Lego or Erector Set, kids of today tinker with electronics. As a result of the miniaturization and decreasing cost of manufacturing, electronics today are more accessible to people of all ages than ever before. Kids at the LA Makerspace (and makerspaces around the world) build robots, design and solder their own electronics, and program computers as a form of entertainment.
 
 Biotech is currently undergoing the same revolution in price and accessibility. While practicing biotech as a hobby is not quite as affordable as electronics, progress is being made and lots of young people are getting involved. We envision a future where kids in LA are just as likely to pick up a pipette as they are a soldering iron. Playing with biology will be as common place as playing with electronics.
 
 LA Biohackers will make this dream a reality before 2050 by getting young people access to laboratory space and advanced biotech equipment in addition to knowledge and guidance. We are currently making this happen but with help we can expand our breadth and scope to include more people of all ages.",Our project will benefit anyone in Los Angeles that is interested in biology and biotech. Our laboratory is not limited by age or earned degrees. Anyone who can demonstrate the ability to follow safety guidelines can have fun in our space.,"LA Biohackers has recently been working closely with LabLaunch, another organization submitting a proposal to LA2050 (confirmed, please see their proposal). We plan on moving in to their facility and becoming the first tenant.
 
 LabLaunch is proposing to create a startup incubator that would help early stage companies. In the biotech world, early stage companies typically already have a proven concept and venture capital backing. LA Biohackers, in addition to serving as a common meeting and work space for the community, would also serve as a “pre incubator” for the LabLaunch incubator. People with a nascent idea can use the pre-incubator to advance their project to the point where it could attract angel investors or venture capital. The company would then move in to the full incubator.
 
 LA Biohackers benefits from this relationship by gaining access to discounted space that is amenable to hosting a biology lab as well as access to some of their resources. LabLaunch benefits by having a source of new companies to feed into their incubator. And we both benefit from the cross pollination of ideas and technical knowledge between the two groups.
 
 Factors that are critical to our success are 1) having a paid employee to work and communicate closely with LabLaunch 2) negotiating a deal that is doable with LA Biohackers’ budget but also compensates LabLaunch appropriately, and 3) working with local universities to get projects from the university into the pre-incubator program.",1,0,

We are rallying great support for the project across the Arts District and with our numerous community partners. LADADSpace has received encouragement from Councilmember Jose Huizar, who initially suggested that we create this program. LADADSpace is working with the LA County District Attorney’s Office to identify apprentices for the program. LADADSpace will supervise all program activities, overseeing the educational components while making sure apprentices meet internship objectives and their legally-mandated responsibilities. LADADSpace has recruited two qualified artist-instructors with years of experience teaching art at LAUSD high schools and at the college level. These artists will tailor the basic training program to individual program participants to ensure assignments and responsibilities are matched to their skill levels. The artist-instructors will meet regularly with LADADSpace administrators to ensure all program goals are realized. LADADSpace will also work with mentoring muralists to make sure that mural development deadlines are on track and that apprentices are committing to the work schedule as set by the muralist mentor. Finally, we will monitor apprentices as they manage their internship duties and fulfill internship responsibilities.","In an effort to serve Los Angeles, which has the largest concentration of working artists in the country, it is part of LADADSpace’s mission to support and create opportunities for artists, inspiring vehicles for cross-cultural and interdisciplinary platforms for artistic expression. LADADSpace, in conjunction with its partners, is excited to organize a collective effort of local businesses, art galleries, non-profit organizations, restaurants, civic, and legal leaders to support the Los Angeles Muralist Mentorship program, helping beautify our communities, put local muralists to work, and support our most vulnerable and unsupported young artists. Taking taggers off the streets will decrease the amount of graffiti in Los Angeles. Even if only a few of the program’s participants pursue a career in the arts, that creates enormous potential for the emergence of new artists who will contribute to the growing transformation of the City's walls into a colorful cityscape that enriches the lives of visitors and residents. 
 We believe that the Los Angeles Muralist Mentorship Program will foster artistic entrepreneurship and inclusivity, creating opportunities that extend to neighboring communities and bolstering cross cultural and economic relationships between the Arts District, Central Los Angeles, and East Los Angeles. 
 
 LA2050 CREATE GOALS/Metrics that the Los Angeles Muralist LA Mentorship Program include:
 • Employment in creative industries
 • Measures of cultural and global economic influence (“soft power”) (Dream Metric)","1. The at-risk youth from East, Central, and South Los Angeles assigned to LADADSpace who will seize the opportunities offered by the program to alter the course of their lives and follow new pathways to a brighter future.
 2. The home communities of the apprentices, particularly members of their peer group who will witness the apprentice's transformation from tagger to artist. Home communities will also benefit from the contribution of the smaller art project that the apprentice brings back to and/or creates in his/her community
 3. Cultural tourists and city dwellers who delight in the proliferation of mural art on the City's walls.
 4. Property owners and the city at large benefitting from both the reduction of graffiti and the availability of new mural art in the city of Los Angeles.","Councilman Jose Huizar, District 14 - Confirmed, worked with in the past. He will assist in recruiting wall space, mural materials, & project promotion.

 Derrick Hensman, artist & LAUSD art teacher & art instructor at UC Berkeley: will evaluate apprentice skill level, teach weekly lessons & supervise visits to LA Arts institutions over a three month period.
 
 Muralist mentors Tristan Eaton & Saber will mentor apprentices in the mural making. He pursued street art as a teenager and painted on everything in the urban landscape from billboards to dumpsters. He is a self-proclaimed skateboarding punk who as a teenager was arrested for various crimes including shoplifting and tagging with graffiti. He consults with Hasbro, Pepsi, and Nike, is sponsored by Versace, & his work can be seen at the Cooper Hewitt Museum and at the MOMA. Saber is most famous for an exceptionally large piece he did on the concrete bank of the LA River in 1997. The full color piece took 97 gallons of paint and 35 nights spread out over the course of a year to complete. The final work, measuring 250 x 55 feet has been called ""the largest graffiti painting ever."" Saber has been called by the Washington Post ""one of the best Graffiti Writers of all time.""

4102133,Los Angeles Performance Practice: Innovative Performance in DTLA,We will produce groundbreaking theatrical experiences that activate under-utilized corridors and buildings in DTLA.,Create,2014056,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050create/projects/LAPerformance.html,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Downtown LA,"We plan to work with city developers, property managers, and downtown businesses to activate contemporary performance in specific areas. We have initiated conversations with the Mayor's Office (city planning division), and have worked in the past with the City of Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs. We also plan to call upon our friends and contacts in property management, and form new relationships with those involved in Bringing Back Broadway initiatives. 
 
 We have seen a huge influx of demand for ""immersive"" and ""site-specific"" performance in the past 2-5 years. In New York, for example, some of the most successful performances have been in non-traditional sites- with 'Sleep No More' being the most dominant example. Audiences are hungry for immersive experiences, and at the same time contemporary art with aesthetic integrity. 
 
 Our network of artists have ample experience working in these emerging forms- but producing at this scale can be expensive. These performance experiences are often intended for intimate audiences, making it impossible to recoup costs through ticket sales alone. Other companies have attempted this kind of work, but have been unable to pay artists a fair wage. 
 
 We will implement this project in partnership with our network of artists, providing opportunities to emerging artists in Los Angeles, and relying on the strengths of artists who are already developing projects within this framework- but still seeking a venue and producing infrastructure. We will hire performers, directors, designers, visual artists, composers, and stage managers to execute the highest quality experience possible.","LA is known internationally as being a leader in film/television, music, even contemporary visual art. Our city is under-recognized for the incredible talent we house in the areas of contemporary performance. 
 
 Prior to Los Angeles Performance Practice, it was common for interdisciplinary artists working in performance to develop and present work outside of their home city. LA artists were (and still are) presenting work at world-class venues in New York, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Dallas, plus in Europe and Latin America. But, sufficient opportunities were hard to come by in LA. 
 
 We are working actively to form relationships with top venues in the city to promote the work of our local artists. We have two premieres scheduled at REDCAT in the coming year, and are in our second year with the Bootleg Theater producing the Live Arts Exchange (LAX) Festival for contemporary work. 
 
 By bringing contemporary performance to DTLA, we will elevate the overall perception of performance emerging out of Los Angeles, and will activate our local audiences and communities in celebration of our work. 
 
 In Los Angeles, anything is possible! We feel it's still the ""wild west"" of theater/dance/performance forms. Because of this, it's the best place to innovate art itself- to tell stories about THIS MOMENT, using tools and technologies of the present day. 
 
 Our project will bring this work out of the theaters- out of outdated infrastructure- and into the streets. We'll activate hotels, office buildings, parks, street corners, abandoned warehouses. By relocated performance to a public space beyond the walls of the theater, we will encourage expanded creativity that will funnel into other industries in Los Angeles: film/tv, design, restaurants, hotels, etc.","Our project will provide well-paying opportunities to local artists. These opportunities are few and far between in Los Angeles. One of our overall goals with LAPP is to create infrastructure that makes it easier to live as a generative artist in our city. 
 
 Beyond the artists themselves, our project will greatly benefit the City of Los Angeles. It is well known that bringing arts and culture to underdeveloped sectors of cities worldwide sparks city development. We have seen this pattern re-occur several times in the country- and several times in Los Angeles.
 
 Additionally, our project will benefit local business. A study from Americans for the Arts found that ""Attendees at arts events spend $24.60 per person, per event, beyond the cost of admission on items such as meals, parking, and babysitters. Attendees who live outside the 
 county in which the arts event takes place spend twice as much as their local counterparts ($39.96 vs. $17.42)—valuable revenue for local businesses and the community.","City of Los Angeles 
 We are in conversation with members of the City Planning team, who have expressed interest in working with us to identify projects that could be used as activating arts and cultural activities in under-utilized parts of the city. Should we receive this funding, we will be able to offer the City our services in programming these unused areas. 
 
 ACE Hotel
 We are in conversation with the ACE around one particular project that would occur on Broadway as an immersive, overnight experience. The success of this collaboration also hinges on funding. The ACE has a built-in audience of local art-seekers, and we would be thrilled to work with them. 
 
 Annie Saunders (confirmed artist)
 Annie has a wealth of experience in working with site-specific immersive performances. Her project 'The Day Shall Declare It' explores the concept of work, both what it means to us and what it does to us. The piece interrogates beliefs about working, work ethics, work/life balance and how these concepts infiltrate our relationships with others and ourselves.
 
 Zoe Aja Moore (confirmed artist)
 Zoe will direct a new adaptation of Hedda Gabler as an immersive, overnight experience. Hedda is a cry for a new radicalism – a woman in the midst of bourgeois culture struggles to break free from the repetition of history. By extending the classic play, Hedda Gabler, into an overnight event the play is adapted into a ritualistic experience that invites the audience to encounter the action of the performance through an intimate proscenium – the performers and audiences body rhythms of sleep and wakefulness align with each other, shifting the play from it’s traditional psychological profile into a united experience of the play’s universal themes. The extended duration of the play aerates the text, creating space for operatic expressions and intimate moments.",1,
4102141,MassKnowtify: Connecting local governments to citizens and communities everywhere,"We will bring MassKnowtify to every part of LA, so everyone can be better connected to information impacting their daily quality of life",Connect,2014057,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050connect/projects/MassKnowtify.html,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"MassKnowtify is dedicated to making communications between government and citizens more accessible, valuable, and effective. MassKnowtify solves distinct problems for both citizens and local governments: citizens can be connected to important localized information wherever they travel; local governments can increase citizen communication and engagement in a more direct and cost-effective manner. To achieve this, MassKnowtify provides a location-based public alerting platform to disseminate a variety of public alerts and notifications that are timely, accurate, and relevant to one’s specific location. MassKnowtify functions primarily as a mobile application but can also be accessed through the web from anywhere on any device.","MassKnowtify is currently in a limited release in Los Angeles and we have already partnered with local agencies to bring them on board. Our current web app is fully functional and accessible on all devices (smartphones, tablets, desktop browsers); however, our next milestone in our roadmap is to launch “native” apps for both iOS and Android operating systems to deliver better performance and reliability. Most importantly, access and use of MassKnowtify by citizens is completely FREE. 
 
 In order to offer MassKnowtify to all public agencies in the entire region, we will implement the following initiatives:
 
 Platform development and enhancements 
 • Convert our current web app to native mobile apps for iPhone and Android
 • Create an application programming interface (API) to integrate MassKnowtify alerts on city websites and other digital distribution channels
 • Enhance MassKnowtify’s message analytics capability for public agencies to better assess the effectiveness of their messaging
 
 Local government access and usage, and support for training and onboarding
 • Provide access and use of MassKnowtify to all local governments in the greater LA region
 • Provide account setup and training for new local agency users
 
 Citizen and community outreach 
 • Host community forums and events, and partner with neighborhood and community based organizations, to drive citizen awareness and usage of MassKnowtify
 • Conduct a variety of outreach efforts to acquire public agencies","There are 88 separate municipalities in Los Angeles County, each responsible for providing individual city services (police, fire, public works, etc.) through individual agencies within the municipality. For example, as one drives along Santa Monica Boulevard through West Los Angeles, one will have traveled through the cities of Santa Monica, Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, and West Hollywood all in under 7 miles. These circumstances make it difficult for a citizen to know which city agencies are responsible for emergency notifications and other essential city services. There are several other large clusters of cities throughout LA County—such as in the South Bay, San Gabriel Valley, and Southeast Los Angeles—with identical circumstances which present challenges for citizens to be connected to timely and geographically relevant information.
 
 Looking into the future toward the year 2050, MassKnowtify can provide the basis for greater connectedness and trust in our local governments. In the wake of the recession, local governments everywhere are experiencing greater pressures to provide services in a more sustainable and cost-effective manner. In addition, civic engagement is important to the success and vibrancy of our communities which are in tremendous need of innovative solutions to drive greater civic engagement. By providing a platform to connect local governments to citizens, wherever they may be located, civic engagement can be dramatically increased in many new ways over the long run. Future extensions of MassKnowtify may include crowd-sourced information and alerts, and greater contextualized notification for various types of local information.
 
 Building upon the 2014 Grant Challenge goals using results of the February 2013 Grants Challenge and My LA2050 Report, MassKnowtify addresses Public Safety as a priority focus area, which was the area with the least number of submissions in the February 2013 Grants Challenge. MassKnowtify also addresses cross-indicator trends from the LA2050 Report by addressing Technology to leverage new technology to build LA’s future and a new way of connecting to local government, and addressing Design & Innovation by applying technology and design to deliver a product and service benefitting all in Los Angeles. Finally, MassKnowtify increases and enhances Social Connectedness by making citizens more connected to their local governments–where they live, work, and spend their free time–in a dramatically new way.","MassKnowtify is a platform designed to benefit everyone in Los Angeles—residents, visitors, business owners, tourists—by connecting them to local government information that is timely and relevant to their specific location. Our platform is connecting citizens to government alerts and notifications that are categorized into three contexts: Emergencies, Quality of Life, and Community Services.
 
 The Emergency context includes emergency events, natural disasters, and police and fire activity. The agency users include police, fire, and emergency management agencies. A key differentiator for MassKnowtify is that other systems are tailored only to the “local” population—the population of residents who have opted in to the system using a fixed address. MassKnowtify, however, provides notification ability to both the local and “visitor” populations. The visitor population consists of citizens who have not pre-registered for their local system, which may be for a variety of reasons including: lack of awareness of system, registration is viewed as too cumbersome, they live and work in different cities, or they are visitors from out of town.
 
 The Quality of Life context includes street closures, construction activity, power outages, traffic incidents, and public transit delays. Certain available tools attempt to address this segment but since they are primarily focused on serving the Emergencies segment, they do not emphasize “non-emergency” communications because of the risk of oversaturating messaging and alienating citizens who have subscribed for the system. MassKnowtify allows each citizen user to custom select the types and frequency of messages to receive, and whether to receive them as a push notification, or by simply accessing the MassKnowtify system on demand.
 
 The Community Services context is also an underserved segment of targeting citizens with timely and relevant information. In talking directly with local agencies, this context is very important to reach constituents that seek out or need their services. Examples include public events, recreation programs, tourism information, and public outreach campaigns.
 
 Interest in MassKnowtify shown specifically from YOU through the LA2050 Grants Challenge will help fuel adoption by local governments throughout Los Angeles. Help us dramatically improve how governments connect to citizens with information that’s timely and relevant to them!","We view each and every local government in the greater LA region as a partner with MassKnowtify. While we already have several local partners which have expressed interest in using and leveraging MassKnowtify in their public communications efforts, we are not identifying any specific partners in the context of this grant application to order to ensure maximum, yet equitable, opportunity for local governments to partner with MassKnowtify in our efforts going forward.
 
 We have also assembled a group of key advisors that include former public safety officials and public communications experts, and we will continue to rely on our network of partner agencies and advisors to enable MassKnowtify to serve the needs of all Los Angeles residents. 
 
 To better connect with citizens and communities throughout Los Angeles, we will rely on networking with a broad spectrum of groups, including community based organizations, neighborhood councils and associations, local elected officials, and other civic technology providers.",

The Econony, Education, Connectivity, Arts/Culture, and Health will be the areas of focus. At the end of the day, the best 3-5 apps will be selected by a board of technical advisors and moved into the accelerator program.
 
 A contracted mobile app development agency will build the applications over the next 3-4 months with the assistance of paid interns from the local university computer science departments. Weekly progress updates with technical advisors will take place to ensure the development teams maintain the production schedule.
 
 When the apps are ready for use, a high-profile launch party with Ideafest participants, guests, dignitaries and press will take place to celebrate the project completion.
 
 The success of Apps4LA will be accomplished with the help of the community. Beginning with the formation of an operations team, we will conduct research to identify industry experts that have a deep understanding of the flaws that exist within the infrastructure of our city. This includes private businesses, non-profit organizations, academic institutions, and city departments.
 
 The structure of the event, procurement of venue, selection of participants, and pre-event marketing will be conducted early in the process. The Ideafest will be coordinated and managed by the Apps4LA team with the help of volunteers. A preselected advisory board will determine the 3-5 mobile apps that have the best viability and will oversee their development. We will contract Dogtown Media, an app development creative agency to construct and manage the projects through beta.
 
 When the mobile apps are ready for distribution, the operations team will host a launch party for the Ideafest participants, city officials, dignitaries, media, and invited guests. 
 
 All apps will be FREE to the public and available for download on both iOS and Android devices. Apps4LA will continue to market the apps to the public, and manage the backend maintenance.","Los Angeles has a sluggish economy due to the loss of several major industries.

4102148,Mobilize LA’s Youth: Eco-friendly digital media bus equips kids to be the creative workforce in LA,Mobilize the diverse creativity of LA’s youth with a new eco-friendly digital media bus to sustain LA as the creative capital of the world.,Create,2014059,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050create/projects/ecoMFC.html,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,LA Area Probation Camps,"We will work with an industry partner to purchase and retrofit an RV into an eco-friendly digital media classroom that runs on biodiesel and has a solar powered generator. This will allow us to more than double the number of kids we serve in a year and expand our geographical reach. Our programs are well tested and beyond the pilot stage so having the physical resource a new, cost effective vehicle will shift us into high gear on our mission to use this LA program as a model and incubator for digital media programs across the country.","A more creative LA happens when all our kids get to work on a project that is their own idea, one that they write, film and edit and see through to completion. It happens when they get positive feed back and recognition from an audience when their finished film is screened. It happens when kids realize they have something to offer. A new eco-friendly production studio-on-wheels that brings media arts instruction to at risk and under-resourced youth will help Los Angeles be the best place to create by making sure this happens in every corner of LA. As the second largest city and school system in the US, LA serves as a microcosm of the challenges faced across the country, its demographic changes represent the changing face of America. Hispanics and African Americans make up over 80% of the school age population but have the least access to the technology and skills required to thrive in a diverse and creative workforce. It’s commonplace to find in local high schools, one laptop cart with 20 computers per 600 students. In this city of over 268,000 millionaires, the entertainment capital of the world, the disparity between neighborhoods that are 15 miles south of the Hollywood sign and the ones just north, is a waste of human capital we can’t afford. LA is losing good paying creative jobs to states like Georgia, Louisiana, New York and New Mexico. Film Industry professionals and their Guilds are answering the State’s call to diversify their membership if they want to see an increase in film incentives by reaching out to programs like ours who help develop the next generation of the creative workforce. Using our up-to-date equipment and software, industry mentors encourage students to express themselves through the process of making a film. Kids engage in a way that fosters creativity and requires critical thinking, collaboration, listening, time management and creative problem-solving skills. A 2006 Ready to Work Study found 72% of employers said that creativity is the number one skill they seek when hiring. Los Angeles can be a leader and a model for a the rest of the country by investing in all our kids, no matter what their zip code, to prepare them to think creatively and to imagine things that have yet to come into existence. Our youth are our greatest resource and we need to foster their talent and celebrate the diversity their voices bring to our media landscape if we want to sustain Los Angeles as the creative media capital in 2050.","Because our program challenges students to create stories around issues in their community, it will benefit all of Los Angeles. They’re not just making a fun movie, they’re making a fun movie with a message. It opens kids up to the world around them and helps them find their voice and discover ways to engage and affect change within their own communities. It also benefits foster and incarcerated teens like Ebony and Kamonie. Abandoned by her mother and shoved into foster care, Ebony hid under a hoodie. But when asked on camera what she wanted to be, she whispered “a poet.” The poem she wrote for her mom became the basis of her film, “Need You”. Ebony’s counselor said that in the month she’d worked on the bus, she’d finally begun to speak up in therapy. Through the medium of film, Ebony found her voice. 
 
 The Mobile Film Classroom doesn’t just give kids a voice, it also gives them life skills and job training. The process of making a film fosters creativity and requires critical thinking, collaboration, listening, time management and problem solving skills. In a world where video is employed more and more by businesses, giving marketable job skills to kids that often have trouble finding employment, benefits our greater economy.
 As director, our student Kamonie, collaborated with his team to write and shoot a film about growing up around gangs and making mistakes; with the message their past should not predict their future. But when got to editing, Kamonie said, “I can’t do this.” We showed him how. His team finished a day early so he had time to teach other kids how to edit. He went from “I can’t” to “let me show you how.” 
 
 Kids like Ebony and Kamonie, have gone on to re-engage in school and in their future. A twenty-twelve study by the National Endowment for the Arts, found that kids who participate in the arts are five times more likely to graduate from high school than their peers who don’t. Less dropouts and more kids that feel they have worth benefits themselves, their families and communities.","This year we are partnering with the County of Los Angeles Public library at 4 libraries in East Los Angeles to provide afterschool filmmaking workshops. We’ve worked with the County Library since 2011. Another ongoing partnership is with the non profit Hollywood Heart, that provides arts training to LA area at risk youth, including a Summer arts camp for teens impacted by HIV/AIDS. This August we’ll be leading our 5 documentary film workshop with them since 2012. We’ve partnered with Green Dot Public Schools, leading two workshops at their Animo South LA High School campus, The City of Los Angeles Public Library, LA’s Best, The Geena Davis Institute for Gender in Media, LACOE Juvenile Court Schools at Pacific Lodge and Camp David Gonzales, Aviva Center, LAUSD, Malibu Boys and Girls Club.
 We have been in discussion with industry partners to help us purchase, customize and equip a new eco friendly digital media bus. We’ve had support of a leading production vehicle company as they supplied parking and maintenance support for our current vehicle since 2012. These potential partners bring expertise in designing production vehicles, state of the art video and editing equipment and software and entertainment professionals that mentor our students in the most current trends in the industry.
 What has made these collaborations work is our flexibility in programming (we customize the projects to fit the interests of that organization), our mobility to provide access to technology and a shared belief in the need to help all LA kids express their creativity as a way of strengthening communities.",1,

Muir Ranch currently occupies 3.5 acres in Pasadena and features a student-run CSA vegetable subscription program, catering and long table dinners and full event floral jobs training programs for low-income high school students. A LA children's garden will be an expansion of our existing work. Designing and building this ""farm"" will be a hands-on project for our students and our adult professional mentors from all sectors: design, entertainment, hospitality (food), #green construction and education.","LA does not have a children's garden like New York or Chicago (or even Dayton, Ohio). It's a double shame since we live in a year-round outdoor growing climate unlike our eastern sisters. 
 
 Kids that interact with nature and each other learn more and faster. And nothing inspires wonder like sunflowers in a Van Gogh field or a spiral maze of zinnias and kale. And once kids engage with nature they might be more inclined to empathize with it and want to do more to travel lightly on the planet. 
 
 The farm will be a school for the students who build it. It will be a wonderful place for younger students to visit and play. The farm will be teaching tool for educators. And like a church, it is the people who gather and invest their time there.","Elementary and Pre-k students: they need places to explore and interact. Think Kidspace as a garden! 
 
 High School Students: look what's possible a career, as a farmer and a learner in service.
 
 Teachers: see what's possible as an educator and know you are supported at your school to teach kids what they are capable of. 
 
 Angelenos: not all soil needs to be covered up! Let's grow a flower farm.
 
 Butterflies: we need more milkweed for Monarchs.","Muir Ranch is a teen jobs program that looks like a farm. We are working with Environmental Charter High School to build the LA Children's Garden as a project-based learning campus.
 
 ""Environmental Charter High School (ECHS) is an award winning, free, public high school in South Los Angeles that prepares students for 4-year colleges using the environment as a lens for real-life learning.

 Muir Ranch is supported by dozens of corporate and individual donors and customers via are CSA program.

4102154,LA Conversation Meals,"When sitting down to eat, what if, instead of a menu of food, there was a Menu of Conversation... and your dinner companion was a stranger.",Connect,2014061,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050connect/projects/laconversationmeals.html,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,"Building authentic community, neighbourhood to citywide, begins with good conversation. Especially between people who might never otherwise get the chance to speak. It’s kind of like DineLA except for conversations and community building.
 
 The idea: 
 
 The second Thursday of every month, all over the city, every Los Angeleno knows they can go out and engage in great conversation, with someone they would never usually get to meet. 
 
 People attending choose from the participating restaurants, food trucks and venues, based on cost, gastronomic taste, or location. Each location will have a set food menu, and when they arrive, diners will be seated with another participant they have never met, and given a Conversation Menu.","We’ll start with a pilot in our local neighborhood - downtown Los Angeles - to get local restaurants and our community on board. Once we see what works, we’ll expand into additional neighborhoods citywide. We’ll use NationBuilder’s Community Organizing System to engage citizens, restaurants, and community centers in creating a web of conversation meals across the city. 
 
 The community page for Conversation Meals on NationBuilder will allow public participation in the organization and format of the events where appropriate, allowing the project to adapt to the needs and desires specific to each community as it grows. 
 
 Before any food is served, each participant will engage with Starters, Entrees, and Desserts from the Conversation Menu. These courses contain questions that will facilitate the adventure of genuine conversation, and help to create a two way dialogue. 
 
 The questions are very important. 
 
 Conversation Meals are not without precedent—and though they are not associated with a particular city (yet!), they have successfully been used to build community all over the world. 
 
 Here is a sample menu from A Handbook for Revolution: Empathy by Roman Krznaric:
 
 A Conversational Entrée
 
 What in your experience, are the best and worst ways of being good?
 
 What would you most like to change about your philosophy of love?
 
 How have your ambitions affected your humanity?
 
 Do you feel more at home in past, present, or future?
 
 What is your personal history of self confidence, and what has it taught you?
 
 Do you think we can empathize with animals, plants, and the planet itself?
 
 What is your ideal way of growing old, and who might help you do it?
 
 
 Conversation Meals take from two to seven hours, often going far longer than anticipated. 
 
 Big questions, as successfully practiced by Sugata Mitra’s SOLE model, Theodore Zeldin’s Oxford Muse, and The School of Life in London, help us get over our inhibitions and over practiced personas, and give us a side door entrance to explore the diverse perspectives in each other, our city and the world. The Questions help us step out of our own way, connect openly over ideas, walk in each others’ shoes—go on a new journey.
 
 The Los Angeles of 2050 will be formed by the exchanges that take place in Conversation Meals.","Authentic community begins with good conversation. It acts as a primer to a larger sense of connectedness and builds trust—in each other, in neighbourhoods, in the city we live in. 
 
 Conversation Meals will elevate the dining experience in Los Angeles by providing a reliable form of community nourishment for residents and visitors alike. 
 
 Far and wide Conversation Meals will renew LA’s contract as an epicenter of culture creation, this time through genuine dialogue in addition to the traditional one-way broadcasting we’re known for. Facilitating real time, in-person connectedness as an accessible, repeatable, scalable cultural event may become a defining attribute of what it means to be a world class city. We have the LA Philharmonic with Gustavo Dudamel, and the most excellent conversation in the world.","The impact is very personal and communal for anyone who shows up. There are numerous barriers to access the kind of safe format necessary to practice these important skills of authentic connection and community creation: the courage to show up, to speak, to really listen, and to walk in each others shoes. Where do we as a whole society get to strengthen these challenging practices deliberately? 
 
 This project will benefit anyone of any age, ethnicity, income bracket or background who is interested in having a good conversation, and has the courage to show up. It will also benefit whomever the participants go home to. Conversation Meals generate the kind of good feeling that spreads. 
 
 Because there are no barriers to the kinds of establishments we can break bread in --a long table at a taco truck, a school gymnasium, or a Michelin ranked restaurant, there is a very interesting opportunity to serve anyone from any community that is interested in community building.
 
 With its car culture and sprawling desert climate, Los Angeles has a reputation of being particularly isolating. At the same time, it also presents limitless opportunity for dynamic connectivity between diverse groups and ages—but people have to talk to each other first. 
 
 Our collective reliance on technology has created a world where people interact with their phones instead of interacting with each other (as this video illustrates: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7dLU6fk9QY). Conversation Meals are a way to break people out of their normal routines, helping create dialogue and connection with people they may pass on the street, sit next to on the bus, or see in a passing car. 
 
 There is also potential for increased innovation. Historically it occurs through authentic discussions around themes:
 
 “At it’s best, conversation is a form of adventure. Like the idea of Socratic dialogue, if you bring two people together with different viewpoints and experiences, the encounter between them can create something unexpected and new. This is just what happened in the 1950’s when Francis Crick and James Watson immersed themselves in endless discussions about genetics from their different disciplinary perspectives—a conversation that resulted in the discovery of the structure of DNA.” -Roma","To reach the greatest cross section of people we’ll partner with a diverse range of restaurants and community centers to host Conversation Meals, starting with our pilot in DTLA. By hosting conversation meals on slower restaurant nights, we can support local restaurants by bringing in additional business. 
 
 Possible restaurant partners in DTLA:
 
 Five0Four Restaurant (opening in DTLA)
 Faith & Flower
 Ebanos Crossing
 Gorbals
 Pete’s Cafe & Bar (Tom Gilmore)
 Smeraldi’s (in the Biltmore Hotel where NationBuilder’s new offices as of December, 2014)
 Church & State
 
 Local radio stations KCRW and KPCC would be a perfect partner to get the word out to the local community, setting a tone of local engagement. You can hear the announcement before Which Way LA, or work in concert to have combine Conversation Meals with events that would benefit from debriefing in a more intimate or innovative way than a cocktail party.",

 Currently, NewFilmmakers LA manages to accomplish everything it does with a staff of only five—four of whom are part-time employees or on retainer, and only one of whom is full-time. The additional support provided by an expansion grant will allow us more resources, manpower and energy to continue the steady path of growth that NFMLA has maintained throughout the years. In expanding On Location, the NFMLA Monthly Screening Series and the rest of our core programming, we can provide important cultural and career opportunities to a wider net of communities in Los Angeles.","Since its inception, NewFilmmakers Los Angeles has dedicated itself towards making Los Angeles the best possible place to create films and experience film culture. NFMLA's core programs were designed to promote cultural exchange in LA by exposing the powerful, young talent behind important local and global cinema to a hungry audience—and vice versa.
 
 Our other core program aside from the Monthly Screening Series, On Location: The Los Angeles Video Project is about to celebrate its fourth anniversary as the first community outreach multimedia program that celebrates LA by enlisting its remarkable pool of filmmakers to make films about the city. On Location was largely founded as a means of helping to fight the current massive production exodus in California. The program serves LA not only by providing an outlet for its filmmakers to share their insider perspectives of this diverse cosmopolitan environment, but also by creating production opportunities for local residents on these shoots, and yielding a vibrant crop of short films that maintain and further Hollywood’s status as the world’s filmmaking capital.
 
 The Monthly Screening Series also achieves these goals by reserving half of each program for local films and offering a large discount to submitting local filmmakers if their movie was filmed in the area. NFMLA further encourages local film production by co-planning the California Locations Conference with the California Film Commission, presenting a Filming in LA Panel with FilmLA and LAPPG, and hosting the PGA’s Weekend Shorts Filmmaking Program.","Over twenty local films are made through the On Location program each year and premier to an audience of 500. Our other screenings serve 25,000+ patrons annually in the greater Los Angeles area, and we additionally reach 55,920 subscribers on our email list and 9,555 via Facebook and other social media. Inexpensive ticket pricing ($5 for a single program) allows us to serve a vast array of socioeconomic groups, and our culturally rich programming draws a racially diverse audience, with 41% of our constituents Caucasian, 15% Black, 18% Latino, 8% Asian, 3% Middle Eastern and 13% other.
 
 With the funds for outreach that a grant of this magnitude can provide, the amount of Angelinos we can benefit is potentially limitless.","NFMLA has a longstanding history of collaborating with other organizations to achieve our shared goal of advancing LA arts and culture. Such collaborations include co-presentations of: two yearly panels with Women in Film, one yearly panel with AFCI Locations Show, the LA Student Media Film Festival with Paul Krekorian, the 57th Assembly District Student Digital Media Competition with Ian Calderon, an LA Harbor International Film Festival shorts showcase, four short film Summer Poolside Screening Series events at the Standard, and respective separate feature film screenings with the Indian Film Festival of Los Angeles, LA EigaFest, AFI Film Fest, and LA Film Festival. Other partners include: the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences, Film Independent, We Make Movies, FilmBreak, Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, Free Arts for Abused Children, the National Hispanic Media Convention, Japan Film Society, and the Consulates of Finland, Hungary and New Zealand. Most recently, we collaborated with NUVOtv to debut three stunning Latino-driven film programs before presenting them to an audience of millions on NUVOtv’s Nu Point of View program—a magnificent opportunity for any up-and-coming independent filmmaker.
 
 Between so many global partnerships and the fact that we bring and showcase international filmmakers to the city on a monthly basis, NewFilmmakers has made promoting a diverse, international presence in LA a top priority. It is for these reasons that the Hollywood Arts Council is honoring us with a Cinema Arts Award this year to celebrate outstanding contributions of merit to Hollywood and its arts.",1,

 ART CITY LA offers the LA creative community and general public a welcoming platform for more of the expression and recognition it deserves by connecting the widest possible mix of artists, partners, venues, neighborhoods, and cultures in a participatory activation involving LA’s vast number and disciplinary array of creatives and the broad range of industries and communities in which they work.
 
 ART CITY LA will help stimulate the creative economy, cultural tourism, and an international reputation by increasing awareness and support the numerous and diverse industries and creative workers that comprise LA's creative economy, inspiring a citywide activation for the advancement of the arts and economy, and ultimately, helping stimulate innovation and create jobs, as well as social and cultural benefits, by way of creative education and professions.
 
 Shining a light on LA’s vibrant arts community to both locals and national and international visitors, ART CITY LA will recognize Los Angeles’ status as America’s Artist Super City in a way that amplifies the financial and social impact of its creative industries and practitioners and promotes creativity as fundamental to economic growth and prosperity.
 
 ART CITY LA will market “Art City” as a slogan/motto that identifies LA as The Creative Capital of California and the Nation, one that says LA is a dynamic place to create, live, work, learn, and connect and speaks volumes about it as a great, livable, thriving center of art, creativity, and culture.
 
 ART CITY LA will act as an educationally-oriented opportunity for all cultures and communities to access and gain entry into the full range of creative industries as a vocation, one that promotes the premise that creativity is an essential ingredient to a successful workforce and justifies increased emphasis on creative economy career paths through technical and university institutions. 
 
 ART CITY LA will provide a much-needed voice for young and emerging artists and their constituents to gain additional exposure outside of more traditional methods and help them build careers and livelihoods across for-profit, nonprofit, public and community arenas.","Furthering the work of institutions such as LA 2050, LA Economic Development Corporation, LA Department of Cultural Affairs, LA County Arts Commission, LA N’Sync, LA Coalition for the Economy & Jobs, and others, ART CITY LA will involve LA’s vast number and disciplinary array of creatives and the broad range of industries and communities in which they work. 
 
 A big-picture solution with exponential potential, ART CITY LA constitutes the ultimate mash-up of artists, entrepreneurs, brands, venues, neighborhoods, cultures, companies, investors, and institutions–all connected by a common goal of making LA a globally recognized center of creative excellence.
 
 ART CITY LA embodies the very attributes of urbanism and the very nature of art and creativity. The arts have a special role in providing inspiration to all people. Therefore, ART CITY LA recognizes that it is not only artists and those involved in the creative economy that are creative but that creativity can come from anyone who addresses issues in an inventive way. Grounded in the philosophy that we can all make the extraordinary happen if given the chance, ART CITY LA is a place where everyone can express their potential which is harnessed and promoted for the common good. When these expressions combine, they create an innovation ecosystem–a synergistic relationship between people and place that facilitates idea generation and accelerates commercialization.
 
 ART CITY LA specifically presents a special opportunity for 50 Ambassadors and Venues to further their work as thought-leaders dedicated to strengthening LA’s creative brand. Being chosen is recognition of individual creativity and support of the local creative community. Not only is this a chance to spotlight their unique talents, ideas and contributions, it is also where they can help shape the things that make LA such a desirable place to be. For LA, this is a way to publicly thank and promote those entrepreneurs who are helping it move up the value chain of global competitiveness by growing the jobs, firms and networks that drive broad-based prosperity.
 
 Altogether, ART CITY LA is an inclusive bridge-building and networking platform that encourages the broad cross-sector partnerships that are crucial to generating momentum and support for the creative economy, one that engenders the kind of open innovation that can forge new and more extensive relationships and collaborations and strengthen LA’s position as America's Artist SuperCity.","In the collaborative spirit of the LA2050 Grant Challenge, ART CITY LA has been designed to support the shared mission of the CREATE Category through a true “Crowdsourced LA” production enabling all those dedicated to enhancing LA’s status as world leader in media, arts, and the creative industries to work cooperatively to achieve a common goal. 
 
 This kind of collaboration goes to the heart of what creativity is all about. Like jazz, often heralded as the epitome of complex collaborative practice, ART CITY LA is a synergistic, wise, resonant, and connected way to share ideas, pool resources, mobilize assets, and tap greater sources of intelligence to spur productive, inclusive, and sustainable economic development.
 
 With this in mind, ART CITY LA has initiated conversations with key players such as LA's Cultural Affairs Department, LAEDC, and Center for Cultural Innovation to invite their involvement in this strategic alliance, communicating how ART CITY LA supports their work and that we are all on the same team. The response has been positive:
 
 “I am thrilled to see what you have produced. You have our total support on what you are doing as this is exactly what we want to see happen here in LA.” -Amy Amsterdam, Innovate in Los Angeles
 
 “Your proposal looks very strong and shows clearly the details of the program. I'm sorry we could not participate as a direct partner in the application, but the project is a wonderful idea. Our new GM who started yesterday very much likes it, and as you note, we should discuss this further and see how we can assist."" -Andrew Kasdin, DCA
 
 “You have a great idea to excite LA's community through showcasing local artists. As you astutely observed, this is also one of the aims of CCI. Unfortunately, with such short lead time, it would be difficult to get involved on our end. I wish you success in finding an institutional partner and hope you'll keep us updated on your progress. If your project is awarded, let me know as that may provide another opportunity for partnership in promoting your program far and wide.” -Angie Kim, Center for Cultural Innovation
 
 These encouraging comments attest to a strong interest in the value of a global program such as ART CITY LA, which if chosen as an LA2050 Grant Challenge winner will offer these institutions and others full opportunity to participate in empowering LA County residents to harness their creativity by fostering entrepreneurship, cultural diversity, and inclusivity.",1,

The space is large enough to hold classes, workshops, events and gallery shows. We have wanted to find a way to share the space with as many who wish to participate. To activate this space as a community arts lab will require experienced staff, additional equipment and supplies. 
  We need experienced guides and lab assistants as well as a budget for guest instructors and speakers. We need support staff for the development and coordination of workshops, classes and lab time. We need a key support person to help with the strategy, marketing and promotion of the learning programs as well as develop relationships with contributors in the community, so as to grow, develop and self sustain as a thriving and vital arts center.","In this hyper digital, social media environment we find ourselves heavily reliant on our technology and grow further and further away from hand skills and tactile experiences. Our friendships, work and even leisure time need the screen to exist. We spend entirely too much time in this digital realm and so our focus is to provide balance. Co- creativity and experienced based learning help us to get out of our heads and into our physical bodies. Hands on learning and analog print processes stimulate creativity and new ideas. An emphasis on balance within our digital lives becomes more and more of a luxury as opposed to a normal learning experience. By activating the instinctive parts of our nature to make, create, learn and grow, we preserve and develop our fundamental human skills and connect us to our physical world, each other and our communities. 
  Teaching people to make art and use the resources they have around them, including their culture and community, will enrich the individual the community and Los Angeles as an arts center.","Our programs will benefit youth and adults in the community, through a cooperative forum that makes available a collaberative, creative workspace and exhibition space that would typically not be accesible and/or affordable to many individuals. Our programs will help advance the public understanding and appreciation for the arts and the practical applications of making, reusing and the importance of hand made arts and analog processes. The specific and primary purpose of our studio is to promote the arts, as both a much needed form of expression and the practical application of these skills to develop and support art and design as a profession. A space where individuals can not only benefit from the practice of experienced based learning, but develop their interests and abilities into a way to make their art support them.","We will work closely with professional artists, writers and musicians in the community.

 ...1.2 Use resources in the College of Engineering at Cal Poly Pomona to set up manufacturing process.
  
 ...1.3 Choose the ten categories and the design for each.
 
 ......1.3.1 Begin process of design and utility patents.
 
 2. Make a public announcement inviting others to collaborate, e.g., local businesses, local organizations, educational institutions, local governments.
 
 ...2.1 News conferences, municipal newsletters, local news media, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, college and school clubs, etc.
 
 3. Set up a system to create and assign QR codes. Each QR code would be unique, enabling the management team to convey and update a unique message. Yet, a cluster of QR codes, that is, those in the same neighborhood, would have a neighborhood identification marker.
  
 4. Manufacture using recycled material.
 
 5. Install where permitted on walls, walkways, and windows. Parolees graduating from the Reintegration Academy at Cal Poly Pomona will be given jobs, as will others.
 
 6. Publicize to residents of Los Angeles County, local businesses, local organizations, local governments, others.
 
 7. Maintain the decals and QR codes, and update the information provided through the QR codes.","TODAY
 
 1. We will be creating jobs.
 
 ...1.1 Los Angeles City has 6,500 miles of streets, not including freeways, http://bss.lacity.org/resurfacing/ . If (a) all of LA County is double that number and (b) QR codes could be put on each side of a street, a hundred feet apart, we would have 1,372,000 QR codes. Assuming that half of the commercial districts and residential neighborhoods would not want the QR codes, we would have 686,000 QR codes.
 
 ......1.1.1 If installation of one QR code took ten minutes, we are looking at 114,000 hours, approximately 57 full-time jobs over the course of a year.
 
 ......1.1.2 After installation, there would be maintenance and updating of information. Ten minutes per QR codes per week would necessitate about 6,000,000 hours over a year, creating approximately 3,000 long-term jobs. 
 
 2. We will be contributing significantly to the sustainability of neighborhoods by making learning, exercise, and social interaction fun.
 
 ...2.1 Learning will vary from local happenings, like the time and address of a farmer's market to classroom priorities, ""STEM on the Street"".
 
 ...2.2 Exercise will be by(a) walking, with motivation coming from clues behind succeeding QR codes leading to an answer, (b) contests where foot or bicycle speed would be essential.
 
 ...2.3 Social interaction will be creative, high-profile, drawing further publicity to WON. For example, scan a QR code to read ""If you find a person named John in the next ten minutes, you and he get a free ice cream at the Foster's Freeze around the corner"".

All planning, design, equipment/safety surface selection, and engineering has been completed. Once funding is secured, the project will be fully completed in 6-9 months.","The PAB wants to establish a place for kids to be outdoors, dream, play and learn to work with others. So whether kids are playing on the playground swings at recess, or having friends over to swing on their own swing sets, it's more than playtime; it's a time to grow. A playground is a wonderful place for children to release stress. Swinging, jumping, climbing and running are good for children both physically and emotionally. Taking time away from structured activity is an important part of keeping a child well-rounded and healthy. A playground is not just a playground. It's a place for kids to dream, relax and learn to work with others. By nurturing our children in this way, we help create a healthier community.
 
 Downtown Los Angeles has a changing demographic with 50,000 new residents and a growing number of children. The City and the residents are joining together to create new schools to accomodate the growing population of families moving to or being created in Downtown.
 
 If we were able to transport to the realization of our vision of Pershing Square in 2050, we would find a reestablishment of the “Living Room” of Downtown Los Angeles. In the mid 1800's, the park was the center of family life and provided the local residents with a social gathering place of shaded walks and topical foliage, a community retreat. In the next decades as the city expanded, and its population center relocated, Pershing Square worked to establish a representation of its growth, and supported the incorporation of structural modifications designed to attract visitors to our growing city. After several reincarnations executed by creative work by the Department, and with strong support from the business community, it was resolved to reestablish the original dream to make Pershing Square once again the jewel of the downtown core, and offer the best of space to local residents, venue visitors, and tourists.
 Pershing Square's South and Southwest kiosks will be children’s play areas serving the residential families in Downtown, South and East LA for decades to come. This common area for children and their parents will provide a friendly oasis for family fun.","The Kids Play at Pershing Square Project will not benefit only benefit families with children in Downtown Los Angeles and the adjacent communites but all families who visit Downtown well as visitors to Pershing Square.
 
 Annually, Downtown has 500,000+ weekday employees and more than 10 million annual non-local visitors. Pershing Square offers many programs to draw these locals, workers and tourists to the Park. Some of the programming includes:
 
 THE SUMMER CONCERT SERIES
 Pershing Square hostsvenue hosts a free summer concert series for six weeks with entertainment four days a week, featuring a variety of music with local, national and international artists. The program runs July through August, Thursday through Sunday. The Summer Concert Series draws between 3,000-7,000 people per week.
 
 FRIDAY NIGHT FLICKS
 Each spring, summer and fall over 25 free movies are shown at Pershing Square every Friday night from May through October. Patrons are encouraged to pack a picnic, bring a blanket or lawn chair and watch movies in Pershing Square Park. 
 
 FARMERS MARKET 
 The Farmers Market includes over 50 booths offering a variety of fresh, local produce and food offerings every Wednesday from 7:00am to 2:00pm. Specialty items such as jewelry and clothing are also available for purchase. The market allows the community another opportunity to meet friends and neighbors at Pershing Square. It also extends a welcome atmosphere to our farming community in other parts of Los Angeles.
 
 FREE MOBILE YOUTH AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMMING AN SUMMER CAMP
 Pershing Square Mobile Youth Team takes programming to underserved youth at pocket parks throughout the City. Recreation and Parks staff works out of City vans stuffed with games, toys, arts & crafts and sports equipment and coordinates fun after school leisure activities and providing homework help. This spring, Mobile Youth will be hosting it annual Extravaganza Spring Egg Hunt at Pershing Square. The event will host free arts and crafts, inflatables, age appropriate egg hunts. The mobile youth team serves over 100 children a week in the after school program. The day camp provides summer fun for 100 children a day. Youth events at Pershing Square number close to 1000 per event.","The City of Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks are a confirmed partner and have committed matching funds for the Kids Play at Pershing Square project. 
 The Department brings the logistical expertise and authority necessary to implement this project; the PAB is the link to the Downtown community, being comprised of Downtown leaders.
 The PAB has worked closely with the Department since its inception 9 years ago. The three factors that are critical to the success of our proposal collaboration include:
 1. Steadfast committment from the Department of Recreation & Parks for this Project - the PAB was chartered by the Department, so we are integrally linked
 2. Open Communication between Department and PAB
 3. Community support and engagement",1,
4102168,LA Mosaic Mecca Project: An Urban Mosaic Intervention on Skid Row,Artists and Arts Orgs provide skills training to recently homeless persons to provide labor for large-scale mosaic art installation,Create,2014068,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050create/projects/LAMosaicMecca.html,,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,All visitors of Mosaic Mecca public art installation,"To implement the Project, Piece by Piece will direct its resources and networks of support toward the planning and design for a major mosaic installation in Skid Row. Our partner, the Trust, enjoys deep connections in the downtown community and will assist our effort to identify an appropriate location for the LA Mosaic Mecca installation. Our training programs will focus on skill sets and special topics that prepare participants to serve as Artisans for Mosaic design, fabrication and installation. We will engage more than 60 Visiting Artists, including both from among the roster of Mosaic, Design and Public Art professionals who have previously served Piece by Piece and outreach to new artists supplying knowledge, skill and talent to the project. We will form new partnerships, including with the Digital Mural Lab of UCLA SPARC, a unique research and teaching facility that brings state of the art computer technology to the production of community-based art. We will engage our Social Media Manager toward the end of connecting Los Angeles, city-wide, to our Mosaic Mecca ambitions. We will gain the support of representatives of the City, and of the local business community that is rapidly expanding within downtown neighborhoods in and surrounding the Skid Row area, including both the Spring Street Arts Corridor and the Arts District. To provide full public access to the Mosaic Mecca activity, we will open a storefront withing Arts District Flea, and take part in events organized through Grand Performances, Renegade Craft Fair and KCRW Summer Nights, among others. Our outreach will include extensive search for volunteers to assist the Mosaic Mecca Project at every level – from planning and design to prep and installations. 
 Steps toward completing the LA Mosaic Mecca project are in keeping with the daily operations of Piece by Piece. Operations include learning workshops for participants at every level, training labs for participants advancing toward Artisan achievement, special topics instruction from Visiting Artists in Piece by Piece studio, and professional development for Piece by Piece Artist Instructors charged with design and fabrication challenges. Our Program Director and Instructional staff will engage in advanced technology training to support their role in leading planning and design of a public art mosaic of scale that is suited to the chosen site.","The idea of transformative art is not new: The Urban Mosaic Intervention conducted in Chile by Isadora Paz Lopez was manifested for a town bisected by concrete rails. Photos at www.mosaicartnow are not easily forgotten. In Chile the need was for transforming an ugly landscape. In Los Angeles the need is toward recognizing the resource of artists for addressing urban problems within systems of education, social service, workforce development, government and urban planning.
 
 The project will put artists to work. It has been established through research that artists can be a creative engine for a thriving society, yet opportunities for engagement remains limited. The project offers work for artists that connects them with a broader community and brings recognition to their contributions as change-makers. The visibility of the project in promoting the role of artists as not only creators but also problem-solvers, collaborators, community-builders, teachers, leaders and agents for change can guide the future of LA in recognizing the role of artists as a critical to education, urban development, and social needs at every level. In 2050, LA can be the best place for artists to work and to live and to be recognized for how their contributions impact the community at every level. 
 
 The proposed mosaic intervention will manifest as an outcome of training extended to residents of Skid Row who are vulnerable to homelessness. These participants, paired and mentored by a large corp of professional artists, will perform the labor as a culminating thesis for their own advancement in creative learning and skill. Following a training that includes both soft skills (working in teams, following instruction, complying with rules) and hard skills (design, craft and mosaic fabrication technique), participants succeed in not only directly producing a lasting work of art that brings beauty to their immediate surrounding, but also job experience that strongly lends to their potential for future employment. Skid Row Residents often share the characteristic of poor education, limited opportunity and other conditions stemming from poverty. The potential for creating opportunity through artmaking among this population helps to reduce the divide that has made homelessness a realty in our city. Art as a vehicle to individual security and success will make LA a better place to create in 2050, and a better place for everyone to live.","More than 60 artists will benefit through their role as change-agents, more than doubling the roster of artists currently with Piece by Piece. More than 100 Skid Row Residents will benefit through arts learning, skills training and transitional employment. Some among these will springboard toward their own career as artists. Others will attain permanent employment as a result of the job experience impact on their resume. 300 community volunteers will gain connection with artists and with their own creativity and deepen their commitment to ending homelessness and making LA a better place for all of its residents. Those who live, work or frequent the site chosen for the LA Mosaic Mecca will benefit from the beautification. The many groups currently working to develop economy and culture in districts that comprise the city’s core will benefit from enhanced connectivity stemming from the project’s implementation and broad outreach for inputs and support. 
 
 The Project will transition Piece by Piece to a next level, solidifying its practices and metrics toward becoming a robust arts establishment. As a social enterprise centered on arts-training and transitional employment that lends to career development both within the arts and in other industries, the advancement of the organization brings to Los Angeles a new model for engaging art to meet workforce development needs and achieve social ends.
 
 The project re-thinks the purposes of a skills training program. It is heavily inspired by expansive research that has proven that art learning can advance skill, knowledge, problem-solving and critical thinking at a rate that academic learning does not. Arts learning speaks to multiple modes: practicing concrete experience and active experimentation as well as reflection and conceptualization. Art offers learning that is accessible to people of all backgrounds, and ethnicities, and is a learning that is not impaired by language barriers. Making art central to workforce development offers participants, many with little education and limited employment experience, the opportunity to grow soft skills -- such as following instruction, complying with rules, and working in teams – while simultaneously developing hard skills in mosaic design, technique and fabrication. The innovation is with applying arts learning to workforce development practice. The model offers transitional employment as well as skills training for income earned as trained Artisan.","This strategic partnership with Skid Row Housing Trust brings to Piece by Piece the resource of direct collaboration with personnel working within each of the Trust’s 24 buildings in Skid Row, the resource of administrative staffing, and a permanent studio space for located in the Trust’s Star Apartment Complex.
 
 Access to quality artists and state-of-the-art design and fabrication resources allows Piece by Piece team to “go big” in their vision for creating public art. The project will be formed from a spirit of city-wide collaboration and will cultivate new strategic partnerships with key Los Angeles art resources such as the Social and Public Art Resource Center (SPARC) in Venice and the Self Help Graphics & Art in East Los Angeles. Both organizations offer deep knowledge and extensive resources that lend to creative transformation in Los Angeles urban environments. 
 
 Our social enterprise partners include corporations, small businesses, and other agencies who support our Job Readiness Program through quantity order of mosaic pieces, for large-scale project commissions, as well as by carrying our product line in retail environments. These partners include Universal Studios, Irvine College, CRA/LA among many others.
 
 Other partners will include a wide range of volunteers, including students, working professionals, retirees, and corporate groups as well as engagement with other Skid Row agencies that share our objectives toward addressing needs among vulnerable populations. A partnership in place with the Downtown Women’s Center engages the Center’s Job Developer in assisting human resources role in recruiting Skid Row candidates for permanent job placement within the Piece by Piece social-enterprise as studio and sales associates.
 Factors critical to success: (1) Partnership with SRHT -- brings to bear an extensive network of private and public resources and connections that make the project possible, (2) Artist Involvement -- Through funding support from the NEA and others, Piece by Piece engages a roster of more than 25 professional artists, and will expand this roster significantly; (3) Arts-Network -- The Project will form meaningful partnership with individual artists, and also arts organizations with the talent and resources for lending support toward successful planning, design and coordination of a large Public Art installation.",1,
4102169,Play the LA River,"Play the LA River invites Angelenos to explore our 51-mile river thru a year of riverside events, an online community, and a playable guide.",Play,2014069,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050play/projects/PlaytheLARiver.html,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,"Since 2012, the team at Project 51 has laid the groundwork with our partners to launch Play the LA River this fall around the project’s three main elements.
 
 Our playable card deck is a unique guide to the LA River, which we will disseminate for free at events and via community outreach. With 52 river sites and 4 off-river “wild card” sites all organized into 4 geographic “suits,” the card deck features greenways and parks along with places that river revitalization has yet to touch but that hold meaning for local communities. Each card is both a tool and an artwork––with a custom map, “dashboard” of site features, access instructions, and tips on how to play. The cards also invite Angelenos to share how THEY play the LA River: dance, picnic, skate, juggle, kayak, bird-watch, bike, paint, swing, BBQ, practice yoga, ride horses, play soccer, play music, fly kites, and the possibilities continue! After extensive scouting, we have finished the card deck and will distribute an initial 2,500 this fall.
 
 In collaboration with partners, we are also producing a 51-week series of public events––including a launch extravaganza at the Frogtown Artwalk on September 13, a closing festival in September 2015, and smaller-scale riverside events across all 4 geographic “suits” (Valley, Glendale Narrows, Downtown, and South). For example, LA River Corp will take the lead in producing a “mobile play” series featuring neighborhood scavenger hunts and bicycle theater. In addition to the programs we implement, Play the LA River will do outreach to an array of organizations—from cultural, sports, and youth groups to gamers, performers, and scientists––in order to galvanize diverse forms of play along the river. To support others in organizing their own play programs and to facilitate spontaneous riverside play, we will develop a toolkit in English and Spanish. The toolkit will include practical resources on river access plus illustrative ideas for self-organized gatherings and projects. 
 
 Finally, our website will include mobile-friendly versions of the toolkit and cards (complete with interactive maps of our 56 sites), an events calendar, and curated multimedia exhibits featuring select Play the LA River events and projects. Through a community-generated and multilingual “stream” of social media posts, the website will also integrate stories, pictures, recordings, and videos showcasing how Angelenos play the LA River today and how they aspire to play there in the future.","The “play” in Play the LA River is an invitation to communities across metropolitan Los Angeles to learn about, connect with, and help create a vibrant future for a river that has been hidden for decades but has been coming back to life thanks to revitalization efforts. “Play” runs the gamut from the performing arts to youth sports to game playing. “Play” involves Angelenos in participatory activities that will inspire broad investment in the potential of the LA River to connect, celebrate, and green communities. And “play” taps into the multiethnic and geographic diversity of art, culture, and recreation across LA.
 
 To envision the river as the geographic and social heart of the LA area, Angelenos first have to know that the river exists, where it flows, and how to access and enjoy it. Play the LA River meets these needs through a public programming and outreach project that contributes to ongoing river revitalization projects and that catalyzes wider civic engagement with the development of parks, greenways, wildlife habitats, sustainable water infrastructure, and cultural centers. However, we focus on the LA River not only to widen the involvement of local communities in river revitalization efforts but also to address critical issues in Los Angeles of park space, neighborhood-centered art and recreation, urban sustainability, and environmental justice.
 
 Most LA River advocacy groups have specific geographical and administrative boundaries (such as the City of LA River Revitalization Master Plan and the City of Long Beach RiverLink Plan). As of yet, no organization has connected the entire river through cultural programming. Play the LA River promises to serve this vital role by providing a hub for events and projects along the river’s entire length and by reaching out to thousands of Angelenos who are new to the river and including them in shaping its future.","To date, public engagement efforts around the LA River have been significant and often highly creative—beginning with the artists who founded what seemed like an improbable movement in the 1980s. However, public knowledge of the LA River and its revitalization continues to lag behind costly civil engineering and time-intensive policymaking. We strongly believe that to be successful, this innovative civic reengineering project requires collective acts of re-imagination.
 
 Play the LA River encourages Angelenos to get to know the entire river—including its most challenged places that master planning efforts have yet to reach. The project pays special attention to communities who live along the river, while welcoming everyone across the region to participate. The project brings Angelenos of all ages and social groups to 52 river sites––which include bike paths, shady parks with playing fields, public art installations, and quiet spots from which simply to take the river in—so as to make the river more compelling to all. The project in turn builds public support and public dialogue around revitalization plans. By working with riverside communities from Canoga Park to Long Beach to view the river as their essential public space, we hope Play the LA River will empower Angelenos to insist that the revitalization process remains democratic and fulfills promises that the greening of the river will benefit existing communities as well as future residents and visitors. 
 
 Play the LA River will ultimately benefit a wide network of groups and individuals in the LA area who focus on river revitalization, park space, visual and performing arts, youth education and recreation, and environmental and social justice. The project will realize these community benefits in part through public programming and in part by awarding stipends to artists, schools, community groups, and other civic-minded folks who are active in river-adjacent communities and who can help to activate play at each of our sites. In tandem, the project website will serve as a virtual river community and living-breathing public art project that will provide unprecedented tools for accessing and navigating the LA River, crowd-sourcing river events, and showcasing the possibilities for playing the river now and in LA 2050!","The Project 51 arts collective is one key player in a larger field of groups. Play the LA River has been developed as an umbrella for collaboration, and the project contributes to ongoing projects and invites other groups to play! Our core partners include:
 
 Non-Profit Organizations:
 - LA River Corp is dedicated to sustainable development and placemaking along the LA River corridor. At the core of its mission is transforming the LA River into a vibrant public space through their LA River Regatta Club (a platform for community engagement and innovative events). LA River Corp is a leading partner in the Play the LA River programming efforts.

4102170,Rebuilding LA’s port communities one business at a time,"PortTech’s entrepreneur program provides comprehensive outreach, education and mentoring services to promising clean tech startups.",Create,2014070,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050create/projects/PortTechLA.html,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Harbor area communities surrounding the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach,"PortTech’s concentrated effort to identify, attract and retain qualified startups centers around the PortTech Pitch program. The first step of the program is attracting entrepreneurs. PortTech connects with Southern California’s research universities, investment groups, the clean tech entrepreneurial community, and industry organizations to seek out potential candidates. We participate in groups such as the Los Angeles Venture Association and Cleantech Open. 
 
 This outreach strategy allows PortTech advisors to broadcast the message of innovation and business opportunities in the Harbor area to more than 3,000 entrepreneurs annually. Through presentations and event networking, we highlight the benefits of participating in the PortTech Pitch. This tailored coaching program provides startups with one-on-one mentoring, constructive critiques and mock judging sessions. Pitch competition finalists have the chance to present to a panel comprised of investors, advisors and representatives of Southern California’s ports.
 
 PortTech Pitch draws upwards of 100 startup applicants each year. The program allows staff to evaluate entrepreneurs’ business plans, validate new technologies and assess each startup’s potential for advancing innovation and solving environmental challenges in and around the ports. Through the PortTech Pitch assessment process, PortTech identifies the best startups to participate in the finals and become PortTech clients.
 
 Finalists also participate in the PortTechEXPO, an annual event that provides technology companies and entrepreneurs the chance to connect with business prospects at Southern California’s ports. The EXPO features live demonstrations, interactive displays and the best technology advancements for ports worldwide. With more than 600 attendees and 60 exhibitors, the EXPO provides entrepreneurs the opportunity to showcase their technology advancements to an audience of port executives, industry leaders, and community members.
 
 Beyond the PortTech Pitch program, PortTech continues to support portfolio clients. PortTech hosts an array of forums and workshops to foster a collaborative working environment and provide entrepreneurs continued access to port executives, government agency representatives, mentors and investors, researchers and industry leaders.","In 2009, the business and community leaders of San Pedro and Wilmington envisioned a future where creative entrepreneurs would solve major environmental challenges facing port communities while at the same time create living-wage “green collar” jobs for area residents. The path to realizing that vision began with PortTech. 
 
 PortTech’s mission is to foster and grow startup companies that address the opportunities and challenges in and around the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. These companies assist the ports in achieving their environment, energy, transportation and safety/security goals and in the process help make healthier communities.
 
 In addition, as entrepreneurs succeed they contribute to the local economy by building thriving businesses. This creates jobs and improves economic growth activities in the marginalized communities adjacent to the ports, including San Pedro, Wilmington, Harbor City / Harbor Gateway and Long Beach. These jobs will elevate the types of employment positions available and provide residents the chance to become part of an advanced workforce and participate in the 21st Century’s technology economy.
 
 Looking forward to 2050, PortTech will be the nexus of a thriving technology and advanced manufacturing-based business cluster. Numerous businesses, large and small, will be focused on addressing the global challenges and opportunities of port and maritime-related industries. And the Harbor area will be an economic development engine in the Los Angeles region – creating jobs and generating wealth for these communities. 
 
 In our LA2050 Vision, PortTech helps transform:
 • researchers/innovators into successful entrepreneurs
 • clean technology entrepreneurs into advanced manufacturing leaders
 • harbor area youth into career-focused skilled workforce
 • demonstration/pilot projects into commercialized products/services
 • port-focused innovations into environmental solutions distributed worldwide
 • declining industrial neighborhoods into thriving “clean economy” regions","Entrepreneurs:
 Through meetings, events and workshops we advise and support 80 to 100 start-ups each year. At any given time, PortTech provides one-on-one mentoring to approximately 20 portfolio clients in-house and virtually.
 
 Harbor Area Communities:
 As entrepreneurs succeed they contribute to the local economy by building thriving businesses. As these growing companies hire their workforce from the Harbor area, communities such as San Pedro, Wilmington and Long Beach benefit. According to the 2013 LA City Council Districts Economic Report, residents of CD15, which connects South Los Angeles with the communities surrounding the Port of Los Angeles, earn average annual wages well below the City average. 
 
 Conversely, clean tech jobs offer more opportunities and better pay for low- and middle-skilled workers than the national economy as a whole. In “Sizing the Clean Economy,” The Brookings Institution noted that wages in the clean economy are 13% higher than the national median wage. Furthermore, 26% of these jobs are focused on manufacturing. With the loss of the shipbuilding industry, manufacturing has declined in LA’s port communities. PortTech can help reverse that trend while helping to define LA as a leader in advance manufacturing, technology and innovation. 
 
 The youth of our Harbor area communities have the most to gain. With an average of 24 years of age, the Harbor community of Wilmington has one of the youngest populations in the county. They represent LA’s future workforce and they’re the ones PortTech’s clients will be looking to fill these new technology and advanced manufacturing jobs.
 
 Greater Los Angeles Region and Beyond:
 PortTech is a collaborative organization. We connect entrepreneurs, mentors and investors, industry professionals, academic visionaries, community leaders and students.
 
 In 2013, we reached:
 • 3,000+ entrepreneurs who learned about environmental and economic opportunities at Southern California ports 
 • 2,000+ professionals who attended PortTechEXPO, forums, workshops and networking events
 • 200+ high school and college students who met entrepreneurs and industry leaders
 
 The green/clean economy – producing goods and services with an environmental benefit – is the focus of PortTech clients’ innovations. As PortTech companies implement their technologies into the marketplace, we all enjoy the environmental benefits of improved air and water quality, and more efficient use of Earth’s resources.","Collaboration is critical – both to successfully supporting entrepreneurs and to our survival as an organization. PortTech’s founding sponsors include the City of Los Angeles, The Port of Los Angeles and the Chambers of Commerce of San Pedro and Wilmington. However, as we began to implement our programs, PortTech quickly realized that the environmental challenges and opportunities did not stop at Los Angeles’ border. 
 
 We work with the Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach Technology Advancement Program (TAP), as well as numerous port tenant companies including terminal operators and trucking companies to implement technology pilot projects. We’re also building relationships with ports beyond Southern California to increase business opportunities for portfolio clients.
 
 Through our partnerships with major Southern California universities, including USC, UCLA and Caltech, we connect student and faculty researchers with real-world business opportunities to support technology commercialization. And our outreach efforts to area colleges and high schools are establishing connections to future entrepreneurs and a skilled workforce.
 
 Volunteer mentors from service business professionals and investor organizations such as Los Angeles Venture Association and Pasadena Angels provide our entrepreneurs with expert advice across a wide range of topics from intellectual property to finance to marketing.
 
 Relationships with government agencies, elected officials, industry and community groups, and business incubator organizations all make up the ecosystem of resources that help our entrepreneurs thrive. With funding from agencies such as the California Energy Commission, U.S. Department of Energy and South Coast Air Quality Management District, our entrepreneurs advance R&D efforts and commercialize their technologies. 
 
 And finally, as a public-private partnership, PortTech can continue to further its mission through support from philanthropic and corporate sponsorships, and industry collaboration.",0,
4102171,Mobilize 10000+ LA Residents Into Volunteerism Using DoGooder.LA,"DoGooder.LA Wants To Mobilize 10,000+ Los Angelenos To Participate in Volunteerism Via “Tracks” Using Our Friends/Reward Based App.",Connect,2014071,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050connect/projects/DoGooder.html,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,"Nothing connects Los Angelenos more than our mobile phones. They are everywhere. You're almost lost without one. So, how do we increase volunteerism using the power of cellphone? 
 
 Well, its not by just creating a regular mobile app that lists volunteer opportunities. That’s been done. 
 
 Its by creating an volunteering app that gives Los Angelenos tangible rewards for completing what we call ""tracks"" which are full immersion volunteering experiences and allowing you do it with your friends.","Introducing our mobile app called DoGooder.LA
 
 The apps shows you curated volunteer opportunities from all over the Los Angeles basin, even those you didn't even know existed, and lumps them into fun and exciting ""tracks"" that you can start immediately and invite your friends to join through social media.
 
 A ""Track"" consist of 3-6 volunteer opportunities, each called ""steps"", lumped together. For example, if Homeless was your ""track"", one day your ""step"" may include serving in the kitchen at Skid Row's Union Rescue Mission. The next day, your ""step"" may include helping build temporary homeless shelters with Habitat for Humanity in Santa Monica. The following day, your “step” may included could be passing blankets with Urban Possibilities under cold freeway bridges along the 110 at midnight.
 
 By following each “step” within a “track”, you fully immerse yourself in your chosen area instead of just the limited experience you get by attending a one time volunteering event.
 
 As you complete your ""steps"", your accumulate reward points. Once you complete the entire track, you’ll receive online badges to proudly showcase your accomplishments and be able to redeem your points towards rewards like free Starbucks Coffee, Six Flags tickets, free lunches at Chipotle, gas cards and other items through our local business partners. Or, if you want, you can donate your points to the charity of your choice for charities to redeem. 
 
 There will be multiple categories of curated volunteering experiences from Environmental Tracks, Homeless Tracks, Children's Track, Mentorship tracks, Animal Track, Social Tracks, Health Tracks, and additional categories giving you you full immersion into what it means to serve in LA. 
 
 In future developments, the app will allow users to curate their own “tracks” as well as a randomize “steps” within “tracks” to bring an element of surprise to volunteerism.","According the The Urban Institute's Center for Nonprofits and Philanthropy in 2012, there are over 40,000 nonprofits and charitable causes in LA. By 2050, that number could easily double, if not triple, and so will volunteer opportunities. 
 
 LA needs a better way of making volunteer opportunities known and attractive by integrating technology such as social media and mobile apps like DoGooder.LA to stay current and connected through 2050. 
 
 If not, as technology gets more integrated with our lives and we become more of a distracted society, less and less people will likely not initiate volunteerism on their own as evident by falling volunteerism rates nationwide over the past 10 years. 
 
 That’s why our app strives to not only lay a clear path to find LA-based, full immersion volunteering experiences with rewards, but through volunteerism, connect LA residents to other people who share the same passion and values and build a more connected Los Angeles well into and beyond 2050.","We believe this app can affect Los Angeles in three specific sectors:
 
 Nonprofits - Access volunteers that otherwise would have been unreachable due to limited reach or limited marketing resources. 
 
 Community - Los Angelenos experience volunteerism without barriers to entry and providing a clear path to volunteerism. And, helping people make connections with people who share the same passion.
 
 Business & LA Commerce - Users will want to frequent businesses that rewards and support community causes by using their reward points.","We currently have confirmed partnerships with World Harvest Food Banks, Union Rescue Mission (Skid Row), Women's Center for Alcoholism, Just For Detention, and Urban Possibilities and numerous other causes to provide volunteerism opportunities and resources. We have worked with these organization in past volunteerism programs.
 
 We will work hard to curate additional organizations to create “tracks” with meaningful volunteer opportunities, which you normally would not find on your own and to help increase awareness to less-exposed causes in LA. 
 
 For user reward system, we will curate companies and business to provide giveaways, coupons, and more for Los Angelenos who complete “tracks” at retailers such as Starbucks, Target, Best Buy, clothing stores, and more.

 1) Foundation - 8 weeks
 
 a. Leadership
 - Michelle Paul, founder of Proktr, will serve as chief executive. 
 - An advisory board will be formed to help ensure the efficacy of the project. The board will include representation from the established art world, local businesses and digital media experts.
 
 b. Opportunity Assessment. We will conduct research to assess:
 - Artist Engagement: Identify how to best support artists to secure their participation.
 - Venue Engagement: Identify how to best serve venue partners and help drive the goals of their business.
 - Stakeholder Engagement: Get in touch with museums, galleries and other invested bodies to identify points of collaboration.
 - Audience Engagement: Conduct research to understand how to best serve current audiences and target new ones.
 - Legal Discovery: Understand the legal assets needed to execute the project at scale.
 - Digital Audit: Find websites that execute similar functions to determine best practices for user experience.
 
 2) Development - 8 weeks
 
 a. Produce a Program Development Strategy.
 - Employ the insights from the opportunity assessment to define strategic imperatives (what program features must be included for the overall project to be successful).
 - Produce a program roadmap that outlines how to bring the program to market that includes: 
 1. What organizations to form strategic partnerships with. 
 2. How to get artists and venues on to the platform. 
 3. The curating/vetting principles that define how we match art and venues. 
 4. Editorial plan to ensure comprehensive, compelling coverage of art + design programming.
 5. How to drive broad awareness and traffic to the website (leveraging partnerships, social media, etc.)
 
 b. Digital Development
 - Employ the insights from digital audit to define the precise features of the website for a “beta” launch.
 - Create a beta site to test the functionality of the site among a small, curated community.
 - Refine the website for the public launch.
 
 3) Execution - ongoing
 
 a. Program Launch
 - Execute against the program roadmap.
 - Consistently seek feedback from the advisory board, artists, venues, and users for program refinements and enhancements.
 
 b. Digital Launch
 - Push the website live.
 - Conduct analytics to test and refine the website.","Proktr will make Los Angeles the best place to create today by increasing the visibility of our creative residents, increasing ease and ability of participating in our creative community and inspiring all Angelenos (not just those already participating in the art world) with art in their everyday lives. 
 
 In 2050 Proktr will ensure Los Angeles remains the best place to be an artist or designer and that we are known for that fact. Our reputation as a global leader in art will be solidified and our ability to attract and retain human creative capital will be second to none.","Proktr seeks to bring value to the following groups:
 
 Artists:
 - We will increase their visibility by multiplying the places their work can be discovered. 
 - In time, we hope to facilitate the sale of art, contributing to the viability of being an artist in LA. 
 - Through our partnerships with curators, we create another avenue of exposure for their work to breakthrough to the traditional art + design institutions and patrons. 
 
 Small Businesses: 
 - We believe that placing notable, sought out art experiences within local business will make them a destination beyond their standard goods and services and they will gain good will through shared social media and word of mouth. 
 
 Museums + Galleries:
 - Proktr will serve as another channel for traditional museums and galleries to be discovered. 
 - As an aggregating, one-stop location, museums and galleries will benefit by becoming more visible among people more broadly interested in art and design; not just people specifically interested in their institution. This has particular benefit to smaller, lesser known art and design destinations. 
 - By bringing an editorial voice to art and design experiences, Proktr can serve to encourage participation. We will speak to, in a tangible / visual manner, what / why an experience is worth your time - not how it fits in the bigger picture of art criticism. 
 
 Minorities
 - There is a well-documented discrepancy between the current art going public (9% minority) and general public (34% minority). We want to lessen this discrepancy particularly as this city and our nation are projected to be ‘majority-minority’ by the year 2050. By making the best creative work more accessible, more people will have a greater opportunity to become part of the art going public. 
 .
 Overlooked Neighborhoods
 - Cultural pockets such as Downtown, Westwood, Culver City, or Mid-City are largely separate from neighborhoods where artists live and work such as Boyle Heights, Lincoln Heights, Cypress Park or Echo Park. Showcasing the work of community members in that community contributes to neighborhood vitality and strong sense of place. 
 
 Greater Los Angeles
 - The economy of our city in general can benefit from this non-traditional ‘stimulant’. 
 - Our citizens will gain surprise, delight, pride and inspiration from this program.","Sew, a strategy led creative agency based in Los Angeles has committed to joining the advisory board, providing 30 hours a month pro-bono business, marketing and digital consulting, as well as discounted digital and creative development. Sew has produced social impact campaigns, digital products and marketing strategies for brands like Gap, Ford, Verizon Wireless, AAA, 20th Century Fox and more. 
 
 Though there are no other confirmed partnerships, warm relationships have been developed through the current production of Protkr at museums such as MOCA, LACMA, The Hammer, SMMOA, PMCA, The Huntington, The Broad and at many galleries in the city. Through these relationships we hope to establish long term partners, advisory board members, and potential editorial contributors.",1,
4102177,Flight of the Angels - A Pervasive Audio Game About DTLA,"We want to create a game about the past, present, and future of Los Angeles that motivates exploration of the real city and allows other peo",Play,2014073,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050play/projects/FlightOfTheAngels.html,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,"Our game FREEQ did a lot of cool thins - it created an audio world and a mystery to solve that was highly reactive to the choices players made. It’s the kind of game anyone can play (in fact, even the blind can play FREEQ with just their ears and their fingers) – and one that rewards exploration and discovery. It’s a game, yes, but it’s also a mobile journey. We think it’s what Playing in LA2050 is all about. 
 
 The game we built last year isn’t location sensitive. We want to build in some GPS hooks to not only hide clues and content but also provide guidance. Even if you don’t want to get too deep into the game, we want to build some “tour modes” that take the idea of a museum audio tour and crank it up to 11. We also plan to expand the device compatibility of the project so that anyone with a phone they bought in the last few years can definitely experience and enjoy it. 
 
 iBeacons are an example of a new technology that uses low-power Bluetooth to recognize when a user is close to the Beacon to trigger unique content. We plan to, with the participation of various locations, install iBeacons throughout DTLA that will add additional hooks for the game experience. 
 
 But that’s the technology side. On the practical side, we have a game to design, new audio content to write, and exciting new partners we want to work with who are as versed in the history of the area as they are experienced in using unconventional technology to experience it. 
 
 Finally, we know there are other storytellers out there and other experts who could give their own fascinating tours. We plan to use some of the funding to make our authoring system open source – allowing other LA denizens to put together their own adventures and tours accessible via download inside the mobile application.","For the past ten years we’ve made our home in DTLA and become immersed in the history of it. This is extra amazing because some of us weren’t totally enthusiastic about locating our office in such a questionable neighborhood. But then a funny thing happened - we walked the streets and discovered and explored. And soon it wasn’t so questionable and we didn’t feel as unsafe. Other artists and creatives also discovered the neighborhood and also went out and explored and that also made everyone feel safer and more connected. Now more people live there. There are parks and cafes and monthly celebrations of art and culture – and we still can’t convince terrified suburbanites to come and visit us. We think they need a reason to walk the streets and see and learn. 
 
 For a young city on the global scale, Los Angeles has a rich history and some of the most interesting architecture in America. It’s also got its secrets. Small parks hidden away. Delicious food down an alley you’d never think to traverse. One-of-a-kind things in one-of-a-kind shops. We think FLIGHT OF THE ANGELS is absolutely a way to help people discover that great opportunities to play are already all around them. Hopefully we point out a few new ones.
 
 Playing the game itself will also be incredibly rewarding. DTLA has such a colorful and diverse history, and it has a future that now makes us more excited than ever to be a part of it. Science fiction used to be inspiring – we think we could tap that and inspire new play and new experiences through the narrative and visions the game projects over the world the players already live in. By 2050, layered experiences with the digital world overlaid on the physical one look to be more and more likely – this project represents an important opportunity for Los Angeles to take a step forward towards being a city of the future.","Flight of the Angels benefits the people and business of DTLA and its surrounding neighborhoods, first and foremost. It’s a way we can give back to our neighborhood by inviting more people to experience its vibrant rebirth and see the potential for future growth and beautification. 
 
 It also benefits anyone who has ever lived in the city but wants to know more – or wants to share more. We’re very excited about having the ability to open up the content creation process to passionate knowledgeable Angelenos to see what they create and add to the repository of play experiences.","We’re partnering with two important collaborators on this project:
 Firstly, our good friends at Wise Guys Events are geniuses when it comes to creating live play experiences that bring people together for an unexpected good time. We’ve had the pleasure of exhibiting games next to them at a number of games festivals, and hold each other in high regard. Last fall they came up with a brilliant play experience set in DTLA and rooted in the history of the place – they were not able to secure funding, but we’re kindred spirits on wanting to do something cool about DTLA, and we’ve agreed to join forces if the project gets a green light.
 
 Another confirmed collaborator – Nathan Masters is a writer specializing in Los Angeles history. He’s written for KCET, Gizmodo, Los Angeles magazine, and is manager of academic events and programming for the USC Libraries. We worked with Nathan on a previous pervasive media experiment and we’re excited he’s agreed to collaborate with us on this. 
 
 Three critical success factors: communication, participation, and balancing of interests. The game needs to be fun, we want it to be informative, and it should have the right mix. We’re pretty sure the three of us work well together – it’s all about balancing what we each bring to the table.",0,

Local businesses and neighborhood councils within our zone have given their full-hearted support for our free, inclusive festival. City officials will speak at events during the weekend, and the last living protester from the 1967 Black Cat Riots will give a keynote address. We want members of our community to learn about their history, connect with each other, and play in open spaces while forging a deeper love for their neighborhood.
 
 In order to keep this event free for the public, we have raised a significant amount of money through local private donors and in-kind donations. We have engaged site operations specialists who have solved logistics at festivals such as Bonnaroo, Coachella, and Chive Fest to help us execute the street closure aspect of the festival. We’ve assembled a committee of local event producers, artists, and leaders to curate diverse queer programming that tells an exciting and relatable overall story. We’ve engaged local promoters, social media mavens, and local organizations to ensure that the word gets out to the community. Our Advisory Committee includes prominent leaders from organizations such as the American Foundation for Equal Rights (responsible for bringing the Prop 8 case to the Supreme Court) and GLSEN (creating Gay-Straight Alliances in schools). We have engaged local artists, artisans, and non-profits, and will give them a platform to educate and connect with the community.
 
 The main event will be Sunday’s festival and street closure, an outdoor celebration on Santa Monica Blvd. right alongside the hustle and bustle of Sunset Blvd (between Sunset and Hoover). We are working with local government officials to ensure a safe and easy closure. We will build two stages to host the best local queer talent, and we have commissioned fun, interactive, large scale art installations. In the middle of it all, we’ll build a small, urban green space as a kind of pop-up park, which will include a landscape installation with trees, grass, picnic tables, free water, and shade. This area will serve as a unique open space for dance performances, free speech, and impromptu classes.
 
 The festival will occur October 1-5, 2014.","Los Angeles is our city, and Silver Lake is our neighborhood -- today we want to strengthen our relationship with the place we live by celebrating our local queer history and empowering our residents to continue to make history. 
 
 QueerFest’s free and inclusive programming aims to deepen our community’s appreciation for its diverse cultural heritage, and will create a safe place to connect and explore ideas. Showing support for a significant (but historically marginalized) subset of the neighborhood’s culture has the potential to create more harmony within the overall neighborhood. Tenets of safety, diversity, and harmony will allow playful acts such as performances, dialogue, and other interactions to naturally develop. 
 
 Reimagining Santa Monica Blvd. into an open public venue allows for all play to occur in broad daylight. All who are interested in attending, and all ages are welcome - this is not a niche event. The park installation between the two stages will encourage a gathering place for relaxation and free speech. It’s a creative use of temporary outdoor space that enables people who are perfect strangers, of all ethnicities, with disparate income and educational levels, to come together and communicate with each other across every social border and boundary.
 
 In 2050, QueerFest will have encouraged even more community members, businesses, and artists to be in dialogue with local queer history. The festival could be transposed to other neighborhoods in Los Angeles, to help unearth local queer history elsewhere. Los Angeles will continue to be one of the most queer-friendly cities in the U.S., and like many other U.S. cities, will have a festival to help supplement its main PRIDE celebration (which was also founded in LA!).","QueerFest will directly benefit Silver Lake residents, whose relationship with their neighborhood will deepen through participation in our unique programming. That said, individuals from all over Los Angeles (and beyond) will be welcome to attend QueerFest’s events, and learn about our colorful history and culture. 
 
 LGBTQ individuals and their allies from around the city will benefit from the range of programming we plan to offer, which aims to represent a more diverse definition of what it means to be queer today. This is particularly significant for individuals who are just beginning to form their identity as members of the queer community, as well as those who support them.
 
 Los Angeles lovers of culture will benefit from QueerFest’s programming by being exposed to local artists’ cutting-edge performances and creations, while learning more about the complex cultural context of these works.
 
 Local businesses will gain exposure and traffic from the expected 10,000+ attendees over the course of the weekend. 
 
 QueerFest performers and exhibitors will benefit not only from the spotlight offered to them on the festival’s stages, but also from the opportunity to represent and show appreciation for the community they come from.","We are proud to say that QueerFest is a confirmed project of the Pasadena Arts Council’s EMERGE Program, and that PAC will serve as our project’s 501(c)(3) fiscal sponsor. PAC serves as fiscal sponsor for install:WEHO, Native Strategies, Fallen Fruit, and KCHUNG in Chinatown. All donations to PAC specified for QueerFest will be tax deductible, and the staff of the Pasadena Arts Council has shared their extensive knowledge on how to run a successful festival and fundraise for a large scale arts project. 
 
 Critical to this collaboration: constant communication between the QueerFest committee and Pasadena Arts Council regarding budget/expenses; Pasadena Arts Council’s pre-approval on all grant applications; and their assistance on reaching out to their base for fundraising opportunities. 
 
 Additionally, in order for this festival to be a success, we must partner with local businesses. The Black Cat (a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument) has donated use of its space, as well as the adjacent raw space, to QueerFest. Programming site-specific aspects of QueerFest in this hallowed and historically queer space is a significant centerpiece to the fest, and gives it weight. Mack Sennett Studios have donated stages for screenings and a Launch Event. The Eagle LA, Akbar, and Hyperion Tavern have offered to host historic events and interventions in their venues.
 
 We have also collaborated with the Mayor's Office to produce the LGBT Heritage Month Closing Night, and are working closely with many additional city offices to ensure this festival is safe and significant for the community.",1,

4102182,Row Gallery Foundation: Empowering Artists from All Walks of Life,We hope to connect underprivileged artists to a larger audience by providing both a physical & online space where they can share their work.,Create,2014077,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050create/projects/RowGallery.html,,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,Wherever art-based non-profits exist!,"We plan on implementing this idea by first developing a fully functional interface where the organizations can upload the work. Account management will be done within our servers through either WooCommerce or a platform like Shopify. Payouts to the organizations will happen twice a month - we always makes sure that all sales are fully transparent to the account holders and their associated accounts. Much like Society6.com, we hope to offer prints and original artwork for sale (the major difference being we will deal specifically with underprivileged artists). A web developer will set up an API feed between the site and our manufacturing and printing partners so fulfillment can be instantly handled. Eventually, manufacturing and printing will all be managed in-house.
 
 After creating our site, we will continue securing partnerships with creative non-profits, foster homes, and any other foundation that supports disadvantaged artists to expand our gallery. Brochures, videos, and financial statements will all be made available to strengthen our pitch.","As stated earlier, this project will hopefully bring together all of the art-based non-profits in Los Angeles to work together on improving the lives of the people they help. Through our website, we will create an ecosystem where non-profits can encourage their artists to not only create art but collaborate with similar groups of people. Furthermore, professional artists and groups can connect through our website to specific artists or non-profits that we have partnered with to teach, create, and inspire. 
 
 By 2050, we will hopefully be able to create a cohesive Los Angeles art unit, where creativity comes from all parts of Los Angeles and in different form of collaborations. Not only will we become a permanent gallery for artists and creative organizations, but a powerful support system as well.","Our project will ideally benefit all creatives in Los Angeles and eventually nationwide. 
 
 First, the underprivileged artists will be able to sell and showcase their work on our website at all times of the day, giving them the ability to independently present their work to anyone with internet access. Non-profits will be able to upload the work for the artists.
 
 Next, the creative non-profits can utilize our platform to showcase what they do. Each organization can have a biography and link to their own site, and if any of them want to reach out to each other, its as simple as clicking a button.
 
 Finally, all artists and creatives can connect with the artists or non-profits directly through our site. With proper funding, we can even host large scale collaborations, fundraisers, or art events that span all social groups.","Our current (confirmed) partnerships consist of businesses, non-profits, and creative studios:
 1) LA Lofts Realty helps provides their wonderful office on the corner of 6th and Spring twice a year on Art Walk for us to showcase the works of professional and underprivileged artists in a physical space.
 
 2) DTLALIFE magazine helps advertise our events to the ~200,000 readers they have. Similarly, the Downtown Art Walk featured us on their website's front page for our first show to help raise awareness.
 
 3) The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf provides free products for our events, which helps volunteers stay in top shape and the visitors to enjoy great coffee during the shows. Through their connections, NeuroGum connects Row Gallery with UCLA doctors to help tackle mental health from a medical perspective.
 
 4) Most importantly, the Lamp Community and their artists contribute their amazing artwork to the shows. We have showcased and sold their work and are looking forward to collaborating with them through our online platform as well. Furthermore, many volunteers that work with Lamp help us on our projects, giving us further support.
 
 5) In addition, we work with many art studios in the area. Andre Miripolsky, Eva Napp, and Mary Woronov all showed their amazing artwork at our shows, boosting the amount of foot traffic that comes in. These spaces can also provide art printing services for our online store.
 
 
 Given these relationships, the three factors most critical to our success are:
 1) Building a larger network of creative non-profits that all talk with each other. We want to expand Row Gallery because many creative non-profits fight for the same cause. If we come together, we can move one step closer to enriching lives.
 
 2) Increasing the amount of art education that goes into the LA community. Row Gallery hopes to provide the tools necessary to help empower people through art.
 
 3) Ensuring a space where the physical gallery can grow. Currently, there are no spaces in LA that specifically showcases artwork from both professionals and working artists. Why not change that?",1,
4102184,Sabio & Crossroads working together to incubate diverse tech talent in Los Angeles.,We are going to train South LA Latino and African American young adults to become exceptional creators using web technology and film.,Create,2014078,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050create/projects/Transformation.html,,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,,"If the LA2050 Challenge Grant were to be awarded to The Sabio Crossroads Creative Tech Training Program (Creative Tech) it would be implemented via a three phased approach: 1) intake; 2) intensive tech training; 3) case management & follow-up.
 The intake phase would take place the first three months of the program, where by Crossroads would the first market the Creative Tech programming to its current list of over 200 clients. They will be given information about the program and be given pre-work.
 Then an interview committee will interview individuals that have completed the pre-work and that attended one of the information sessions. Ten individuals will be selected to move on to the final phase of the intake phase, the hands-on pre-screen.
 The second phase of the program will be the intensive accelerated learning program, with the goal of creating innovative tech creators that represent the rich cultural fabric of Los Angeles. We will utilize an immersive and intensive learning environment to create a workforce that sets the standard for entry-level tech-media technologists. In addition, the training program will simultaneously serve to cure the current imbalance in the existing technology workforce, which suffers from a largely homogeneous make up. 
 This tech training can be completed in 12 weeks, where the cohort will meet from 8am until 6pm, Monday – Friday, with a seasoned, senior-level software architect acting as their trainer and mentor. The training will be project based, and centered on the delivery of a new media software product. The lead instructor has a proven track record of already running these types of intensive training program for the past 12 months, with a 100% job placement rate. This model of intensive training has also been successfully implemented in various parts of the country, such as San Francisco and New York City.
 Because the Creative Tech cohort will be constituted with individuals from communities plagued with violence, and may have been previously incarcerated, to ensure they receive the emotional and social support required to fully re-entry the workforce, and community at large, the fellows will be required to have weekly meetings with their case managers throughout the 12 weeks of tech training.","The Sabio Crossroads Creative Tech Cohort will make Los Angeles the best place to create 12 months following our LA2050 Challenge Grant because it will produce exceptionally well trained web creators, that are also ethnically diverse, which match the cultural fabric of the City. Once this Creative Tech program is launched, lessons will be learned, the Fellows will be out in the workforce collaborating with various media professionals, and contributing to the growing knowledge base of the program, and the program will be scaled to serve hundreds of other diverse Fellows throughout the City. 
 Los Angeles is an exceptionally diverse community, with individuals from the entire world making this their home. The largest cultural group is Latino at 58%, followed by 42% Non-Hispanic Whites, approximately 11% Asian, and approximately 10% African American. 
 Los Angeles is also undeniably the Creative Capital of the world, with many exceptional large studios situated in Los Angeles County. In addition to the large formal media complex currently operating throughout the LA region, there is also a thriving independent film and creative arts community that is also creating opportunities for various type of entrepreneurial creators.","Three separate groups will benefit as a result of the LA2050 Grant Challenge Grant: 1) Six Latino and African American Creative Tech Fellows (clients of Crossroads), 2) Sabio, and 3) SoCalCrossroads,. 
 Six Crossroads Clients, 50% Latino and 50% African American young adults, ages 18-35, both male and female, will be selected to become Creative Tech Fellows. Each of the Fellows will receive a laptop to train months three – six, also, they will benefit from the 12 week intensive tech training, as well as the case management and the follow-on six-week professional development training offered by Sabio and Crossroads. The six Latino and African American individuals will most likely be members of the low-income community, with low-job prospects in the tech sector. Although Crossroads currently has funding resources to help their clients secure some vocational training, they do not have sufficient funding to provide technical training; therefore, but for the LA2050 Challenge Grant. Once these six individuals complete the program, they will have skills that are in high demand, not only in the creative capital of the world, but basically in any major metropolitan area. Enabling them to become transformative story-tellers and possibly tech entrepreneurs, if they so desire. Once they have the web development skills, the trajectory of their lives will be completely changed as a result of this program.
 
 Sabio is a developer training program born out of necessity, desire and hope. The necessity of bringing more women and minorities into the world of technology. A desire to see a diverse workforce that’s vibrant and innovative. And a hope to uplift the communities that suffer from the highest rates of unemployment and worst educational resources to a higher socioeconomic status through technology training.
 There is an opportunity for a better life waiting for various diverse creators in Los Angeles. An opportunity to acquire a skill set that that hiring managers and entrepreneurs are anxious to find. A chance to earn your way into a career that enjoys an unemployment rate half that of the national average. 
 Crossroads is a non-profit 501c(3) organization that was created to assist under privileged individuals who come from low-income families in violence plagued communities. Their objective is to lead them to a Healthy, Peaceful and Productive lifestyle through prevention, intervention & re-entry services.","Both Crossroads and Sabio are organizations that are deeply rooted in the local Los Angeles community, and have cultivated a number of key-strategic partnership throughout their tenure, and are eager to collaborate with other organizations also looking to make a positive impact on the lives of young adults. 
 
 For example, Crossroads was born out of a collaboration with St. Francis Medical Center, and their’ focus is on addressing youth and gang violence. The St. Francis Medial Center has been an instrumental partner since their inception, providing facilities, volunteers, and financial support throughout the years. 
 
 Similarly, Sabio is also a local Los Angeles organization that has benefited from various joint ventures with various organizations. For example, HubLA was one of their first collaborators, allowing Sabio to use space at a reduced rate, and also providing marketing capacity. Sabio has collaborated with other area nonprofits such as DIY Girls to host Learn To Code workshops, and local college alumni associations to do tech training. 
 Both organizations believe in the power of collaboration and understand that relationships and partnerships foster positive results and outcomes. That same approach and philosophy will be employed, and will be central, in the Creative Tech Cohort: 
 
 Sabio and Crossroads have developed relationships with the following organizations, and are ready to collaborate with them to bring additional capacity to the Creative Tech Cohort: 
 MasWired – a Latino online media platform features tech creators and innovators. This online platform needs web interns to help build and modify its online content. 
 Disney – has agreed to review resumes and to provide interviews to individuals with full-stack web development expertise.
 WalMart – Bentonville, AK – various opportunities are available for individuals that have full-stack web development expertise. They have reached-out and are interested in reviewing Sabio Fellow’s resumes to identify potential candidates to be interviewed.

4102187,Schkapf Performing Arts Incubator,Schkapf aims to create a permanent performing arts incubator that provides a support system and career development for LA artists.,Create,2014079,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050create/projects/schkapf.html,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,"Building upon our 10-year track record as a presenting theatre and home to a resident theatre laboratory, Schkapf will expand its pilot programming capacity to increase our functionality as an incubation house for artists as entrepreneurs. In order to achieve this goal, Schkapf will:
 
 (1) Cultivate its current intern team into sustainable staff positions, including Development, Programming and Education Directors, as well as a Cultural Liaison to engage with neighborhood, academic, and business partners.
 
 (2) Select five ensembles or individuals to incubate projects. Recipients will be guided through their creation process with resource-sharing, space-sharing, professional development classes, and expert feedback. They will hold consistent public showings of work-in-progress, and will serve as case studies in the further development of the incubation model.
 
 (3) Expand the School of Embodied Acting to hold regular fee-based classes with established local, national and international teachers in order to improve the caliber of work created in Los Angeles and make it competitive in a wider market.
 
 (4) Secure partnerships with at least three new partners, including a local vendor, school, and other nonprofit, to cross-promote and support, creating a positive feedback loop within cultural and economic ecosystems. The areas we are focused on are: 
 (a) the creation of our research library and commissary as a neighborhood hangout that serves the Theatre Row Association and Central Hollywood, and acts as a hub for artists within the wider LA County area to exchange ideas, do research, and be inspired by installations, video and audio recordings situated throughout the space; 
 
 (b) the building of stable foundations for a wider alternative touring network on the West Coast specifically for, but not limited to, physical, collectively created, visually ambitious, and cross-disciplinary live performance that will serve as a viable way for LA artists to bring their work to other communities and generate more income; 
 
 (c) the development of a more vibrant educational interface bridging students and faculty of LA’s rich universities with local practitioners, thus generating more research networks and potential funding revenue for the universities, a clearer understanding of the current artistic field for students, and a more robust pool of patrons and artists at Schkapf.","Today, independent artists interested in live performance in Los Angeles contend with the mega-industry that is film and television while receiving minimal support from government and local nonprofits. While many theatres have ‘new works’ series, few incubate projects from inception to completion. University settings are fertile breeding grounds for experimentation, but too often do not communicate with local practitioner groups. The result is a broken pipeline in which much of the city’s best talent does not have a venue to hone their craft, connect with fellow artists, and key into the communities that they exist to serve.
 Schkapf’s project challenges the production status quo, creating new environments for industry professionals to develop and expand their artistry, raise the culture of live performance in LA to a competitive standard on the national and international scenes and generate more economic viability for artists seeking community engagement and experimenting with new work.
 By 2050 we envision Schkapf to be a vibrant artist live/work village providing onsite livelihood for hundreds of artists. This means easily accessible work and rehearsal space, a state-of-the-art flexible performing arts centre capable of meeting a wide variety of performance demands, and a robust and unique School of Embodied Acting with its own pedagogical paradigm that serves as a node in an international training scheme. It also means a performance research library and bookstore, artisan retail shops, a cafe/restaurant, and rotating interfaces (galleries, installations, screenings, hands-on learning opportunities) for the wider education and recruitment of audiences. This village will not only directly change the ways in which performance is created in Los Angeles, dramatically increasing access to the means of production, but will also add to a more educated and interactive audience support base for live performance in LA County. Schkapf will not only be incubating world class homegrown LA performance, but, unlike the majority of presenting houses currently in LA, Schkapf will directly collaborate with international artists to incubate work that impacts and serves the residents of LA County.","Our project benefits the performing arts communities of Los Angeles and their audiences, specifically but not limited to, those interested in physical, visual, ensemble and cross-disciplinary work. It will also benefit the surrounding neighborhood of Schkapf by creating a Cultural Liaison with the intent of bridging the artist-driven work at Schkapf with local residents, creating more dialogue around the use and value of live performance as well as developing mutual bonds that will cultivate respect, care, and pride in the neighborhood itself. Our project also aims to benefit our partner organizations: the local vendor, school, and nonprofit that we engage with in order to mutually grow, or further sustain, our respective organizations.","Schkapf has a robust network of sustained partners that it has been collaborating and consulting with to create the first stage of its development. In the performing arts context these include The Clown School (local), the Network of Ensemble Theaters and Celebration Barn (national), Slava Polunin, Au Brana, Awake Projects, the Grotowski Institute and the London School of Performing Arts Practices (international). In a local government context, Schkapf is an active participant in the Central Hollywood Neighborhood Council, Media Business Improvement District, and the Theatre Row Association as well as seeks regular consultation from Arts for LA and the Department of Cultural Affairs. In an academic context, Schkapf has partners at USC, CalArts, CSU/LA (local), Naropa, Emerson and Brown University (national), the Laboratory Theatre Network, the University of Leeds, the University of Huddersfield, and the University of Kent (international), as well as notable independent scholars, such as Kathryn Mederos Syssoyeva and John Britton. We will continue to work extensively with these partners in the visioning and implementation of Stage 2 of this project. Schkapf will also reach out to local theatres that have successfully created multi-faceted neighborhood hubs, such as the Bootleg Theatre (which is also a bar and music venue) and Greenway Arts Alliance (which partners with its local school and vendors) and international organizations such as the National Theatre Studio (a research and development organization that ensures innovative new performance for England’s regional theatres) and the Battersea Arts Centre (a collective of producers who have renovated an historic London Town Hall in order to incubate a variety of performance capable of “inventing the future of theatre”) to further develop our programming and ensure that stage 2 is sustainable and influential. Furthermore, we will identify and begin collaborating with new partners capable of assisting in the creation of an operational and revenue-producing commissary, the foundations for a sustainable touring network, and a university-to-industry pipeline.",1,

Vorenberg, President of ArtAge and a nationally recognized expert in senior theatre, and according to AARP, senior theatre is one of the fastest-growing recreation and culture trends in the country. Los Angeles stands to benefit from this growing trend with the niche entertainment that Senior Star Power offers. The city is already actively involved in supporting theatre venues as a key component in all arts- and culture-promotion projects with a special emphasis on Hollywood and the downtown Broadway areas. It was noted recently that Los Angeles saw a record-breaking 42.1 million visitors in 2013, a factor which will drive city investment in tourism in years to come. With the influx of new and innovative creative theatre, LA can reach the 50 million+ visitors goal. A case in point: In 2012, Branson, Missouri welcomed over 7.3 million visitors. Tourism is the Branson/Lakes Area's chief industry, with an estimated $2.9 billion in tourism-related spending in 2012. Average age of visitors was 58 years. 79% of activities participated in were shows. Senior Star Power can bring these tourists and their spending power to Los Angeles.","Senior Star Power's project will directly benefit the aging population of 60+ years and indirectly benefit the entire Los Angeles community. There’s no doubt that all of these aging adults wish to keep active and vital. Along with this wish, comes, for many in Los Angeles, a strong interest in activities structured around entertainment and performing arts, especially theatre. Senior citizens now account for 20 of every 100 adults of working age in the greater Los Angeles area, and by 2034, that number will reach 36 of every 100 adults. That’s a gain of nearly 1 million senior citizens in the area. By 2050 it is projected that the number will be 50 of every 100 adults.","We will engage all government, civic, education, nonprofit, and faith-based organizations to participate in our activities. We will also work with local travel and hospitality businesses to develop tourist packages including lodging, bus tours, dining, shopping, and other entertainment attractions that will encourage visitors to stay multiple days in the city.",0,

 Community-engaged research will have residents actively investigate issues of the neighborhood while collecting supporting data and continuing community engagement and outreach. Instead of Skid Row residents being the subject of research, Our Skid Row plans to switch the role and have Skid Row residents pose questions, implement fieldwork to collect supporting information and draw conclusions from the process. Accessible and impactful research tools, such as graphic surveys and interpretive mapping will be tested and refined to maximize impact. Additionally, the participation station- a mobile design kiosk will be available for additional data collection, conversation, and street workshops.
 
 Participatory design workshops will create an outlet for residents and stakeholders to engage in generating design solutions to community identified issues. Our Skid Row will work with resident designers to move through an iterative process that begins to represent possible solutions. Design support will come from in-house staff, as well as our network of nationally recognized leaders in design and community-engaged planning. Additionally, continuous design workshops will hone in on developing drawing and technical design skills. Short design activities will provide low-commitment outlets for artistic and creative expression. Workshops will include model-making exercises, photography and drawing. Resident facilitators will also be trained, so that they can lead the design process as well.
 
 Public Actions will focus on events and built works in the community that celebrate the neighborhood, provide new resources, and support meaningful connections. With Our Skid Row designers, we will create public events that foster a larger dialog around the power of place and equitable community development. Additionally, small built works will be installed in the community to amplify existing assets and provide new amenities to the area. This will be an opportunity to share the successes of our Skid Row with Los Angeles and beyond. 
 
 We will celebrate Skid Row as a place of design innovation!","Our Skid Row will provide a creative outlet for Angelenos to explore collective definitions of sustainable and equitable place-making. The project functions on multiple scales and time frames. In the 2050 time table, Our Skid Row lays out a roadmap for a socially and physically sustainable community though a comprehensive neighborhood plan and implementation strategy. For today, Our Skid Row residents will identify specific underutilized spaces, and design catalytic projects that will begin steps towards the long-term vision.
 
 Our Skid Row creates a platform for Skid Row residents, small business owners, and other committed stakeholders, to be involved in the creative design process and actively shape their environment. The goal is to bring design out of the ivory tower and put design decisions and direction in the hands of the end user, so that communities can create the most impact and generate greater diversity in the conversation of community development.
 
 Additionally, tools and processes will be closely documented and shared on our website, so that we can foster additional innovations in participatory design and encourage other communities to positively impact their built environment.
 
 Our Skid Row will develop local creative jobs to Skid Row residents, opportunities for young designers to hold positions in public interest design, and volunteers from across the city to engage in improving Los Angeles. Additionally, the project supports the community to think critically about their built condition and analytically develop skills that can positively change their community.","Multiple publics will benefit from Our Skid Row, including Skid Row residents, downtown stakeholders, and Los Angeles County. The residents, both the housed and unhoused population, will have the opportunity to voice their visions and generate design solutions for their own neighborhood. This is an opportunity to increase a sense of ownership and civic involvement in their community. Additionally, community-driven improvements to the neighborhood will begin building bridges to the rapidly developing downtown area, creating shared resources and amenities, and opportunities for interaction between residents, business owners, and visitors, creating a more cohesive region. Lastly, Los Angeles County will benefit from focused efforts to equitably develop the lowest income and most under-resourced area of the region.
 
 Specifically, existing organizations and residents in Skid Row will have access to affordable and pro-bono design resources that did not exist before. By creating a design outlet in the area, residents will have additional activities to contribute to. We will work together to design, build, and install small-scale design interventions in the public realm. The design and development process will also create many opportunities for volunteerism and community-engagement.
 
 At first, building small scale projects can support new programs and offer new amenities that are lacking in the area. This can lead to larger infrastructural developments, attract private impact investments, and may offer local job opportunities along with physical improvements.","Our Skid Row will be a community resource that all neighborhood organizations and residents have access to. We will also leverage our design network to enhance design support resources and build upon existing collaborations and partnerships with organizations in the community. Three critical factors are outreach, accessibility, and continuity. To ensure welcomed participation of all residents and organizations in the area, street and organizational outreach will be implemented for all programming. Activities will be accessible and will not limit participation due to lack of technical abilities. Lastly, programming will be continuous to nurture cumulative growth, involvement and leadership development.",1,

Organizations that have shown expertise over decades, increased resources and moved key policy will assist newer nonprofits and leaders to strengthen their organizations and achieve their missions. Local veteran nonprofits could earn millions over time through quality consulting and organizational development services. SoACT will coordinate, train and support these nonprofits to develop their consulting practices and expand indigenous knowledge. With consolidated marketing using social media and effective strategic planning, we will collaborate to keep consulting dollars in South LA and build a robust nonprofit scaffold.","1) Train and support 9 South LA partners to provide local capacity building services
 
 SoACT is partnering with South LA nonprofits led by people of color that are committed to cultivating a strong nonprofit infrastructure in South LA and ready to become capacity builders in this project. Our founding partners who have shaped this project with us are Community Coalition, Jenesse Center, and Strategic Concepts in Organizing and Policy Education (SCOPE). We are reaching out to additional organizations that have: 1) a track record of providing effective peer learning and consulting; 2) organizational capacity and designated staff to become capacity builders; 3) sound fiscal and organizational health; and 4) board and leadership commitment to develop their capacity building program.
 
 2) Connect 100 South LA nonprofits that want to receive capacity building services from their peers to provide these services
 
 To identify these organizations, we are reaching out to South LA nonprofits that demonstrate: 1) readiness to be an active partner in the consulting process and accountable for implementation; 2) investment in developing staff capacity to meet outcomes; 3) pursuit of consulting topics driven by organizational priorities and strategic plan; and 4) commitment to move beyond a transactional model and build lasting organizational capacity.
 
 3) Provide the infrastructure to sustain and strengthen the project
 
 SoACT will be responsible for fund and resource development, business planning and evaluation of the project. We aim to demonstrate that peer learning and consulting for and by South LA nonprofits is both financially sustainable and organizationally impactful. We will expand use of social media and work to improve network density among organizations focused on earned income, developing expertise and improving capacity.","Our project will help make LA the best place to connect today with a website that POPS with engaging content on capacity building; a blog on what we are learning and how it is being used to improve our community; “TA Cafes” with technical assistance on thorny topics where folks need face-to-face inspiration; and webinars that reach those who work to engage voters, improve transit and green spaces, find better food and connect with youth and emerging leaders. By 2050, we will have a critical mass of well-trained leaders and managers to move agendas of equity and justice and sustain revitalized and innovative nonprofits. Nonprofits will have easier access to technical assistance to improve systems and make better use of volunteers. With stronger, more collaborative and strategic community organizations, South LA residents will receive better services, play a larger role in the governance of local organizations, and find new pathways to engage in community. 
 
 We will help make LA the best place to connect by:
 
 1) Developing the capacity and leadership of people of color-led organizations in South LA, reflecting our population 
 
 2) Mining peer networks and peer learning (Sharing expertise, valuing local knowledge and voices, and exercising a deep commitment to collaboration, coordination and leveraging organizational strengths)
 
 3) Strengthening social change and movement building in South LA (Prioritizing work that is rooted in community organizing and the empowerment of South LA residents, and amplifying the collective work of local organizations and individuals)
 
 4) Improving outcomes for organizations and residents in South LA, including quality of life and economic indicators
 
 5) Developing culturally responsive curricula that builds capacity (We define capacity as our partner SCOPE does: the lasting skills, tools and expertise an organization needs to succeed)
 
 6) Supporting the sustainability of capacity building partners with scaffolds of tools and resources to support and sustain innovation at the community level","Our project will benefit the leadership, staff, members and clients of the 100 South LA nonprofits who will receive capacity building services – including the 20 who receive individualized consulting – the 9 South LA nonprofits who will provide these services, and the communities that these organizations serve. We are particularly committed to working with nonprofits invested in civic engagement, local community building and grassroots organizing, including social service agencies that seek to understand and engage their clients as a constituency. 
 
 This project will benefit South LA organizations working on each of LA2050’s goals. We believe that the LA2050 goals can be met in South LA if the nonprofits tasked with meeting them are strong and if the community infrastructure that they are a part of has the tools to support innovation. In a 2013 report on the state of nonprofits in LA County, UCLA’s Luskin School of Public Affairs found an extreme service gap in low-income communities: nonprofits exist in the lowest numbers in poor neighborhoods [http://civilsociety.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/publication-pdf/2013%20Report-web_copy.pdf]. This means that, right now, the people in Los Angeles who have the least support are those who essentially need it the most. Our project’s focus on South LA represents a desire to reverse this service gap and a long-term commitment to communities of color. We believe that our project the first step in designing a model that can be replicated citywide.","We are thrilled to report that Community Coalition [www.cocosouthla.org], Jenesse Center [www.jenesse.org], and Strategic Concepts in Organizing and Policy Education [www.scopela.org] came on in 2013 and have developed the project with SoACT. Each brings 21-34 years of organizing and/or providing services as a people of color-led nonprofit in South LA, a history of positive outcomes in South LA, and experience providing technical assistance and training to other nonprofits. Through Community Coalition’s Prevention Network, clients and staff from local social service agencies get trained in organizational development, sustainability and strategic planning, and connect with funders. In the Peer Learning Collaborative on Cultural Competency, Jenesse Center mentors and provides technical assistance to domestic violence organizations in CA improving how they serve the Black community. At SCOPE, trainings on topics like civic participation, fund development and coalition building build the capacity of campaigns that impact low-income communities of color nationwide.
 
 SoACT intends to add 6 additional South LA nonprofits as capacity building partners in 2015. We are also eager to connect with collaborators through this grant challenge and excited by ideas generated at the #LA2050Collaborates meetings, including “investing in grant readiness for communities that need it to secure more funding, e.g., South LA” (Goal Notes: LIVE) and “create a coalition, or at least some sort of support group, where these different LA orgs can continually share challenges, opportunities, needs” (Goal Notes: LEARN).
 
 CompassPoint Nonprofit Services [http://www.compasspoint.org/] is an additional committed partner, assisting in training, coaching and curriculum development. While based in the Bay Area, they literally have written the textbooks on consulting, coaching, facilitation and other tools and techniques. With their commitment and expertise, CompassPoint will benefit us by expediting the facilitator process and by providing coaching to the SoACT capacity building team. 
 
 Three factors critical to the success of our project include: maintaining credible and responsive relationships with SLA nonprofits; maximizing the use of social network tools to engage and make more readily available capacity building knowledge; and cultural competence and responsiveness to the unique needs of diverse organizations.",
4102194,BALKAN - L.A. CULTURAL CROSSROADS,SEEFest’s year-long program showcasing the CULTURES OF THE BALKANS through films and live performances by Los Angeles artists.,Play,2014083,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050play/projects/BalkansLA.html,,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,,"SEE Fest LA will invite Los Angeles-based film-makers and artists who have either emigrated to Los Angeles and/or are residents of Los Angeles who are of Balkan descent to present SEE films and related cultural activities, including food, dance, music, theatre, the visual arts, etc. Participants of the Balkans-LA project will also include Los Angeles-based artists who are not of SEE or Balkan descent to properly cross pollinate and collaborate while building understanding of SEE cultures as the blend with the diverse cultural landscape of Los Angeles. Further, Balkan-LA programming will invite Balkan filmmakers and artists who still live in SEE countries to present their works to the community of Los Angeles to broaden the horizons and world-wide understanding of SEE cultures. 
 
 Balkan-LA will host monthly events (film, music, dance, visual arts, exhibitions, and theatre) during the coming year and hopes that LA2050 will choose to support these ventures. SEE Fest LA believes that the arts have the power to build bridges amongst diverse cultures and communities to build a LA2050 whose residents, although diverse, can engage and appreciate differences while living together in peace and cohesion. Balkan-LA will weave the cultural fabric of Los Angeles through fostering cross-cultural collaboration and discourse on the similarities, dissimilarities, and the ties that bind through education, exposure, and engagement in the arts while encouraging arts participation by all residents of Los Angeles.","The Balkan cultures have given us geniuses like Serbian-American scientist and inventor Nikola Tesla, notorious events like the assassination in Sarajevo in 1914 which precipitated WWI, Hollywood mythology based on the character of Count Dracula, and world figures like Mother Theresa. There is hardly a better place than Los Angeles for the very diverse content from a European frontier to fit culturally and engage its peers. 
 
 SEEfest wants to put in place a comprehensive year-round program of film screenings and cultural events highlighting the contributions of SEE countries to the world’s cultures. With our Balkans-LA project we will add one missing jewel to the cultural crown of Los Angeles, a development which will not go unnoticed in 15+ countries of the South East European region. We plan to bring the best cultural representatives from SEE countries to visit L.A. and lay the ground work for lasting creative connections between South East Europe and Los Angeles. Our activities will be spread all over L.A. in different communities, engaging people of South East European (SEE) descent, often marginalized because their languages are too small and they are geographically too scattered to register on the larger map of our city. 
 
 Our Project will promote social cohesion among Americans from Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Georgia in the Caucasus, Hungary, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Romania, Serbia, Slovenia, Turkey (and other ‘pockets’ of smaller ethnic/linguistic groups from Eastern Europe) and will achieve this with programs that are representative of these cultures and possess qualities that can attract more mainstream American audiences at large. For 10 years SEEfest has been working towards this goal to reach across demographic and ethnic divides, and build social cohesion and mutual understanding within SEE demographics, fostering their integration and sense of pride. The cultural crossroads of the Balkans and surrounding countries resonate with an ethnically, culturally and linguistically diverse city like L.A. Our Project wants to tap into this diversity which is a social capital and resource still little used. This human resource has the desire and potential to burst onto the scene and create new artistic and cultural content, and our Project wants to provide programs for this creativity to be seen and find its place within the creative industries sector of Los Angeles.","LA2050 grant will enable SEEfest to serve audiences of SEE descent, marginalized because their ethnic groups and languages are too small if taken individually, promote social cohesion between disparate SEE groups and at the same time foster social interaction with American audiences through artistic collaborations, programs, events, cross-cultural collaboration and discourse on the similarities, dissimilarities, and the ties that bind. By targeting culturally isolated groups across Los Angeles County the Project will bring a unifying sense of belonging and, we hope, contribute to building their L.A.-specific identity. 
 
 Large part of our efforts will be devoted to audience outreach and student-related activities. If funded, the Project will expand opportunities for training and transfer of skills for youth and students from local public schools involved in our partner's career technical education curriculum. We plan to engage them in every aspect of the Project and provide ample opportunities to learn, practice, interact with accomplished artists whose ethnic and cultural background is just as diverse as theirs. We believe that social backgrounds of people involved in the Project and the type of programs we plan to do will convey a sense of inclusiveness to student population from underprivileged communities. For bi-lingual youth with recent immigrant experience there is a stronger sense of identification with our Project's people who are also bi-lingual or tri-lingual emigres, and whose stories, music, films, plays, even jokes mimic the same feeling of displacement and struggle to fit in. 
 
 The best arts programs from South Eastern Europe and rich historical, ethnic and cultural perspective will act as a catalyst for social cohesion between diverse segments of our target population. Student audience is all bi-lingual, Spanish-English, with a small portion of bi-lingual youth from SEE countries. Our programs will resonate with student audience because they speak of experiences that mirror their own, however remote SEE countries may be from South America or southern California. Our youth outreach to date, with participation from Hollywood High School, Duarte HS, and School of Global Studies has proven that we were on the right track. The acorn has been planted. LA2050 funding will make our BalkansLA Project feasible and open the doors to advancement and ultimately job placements for our youth participants.","We have identified and confirmed collaborative partnerships with KLCS-TV and the Los Angeles Unified School District, specifically LAUSD’s career technical education in several LAUSD schools. 
 
 These partnerships are two-fold, contributing towards development of our programs and ideas, and channeling student integration in the programs with job training. 
 
 Our partner KLCS-TV is the PBS-affiliated station and a multiple Emmy® Award winner, broadcasting to over sixteen million viewers throughout Southern California on DirecTV, Dish Network, and most cable systems. It is a licensee of the Los Angeles Unified School District, providing over 80,000 hours of instructional/informational content annually. 
 
 SEEfest first partnered with KLCS-TV in 2010 to promote the annual film festival, progressing to SEEfest cultural and business programs, and production of filmed segments. 
 
 Project partner KLCS-TV responsibilities will include broadcasting films and new original Tv program, featuring artists from Los Angeles in lively short segments about musical, folk, dance, literary, craft and food traditions of the Balkan people. KLCS will contribute station staff and technical resources. 
 
 Project partner C.T.E, Career technical education staff, in conjunction with KLCS and LAUSD, will be responsible for local curatorial assistance in developing tailored programs for student demographics, identifying and recruiting from the pool of SEEfest those L.A.-based artists best suited for the transfer of skills needed in the L.A. creative industries marketplace: production jobs, story boarding, editing, composing and scoring music, copy writing, set decoration, lighting, filming. SEEfest will provide access to real-life training for these budding photographers, camera operators, crafts services students all of whom come from underprivileged neighborhoods of L.A. With their bi-lingual background and recent immigrant experience they don't have an easy access to on the job training and SEEfest has a track record of providing opportunities for this student population.

LA 2015 will be the largest event in LA since the 1984 Olympics. 7,000 athletes from 177 countries will compete in 25 events over 9 days supported by 3,000 coaches and 30,000 volunteers. 500,000 spectators will enjoy LA’s world-class venues, including the Athlete Villages hosted at USC and UCLA, and Opening Ceremony at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. 500,000 spectators and visitors will experience LA’s destinations, a projected $415 million boost to the local economy. Special programs include athlete physical exams, Host Town and festivals at USC & UCLA.","The 2015 Special Olympics World Summer Games Organizing Committee, Inc. (GOC) is the nonprofit operating and management structure set up to fulfill the mission of funding, planning, and staging LA2015. LA2015 will require the skills of 157 paid staff, 220 student interns, plus 30,000 volunteers. Our anticipated costs over a four-year period ending December 2015 are expected to total $74 million. Some of that will be covered with corporate sponsorships, Opening Ceremony tickets, and merchandise sales, as well contributed services and donated product. But $30 million will come from foundations, government and individuals. 
 
 Extensive planning is required to develop the operational plans necessary for the production of an event on the scale of the Olympics. The GOC hosted Invitational Games June 6-8, 2014 at USC and Griffith Park. This event hosted athletes from 13 countries, which allowed the GOC to test plans for competition venues, airport arrivals/departures, medical operations and Healthy Athletes, delegation services, language services, credentialing, food & housing, and limited transportation and security. Overall this event was a great success and enabled the GOC to learn some important lessons when planning for LA2015. 
 
 In order to scale operations and meet the demands of an extensive hiring plan, LA2015 is heavily utilizing social media and awareness marketing. The GOC has created an amplifier program to give all LA2015 partners the tools to seamlessly share LA2015 content with their networks. LA2015 has created “Support An Athlete,” an online campaign where individuals can sponsor and be connected with their athlete. Finally, the volunteer recruitment plan launched in December 2013, with the objective of finding nearly 30,000 local individuals, from physicians to parking attendants. For the first time in World Games history the GOC has implemented a CRM database, which has already expanded registration capabilities. After LA2015 all data and lessons learned will be shared in the transition leaving Special Olympics Southern California with thousands more trained and committed volunteers.","LA2015 is an extraordinary opportunity for Angelenos to come together and host the world. A city with more than 135 nationalities represented, Los Angles offers a built in fan base for nearly every visiting delegation. Volunteerism is the backbone of LA2015, requiring the support of 30,000 volunteers from across Los Angeleles. Together Angelenos will welcome thousands of athletes, their coaches and families. These games are an embodiment of what Los Angeles is all about -- a vibrant civic fabric full of hopes and dreams. LA2015 is just the needle to stitch our communities together. If USC and UCLA can get behind a common cause so too can Watts and Woodland Hills. 
 
 A study commissioned by the Los Angeles Tourism and Convention board estimates LA2015 will bring a $415 million boost to the local economy as a result of the World Games. It also is worth noting there will be no other large-scale world events taking place in the United States prior to the USOC selection for the host city of the 2024 Summer Olympic Games. The IOC and USOC leadership will attend LA2015. Los Angeles has a unique opportunity to showcase to these Olympic committees just what LA can do if given the chance to host the 2024 Olympic Games – certainly a contributing factor to Los Angeles in 2050.","LA2015 serves every population attending and participating in the movement leading up to the event and at the Games including: athletes, coaches, family members, spectators, volunteers, 100 Host Town communities throughout Southern California, k-12 students, elected officials, business owners, arts institutions, hotels, and you. All ethnicities, ages, gender and socioeconomic status are represented. 
 
 Athletes are the heart of Special Olympics. Our athletes are children and adults with intellectual disabilities (ID) from all around the world. They are finding success, joy and friendship as part of our global community. As their lives open up, athletes gain the confidence that comes with achievement. They feel empowered. At any age and in every country, our athletes are learning new skills, making new friends and gaining in fitness and confidence. Special Olympics athletes are twice as likely to be employed as people with ID who don’t participate in Special Olympics and their positive health indicators are twice as good as well. Finally, because of an increased sense of well-being and personal health, our athletes are twice as likely to live on their own as people with ID who don’t participate in Special Olympics.","LA2015 enjoys the benefit of a working partnership with:
 Deloitte has committed $5 million in pro-bono work throughout the duration of the World Games in 2015. Deloitte’s support includes: assistance in production of LA2015 business plan; financial analysis and budgeting; “Experience Mapping,” identifying all touch points and priorities for World Games constituents; ongoing operational planning support; donation of pro-bono office space (including furniture, phones, office equipment, & utilities); and a loaned executive who served as the GOC’s SVP of Finance. 
 Davis Elen Advertising has given LA2015 $2.5 million in pro-bono creative services and by serving as the agency-of-record. Davis Elen support includes: the creation of the World Games logo, brand strategy, messaging, video production, other creative and advertising services, development of collateral materials, sales kits, and the overall theme for LA2015. 
 Kaiser Permanente continues to support the promotion of health and fitness at the Games. Healthy Athletes, a cost free health-screening program, examines all 7,000 athletes in seven clinical areas. In addition, the program gives referrals for follow-up care and provides health-related products like prescription eyewear, shoes, and hearing aids. The program also provides training for healthcare professionals and students on the specific needs of people with intellectual disabilities. 
 USC & UCLA will host the athlete villages and sports venues. 
 ESPN has partnered with LA2015 to serve as the Global Media sponsor for the World Games. This historic agreement will broadcast a 3 hour Opening Ceremony special live on ESPN 1 or ESPN 2 (98 million subscribers in the USA), provide a minimum of an additional 5.5 hours of coverage during the Games, production of a daily highlight video package for the GOC to be provided to media around the world, as well as a promotional campaign leading up to the 2015 World Games.",
4102199,AGEnts for Change Initiative for Seniors in Los Angeles,0,Connect,2014085,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050connect/projects/AGEntsforChange.html,,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Mid-City MacArthur Park Area, Hollywood and Echo Park",John Kotick,We are training Seniors to be AGEnts for Change in Los Angeles to improve the lives of Older Adults in our City through advocacy.,"SBSS will build on its successful experience in creating and conducting the AGEnts for Change program. The primary goal for the 2nd generation (G2) of the AGEnts for Change Initiative is to expand the impact of AGEnts advocacy and education activities by launching a revitalized recruitment, education and mobilization process that will engage a new cadre of lead AGEnts who will in turn educate key legislators, other seniors in Los Angeles, and the general community about issues facing the aging population. In order to achieve this goal, SBSS will do the following:
 (1) Organize 5 recruitment events at identified sites in SBSS service area to engage the senior community.
 (2) Identify and recruit 12 -15 seniors to be trained as lead AGEnts. 
 (3) Conduct 3 periodic meetings in which information and training will be provided to lead AGEnts to keep their skills current.
 (4) Coordinate 8 educational meetings with key legislators (federal, state, and local) on topics relevant to the senior community. 
 (5) Produce and distribute four Video on Demand (VOD Casts) Issue statements.
 (6) Conduct 6 monthly communiqués including conference calls, emails, direct mail and newsletters distributed at the Senior Centers and community sites. 
 
 The need is great and with the right support, many older adults are willing and able to speak up for themselves and for the senior community at large.","St. Barnabas Senior Services (SBSS) initial AGEnts for Change Initiative achieved success in its first year of implementation. Due to the support of The SCAN Foundation, SBSS was able to recruit and train 32 seniors. Six emerged as lead advocates who actively informed key legislators, for-profit and non-profit organizations, and the general community about issues that are facing the senior population. Paramount to the success of the initiative was the empowerment of a diverse group of seniors who now take responsibility for educating themselves and others and can provide testament to their ability to positively impact their community.
 Over the past several months, SBSS and a few of the AGEnts have remained active in their pursuit of preserving safety net services for seniors. In particular, these AGEnts have continued to support the efforts of the Los Angeles Aging Advocacy Coalition (LAAAC) by attending meetings, participating in conference calls and educating key legislators. During these interactions, it has become even more apparent that the impact of SBSS AGEnts can be improved through an enhanced recruitment, education and mobilization process that will engage additional AGEnts for Change. 
 
 SBSS is in a strong position to initiate the enhancement of the AGEnts Initiative, not only because of its solid record of community engagement, but also as a direct result of the recent expansion of its service area to include the neighborhoods of Hollywood, Griffith Park, Los Feliz, Silver Lake, Atwater Village and Chevy Chase as served by the Hollywood Senior Multipurpose Center (HSMPC). This expansion has doubled SBSS’ geographic reach and increased the number of seniors served annually from 8,000 to nearly 18,000. This expansion has provided SBSS with the opportunity to reach an entirely new group of seniors who have the potential to become advocates for themselves and for the senior community. The diversity of this community will further strengthen the efforts of the AGEnts Initiative as SBSS is able to recruit and engage seniors who are representative of the cultural, linguistic and social richness of Los Angeles.
 Involving the growing senior population of Los Angeles in advocacy not only contributes to their well being, but helps make L.A. a great place in which to live and age with dignity. By 2050, our population of seniors will have increased dramatically and investing in sound policy and advocacy now, will contribute to a vibrant L.A. in 2050","Our project specifically benefits all older adults living in Los Angeles and their families, by advocating for senior friendly public policy, programs and services that contribute to their independence, health and well being. Through a strong policy framework that supports seniors advocating for themselves, their voices are heard, their lives are enriched and L.A. itself becomes a better place to live.","The SCAN Foundation continues to assist with funding for the AGEnts for Change Initiative and their advice as well as funding has been important to our project. In addition, the Los Angeles Ageing Advocacy Coalition is a significant policy partner to SBSS and the AGEnts for Change Initiative, bringing together over 50 organizations and individuals working together on policy issues impacting the lives of older adult residents of Los Angeles.",1,

We will select the filmmakers, help produce, fund, and distribute the films. 
 
 We need more storytelling by Women of Color about their experiences as Angelenos, as they themselves see it. Hollywood definitely has a dearth of Women of Color in film. Only 1 out 500 Top Films in History have ever featured a live action Woman of Color. There's a danger in only being shown LA and the world through the point of view of the status quo. Women of Color in the LA community need to speak for themselves and film is the world's most far reaching media.","If Los Angeles and Hollywood don't nurture and invite new voices as an example of an inclusive modern city, then who will? We can lead the diversification of cinema and help improve the statistics for women of color creatives in the entertainment industry. 
 
 This would be a landmark for other cities to follow and showcase their diverse voices. Women of Color initiatives have never been done this way anywhere before, so why not in the city that makes the most filmed media in the universe? We have the talent but we need support in making a statement to our networks and studios that Women of Color are capable and cutting edge creatives for hire. Statistics say women often leave the film industry, when they are often pushed out for not getting opportunities that men and white people do. We feel it's a shame that LA is such a melting pot of cultures, but our most dominant industry is negligent of this fact. 
 
 As an example- London has better initiatives set up to make films that are made by Londoners that show off multi-cultural voices. Many of their funding initiatives mandate diversity now. We, LA- the seat of Hollywood don't have anything built in like this, yet.","Everyone of every color, creed, age and gender will feel like their lives in LA count when they can see diversity accurately represented in the short films funded by this program. These films will show LA as a beacon for all to express themselves via film (what we're known for). It is also important for the future of LA that we send the message to younger generations that their voice matters regardless of ethnic background and gender. People everywhere will be able to see Los Angeles in a different light, a true modern city where opportunities lie for all.","-Seed & Spark CEO Emily Best (confirmed)

 With the help of a growing network of hosts, we’re creating spaces that are warm, inviting & conducive to sharing the part of ourselves we otherwise keep hidden. Rather than treat loss as a conversation-killer, we’re using it to inspire our most profound conversations & deepest relationships. 
 
 And we're working to tackle cultural taboos head-on, by creating spaces & tools through which those who've yet to experience this level of loss can gain insights about how to be better friends to those who have.","Our strategy is three-fold: 
 
 1. Network-building: At the core of our work is a growing network of Dinner Party tables, each powered by 1-2 hosts, who are in turn supported by a combination of training retreats, open-source toolkits, and on-going coaching. 
 Goal: 
 - Grow # of LA Dinner Party tables from 4 to 15; 
 - Find and support local Host Mentor to serve as the primary point-of-contact for local hosts, and an LA City Coordinator, responsible for matching participants & hosts; 
 - Hold quarterly dinners among local Dinner Party hosts 
 
 2. Collect & share healthy habits, practices, & rituals: A 2013 study by researchers at the Harvard Business School revealed that people who had found a way to move forward had discovered and embraced what they called, ""personal rituals."" We are working to surface and share the practices and resources that emerge around our tables, in order to capture stories and tools to inspire self-care.
 Goal: 
 - Publish digital and print copies of Finding What Feeds Us, a photo journal featuring recorded stories & rituals shared by wide range of Dinner Partiers, currently in process;
 - Develop and execute LA-focused digital activation campaign, as a reminder to live boldly each and every day. 
 
 3. Break down taboos: We’ve all got stories to tell: funny stories, gut-punching stories, stories that tell us who we are, and allow us to hold on to the people who live only in memory. All too often, however, those stories are invisible: something we keep hidden even from ourselves. We want to invite Angelenos to find and share their own stories of #lifeafterloss, and to remind them that they’re not as alone as they might think. 
 Goal: 
 - In the spirit of The Moth and Vagina Monologues, we’ll host a public event featuring live readings, exploring loss and its role as part of our common currency: the subject that binds us across socio-economic, cultural, and generational lines. The event will feature voices and stories from folks at our tables, along with participants and members of partnering organizations, who share a commitment to breaking down taboos around life after loss.","LA is a big, vibrant community where it can be easy to get lost and to feel isolated; a place where finding your tribe takes time. It’s a city of thriving micro-communities that don’t always intersect, where connecting across lines of difference requires more than simply walking down the street. 
 
 But LA is also a city of unique and, if we may be so bold, extraordinary potential. It’s a city whose food culture is the product of the unique backgrounds & family histories we bring to it. It’s a city of yoga studios, community gardens, where wellness is taken seriously. It’s a city where entrepreneurs and communities reshape cultural boundaries so we can live better together, from Home Boy Industry’s Father Greg to TreePeople’s Andy Lipkis. It’s a city that’s mastered the art of telling stories, and changing the way we look at issues. We believe we can change the way we choose to connect here, and by doing it here, change the way we connect everywhere. 
 
 In the short-term, we want to make it easier to find people with a particular shared experience, and to treat loss not as the ultimate conversation-killer, but instead as a door-opener---one that can lead to profound conversations and deep relationships. 
 
 In the long-term, we want to to dismantle prevailing taboos, and to establish a new set of norms among young people who’ve experienced significant loss. We want to realize a day in which young people everywhere can easily find a Dinner Party near them, or else start one of their own: a day in which it’s perfectly normal to get together with people you know who’ve lived through similar experiences, and talk openly over dinner about subjects we otherwise keep under lock and key. We’d like to see increases in the number of people replicating our strategy, measured by toolkit downloads, and evidence of impact on the local dialogue, measured by everything from the number of people reached online and off, to the number of local influencers engaged. 
 
 We foresee a day in which Dinner Parties in LA are as pervasive as AA meetings, and as culturally acceptable and readily accessible as yoga and meditation classes: a day in which young people who have experienced loss are recognized not as objects of pity, but as better listeners and better leaders, characterized by profound empathy, resilience, and agency.","Ours is a community of mostly 20- and 30-somethings, who’ve each experienced significant loss, and get together over Dinner Parties to talk about it and the ways in which continues to affect our lives. Some of us have lost parents; others, siblings, partners, or friends. For some of us, it’s been six months, for others, sixteen years. Some of us are actively grieving, others not. Our identities and labels include gay, straight, women, men, unmarried, married, of varying backgrounds, creeds, and economic strata. Some of us have struggled in visible ways, grappling with depression, or eating disorders, or general listlessness. Others were simply leading what author Parker Palmer calls, “divided lives”: compelled to cover up a key part of themselves. 
 
 What binds us together is a refusal to subsist on platitudes: a promise to one another to abstain from bullshit, and to speak our own truth, as others speak theirs. We’re not trying to “fix” each other: we’re creating a space where it’s okay to be not okay, where it’s easy to swap therapists’ contact info, where we can cheer each other on on our good days, and be the person to call on the bad. 
 
 Over the coming year, we’d like to develop partnerships with individuals and organizations working in parts of LA where loss and trauma is daily reality. We have no grand illusions about bringing candles and flowers and potluck dinner parties into neighborhoods where crime rates run high and children are more likely to attend funerals than graduation ceremonies. Yet we’ve found that loss can serve as an extraordinary bridge-builder across lines of difference, be they cultural, economic, or age-based. While our stories may be different, each of us knows what it is to be alone. In naming that, we believe we can learn to see one another not as “other,” but by what we have in common below the surface. We want to work with those already on the ground, and to help create tools that make it easier to talk openly about shared experiences of loss. 
 
 We’re inspired by the possibilities latent in bringing people together from across cultural lines who may appear to be leagues apart, but through a dinner party conversation, discover parallel experiences. We see a future of advocacy and action enabled by these connections, and fueled by the epiphany often had around the Dinner Party table that we’re not so different after all, and that the pressure points felt in one of our neighborhoods need to be solved by us all.","Our advisors and collaborators currently include the Center for Courage and Renewal (www.couragerenewal.org), and a number of individuals and organizations practiced in the art of #realtalk and opening up spaces where people can express vulnerability, as well as Hope After Project (http://www.hopeafterproject.com/). We can envision significant collaboration opportunities with others in the grief support space, including Camp Erin (http://www.ourhouse-grief.org/programs/camp-erin-los-angeles/) , where several Dinner Partiers have volunteered, and/or Our House, which several have attended. 
 
 Confirmed event partners include EngAGE (www.engagedaging.org) and Experience Talks (http://www.experiencetalks.org/), and we are currently in conversation with several other potential organizations with a passion for story. Finally, regarding a digital campaign, the Harry Potter Alliance (thehpalliance.org) is already on board, and it’s something we’d like to explore with several existing friends in this space as well, including ModernLoss (www.modernloss.org).",

 1. SENIORS currently “playing” in local parks, recreation areas and senior centers, beaches and other public recreational areas
 
 2. AT RISK TEENS and foster youth needing safe and enjoyable public “play” spaces to gather and engage in creative and educational activities.
 
 3. LATCH KEY KIDS in downtown LA currently enrolled in after school programs who frequent recreational centers for interactive, creative and educational “play” activities. 
 
 COLLABORATION/TEAM BUILDING
 The initial steps for this project will be to solidify partnerships and collaborations and develop a pilot strategy. 
 
 CREATIVE DEVELOPMENT
 We’ll work with partners to host a series of workshops based on a Play in LA theme. Workshops encourage individuals to share visions for “play” venues in the foreseeable future and building systematically to target goal in 2050. 
 
 Each group will have 50-70 participants. Workshops will be facilitated in a series of 1-3 sessions. Each participant will have an opportunity to paint a vision of the perfect “Play in LA” area using paint and canvases. Local volunteers will help recruit, engage and motivate artist participants. 
 
 Participants will initial their paintings, including their age in a format that replicates the labeling on the periodic table, thereby contributing their own personal ""element"" to the human story and Play in LA concept. A written statement from each participant will accompany each painting.
 
 INSTALLATION
 All paintings are combined into a full-sized art installation. The center art element will be commissioned to an LA artist and will serve as a “statement” piece reflecting the sentiment of the collective artwork. The collaborative artworks will be displayed in civic buildings: schools, libraries, museums, airports, train/bus stations. All individual paintings with accompanying statements will be posted on the Human Element Project’s and partner’s websites.
 
 FORUMS
 Installations will inspire public forums and discussions on future vision and strategy for community capacity building and can be held at the USC IGM Art Gallery or installation venues employing USC IGM AG forum format. 
 
 RECEPTION
 Opening receptions for each of three installations will be organized to honor participants, sponsors, and supporters. Receptions will boost self-esteem of participants and ensure their ideas are heard and honored. Events will be coordinated and documented by artAngls.org and the USC IGM Art Gallery.","By enabling ownership, community pride, mindful stewardship, collaboration strategies, and personal and professional empowerment. 
 The Human Element Project: Play in LA will attract residents to work together, using existing resources to enhance
 • Access to open spaces and park facilities 
 • Number of children enrolled in afterschool programs 
 • Percentage of residents who feel safe in their neighborhoods 
 • Enhance the transportation experience for attendance at major league sporting events 
 • Residents within 1⁄4 mile of a park 
 • Number of residents with easy access to a “vibrant” park 
 • Number of parks with intergenerational play opportunities 
 • Number (and quality) of informal spaces for play 
 • Decrease per capita crime rates
 
 The Human Element Project: 
 Play in LA workshops will significantly impact these metrics by collaboratively conceptualizing and displaying a sustainable “play” space for young adults and seniors.

4102215,HOPSCOTCH: A MOBILE OPERA AND POP-UP SPACE,HOPSCOTCH is an audacious operatic adventure that takes the audience on crisscrossing car journeys throughout LA.,Create,2014091,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050create/projects/HOPSCOTCH.html,,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,"HOPSCOTCH is planned for October 2015, but the concept for the project has been in development since April of 2013. We are currently at the stage of securing partners to realize this work. The Industry is thrilled to work with the Southern California Institute for Architecture on the design of the central hub. SCI-Arc will host the hub as well, meaning the radius of the project in the city encompasses downtown, Chinatown, Boyle Heights, and other sites that offer a wide range of vistas and cityscapes. Alex McDowell’s 5D World-Building Studio is also collaborating on the media elements of the project: video and media inside the cars and projections both onto the street and inside the cars. 
 
 The process for creating the music and narrative material is a highly unusual experiment in collaborative creation that speaks to The Industry’s passion for new ways of telling stories. The work is being developed with five of LA’s most innovative composers: Andrew Norman, Andrew McIntosh, Veronika Krausas, Ellen Reid, and David Rosenboom. Each composer is working with director Yuval Sharon and a writer to create highly individual pieces that will create one master narrative. Creative partners are given freedom to devise experiences with driving in mind, but part of each piece must be able to fit inside a limousine - one singer and one instrumentalist, perhaps; one live singer and one video of a singer playing on the limousine's television; two instrumentalists in the main cabin and the singer in the passenger seat; and endlessly on. This will create an unusually intimate experience for each audience member, and a different experience in each car. The timeline for creating the work goes through April of 2015. 
 
 In the coming months, The Industry will begin confirming its technology partners for the project—and of course a limousine partner! Sharon is also mapping out the geographic regions of the piece based on SCI-Arc as the hub. In the fall, we will secure the production team, and in February 2015 we will cast the singers, instrumentalists, actors, and dancers.
 
 Starting in February 2015, our PR campaign will begin with MPRM, the firm who successfully secured prominent international press for INVISIBLE CITIES. Also, during INVISIBLE CITIES, The Industry partnered with KCET-TV’s ARTBOUND to document the project in an Emmy award-winning hour-long documentary. The Industry plans to develop a similar partnership for HOPSCOTCH.","The cultural scene we imagine in LA 2050 is a highly collaborative one, where the traditional boundaries that separate visual art, music, theater, film, and dance are broken down, and the conversation between the arts is fluid. The spirit of innovation, curiosity, and adventure that has always defined LA makes it the perfect candidate for the world’s next great center of creativity. We believe opera is an ideal catalyst for that transformation, as an inherently collaborative and multimedia art form. By creating ambitious large-scale collaborations with LA-based artists, The Industry’s projects have already worked to realize that vision in this city today, engaging and inspiring new audiences for the arts in general. HOPSCOTCH, will be our most ambitious celebration of the cooperative spirit of LA’s art-making future. It’s a project that is both “very LA” and an aspiration for what LA can still become.
 
 The city itself is the “set” of this particular project, and viewing the city with fresh eyes is a central theme of HOPSCOTCH. This project began with a central aspect of LA life: driving. Cars have defined life in LA—for better and for worse. Using driving to create a communal experience that transcends isolated cars will offer audiences a new vision of what is possible in our city.
 
 There’s nothing we take for granted as much as the city we live in, the evolving backdrops of our everyday lives. But the environment around us should be a constant source of the unexpected, full of surprise, inspiration, provocation. With HOPSCOTCH, we ask the audience to notice our streets in a vivid new way, seeking to transform our everyday view of the city. We hope to inspire Angelenos to fully embrace the entire city as a canvas for creative placemaking. 
 
 One of the most exciting elements of INVISIBLE CITIES at Union Station was the unpredictable collision of artists with everyday life, as singers mingled imperceptibly with the daily activity of the train station. In this way, art directly enriches our sense of the everyday life of our city; it is open to everybody and changes our perspective on our city. With HOPSCOTCH, we take that idea directly out into the streets, as the performance surrounding each vehicle will offer Angelenos an unexpected engagement with artists typically locked away in the opera house. The free central hub we are imagining invites people from diverse walks of life to experience a birds’ eye view of LA, geographically and artistically.","HOPSCOTCH takes the entire city of Los Angeles as its backdrop, and we are creating a work that we believe will inspire the broadest possible spectrum of audiences: young audiences and new operagoers; art patrons and opera-lovers; technology enthusiasts; fans of multidisciplinary art, architecture, site-specific and community-based work; cultural tourists and members of the local community. We look to the eclectic and diverse audience that made INVISIBLE CITIES at Union Station a sold-out phenomenon. The scale of the project inspired people who even simply walked through the station during the opera; we believe HOPSCOTCH has even greater potential to reach as wide an audience of Angelenos as can be. Thanks to the central hub, HOPSCOTCH allows access to a large audience to experience the performance at no cost.
 
 A large-scale project like this has many additional beneficiaries, including corporate partners, sponsors, local businesses, and Los Angeles' Arts & Cultural establishment. SCI-Arc students will also benefit from this highly unusual real-world application of thoughts on temporary architecture and performance spaces. 
 
 Not to be overlooked are the artists who will benefit from this one-of-a-kind experience. The Industry has already helped launch artistic careers—composer Christopher Cerrone received a Pulitzer Prize and several commissions after INVISIBLE CITIES; tenor Timur Bekbusonov was discovered by his new international representative through his performance in CRESCENT CITY; composer Ellen Reid is receiving a high-profile workshop of an opera in New York that The Industry developed. The many singers, composers, dancers, and actors who will be given an opportunity through HOPSCOTCH will continue to make a significant impact on the cultural life of Los Angeles and beyond.","The Industry is partnering with the 5D Global Design Studio (5D) and the Southern California Institute of Architecture (SCI-Arc) to help build the multimedia and logistical infrastructure to make this project a reality.
 
 SCI-Arc is a center of innovation and one of the nation's few independent architecture schools, dedicated to educating architects who will imagine and shape the future. An integral part of the emerging cultural hub of a city with a tradition of architectural experimentation, the school is devoted to finding radically new responses to the real needs and aspirations of today's world. SCI-Arc will be instrumental in helping The Industry develop and maintain its central hub for HOPSCOTCH in Downtown LA.
 
 5D is committed to ""building worlds and the spaces in between"" through interactive media and technology. Under the leadership of Creative Director Alex McDowell, set designer for Tod Machover's robot opera DEATH AND THE POWERS, 5D's interest in augmented reality situations make a natural fit for this project. 5D's role in the project will be to work in tandem with The Industry to imagine the most impactful and innovative ways to use technology as a storytelling tool, incorporated into both the sound and vision of HOPSCOTCH.
 
 These will be new partnerships for The Industry, and the three factors that will be critical to the success of this collaboration are:
 
 1. The freedom to play, experiment, and take risks in the development of the work.
 2. The shared vision of thinking outside the box and creating work that is of the highest quality possible.
 3. Keeping the artistic vision at the center of everything we do.",1,

4102219,Check out our New Digs: The La Brea Tar Pits Improvement Project,Our improvement project will reinvigorate the La Brea Tar Pits and provide a prehistoric playground where Angelenos can play and learn.,Play,2014093,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050play/projects/newdigs.html,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,"The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County (which oversees the Page Museum aka the La Brea Tar Pits Museum) experienced a dramatic reimagining in the last 10 years. The $135 million improvements include 7 gorgeous new galleries and 3.5 acres of beautiful gardens. We are taking our “lessons learned” from the NHM project and applying the same passion, aesthetic, and content commitment to the Tar Pits. 
 
 The process of change can be messy, and our end product is sometimes quite different from our initial plan, but always just right for our visitors. Our aim is to put the visitor first, creating exhibits and programs where research and collections meet the guest experience.
 
 We are convening scientists, curators, design experts, exhibit builders, and members of the community to ensure that project content will be relevant. We will prototype programming with visitors and test exhibit components while gathering ongoing guest feedback on a wide array of performance metrics. 
 Last year, visitor surveys at the Tar Pits Museum came back with a clear challenge – our visitors needed us to do better. Last month we unveiled $500,000 in Phase I improvements, including:
 • A prototype “Excavator Tour” which brings guests close to the process of discovery 
 • The reopening of our mid-century modern “Observation Pit”
 • A refreshed Pit 91 observation site featuring the return of summer excavations.
 • An edgy bi-annual fundraising gala called the Ice Age Hair Ball
 • The conservation of the Mammoth sculptures floating in the “Lake Pit” 
 • The restoration of the bas-relief frieze on the Museum’s façade
 
 While our “new digs” are great, our improvements are nowhere near complete. Aided by LA2050 grant funds and the generosity of our donors, next year we will invest an additional $1.1 million in the park and Museum. While plans are still fluid, they include the following:
 
 • The creation of a Teratorn Puppet (a fearsome Ice Age Bird with a wingspan of 12 feet!) which will bring avian Ice Age creatures to life through our popular Ice Age Encounters performance program. 
 • The creation of new outdoor experiences which improve the overall understanding of the La Brea Tar Pits
 • The continued refinement and creation of intergenerational programs and tours
 • Multimedia interpretive components 
 • The pursuit of free Wi-Fi access for visitors 
 • The development of a Tar Pits Mobile App
 • Technology updates for our check-in system","Today, the project will:
 • Provide important scientific and visitor-friendly updates to the only urban National Natural Landmark in the United States—a unique space for visitors to play and learn
 
 • Make Los Angeles proud to visit the Tar Pits by improving the overall visitor experience.
 
 • Infuse playful interpretation into the park and Museum, creating an interactive destination for all to enjoy
 
 • Through our improvement efforts, the Museum will become a lab for leisure activities and serious fun for all ages—from kindergarteners who attend at no cost through our School and Teachers Programs to adults who attend creative programs like our Ice Age Hairball.
 
 In 2050 the project will:
 
 • Ensure that our Earth, and the many places of play found on it, will last long into the future. Since the La Brea Tar Pits are a place where visitors can rediscover the past, specifically the most recent and most dramatic change in the Earth’s climate (the end of the last Ice Age), they have much to teach us about the future of our planet. Why did these animals and plants go extinct? Why did some animals and plants continue to thrive? By 2050, our researchers should have the answers to many of these questions, and will present them to the public in a way that helps us to make the best possible decisions about our planet, our economy, our future.
 
 • By 2050, we hope that the entire Tar Pit experience will be reimagined. This grant and the incremental improvements proposed is just a stepping stone to a large initiative to protect, preserve, and reinterpret the Tar Pit experience. By 2050 the La Brea Tar Pits and Museum could be the premier destination for understanding climate change and the premier museum destination for serious play.","• Los Angeles Area Children - The challenges of the Los Angeles education system (low test scores, low graduation rates, low college readiness, etc.) are well documented. Despite improvements in public safety, many neighborhoods still suffer from crime and a lack of safe places to for children to play. The La Brea Tar Pits Museum seeks to address these converging issues by providing a safe destination for learning and play for children who visit from all over the city—whether on a field trip or with their families. Last year the Museum hosted more than 49,000 students, teachers and chaperones from 575 schools. The Museum also welcomed over 35,500 visitors for free through special admission programs designed for those who could not otherwise afford a visit. These visitors see the Museum but also spend time touring the grounds, eating and playing. 
 
 • The Surrounding Community – The Miracle Mile area (where the La Brea Tar Pits are situated) is one of the most densely populated regions in the country. The area suffers from an acute shortage of public parks and outdoor recreation opportunities. The improvements associated with our project would enhance the park-going experience for the thousands of people living near-by, providing a rare place to lie down and relax, have a picnic, or spend time with a pet. With many businesses and cultural institutions within a short distance of the La Brea Tar Pits Park and Museum, an enhanced destination would bring additional customers and visitors to the area. 
 
 • The Greater Los Angeles Community – World-famous for its fossil deposits of Ice Age flora and fauna, the La Brea Tar Pits are an essential cornerstone of the city’s cultural landscape. Recent dips in attendance and satisfaction surveys at the Museum have made it clear that our offerings to visitors were stuck in the past and not providing an experience that was up to the standards Angelenos expect from this unique treasure. In response, we have already made programmatic improvements, but these new enhancements will be a sense of pride for locals and tourists alike. The important scientific discoveries of the region will not only be well cared for, but also well-presented through expert storytelling and exhibitry.","With many changes occurring on the Miracle Mile, we are in very early conversations led by The Academy Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Museum to partner with LACMA, the Craft and Folk Art Museum, and the Petersen Automotive Museum with the goal of promoting increased visitorship at each location. These changes coincide with a future Metro station planned in the immediate area which will also help drive attendance. 
 
 As a National Natural Landmark, the La Brea Tar Pits is in early stages of a renewed partnership with the National Park Service. Owing to a successful application in the past, the La Brea Tar Pits Museum plans to once again work with NPS to enhance the Museum and its grounds. This partnership will be successful because it will remind visitors of the national and international importance of the Tar Pits while providing the NPS a site to connect with visitors in a densely populated, urban region of Los Angeles. The partnership also allows each organization a platform for professional exchange and networking with shared access to the resources of each. 
 
 Individual teachers are also important partners and we work extensively with 10,000 annually to create museum curriculum for visiting schools. This “for teachers, by teachers” approach ensures that the information the Museum provides is relevant and helpful to visiting teachers and creates a generation of Angelenos who know and value the La Brea Tar Pits. Teachers are also welcomed to regularly scheduled teaching workshops that inform their field trip and classroom teaching while ensure school groups will visit the Museum. 
 
 The Museum is also working with a confidential technology partner to bring Wi-Fi service to the park and Museum, free of charge for visitors. This partner is currently working with the Museum, and has for the last two years on several very successful endeavors. With a wealth of fossils lying still undisturbed in the park, it is critical that the best-possible experts work with us to design a connectivity system that keeps the fossils safe while also providing uninterrupted service. A successful partnership would: enable streamlined guest services throughout the park with the aide of wireless connectivity, allow for highly interactive mobile activities to be designed for our indoor and outdoor visitors, provide a way for us to further track crowd flow to better enhance the experience.",1,

Without the security of our studio walls, Mirror, Mirror welcomes professional artists and homeless youth to sit across from each other and see how creating portraits of the other makes us each the same--human beings. 
 Once the pairs are finished with their portrait, each portrait is displayed side by side in a traveling art installation in parks all across LA where the community is invited to connect with the work, the artists and the youth.","1. Invite Artists: First, invitations to professional artists working in any/all mediums in Los Angeles will be asked to participate to work with a youth of My Friend’s Place (the goal is to get about 80-100 different artists signed up). Once signed up, the artists will get a livescan (background check) done before coming into the center to work with the youth. 
 
 2. Hold Information Meeting(s): An artist kickoff event will be held at a specific location to give the artists a chance to get their livescans done and to get all the details for participating in the project. 
 
 3. Create Art: The artists can provide art materials as they wish to share with their partners or select from the materials we have provided. They will collaborate with their partner to create their portrait and have their portrait created by their partner. Once the artists have their livescans complete (and they have cleared) the artists will be able to pick a day they would like to come into the drop in center during the 3-4 month art making period. (We will create a sign- up sheet for the artists to pick from specific days and times so there are not more than 6 artists coming into the center at one time).
 As the artists sign up and start coming into the center, myself and another lead artist will help make sure the artists and youth are getting paired up together and have a space to work together on their portraits. 
 
 4. Frame the Work: The artists and youth will be able to work together until they finish their portraits. Once each partnership finishes a portrait, we will take them to get framed. 
 
 5. Install the work and hold exhibitions: The portraits will be displayed for the community to interact with in exhibitions around LA. The artwork will be to stored on a mobile truck to be able to transport to different parks across LA. At each park we will have open-air exhibitions with mobile display walls to set up at each location.","TODAY: This project helps make LA the best place to connect today because it gives people a space for real interaction between two communities that normally don't connect with one another. The outcome is that each partner sees something they never saw in themselves which consequently gets projected not only in their portraits but in their perspectives forever. As this project continues into the future, greater compassion between the people in our community will be present. This project acts as a portal to ourselves, to others, and our society as we connect across social boundaries. This project allows us to powerfully share the magic of the artistic process and positively influence the youth to see their own dreams and empower them to purse something that inspires them and even seek help to get out of their current situations. The artists see what they have been blind to and are able to form new perspectives and get past judgments they have on the homeless.
 
 2050: People will be able to have a changed perspective of what homelessness looks like. They will feel more empathy towards people that don’t have a home and be able to connect on a new level. In 2050 more people will want to volunteer at drop-in centers, provide services for drop-in centers, bring food, materials, and come up with better ideas to help young people without a home. Because this project allows us to see what the homeless need on a deeper level, we can see where we are still lacking shelter, clothing, food, access to wifi, transportation, and employment opportunities.","1. At-Risk Youth
 First the project will benefit the youth of My Friend’s Place. Not only will the youth get a one-on-one mentorship but they will feel heard and seen on an individual level. They will have a chance to share a story and passion through a form of art that excites them and get the support they may be wanting to express an idea with guidance. 
 
 2. Artists
 The artists will benefit greatly through this project as they will be forced to step outside their comfort zones of their studios to create art. They will have a space to let their walls down, be vulnerable themselves and share stories with youth they may haven’t shared with anyone else. The artists will open themselves up to a new perspective on what it means to be without a home and actually put themselves in their partner’s shoes. They will be forced to work on a new level, have the chance to be a teacher and a student at the same time. They will find themselves having a much bigger connection to their partner than they initially thought and open up a whole new level of seeing people for who they are instead of making judgments from an outside appearance. 
 
 3. The Community
 As the exhibition gets to travel around the LA parks, our whole community gets to experience the relationships that were formed through this project. The youth, artists, and the community in each park will be invited to experience the portraits and the stories of the relationships that formed and get to know others they may have never had the chance to meet before. 
 
 4. Community parks
 The parks around LA will benefit as this will open up excitement and activity. This project will show the community that the parks are always there to enjoy the beautiful city of LA and the community that we are.
 
 5. My Friend’s Place 
 This will benefit My Friend’s Place drop-in center in a way that will reinforce their model of being a low barrier service structure using their harm reduction approach. By bringing the MM Project to this drop-in center it will provide education and support and equip the youth to reduce the harmful effects associated with high risk street
 survival behavior and minimize the psychological, physical, and social barriers that typically deter youth from seeking and accepting assistance from a social service agency.","1. My Friends Place (http://myfriendsplace.org/) (CONFIRMED)
 We have not worked together before but we have worked with Safe Place for Youth (which is a very similar drop-in center two times before)
 
 Three Factors:
 1. Create detailed timeline of project: That we sit together together as a team and map out all the details of this program together making sure MM Project and My Friend’s Place have a specific plan of the entire project including how many artists will be coming in each day to work, which staff will be coordinating the project and helping pair youth and artists together. 
 2. The safety of the participants: Both the youth and artists feel taken care of and respected as they create their artwork.
 3. Communication between MM Project coordinators and My Friend’s Place directors and staff 
 
 
 2. MOCA (Not confirmed but have reached out and hoping to do a mobile exhibit unit for the final closing exhibition (after the exhibit has gone to all the parks) like they did with the Mike Kelley mobile homestead exhibit outside their museum)
 
 Three Factors:
 1. Able to use space outside of MOCA 
 2. Open communication between MOCA and MM Project on rules of exhibiting outside the museum 
 3. Will be able to advertise with MOCA of the exhibition 
 
 
 3. PARKS of LA (None of these are confirmed yet and are just ideas of different parks around LA and the goal is to bring the exhibition to a broad audience in many different parks) 
  -Griffith Park 
 -Grand Park
 -Exposition Park
 -Kenneth Hahn State Rec Area
 -Barnsdall Art Park 
 -Pan Pacific Park Rec Center
 -Hollenbeck Park
 -Chesterfield Square Park 
 -Santa Monica
 -Venice
 
 Three Factors:
 1. The mobile exhibition will be able to find a nice location at each park to create a open air exhibition by opening the truck and creating a community event for a period of 3-4 hours on a specific day
 2. The park will allow the event to be advertised on a website
 3. The parks will each have a written contract with specific rules so that the exhibit and park are in clear agreement and communication for each event in order to ensure each event is carried out safely",
4102226,Play With Music Platform (PWMP),"Research & build a platform to teach LA kids music & tech skills, by playing in ""virtual bands"" with peers & pro musicians.",Play,2014095,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050play/projects/PlayWithMusic.html,,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,"The year long pilot program will benefit kids & the community of South LA, but our app based platform will benefit the entire Green Dot Network and then hopefully all of LAUSD","We have a 3 phase plan!
 
 1) Introduction & development:
 
 We’ll present the PWMP to students, refine our ideas based on feedback & research (with our partners: Green Dot, CalArts, NRBLB) & prepare the pilot after school program
 
 •Needs assessment & partner alignment
 •Research indicators: assess wants/needs of teachers & students, youth attitudes, career aspirations, music level & preferences
 •Survey at-risk indicators (crime rates, enrollment, grades, etc)
 •Refine & plan pilot after school program
 •Recruit & video/record well-known LA musicians for the program
 •Strategic partnership & sponsorship development (includes academic feeder programs)
 
 2) Implement after school pilot program at Locke:
 
 The pilot enables students to work on a song, make a virtual band, learn tech, music & performance skills, culminating in a live student music concert (hopefully with celebrity participation). The pilot will also focus on translating skills into scholarship & career opportunities.
 
 •After-school pilot program in the Locke ""Jetspace"" (2 hour sessions) twice/week for 20 weeks
 •CalArts teacher/mentors & The New History will run all sessions
 •Program will align with & supplement Locke’s existing music curriculum
 •Students build skills in a safe & fun environment after school
 •Students will write, record, produce (using Garageband, with both physical & software instruments) and perform (live for video capture) their parts to a song
 •Students learn to use basic video editing software (iMovie) to compile their performances together with those of peers and pro musicians to make a “virtual band”
 •Students can share their performances & virtual bands online
 •Students will perform a community music concert with pro LA musicians
 
 3) Build app to scale the PWMP
 
 Informed by the pilot, we’ll build a scalable model using a tablet app based platform that automates the audio/video recording, editing process, as well as creates a student virtual music network.
 
 •Evaluate pilot (follow-up research w/students, community, teachers, musicians)
 •Reassess research indicators (comparative study of students before/after program)
 •Connect students with career opportunities/scholarships
 •Based on the above, build app and online platform to automate and scale PWMP
 •Provide Green Dot network & other under-funded schools with the new PWMP tablet app, to implement a full-scale test program.
 •Create opt-in teacher training program to help implement PWMP","By creating a platform that gives our students the skills to play with music, technology & each other, we’ll build the foundations of a truly creative generation in LA. 
 
 We want LA in 2050 to be a city where our public school kids don’t see the recording industry & famous musicians as being inaccessible. Using basic tech we can enable them to actually play together, create together & inspire each other.
  
 Last year, in Green Dot’s winning LA2050 proposal, they wrote: “More than ever, the city’s communities require inspiration & motivation to believe that something better is possible (…) We work to equip them with the tools necessary to become empowered & authentic agents of change”. The PWMP will validate & expand upon that work to make LA the best place not only to Play in 2050, but to Learn, Create, & Collaborate.
  
 At a time when arts education funding has taken a stark downturn, it’s more vital than ever to use innovative methods & practices to ensure LA’s students (especially the at-risk) have places & contexts to acquire tools to be creative, imaginative & productive members of an engaged society.
  
 Our education system is often accused of separating students from engaging deeply in play & benefiting from the incalculable value & creativity it fosters. The current system can isolate students in a narrow academic paradigm, that earnestly tries to ensure their basic economic survival, but can become deeply uncreative & alienating to kids, resulting in their rejection of education entirely. This, coupled with a rapidly changing society & economy, can leave them unprepared for the “real world”, and/or with skill sets for menial jobs soon obsolete.
  
 We want our kids in 2050 to be given (at least in their music classrooms) the tools to play & collaborate on positive creative projects, & be inspired by mentors that have succeeded in ways they admire. We want our students to then use these tools as a gateway to good jobs in LA.
 
 Music is not just an art form or a career path... at it’s core, it’s a platform for sharing, storytelling & playing together. That’s why music has almost always been at the heart of our communities. If every school in LA participated by 2050, our virtual music network would bridge socio-economic and physical distances, foster connection, & unite students across the city through creative play. Not only would this nourish our economy, but contribute significantly to a safer, more equitable and vibrant city.","First, it’ll benefit Locke students, teachers & the Watts community. Post-pilot, it’ll grow to impact students & educators across LA, and eventually, any school with internet access.
  
 Locke was opened in ‘67 in response to the Watts’ riots, to provide the community with a safe & prosperous school. The band program quickly became one of the country’s best, performing at LA Rams games, marching in the Rose Bowl Parade, & traveling globally. Several Locke alumni even went on to successful recording careers as well.
  
 The program has since dwindled into obscurity, with nearly zero enrollment. The equipment & facilities have fallen into total disrepair with broken instruments & band rooms.
  
 This year, Green Dot launched an effort to return Locke’s music program to its former glory, from repairing instruments to renovating classrooms & building an outreach program. A new music curriculum is being designed from scratch, creating a unique opportunity for the PWMP to innovate & inform that process. 
 
 Today, Watts is the 4th deadliest neighborhood in LA County, with 6.6 killings per square mile, and a median age of 21, among the youngest in the county. We must rally hard for these young minds. In 2003, California cut arts funding by 94%. Today, the state spends less than $1 per kid per year.
  
 Music is enough. A study released in 2012 by the National Endowment for the Arts, monitored over 70,000 at-risk American students of various ages for 19 years. They found at-risk students with access to arts-rich curriculum had: higher GPAs & test scores, graduated from high school, attended college, read the newspaper, volunteered & voted.
  
 Another UCLA study of 25,000 middle & high school students found that students involved in the arts watch less TV, did more community service, and were generally more engaged with education.
 
 Our response: create a platform that’s as compelling & fun as it is relevant & useful. We want to build communities & economies by inspiring kids. There’s no lack of opportunity - LA employs more artists than any other city in the U.S., with a sector that consists of nearly 1 million direct & indirect jobs. By 2016, these numbers are projected to grow; for example, we’ll have 14% more sound engineers (earning $59,470/year on average).
 
 When we foster creative platforms & programs, we prepare LA kids for these jobs, creating generations of sustainable communities. Laying these foundations will benefit all of LA by 2050.","Our confirmed partners are Green Dot Public Schools, No Right Brain Left Behind (NRBLB) & CalArts Community Arts Partnership (CAP).
  
 Green Dot is the largest charter school organization in Southern California, serving 10,300 at-risk students in 18 schools across LA, half of them turnarounds of LAUSD’s lowest-performing schools. 90% of students graduate with 76% going on to attend college, making their schools among the highest performing ‘minority’ schools in California. In 2008, Locke was one of the lowest-achieving schools in the nation. Four years into Green Dot’s leadership, Locke scored over 600 API compared to a pre-transformation score of 511. Green Dot’s expertise will guide our implementation at every stage.
  
 NRBLB’s LA2050 award-winning project created the Locke “Jet Space”, which we’ll use as our program’s epicenter. We’ll increase the Jetspace’s impact by bringing music programming and permanent technological infrastructure. In the future, as we expand the PWMP’s reach, we hope to work hand-in-hand with NRBLB as they continue to imagine the future of creative spaces and programing in more schools.
  
 Additionally, we’ll partner with CAP, harnessing their expertise to mentor, teach, research, and co-create school-based arts programs. CAP offers free, after-school and education-based co-curricular arts programs for youth ages 6-18. Their teaching corps comprises of accomplished CalArts faculty, alumni and student instructors. As expert program creators who enable youth to discover and create original works of art, they’ve received numerous honors, including the National Arts and Humanities Youth Program Award, for fostering the creative & intellectual development of America’s children.
  
 Under the leadership of Locke’s new music director, Matthew Cotton, we’ll also forge ties with USC & the LA Opera. We hope to provide access to internships, scholarships, and feeder programs with CAP, USC, LA Opera & more. 
  
 We also hope to attract participation from famous musicians, and inspire students with an opportunity to be in a “virtual band” with them. We’ll lean on our entire professional & personal network to achieve this goal.
  
 Finally, we have relationships with many socially conscious local tech firms, including Pull Creative,100 Years, Ludlow Kingsley & Arts of Olympus, who are all on board to help. Together we will create the most impactful program and platform possible.",0,
4102228,The Imagined Futures,"Presenting entertaining & educational public events & designing an interactive museum experience to celebrate art, storytelling & tech in LA",Create,2014096,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050create/projects/TheImaginedFutures.html,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,"The Imagined Futures consists of three components: live programming; a sequence of galleries; and an augmented-reality panorama of the city of Los Angeles in the future. We can start work on the first of these today; the other two need custom-designed physical spaces which we will start preparing. The first phase of The Imagined Futures, covered by this grant, is the next year. We will establish ourselves with live programming while finalizing the design for the complete vision. The second phase will implement that vision with the aim of opening the building at the end of 2016. (More on this can be read on our website, http://theimaginedfutures.org) 
 
 We've found a group of designers and creative minds to help develop our vision. Many are former Disney Imagineers now working at places like Google, The X Prize Foundation, and The Hettema Group. Over the past year, we've had twelve charettes with this group; that process will continue, but we're now at the point where we should work with a professional design firm – Thinkwell Group – to come up with concrete visions of the space needed, layouts of the galleries, what exhibits require, and the greater user experience. We estimate this process will take three months. 
 
 After this, we can commission a feasibility study from Entertainment + Culture Advisors to determine the project's cost (working estimate: $70 million) and resource usage. This will take another three months. At that point, serious fundraising can begin with introductions to potential partners: individuals and L.A.-based corporations that see our work as a way to attract possible future talent.
 
 In parallel with this work, we will start implementing live educational programming – some in Spanish or dual-language – by bringing together creatives and technologists to imagine futures in front of the general public. Our partners will the National Academy of Sciences, who have been presenting films with commentary from scientists. Working with the NAS, we will expand programming to include panels, presentations, debates, and competitions, as well as building mutually beneficial visibility.
 
 We also want to work with schools to bring scientists and artists working in creative media to students as a tool for educators to augment existing curricula. We want to bring together storytellers and people working on technology featured in stories to create a moment of revelation for audiences throughout the city who otherwise might not have such access.","Los Angeles has been built on the idea that the future is captivating. Our inexhaustible appetite for science fiction and imaginative entertainment – often created right here in Hollywood – exists because everyone loves thinking about potential futures. Innovation, in both art and sciences, happens because someone looks at the world and imagines how an element of it could be different – and, perhaps, the changes that might come across because of that difference. New products – and works of art – come into being this way all the time. And social change can happen because people imagine better possible futures. By encouraging creative and imaginative thinking, we can cultivate a better future. The Imagined Futures wants to challenge people to explore, predict and imagine the possibilities for the future.
 
 That's why this project, at its core, is about Los Angeles itself. The possibilities for a city focused on imagining future potentials – as Los Angeles historically has been, from the prominence of the film and aerospace industries in the twentieth century to Activision today – are exciting. We want make sure that LA doesn't lose creativity to centers like San Francisco or New York by highlighting local creators, researchers, and companies who are on the cutting edge. We want to excite young Angelenos about scientific, technological, and creative career choices. The Imagined Futures also celebrates imagination, which teaches critical thinking, collaboration, problem solving, and entrepreneurship just as it leads to new industries in engineering, art, science and design. 
 
 A major goal for The Imagined Futures is to brand – or rebrand – LA as the premier place for creative minds to come to tinker with science and art in order to make exciting new things. This rebranding will have an immediate effect on existing creative industries: companies will be able to attract new talent and new ventures will find a foothold here. But the broader benefits of The Imagined Futures will only be seen with time. The seeds of ideas dreamed up today can blossom into future industries and fields of study. By 2050 there will be a more pronounced effect, as students who have grown up with The Imagined Futures programming will become major players in the industries that define the city. A population raised to prioritize the imagination will develop faster, farther and smarter. By doing so, we hope to create a population that will sustain Los Angeles well into the future.","Primary beneficiaries of The Imagined Futures in its completed form will be visitors. Visitors to The Imagined Futures can be divided into three groups: 1) tourists, as we imagine it becoming a destination like LACMA or the California Science Center; 2) school children, who will visit The Imagined Futures in classroom groups as part of our educational component; and 3) Angelenos, who will return for event programming even if they've already visited the museum component.
 
 Even at the project's inception, other primary beneficiaries will be Los Angeles scientists, technologists, artists, and storytellers. The Imagined Futures will allow scientists to connect with artists (and vice versa), as well as sharing insights and ideas with the general public, which appears to be interested but generally lacks a venue for this sort of learning. The Imagined Futures will also be a platform for scientists and technologists as well as entertainment firms to promote their work as a way to attract attention, future talent, and the funds to continue.
 
 By extension, this project will benefit the Los Angeles economy more broadly – by bringing in money to the area – and attention to Los Angeles firms and creators. As a resource for educators, it will make getting students interested in STEM jobs (and thinking more broadly about the function of creativity) easier. A primary goal of this museum is to interest underrepresented populations in STEM fields: women, minorities, low-income groups, and those with English as a second language. Long-term, we'd like to see those students going into science, technology, and entertainment, bringing with them their diverse backgrounds and keeping their skills in the Los Angeles area. We want to be a driver of technological and entertainment progress in Los Angeles, which will benefit everyone. 
 
 In the short term, The Imagined Futures will not have a physical building. The number of people – and their economic effects – attending programs set up by The Imagined Futures will be smaller than it will be. We will, however, be able to launch our first year of educational initiatives, as well as public programming in partnership with the National Academy of Sciences. Collaborations between creators and scientists – and interaction between those professionals and students – will be happening from the beginning. We envision an immediate impact on students as well as a secondary impact on the creative arts in Los Angeles.","As mentioned above, there's been a tremendous interest in our project. We've formed an informal working group to design the project that includes people working at JPL, Tesla, Google, Disney Imagineering, The X Prize Foundation, and The Hettema Group, as well as writers, film producers, gamemakers, designers, and architects.
 
 To move forward, we need a complete design for the project's physical implementation. Members of the Burbank-based Thinkwell Group – the premier agency for designing museums, theme parks, and exhibits – have been working with us informally. Thinkwell has agreed to take us on as a client. Their work will finalize concrete visions of the space needed, layouts of the galleries, exhibition requirements, and user experience. We estimate this process will take three months. Once finished, we can commission a feasibility study from Beverly Hills-based Entertainment + Culture Advisors, who we've been meeting with. Successful completion of both studies will allow us to pinpoint exactly what we need to build to make our project feasible and designed for its highest potential. The concrete plan this process will develop will allow us to begin more serious fundraising. 
 
 Risks with these partners include time and money: our working process has given us a good idea of what we'd like to do, but a design process that isn't carefully controlled could drag out and cost more money than we've anticipated. We've reduced risk by having a long pre-design process working with others who've worked on similar projects – like Seattle's Experience Music Project. We've learned from their mistakes. Mission drift is a potential problem, but one we've attempted to minimize by focusing on what we want to do and working with experienced people. 
 
 As part of this preparedness, we want to start programming before we have a final space. Our partner in this will be The Science & Entertainment Exchange, part of the National Academy of Sciences. While they typically work with movies and television to increase the amount of science on screen, they want to work with us to reach a broader audience through public programming. Potential issues are building compelling programming, attracting audiences, and finding spaces. The NAS has shown they can do the first of these; we have tentative agreements with members of our working group in the entertainment business – including film institutes – to help us with the second and third of these issues.",1,
4102230,Fix our Traffic: Getting people to rapid transit stations one neighborhood at a time,"In order to get people out of their cars, we need to create effective ways to get them to rapid transit stations.",Connect,2014097,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050connect/projects/Fix_our_traffic.html,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,"A lot of L.A. residents would use mass transportation if there were a way to get between home and the station. Our project is to develop a plan for moving people from where they live to the closest rapid transit. It is a critical element in developing L.A. connectedness.
 
 There are lots of ways to do this, ranging from fleets of small dedicated taxis, to electrically assisted bicycles, to electrically powered shuttle buses. A workable system needs all of these and more. What's been missing is a plan to ask for ideas from the public, and then put everything together in a comprehensive system.
 
 We intend to work with the public and with transit providers to find a mix of ways to get people to the stations and home again.","This project will devise a practical solution for getting people from their homes to the nearest rapid transit station and back again. To do this, we need to work with L.A. residents who will use the new systems, as well as with manufacturers and transit agencies.
 
 Many L.A. people live far from train stations, including the stations that already exist and those that are yet to be built. Getting to the station will continue to be a problem if we don't come up with a practical solution.
 
 We believe that the light rail systems now being built will address some of the transportation deficit we now face. Another rapid transit technology known as personal rapid transit (PRT) is currently being developed by several companies. PRT basically consists of passenger carriers (pods) that are elevated above the street, and can take people without intermediate stops to their destinations. 
 
 We have been collecting ideas for getting people to and from the rapid transit stations. This project will develop a comprehensive concept for a system with multiple types of connections, and then do a specific design for two neighborhoods.
 
 For example, a fleet of electric taxicabs, accessible by cellphones, and serving the public on a fixed price basis, could be one part of the solution. We are also very intrigued by the newly developed hydrogen fueled electric bicycles, which can be adapted for commuting. We think that it's also important that if personal rapid transit comes to L.A., that the passenger pods be designed and built so that bike riders can take their bikes along.
 
 Too often, governmental decision making has been from the top down. We feel strongly that the design and planning of a neighborhood friendly solution to getting people to rapid transit has to be put together with and by the people who will be directly afffected, and who stand to gain or lose. We therefore are planning this as a public participation project from the very start.","The long range goal is to make Los Angeles easier to get around. This includes commuting to work as well as traveling to all the destinations that make living in the city a rewarding experience. We all know how overstressed the freeway system has become. We know how frustrating it is to be driving down the freeway, only to see a wall of tail lights go on just ahead of us.
 
 Imagine how useful it would be if we were able to travel quickly and easily to a train station or to a personal rapid transit station, board the train or the PRT pod, and get to the destination quickly.
 
 Residents of Los Angeles have an amazing choice of destinations, everything from the Music Center to sports centers to our major shopping centers. There are museums, universities, community colleges, and restaurants.
 
 Frustratingly, our Los Angeles of 2014 suffers from heavy traffic and the slow but inexorable increase in gasoline costs.
 
 The goal of building rapid transit is to connect the people of Los Angeles with all of these different destinations. The intent of our project is to consider and then design the critical link that gets people to the mass transit services themselves. In short, our project is the final element in aiding Los Angeles residents connect to work, play, and study.
 
 Without the new rapid transit systems, we are stuck in a descending spiral of traffic and fouled air. We have to figure out how to make it easy for people to use mass transportation, and that is the goal of our project.
 
 Transportation experts refer to the problem of getting people to and from mass transit systems as the ""first mile, last mile"" question. We believe that an intelligent choice of solutions (and it must be solutions, not just one solution) can not only solve that problem, it can increase the range to several miles. For example, we will explore the idea of how to make carry-on bikes a regular part of the commuter experience. Other methods such as the dedicated taxi fleet would be required by other people. Personal, human connectivity with the full geography of Los Angeles is our goal.
 
 It is critically important to have the next generation of rapid transit riders be a part of this planning process. In the short term, L.A. residents will begin to appreciate the idea of using rapid transit, and in the year 2050, much of Los Angeles commuting and recreation will use rapid transit.","It is obvious that developing a citywide and countywide system of mass transportation will benefit practically everyone who lives in the Los Angeles area. We all need to move around in the city, but we are currently caught in an overstressed system that does not provide enough freeway lanes or city streets to serve our needs. Even freeway commuters will be helped as many of us leave the freeways and use alternative transportation.
 
 But commuters and travelers are not the only people who will benefit. One outcome of a newly invigorated rapid transit network in L.A. will be to stimulate manufacturing, particularly as the city and county engage in local sourcing of some components. One possibility is that by making Los Angeles a leader in rapid transit technology, L.A. can become the leader in a newly created export industry.
 
 None of this is inevitable, but a concerted effort by planners and designers has a good chance of getting to this highly desirable goal.
 
 We also need to mention some other benefits that go beyond the ability to get from one place to another quickly.
 
 A citywide system of electrically operated personal rapid transit and light rail will replace a large part of the carbon dioxide that is currently emitted by cars. What we will achieve is a city that is cleaner, that suffers from less vehicular noise, and which will carry its own weight in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
 
 Development of support systems for rapid transit, such as dedicated fleets of minicabs, will create new jobs in whole new sectors of the local economy. Providing citywide mobility for handicapped people is an essential element of any system we develop.","Interestingly, our collaborators include not only our nonprofit organization members including the Transit Coalition, they also include neighborhood councils created by the City of Los Angeles, mass transit providers, companies that are currently developing personal rapid transit, and academic experts in the field of transportation.
 
 We currently have an ongoing relationship with the one personal rapid transit company that is based in California, Skytran Inc. Skytran is currently designing and building a PRT demonstration overseas. We have been discussing the acquisition of a PRT system for Los Angeles not only with Skytran, but with our elected officials.
 
 City Councilman Paul Koretz and his staff are important collaborators whom we have been working with for several years on the subject of improved transportation. We will ask his staff to collaborate with us on the project. 
 
 Several members of our group have been active members of the city's neighborhood council system going back to its inception. Neighborhood councils have active transportation committees that we shall work with. We are currently negotiating with the Neighborhood Council Congress, a yearly gathering of more than 500 people, for a breakout session on ""Getting to the station: the final link.""
 
 We feel that we have an important collaborator in the public as a whole. In fact, our interest in studying and solving the ""first mile, last mile"" problem came out of a transportation discussion at a public venue. One of the audience, a professor at Harbor UCLA Medical Center, explained that she lives in Mar Vista and needs to get to Harbor UCLA in Torrance for her work. She explained that unless she has a mass transit station nearby, or some convenient way of getting to the station, she will be stuck with taking her car to work.
 
 Since the proposed project involves interviewing residents of Los Angeles about their needs and wants, we consider all of our future contacts to be collaborators.
 
 We hope to develop working relationships with several other companies that are currently developing innovative new systems in Europe, Asia, and other parts of the United States. We feel that designing the vehicles in a way that works seamlessly with our ""first mile, last mile"" solutions is critical.",
4102232,A Physical Space for the WCCW,"An all-female shared creative workspace & community site for workshops, events, & conversations about contemporary feminisms.",Create,2014098,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050create/projects/WCCW.html,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,"In many ways the Women’s Center for Creative Work is well underway! We have a strong community of women makers who are already attending Women’s Dinners, going to and leading workshops, taking part in our “Workers in Residence” program at our residencies, and in general giving their support to the WCCW in real life and online.
 
 Women often have multi-faceted practices, balancing their time as producers, makers, workers, mothers and partners. The WCCW is a proposed answer to this challenge, offering a collective workspace to provide an environment of solidarity and community, a sanctuary where women with all sorts of small businesses, artistic practices, and personal projects can come get some work done within a supportive atmosphere.
 
 To implement the next phase of the WCCW –a permanent physical location, we would need to find that right location, do the appropriate build-out and remodeling, activate our community to find women to be in residence in the studios in the space, and continue to grow our network. The LA2050 grant would make this all possible in one fell swoop, but we also have plans in place for fundraising. 
 
 If receiving this grant, The Women’s Center for Creative Work would continue to host workshops, events, and exhibitions and the like as we have already been doing throughout our research and development year. The crucial difference would be that we’d have a permanent location to hold our communal workspace and activities. Space is important in Los Angeles. Having a permanent location would allow us to foster community in a physical way and build the foundational support necessary to gr","Los Angeles is a collection of nodal centers, some very spread out from each other. In order to cultivate community in this rhizomatic city one has to be very deliberate–most of us get in our cars and drive somewhere rather than walking along the street. This lack of street culture leads to a brevity of the sort of chance interactions that can be very generative, creatively and otherwise. With a permanent physical space, the WCCW could function as a gathering place and foster an environment which allows for chance meetings and conversations as well as more formalized events, exhibitions, and workshops.
 
 We believe the best places for creation have a built in community to discuss ideas, help out with big projects, support makers physically, emotionally, intellectually, spiritually, financially, etc…. We value both craft and high art, but are not into the hierarchy that separates them. We’re into constantly learning, sharing ideas and skills, and making it easier for women to get work done (whether this means a child care co-op, a tutorial offered on web design, or someone to help build a shipping crate). We endeavor to make visible the invisible labor that makes up a community: stacking chairs, creating spreadsheets, cooking a group meal, managing a facebook page. 
 
 We are feminists and we believe all these things, from administration to organization building, can be done from a feminist perspective. WCCW already embodies these visions and principles in its nomadic form and they would translate naturally to the physical space, making it an excellent place for women to create, foster relationships personal and professional, and participate in the cultivation of our ever-growing community.","Creative women of all kinds will benefit from the space, especially those whose jobs/projects are of a more freelance nature, which is so common in this city: screenwriters, graphic designers, small business owners, stylists, comedians, landscape architects, etc... would have a place to come work within a supportive environment, proving a welcome alternative to having to take meetings at Starbucks. Through our varied activities and interests, we endeavor to make the WCCW as open and welcoming to all women as we possibly can and are particularly committed to intergenerational and cross-cultural conversations around women's creative work. 
 
 Events, exhibitions, and educational projects would also offer anyone interested in creative production in Los Angeles, the chance to engage with the WCCW and it's members.","We constantly work with collaborators and partners, and inevitably there would be many involved in this project, but none that have been specifically identified yet.",1,
4102233,A Paradise of Artistic Innovation and Theatrical Celebration,Expanding our reach through ambitious artistic collaboration and offering scholarships to our world-class training programs.,Create,2014099,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050create/projects/TE-San-Pedro-Rep.html,,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,San Pedro and the Port of Los Angeles,"Our first step will be to focus our efforts on maintaining the highest class of artistry and professionalism in Theatre in Los Angeles. Through high standards of excellence we build our reputation to bring credit and a good name to San Pedro and the surrounding areas as an arts district. This includes seeking and partnering with an increasingly large group of internationally known artists, as well as fostering relationships with LA's growing theatre community. 
 
 This reputation, only now beginning to flourish, can be sustained through creative ad campaigning and most especially through bringing ever more students into our world-class actor training programs. This is the ultimate goal for us! We are at our best when we have students to nurture and to foster into the cycle of mentorship in combination with our professional company of artists. We will provide scholarships to these student and aspiring artists to ensure that they have the opportunity to invest in themselves. We are eager to invest in students who are eager to invest in themselves, and these scholarships will provide many such opportunities.
 
 This will include the continued establishment of our 1 month and then 3 month conservatory programs as well as the growth of our single and drop-in class menu. In these programs we train actors, directors, and artists of all backgrounds to tap into their talent and artistic instinct to become self sustaining artists who can foster growth in themselves and also in others. The key to this process is a cycle of mentorship. 
 
 The next piece of the process will be in providing enhancements to our performance space so that our artistic ambition can be matched my technical and practical precision. This will give the professional company added opportunity to push their limits artistically, and through that process mentor the students in that process as well. The student then has the perspective to become self empowering and sustaining.
 
 The culmination of the process is to showcase the work of our organization to the San Pedro community and our neighbors. The final portion of the project involves inviting our community to see and experience what their friends and neighbors in the city have been a part of, and inviting them to take part in it as well. After all theatre is incomplete unless the creators get to share it with the audience and give them an opportunity to filter the experience through their eyes, ears and minds.","For today, LA needs an unabashed arts district that is not tied to nor unduly influenced by the Hollywood film business. It needs a place where theatrical art and artists can grow and challenge themselves without the taint of Hollywood's glitz and glamour. The artists who train and work with us are held to the highest standards of professionalism and artistry, helping to build and sustain a culture of dedication and art that is often (though not always) lacking in Los Angeles. 
 
 San Pedro is in the process of rising to become a sought after destination in LA. We aim to lead and be a part of the cultural renaissance! 
 
 For the future... Our goal when moving our company to San Pedro was to find a place where we could put down roots and firmly establish ourselves as a major player in the regional theatre circuit. In the same way that Oregon Shakespeare Festival put Ashland, OR on the map, we want to do the same for San Pedro and the Port of Los Angeles area. 
 
 Our ultimate goal is to have San Pedro as our ""mother ship"" site, and have other Theatrum Elysium ('TE' of TE San Pedro Rep) satellites through out the city and country - envision TE NYC, or TE Toronto! But first, we establish ""Elysian Fields"". This is an artistic haven on a piece of idyllic land nearby where TESPR houses it's professional company of actors and artists. Not only will a full season of theatre and dance be produced here, but Elysian Fields will house a full accredited MFA program training Actors, Directors and Playwrights and Dramaturgs. Beyond that this training program will be multi-disciplinary and house training for musicians, singers, dancers, visual artists and fine artists. We believe that though the medium may be different the artists still speaks from the same desire to express no matter if they wield a paint brush or toe shoes or a script.
 
 It is in Elysian Fields that the potential of the cycle of mentorship is truly seen. The professional company trains the students in classes where they learn side by side with the other professionals. The students learn how to learn from the professionals in class with them, and are further mentored in the productions that rehearse and perform in the performance venues.
 
 In 2050 Theatrum Elysium's Elysian Fields will be a foundation of what makes LA's arts and theatre scene vibrant, respected and well known. We can't wait to get there!!","Our project will benefit most directly the neighborhood and community of San Pedro. This burgeoning arts district will be sustained and supported by our success. This will in turn create opportunities for other organizations to come into town to plant in the ground that we have helped to furrow and cultivate. Additionally, the restaurants, shops, bars and clubs of San Pedro will all benefit if increased traffic come through San Pedro in search of the arts.
 
 Beyond San Pedro, the class of aspiring actors and artists who are constantly beaten down by the juggernaut that is Hollywood will certainly benefit. The training that we offer is specifically geared to tap into the students talent and help to bring out what they would think of as their ideal artistic self. This is the artist that can be self sustaining. This is the artist that can create work independent of ""the biz"". This is not to say that the business at large does not create meaningful work, but to be truly meaningful the cumulative work of all the artists of every level in the city must be fostered and grown. Broadway in NYC would mean very little if Off-Broadway and Off-Off-Broadway did not exist to challenge it and push its limits and boundaries. Similarly, the greater LA area's work will be made better by having a community of artists who are pushing themselves and each other to be better, more innovative, less bound by tradition, less afraid of failure, and more and more proud of LA as an artistic breeding ground!","At this time we have no partner organizations, however, due to the collaborative nature of our work in the theatre, we are open to collaboration with other organizations.",1,

An ecological interpretation of Los Angeles while traveling on the Metro Expo Line. UCLA Extension Landscape Architecture Students and instructors will work with Metro, the Supervisorial Districts, the cities along the Expo line, the school systems, and other partners to create a natural trail experience of the EXPO Metro’s ride from city center to the sea.
 
 The Once and Future Ballona Creek.
 The Expo Safari line travels the path of the undergrounded braided river bed of Ballona Creek, the drainage conduit to the Ballona Watershed! The Safari will explain the watershed, its importance, the history of urban development and the resulting filling and reduction of the Ballona Creek and its continuing importance and vibrancy, providing habitat and food for migratory birds. 
 
 Urban wildlife is hidden and many creatures live underground, such as possums, rats, raccoons, moles, and snakes. Subways and pipelines provide habitat for much of this subterranean wildlife.
 
 Connections to Exposition Park and the LA County Natural History Museum provide opportunities to explore the natural past of California, and the new Botanical Gardens have wonderful displays of California’s native plants, and ecosystems.
 
 Tree canopies provide flyways, habitat and bird rest stops that connect the LAs River and Ballona Creek into a continuous system for migrating birds. Above ground are shorebirds, waterfowl, songbirds and raptors that feed, rest and winter in Southern California. Ducks, hawks, redwing blackbirds, as well as Canada geese, seagulls and snowy plovers are among the many species of birds that can be seen along Expo Safari as it passes through a portion of the Pacific Flyway.
 
 Making the “urban wild” of LA visible provides opportunities for schools along the Metro Line to interact with nature. To encourage schools and students to participate, “Field Guides” will be developed and an “Expo Safari! Field Guide Book” (mobile app to be developed), containing information and images of the animals and habitat that are along the route and sections for the recording of animals seen and experienced. The field guides will be uploaded to a Facebook page : “Field Work: Expo Safari!”, that will showcase citizen scientists discoveries.","So much of Los Angeles has displaced nature in the development of the metroplex. There are many opportunities to show the layers of LA, the past, the underground or unseen, the other creatures that call Los Angeles home. Taking a transportation route and exposing the scenic and natural processes enriches the experiences of the riders, and the understanding of the natural world where we live. 
 
 Using the Safari, as an exploration, and creating field guides and citizen scientists who record nature and become aware of these interconnections is just one of the possibilities for the Expo Line “Safari”. This UCLA Extension Landscape Architecture program will work with students, naturalists, artists and metro riders to create an extraordinary experience of nature along the Los Angeles Metro Expo Line.
 
 Upon implementation, the template could be applied to the other Metro lines: Gold (the Cornfields and LA River), Blue (Augustus F. Hawkins Park and LA Port), etc., creating a network of nature and transportation opportunities.","EXPO Safari will benefit schools in Los Angeles, Culver City, and Santa Monica by providing a fun scientific expedition using public transportation and exposing these students to the natural process and nature in Los Angeles.
 
 EXPO Safari will increase ridership along the EXPO line, by weaving the Natural History Museum, Gardens, Ballona Creek, into the Safari experience and engaging riders to explore areas along the route.
 
 EXPO Safari will benefit the wildlife we share our space with, by creating an understanding of tree canopies, bird migration, the value of wildlife in our city.
 
 EXPO Safari has the potential to create future botanists, biologists, zoologists, park rangers, hikers and a citizenry that is excited to explore outside the confines of a train, to see more of the world, to learn more and to experience nature.
 
 EXPO Safari will benefit our Landscape Architecture students in understanding that design is a collaborative process.","LA County Natural History Museum's scientists and gardens create a synergy between the past and the present natural history of LA.

 Critical factors

4102246,URBAN AIR,Urban-scaled purposeful artworks as networked atmospheric monitors — fuse good art and good science to the global commercial infrastructure,Create,2014102,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050create/projects/URBANAIR.html,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,"During the design and prep phase Urban Air will erect the pilot or prototype greenboard in Los Angeles — ideally in Q1 2015. Summit Media has already guaranteed donation of the media site for the Urban Air prototype. This pilot installation will serve multiple ends: 1) it will allow us to do real-world testing of the technologies, designs and construction techniques before rolling out to other target sites; 2) it will provide an engine to build velocity for marketing and promotion — telling the Urban Air story; and 3) it allows Urban Air to market its successful Kickstarter campaign, which generated over 21,000 blog posts and articles, 150,000 downloads of video, and over 600,000 social media impressions. 
 
 site considerations
 Ideally the sponsor/underwriting partner(s) will have existing relationships (or even existing contracts) for outdoor media, and would be able to offer Urban Air several location choices in each target c40 city. We assume this will be a point of negotiation with sponsor partners, but ideally the Urban Air team would be able to make the final determination as to the sites. 
 Some of the considerations driving suitability of Urban Air sites are:
 
 High traffic/visibility for maximum impact of the project.
 Viability of the existing billboard: will it require retrofitting and is it capable of being re-designed within the budget/technical parameters established for the project.
 Suitability for data monitoring goals of the project.
 Suitability for social networking/destination goals of the project.
 Visual/aesthetic considerations, such as surrounding buildings and background picture.
 
 Although much site research can be done virtually (with googleEarth/gMaps street view, existing photos provided by outdoor media companies, etc.), members of the Urban Air team will be required to make at least one site visit during this project phase (structural engineer, designer and/or project lead). This visit also will net important documentation assets, including site photographs and plans.
 climate science and installation duration
 The vision of Urban Air, and one of its key concepts, is to monitor and publicize carbon footprint reduction through the year 2020 (this is the c40 initiative target date, and also the target date of the BEACO2N project). For the costs of the strategic BEACO2N partnership to make sense, and to ensure scientific value for the project, BEACO2N sensors must be in place for at least one year — ideally two years or more.","Urban Air is a public artwork that also puts an active face on the possibility of urban sustainability. Urban Air will bring an urgency and vibrancy to the civic landscape, inspire community dialogue and action, beautify transit corridors, and ultimately connect people. Much like a modern city, bamboo is at once both vertical and horizontal. Each culm is connected to and sustained by the others through a vast rhizome network. Like streets, mass transit, or electrical grids in a modern city, everything and everyone is connected. The health of any individual within such a system is ultimately dependent on the health of the system as a whole. Urban Air will contribute to the overall health of Los Angeles. 
 
 Throughout history, art has been a vital sphere and critical element in the construct of communities. It has lived in the public realm in cave paintings, religious idols and shrines, piazza’s, monuments, and more. In the 20th century, with the privatization of culture, art moved more into the realm of institutions, museums, and private collections. The sphere of art however, still occupies critical social space. It enhances cities by contributing to commerce and helping to revitalize neighborhoods and communities. Today however, the presence and role of art is frequently replaced by advertising. Urban Air will also generate value and spectacle in the public realm, though with a different intent. 
 
 Urban Air reclaims the territory of advertising traditionally occupied by billboards, and as such directly intervenes, engages, and transforms it. Today advertising is consciously exploring its ability to generate new value. Social entrepreneurship, transparency, and sustainability are emerging as business’s new index of what matters. Likewise, the need to experience creativity “for no reason” - art for art’s sake - in daily, urban life, becomes more urgent. Urban Air takes on that action. With its ideal climate, Los Angeles is poised to become a world leader in sustainable urban culture. As an accessible work of art and a green, interconnected billboard, Urban Air will be a flag flown for both.","Urban Air will be a positive landmark for all immediate passersby, as well as a major social media hub. Climate monitoring, social media wifi broadcasting, and public private partnering will foster a robust local and global dialogue. Profound questions and solutions will actively be proposed and powerfully exist in the civic landscape. Not only is there the inherent values of service and beauty, but the value that can be created through social media participation and connectivity will be vast. It is the intention of Urban Air to partner with the Clinton Foundation's C40 climate initiative, and LA is a C40 city. Urban Air will become a symbol of LA's green apirations and policies, and be the first in the worl to launch a global program.","The following collaborators are all confirmed and been on board 6 months to 2 years
 
 the urban air team
 Urban Air is conceived, designed, and will be produced by Stephen Glassman Studio. Urban Air has rapidly expanded from a solo artist’s vision into a work of scale and impact, and has inspired key vanguard professionals in related fields — engineers, technologists, media professionals, environmental and industry figures — all collaborating to realize not only the prototype Urban Air installation in Los Angeles, but to craft a viable, scalable system that will allow Urban Air billboard gardens to be elevated in dense urban environments around the globe. 
 The Urban Air executive team includes artist and designer Stephen Glassman, who has created socially-relevant large-scale artworks around the world, Supervising Producer Steve Reiss, an environmentalist and award winning producer who has collaborated with a long roster of Hollywood A-list talent across all media, and Aaron Slavin, a multi-faceted creative producer who specializes in grand-scale festivals — especially site-specific multi-media works with an art/science focus that impact urban civic spaces.

Much of the initial training will take place within ‘The Cube’, UrbanTxt’s newly renovated ‘Hacker Space’ Headquarters on the outskirts of campus at USC. The students will take these skills, and use them to create simulated scale environments of their own neighborhoods within the Minecraft video game world, as the students envision, and create, what their neighborhoods will look like in the year 2050. Young people will work collaboratively within project management groups, to construct these virtual LA neighborhoods of the future. Many of the youth who participate in our program come from disadvantaged backgrounds. Teens will be learning while playing, having fun, connecting across the city and developing skills that will help create a diverse tech workforce in Los Angeles. Teens who have previously participated in URBAN TXT curriculum will mentor and teach new students how to code, and how to reimagine present day low-income neighborhoods as new communities of the future. #EnvisionLA is an opportunity for young people to create their own utopian worlds, filled with as much hope and opportunity as they wish to fill it. Classes for youth participating in the project will take place at our HackerSpace and at the locations of participating partners. We will train 20 mentors to implement the program and 1 full staff member, and expect it will take four sessions of coding and design classes per week to teach youth the necessary skills. Our equipment needs include computers, a server, and Minecraft related software to complete the project. We expect to complete the #VisonLA virtual world project by 
 September of 2015.","Our idea will make LA the best place to create today, because we are engaging young innovators who come from disadvantaged backgrounds, and have great ideas, to make their communities a better place. These young innovators want to start creating and sharing their ideas today. The over 150 students we have interviewed in the past year are ready to be part of an LA that encourages them to create and design new environments, and where they will learn the skills of the 21st century. 
 
 Minecraft already serves as a phenomenon of creativity and collaboration within the gaming community. Our #EnvisionLA project only seeks to harness the collective, and often untapped, resources of creativity and collaboration within the disadvantaged neighborhoods of Los Angeles. Where gang rivalries and violence act as detractors and deterrents to living in these neighborhoods, and delivering good-paying jobs to these same communities, our #EnvisionLA project will serve as a reason to bring hope there. Not only because these communities will be transformed through the collaborative efforts of our coding teams rendering new designs of them in the virtual world, but because these teams will have learned the skills necessary for each team member to get that well-paying job- today. It is currently reported that only 10% of our nation’s K-12 schools have computer programming classes http://cbsloc.al/1nJEWfc. In LA’s inner city, this number is closer to 1% 
 
 In 2050, our project will have served as the project that gave young people of color an opportunity to be part of the tech world. Our project will undoubtedly increase the amount of students who are interested in coding and designing. In 2050, LA will be the best place to create because, by then, we will have a more diverse group of people being part of the tech and innovation industry. Today, a 10 year old kid living in Watts who is inspired by our project could easily be the one who creates the next big tech start up in South Los Angeles. The skills they learn through #EnvisionLA will make them part of a workforce that allows Los Angeles to create the best products and businesses possible, and solve LA’s most pressing problems. If we don’t help kids in low- income communities engage with coding and design today, LA will lack creativity and innovation in the future. URBAN TxT, through #EnvisionLA, will help create a future workforce that inspires the culture and vibrancy of an innovative Los Angeles.","Directly, our project will benefit the 400 young people who will participate in #EnvisionLA , which will teach them the computer programming skills they need to become employable within the programming industry. Indirectly, our impact through this project solution has the potential to be much greater. Currently, the LAUSD high school student body is 75 percent Latino, 9 percent African American, 4 percent Asian, 9 percent White, 3 percent Filipino, and 74 percent of this cohort is economically disadvantaged ( LA 2050 report, p. 13), According to this same report, unemployment rates for African American and Latinos are the highest among any ethnic group in Los Angeles. As UrbanTxt serves youth through this project, we expect the ratio of participants to be approximately 60% Latino and 40% African-American, and we expect for 100% of these youth to have employable skills in computer programming by the end of this project’s duration. 
 
 
 In Los Angeles County the unemployment rate for African Americans and Latinos is 21 percent and 14 percent, respectively (LA 2050 report, p. 18). This LA County demographic make-up (with a large share of the population being Latino and African American) implies that the region will persistently suffer from elevated rates of unemployment in the future. Based on these factors, the Los Angeles of 2050 will continue to be a region of haves and have-nots. However, the #EnvisionLA project will provide skills to teens that will encourage them to continue creating and designing with the programming skills they learn. If each one of our 400 program participants touched the lives of a mother, father, sister and brother through their contribution to the local/global economy, we fully expect the impact of #EnvisionLA to impact over one thousand lives.","As of January 2014, UrbanTxt has trained over 60 kids in four computer programming languages. Our students have created their own apps, and some have even gone on to sell their apps within the Apple App Store. Now we are going to share our knowledge of design and code with ten other organizations around Los Angeles. We already have partner agreements with ICEF and Alliance Charter Schools, and we have discussed the project with Boys and Girls clubs, Brotherhood Crusade, #YesWeCode, Manual Arts HS, Markham Middle School, Arts+ Practice Foundation, YMCA and ELACC. URBAN TxT has a history of collaborating with each of these organizations, and now we want to bring coding to the kids they serve. Every year URBAN TxT receives over 150 applications for our Summer Computer Leadership Academy. Most of our applicant pool comes from our partners, who help us recruit. Currently we are working with over 25 schools all over Los Angeles. 
 
 Three factors that will be critical to the success of our collaboration are:
 1. Organizations allowing us to use their facilities to provide the Minecraft and coding training at their locations. 
 2. Providing an online resources system that will allow the participants to communicate with us remotely when we are not at their location. We have already developed an internal online social media tool for teens to safely communicate with our mentors and staff
 3. A quarterly meeting where all teens participating gather to share the work they are doing. It will be important that we support all collaborators with troubleshooting assistance to meet their technology needs.",1,
4102251,LAReality - a game that makes its players into makers doers and creators,"Our game motivates Angelenos of all ages to become makers and doers in all form, creating amazing experiences for the entire city of LA.",Create,2014104,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050create/projects/LAReality.html,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,"Simply: we are expanding the scope of a proven project to benefit the entire city.
 
 Reality uses a simple card game mechanic to suggest creative projects – often those require collaborators who have their own cards and skills. It motivates the act of creating by arranging wonderful surprises for top players and other players who distinguish themselves in key ways. 
 
 Expanding the game to LA as a whole involves folding in more creative disciplines and re-balancing the game to play out over an entire city instead of just one college campus. Location also plays a big role in Reality – we encourage players to develop a curious mind and explore their surroundings and the larger cultural context of their city. We’d push this angle heavily in developing LAReality. 
 
 Community is also a big part of making the game successful. For our campus games, we built online communities and integrated the powerful social networks our players already used in ways that were engaging and sometimes challenging. Bringing the game to the city as a whole means a significant expansion of that infrastructure and the people to run it. 
 
 Rewards are also a big factor that motivates creation in the game. Doing exceptional work earns once-in-a-lifetime encounters with luminaries in their fields. In our campus game, top players found themselves unexpectedly meeting director John Singleton, touring the Museum of Jurassic Technology with game designer Jenova Chen, and being whisked to the Warner Lot in a limo to present their resumes to powerful executives. Significant effort from the game runners goes into securing these rewards, but they’re powerful motivators. 
 
 We’ll expand that to the broader creative community of Los Angeles. Imagine unexpectedly going on a culinary tour of K-town with Roy Choi, or meeting Shepard Fairey to scope the graffiti murals of LA. Enlisting the participation of powerful Los Angeles creators will make the project special and ensure a level of participation we’ve seen great results with so far. 
 
 We’re constantly adding new technologies and surprises to our game. Growing it to promote more times of creativity means we also need to expand our exhibition platforms. One of the things we love about LA is the incredible number of pop-up exhibition venues organized by small groups passionate about some aspect. Our plan to grow Reality to all of Los Angeles also involves linking these groups and working towards a common, amazing cultural explosion.","Creating is a habit. The game helps build those habits. It produces new creative work as a natural byproduct of trying to “win” the game. The effects will be immediate. Los Angeles, already known around the world as a place where creativity flourishes, will see a spike in new works. Since the game doesn’t own or seek to profit off what’s created for the game, the originators are free to pursue their ideas or interesting discoveries as far as they can imagine.
 
 Everyone sits on their couch at some point and talks about the thing they would make if they just had the time, or the money, or the motivation. We can’t help in a tangible way with time or money, but as practicing creatives, we’ve observed that when it matters, you MAKE time. We’ve seen Reality provably cause students who protest they’re too busy and too broke and too tapped to create not just short films, but entire transmedia shared universes linking dozens of projects across all mediums. We really truly think the game has the power to get more people off the couch and chasing their dreams.
 
 In 2050? Well, like we keep saying, creating is a habit – but it’s also like fitness. It hurts at first, but when you get in the habit, it becomes easier. You do a little every day and before you know it, it’s second nature. Los Angeles is suffering a little bit of a creative brain-drain as other cities have begun luring creatives away – but if we keep the city itself fertile for creativity by building not just a place, but a community of creators, Los Angeles of 2050 will be a hell of a place to make cool stuff.","If you've always wanted to create something, the game is for you. If you live in this city because it's a mecca for talent, because it offers food and art and music and film and technological wonders you wouldn't find wherever it was you came from or would go to, then LAReality is also for you.
 
 We know you said to be specific, but the truth is it could benefit anyone. All you have to do is engage with it. Engage a little, engage a lot, it's designed to be as casual or all-consuming as you want to make creativity in your life. We think it's perfect for this initiative.
 
 One thing, though: 
 
 We place a high premium on inclusion. One thing we've prided ourselves on when developing Reality is smashing the completely toxic and baseless gates some like to erect on creating based on gender, race, creed, orientation, or other socioeconomic factors. 
 
 Obviously, we think the opposite is the case - there are voices out there being shut out by certain creative fields that need to be heard MORE and not less. This is a venue for those voices. So if you've ever felt trapped or boxed in or unheard - oh, we are most definitely for you.","Reality already has three years worth of inroads and good ties with the entertainment industry. If LAReality gets selected, we plan to expand to other creative professions. 
 
 From past experience, three crucial factors for participation from outside partners are:
 - be flexible to their schedules and life's demands
 - give them ownership over the experience and how they'd like it to play out
 - keep the experience small and intimate - this makes it special and doesn't turn it into a circus",1,
4102252,LA for Youth,LA for Youth seeks to promote investment in and strengthening of LA's youth as a way to increase public safety and build strong communities.,Play,2014105,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050play/projects/LA4YOUTH.html,,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,"The effort is County-wide, but with an emphasis on communities in most need (South LA and East LA)","Over the course of the coming year, we will build on the established foundation to bring additional partners into the collaborative. While our overall goal is to create a Department of Youth Development in the County of LA, there are several short- and medium- term goals that will help move the long term campaign forward while also achieving immediate change. 
 
 We will conduct community asset mapping with young people, to identify existing community resources, and prioritize one or two parks or recreational spaces in the community to reclaim as youth-centered spaces. Activities may include holding events, raising awareness in the community, litter removal, and advocating for funding for specific local improvements.
 
 Additionally, we will work with young people to create a strong case for support of the campaign that includes youth language and imagery. We will then educate local communities about the goals of the campaign in an effort to increase community engagement and buy-in. Further, we will create 3-5 video and/or performance projects that help capture the stories of young people in at-risk communities in order to re-shape the narrative around young people. These pieces could be shared online, through social media, and in a performance at a park. Our goal is to increase community's sense of their own safety, and to re-frame how young people are seen. By engaging with community members to tell the story of young people's experiences we hope to dispel misconceptions around actual safety and increase inter-generational connection among community members. 
 
 Additional efforts may include developing joint use agreements with schools, parks and rec centers to maximize the use of existing spaces as effective and engaging community spaces. Further activities may include collaboration building and advocacy training, creating a Peacebuilders Round Table to ensure ongoing communication and knowledge sharing, to coordinate truce building, rumor control and inter-neighborhood relationship building among intervention workers and service providers in order to prevent street-based violence throughout the county. Additional goals include establishing training in partnership with a local college or Cal State to provide nonprofit management and leadership curriculum to youth, leveraging opportunities for co-located services in community spaces, and bringing in technical assistance to support the long-term sustainability of the youth spaces and centers.","LA for Youth will help Los Angeles re-imagine its relationship to its young people. Instead of being afraid of our youth, this campaign will support a structural shift that emphasizes investing in children as a way to improve a community's sense of safety, increase local use of park and public spaces, and empower young people themselves to see themselves as valued members of their communities.
 
 This effort is not about starting from scratch, it's about re-purposing what we have, and re-framing our priorities. By engaging youth themselves in this effort, we are not only pushing for systems change, we are concretely developing the leadership of some of our most at-risk young people. We are re-framing their vision of themselves from ""always in trouble"" to someone who makes a positive contribution to their community. By training young people as leaders and providing a path to long-term success by connecting them to other youth leaders, community colleges, and even their local middle and high schools, we will be increasing the safety of their communities, and increasing their access to safe public spaces. Additionally, this effort will be particularly attentive to young people returning from incarceration. These young men and women are often the most at-risk for committing new crimes. LA for Youth would include efforts to reconnect these young people to their communities, provide support groups and ensure funding for positive activities as part of an effective strategy to make LA a better place for all youth to play.
 
 By seeking a structural shift in how Los Angeles invests its money, this campaign will result in long-term change that will resonate for decades to come. LA for Youth asks Los Angeles to invest in youth development not just for today, but to create a cycle of hope for generations.","The project will benefit the young people in Los Angeles County, as well as their families, and the communities where they live. By shifting the County's relationship to its youth, by promoting youth investment, LA residents will benefit from healthier, stronger young people who are more engaged in school, more physically active, and more involved with civic institutions. Young people facing a lifetime of repeat incarceration (at significant cost) will be redirected to more positive activities, including long-term employment and meaningful careers. 
 
 Because LA for Youth is focused on improving conditions and support for our most at-risk and under-served young people, the primary beneficiaries will be low-income communities, and neighborhoods with high rates of youth suspension, and little access to safe public spaces. The areas of Boyle Heights and South Los Angeles will be primary areas of focus. Additionally, we anticipate that young people ages 12-24 will be the primary population this effort will engage.
 
 As a whole, this effort will lead to stronger families and communities, and a better Los Angeles for everyone - not just now, but also in the future, as these young people grow into future leaders of Los Angeles.","We are tremendously excited by the complementary skills and strengths of our partners. We believe this presents a uniquely powerful combination that will be able to move what's a pretty substantial effort. The core organizing collaboration is between the Youth Justice Coalition (YJC) and the Violence Prevention Coalition (VPC). Youth Justice Coalition did the original research and laid the foundation for this effort. YJC engages and empowers young people to be community organizers and advocates. This project will help leverage their existing work with at-risk youth. Their partnership ensures that youth voices remain at the center of the effort -- a key factor in the success of this collaboration. The Violence Prevention Coalition brings in a broad and diverse membership base, and serves as a non-service-providing neutral body to convene, facilitate, and shepherd this effort (our second and third key factors for the collaboration's success).
 
 We will bring in already-committed allies in the Boyle Heights Building Healthy Communities Hub, including their Youth Engagement and Community Engagement Committees. This represents six core partner organizations, as well as several supporting organizations. These partners are already working with technical advisers through the Advancement Project (whom we hope to bring on as an official partner) on deconstructing the City budget, and engaging City leadership in support of the effort. We have begun conversations about engaging the South Los Angeles Building Healthy Communities partners in this effort as well, which would bring an additional dozen organizations into the coalition. All partners will help ensure community and youth voices are leading the effort for change. Additionally, the project will be a vehicle to grow local capacity around civic engagement and advocacy implementation, to ensure the long term sustainability and community ownership of the effort. 
 
 It is important to note that engaging these additional coalitions would represent longstanding partnerships, and organizations with a history of working together for systems change.",1,

 This is the crux of our approach for a cohesive, coordinated, community-based after school program. In an organized collaboration to create an electric and dynamic after school program, we will harness the lightning power of established groups who are experts in each of their fields and have a track record of providing enrichment classes in LA schools.
 
 We will implement this project in the second semester of the 2014-2015 school year. The first pod will begin on Jan 12th and the second will run till April 10th. With structured 6 week pods, we will work with students for 3 hours everyday after the bell rings. Two cohorts of 3 groups of 20 will rotate every hour, participating in each module. So while one group is in the water safety program, the second will be learning the four emotions through improv, and the third would be practicing yoga and mindfulness exercises. Another day, they would rotate between creative writing, learning the components of competitive swimming, and preparing a meal with produce from farmers markets. Several times a week, the students will also tend to the community garden.
 
 Parent volunteers will be recruited not only to assist instructors, but to participate in the activities themselves. They will help with the garden, learn a dance routine, and become informed about water safety. 
 
 While we believe that the process is the product, that learning is a lifestyle and has no finish line, we also believe in the empowerment of students to share their experience with their local community. Parents will help host a culmination festival in the week of April 13th. Students will present work-in-progress artistic pieces, serve healthy food they have prepared, and engage in a dialogue of their experience in the program. Open to the local community, we will also live stream the event in order to share it with the global community.","Young bodies especially need active PLAY time! A Cornell University study found that an additional 1 hour/week of PE reduces obesity probability of a fifth-grader by 4.8%. Everyday for one hour, students will either be in a water safety class, or participating in the Mustang Swim Team practice. In addition to these daily one hour sessions, they will also participate in yoga classes.
 
 To have the energy and desire for active PLAY, children need to make better food choices. UC Davis and UC Berkeley cost-benefit analysis showed for every $1 spent on nutrition education, between $3.67-$8.34 is saved in health care costs. Nutrition education will be disseminated through improv exercises and through hands-on cooking classes.
 
 Cooperation and conflict-resolution is essential for individuals to PLAY together. The US Departments of Education and Justice Report shows students in after school programs have fewer behavioral problems, more self-confidence and can handle conflicts better than non-involved students. Instructors will be trained in how to work cooperatively with their students, how to use positive reinforcement, and use any conflicts as teachable moments.
 
 We see these goals as a reality for one school within the next year. By 2050, we aspire to have Arts & Fitness After School implemented county wide in Los Angeles.","The neighborhood of Florence in South LA is under 3 square miles yet has a population of over 44,000, ranking among the highest density areas in LA County. The population is comprised of mostly Latinos at 70% and African-Americans at 28%. The median age is 23, the median household income is $29,447, 40% are living below the poverty line, and 60% of adults hold less than a high school diploma.
 
 Approximately 2,500 families are headed by single parents. In an average week, the residents of Florence will experience 13 violent crimes and 23 property crimes.
 
 Mary McLeod Bethune Middle School on West 69th Street will be the recipient school for this project. A Title 1 school, Bethune has an an enrollment of approximately 2,500 6th - 8th Grade students. In 2013 CA State Tests, 71.7% of Bethune’s students scored below proficiency in Language Arts and 72.1% below proficiency in Mathematics. According to the CA State Department of Education, Bethune’s Academic Performance Index is 1/10 with 10 being the highest.
 
 Bethune is identified by the Community Coalition as the number one Highest Need middle school in all of LAUSD. Students in High Need schools are almost 5 times as likely to be exposed to gun violence, have 3.5 times the number of students in foster care, and nearly 4 times the number of drop-outs as compared to Low Need schools.
 
 This program will benefit the students of Bethune Middle School, their families and their community.","With 25 years of presenting assemblies, workshops and residencies, we will provide the performing arts module. We have confirmed the organizations and companies below as our collaborators. 
 
 The Trojan Swim Club consists of USC graduates and world class athletes from 15 different nations, representing five of the world's continents. Their Outreach Program is aimed at empowering disadvantaged youth in the Los Angeles area and neighboring communities of USC. A benefit of this partnership is that they are already working with Bethune Middle School by reviving the Mustang Swim Team in an otherwise dormant pool facility on their campus. This will be our first time working together.
 
 SC Fitness is a minority female owned and operated small business whose mission is to improve the life of their community through enjoyable exercise with a strong dance influence. SC Fitness was our main collaborator when creating the pilot program of Arts & Fitness After School for Elementary, and was able to underwrite the costs through a Lululemon Athletica Metta Grant. As our collaborator, SC Fitness brings a staff certified by AAFA Youth Fitness, AFTA Group Fitness and dance instructors in Zumba and Ballet.
 
 youTHink is an innovative education program of the Zimmer Children’s Museum which uses the power of art to foster critical thinking, engage diverse learners, promote literacy and serve as a tool for social change. They provide art/education lessons in LA area public schools along with professional development opportunities for teachers. Youth Services provide meaningful art, leadership and community involvement opportunities for middle and high school youth beyond the classroom. This will be our first time working with youTHink.
 
 Happy Healthy Yummy provides bilingual Spanish-English classes rooted in an experiential and experimental hands-on cooking and tasting process. Through continued exposure, and not force, students are introduced to new foods, see others enjoy them, and eventually make their own decision to try new things. Students cook vegetarian seasonal dishes based on available produce to promote seasonal eating. What is most beneficial to working with HHY for the first time is that these classes can be taught without the need of a traditional kitchen.
 
 The three factors critical to our success:
 -Shared methodology of teaching approach 
 -Curriculum & lesson plans that intersperse with each module
 -Weekly check-ins of key leaders for each group",0,

We also have a team of graphic and architect designers finishing the store and cafe's interior and exterior design. We continue to establish and further connections with other community groups/organizations, and are strategically outreaching to the community to fill various employment roles.","The goal of With Love Market and Cafe is to create a successful and empowering model for addressing the Southwest LA's need for food access and employment opportunities in the urban context. Our vision is that if we are able to replicate this business model throughout greater Los Angeles, there should be a significant impact on the amount of support given to local producers and infrastructure for increasing food access across LA county.","The project is currently seeking to serve the roughly 100,000 residents within the 5 square mile radius surrounding the location of the market and cafe. Of this population, 55% of residents are latino, 20% are African American, 15% are Asian, and the rest are white or other. Our main focus is to serve the families that live in the area. Within the past 3 years, this 5 square radius area has lost 3 or its 6 full-service grocery stores, making it harder for families and residents to access groceries on a regular basis.","Two major confirmed collaborators are LA Kitchen and Homeboy Industries:
 
 Our factors for success with LA Kitchen include:

 The goals of this project are to enhance services to those who have experienced domestic violence; and to conduct outreach (in the community and in cyberspace) that results in more informed dialogue regarding the issue of domestic violence among adults and teens; and to inspire a commitment among Long Beach and LA County residents to participate in the prevention of domestic violence through informed activism and leadership opportunities.","Start-up activities call for the design/piloting of the project's cybersafety curriculum and the continued enhancement of WSLB's online presence. After the curriculum has been evaluated to ensure all issues are addressed and that our methodology is responsive to both the unique learning styles of older teens and adults, the agency will offer “train the trainer “classes to other area shelters and agencies that serve youth and young adults. 
 
 Following these activities, the project will extend to the community offline, seeking to engage as many residents as possible in a special year-long project campaign. 
 
 Partner agencies will offer three large community events designed to strengthen and connect the community in uniting to end DV. Each hosted event will educate and empower participants, many of whom are DV survivors and the families of victims. Each event will include a survivor’s art exhibit and art workshops with a focus on the I Can/We Can hands- a unique socially engaged art project gaining popularity and momentum in LA County. 
 
 Youth Leadership Teams, ages 16-25, and Adult Leadership Teams will be recruited and trained to lead discussions on TDV prevention strategies and healthy relationship practices, as well as receive training on community mobilization techniques. 
 
 This effort will increase community awareness about teen dating violence and domestic violence and increase the commitment among Long Beach (and surrounding cities) residents to participate in the prevention of violence through informed activism. Accordingly, the project takes advocacy to a new level, facilitating systemic change while engaging a diverse (and limitless) number of stakeholders. 
 
 Our work with youth has become progressively comprehensive in recent years. In addition to the programs we offer at our shelter, at our Domestic Violence Resource Center, and in middle and high school classrooms through the Long Beach Unified School District, we continue to cultivate strong collaborative relationship with local youth-serving agencies. Through all corresponding programs and activities, youth leaders have emerged, and we continue to welcome their involvement as we enhance our prevention work both within the organization and out in the community.","Funded, SNAC will inform future dialogue on teen dating violence and domestic violence. Collaborators, already aware of the need to address intimate partner violence, will appreciate the knowledge we are guaranteed to gain as we develop and implement this special project. Youth and domestic violence agencies will benefit from the increasingly substantive leadership in the area of community education. 
 
 WSLB engages in consistent strategic planning to maximize opportunities for collaboration and innovation. WSLB’s Executive Director serves on the Steering Committee of the City of Long Beach Violence Prevention Plan (LBVPP), which comprises representatives from law enforcement, local colleges and universities, the faith community, the judicial branch, the Long Beach Unified School District, public departments, hospitals and clinics, a diversity of local social services providers, and the community at large. 
 
 Given the investment that already has taken place toward promoting violence prevention in Long Beach, the community is well-positioned to continue to unite its assets, tap its strengths, and thereby ensure the stability of and support for long-term DV/TDV primary prevention efforts. Tracy M. Colunga, Violence Prevention Coordinator for the City of Long Beach, supports WSLB’s efforts and specifically the actions it would take in addressing Domestic Violence and Teen Dating Violence. The coalition that Ms. Colunga coordinates has demonstrated and documented its commitment to community engagement on this front.
 
 In implementing SNAC, WSLB will be able to draw on the coalition’s resources while taking advantage of the momentum that already has been established. WSLB will relay new knowledge to the coalition’s Steering Committee, thereby maximizing the likelihood of well-coordinated community-wide efforts that reflect best-practice based prevention strategies and practices. 
 
 By building connections through community outreach and presentations and the active recruitment of community leaders, WSLB will have a cadre of enthusiastic and committed SNAC volunteers. Through a series of 3 major events, we have a unique opportunity to respond to the community's ""readiness"" for community engagement around the issue of partner violence. By including art, drama, social media, and community leadership, we seek to empower and transform individuals and the larger community—as we are all impacted, to some degree, by trauma brought on by DV.","The project will be implemented in and for the residents of Long Beach and the surrounding cities, but given WSLB’s efforts – already underway – to utilize social media as part of the agency’s DV/TDV prevention strategy, the project’s reach will potentially be much broader geographically. Because the project’s focus is on TDV/DV and the development of leadership skills vis-à-vis community mobilization, the primary audience will be youth, ages 11-18 and adults of all ages. The very nature of community mobilization is to reach and inspire all, so while the primary audience appears to be related to domestic violence, the project should be viewed as having no audience limitations.","WSLB’s current DV/TDV primary prevention efforts maximize local resources and assets in service to youth. Guiding past and current prevention work has been WSLB’s substantive collaboration with the school district, whose representatives have helped to coordinate the delivery of TDV presentations by WSLB’s Youth Services staff. Since 2006, these presentations at middle and high schools have delivered knowledge on TDV while simultaneously introducing local youth to WSLB’s position as an advocate. Post-presentation activities, in turn, have provided WSLB staff with an opportunity to assess the needs of local youth and then bring those assessments to planning sessions with other service providers within the community’s continuum of care.
 
 The Safe Long Beach Steering Committee, as well as the City’s Inter-Department Team – which is charged with strengthening collaboration and coordination among City departments that prevent, intervene, or suppress violence – will continue to oversee and assess prevention developments in Long Beach, and those activities will reinforce the linkages made between WSLB’s work, and the broader work conducted through Safe Long Beach. Accordingly, there will be a variety of opportunities for WSLB to share project information with fellow Long Beach stakeholders.
 
 WSLB also has cultivated strong partnerships with many other youth-serving agencies in the community, and presentations through those agencies have helped reach a greater number of youth while facilitating a collaborative approach to addressing violence prevention – and particularly teen dating violence prevention – in Long Beach. 
 
 Through collaborations with program designers, such as A Window Between Worlds, which uses art as a healing tool to empower and transform individuals and communities impacted by violence and trauma, WSLB engages those youth in activities that benefit the community at-large. 
 
 Confirmed partners for this funding opportunity include: A Window Between Worlds and Su Casa. Furthermore, Tracy M. Colunga, Violence Prevention Coordinator for the City of Long Beach, endorses this application and strongly recommends it for funding. 
 
 Required for the success of this endeavor are: funding for the project, continued collaboration between the existing partners and the acquisition of new partners, and a strong coalition of volunteer leaders.",

World Peace One helps to connect the as-built environment in our communities with education through community-based projects. Residents who want to transform their environment are supported through mentoring and resources. Students in the education program gain academic credit in a hybrid learning environment by learning as well as journaling, designing, building, sculpting, growing food, coding, creating art, and innovating ideas for these neighborhood projects. In the end, residents and students form the foundation of a larger community that creates these innovative spaces. World Peace One classes are taught through a partnership with UCLA Extension, the Los Angeles City Community District, and iTunes University and range from a Transforming Your Community weekend boot camp for residents with little education to Earth Ethics for Environmental Design for degree-oriented learners.
 
 In addition to the Peace Projects above, Innovation hubs will be created in Los Angeles. These hubs will provide co-working space for Peace Project teams, and a nexus for classes and learning activities. Courses taught at the hub will initially focus on practical skills needed for community transformation (from the Peace Project boot camp to drafting to landscape architecture). Students and participants from the program will be encouraged to effect change in their community and provided space, mentoring, and access to potential investors to make their ideas into reality. These hubs are studios where solutions can be created, made, and innovated, including the use of new tools like 3D printing, visualization, and sustainable materials. The hubs will be operated in coordination with local government and universities. The first hub in Los Angeles is expected to be a joint venture amongst the City of Los Angeles, UCLA Extension, the Los Angeles Community College District, and World Peace One.","World Peace One is launching a global movement for peace, reaching billions of people through concerts, music, games, and social media. This movement will focus people on envisioning how to transform their communities, cities, and nations into safer spaces that will unleash human innovation—giving a voice and power to all citizens. World Peace One Education and Communities works with residents, businesses, educators, and governments to transform neighborhoods step-by-step to more beautiful, usable, safer, eco-friendly, and innovative spaces. 
 
 This movement is starting here, this year, in Los Angeles, with coordinated activities next year in cities around the world. Los Angeles will be the hub, the home, and the heart of this peace movement that starts with Angelenos helping create a new city around the needs of the residents in our neighborhoods.
 
 Over the next years and decades, project by project, block by block, L.A. will transform into the city its citizens dream it can be. Through the power of music, global awareness, and planned future fund raising, these Peace Projects will create sustainable spaces in the built environment across the city. L.A. will be the global model and lead other cities in how to become both a beautiful, safer city and to empower its citizens to be engaged, transformative, educated, and active.
 
 Transforming Communities for Peace will make L.A. the city we all dream it could be.","The project benefits Angelenos who are interested in changing the environment and conditions in their neighborhoods in a way that will make their lives better. The benefactors will be those people, their families, and their neighbors.
 
 These people are supported by students who benefit by receiving course credit and real experience in helping to design, build, and manage projects using skills from the classroom.
 
 A greater good happens when projects happen near each other, share practices, and create a library of models and designs that help others in the future. As projects start to connect in a physical way in the city, block by block, areas will be creatively transformed by the residents themselves, supported by not driven by city planners, architects, and professional designers.
 
 L.A.'s amazing strength is the diversity of its citizens and these projects allow them to express that diversity in visible ways and to be empowered to care for, create, and be involved in their city.
 
 From that empowerment, caring citizens watch out for each other, turn out to vote, seek out education and employment, and help others to do so.","To achieve these goals, there are a wide variety of partners ranging from the music production for future fund raising to implementation of Peace Projects and innovative hubs in Los Angeles and elsewhere.

Would-Works has tested and refined an approach that is now ready to grow. With funding from LA2050 Would-Works will secure permanent space in which to hold workshops, hold them more often, develop a marketing approach that will keep product sales robust, establish partnerships with relevant groups and enterprises and continue to develop products.","Would-Works CREATES opportunities. Would-Works CREATES quality products through collaboration. Would-Works CREATES a vibrant program highlighting a forward-thinking environment present in Los Angeles which can be a role-model for the rest of the country. We are proud of what we have achieved as a small organization so far, but we are ready to grow and have a larger influence. 
 
 In 2050 we see Would-Works continuing to empower some of the most disenfranchised and chronically unemployed individuals in Los Angeles to CREATE hand-made products. Would-Works anticipates being a part of the movement to greatly reduce homelessness in Los Angeles. Would-Works plans to continue to provide the opportunity for women and men to CREATE their own opportunities out of homelessness through the dignity of working for one’s own need.","In Los Angeles, 254,000 men, women and children experience homelessness during some part of the year and approximately 82,000 are homeless on any given night, according to the Institute for the Study of Homelessness and Poverty (Weingart Center, 2014). In the Skid Row area of downtown Los Angeles, over 5,000 are homeless. Further, 65% of the adults in Skid Row live on less than $10,000 a year. This is the population that Would-Works seeks to help. Would-Works addresses both the causes and the impacts of poverty and homelessness by helping people overcome barriers to employment and permanent housing by working to meet their own needs while becoming more employable in the process. With funding from LA2050, Would-Works will be able to focus on expanding the model. More workshops will be held; not only in Skid Row but also in additional areas and serving additional population groups. Would-Works has explored growth within several population groups. For example; the young adult population that has aged out of the foster system is a specific group that is in need of resources. By identifying specific groups, Would-Works can tailor the model to maximize impact on population segments.","We understand that to end an individual’s homelessness, we need to work with a number of partners. In addition, our products reflect collaboration and partnership for design and resources. With this in mind, we seek to establish partnerships on all sides of our business.
 
 Work Session Partners:
 
 Our work sessions have agency partners before and after the work is completed. Our Charter model has social services agency partners who refer men and women to the workshops. These social services are working with the individuals and help to identify the immediate need for which a person needs to work. We have currently partnered with Central City Outreach Center to refer men and women to the program and have informal agreements with permanent supportive housing providers as well. We have had inquiries for partnership from numerous social service agencies, schools, and training programs. However, before we can establish new partnerships we are focused on developing a permanent workshop to accommodate the large volume of referrals.
 
 Design Partners: 
 
 In addition to partners for our work sessions, we are also committed to partnering for design. We strive to create high-quality, hand-crafted products in downtown Los Angeles. To accomplish this, we have partnered with some designers to create products and plan to expand our design partnerships. We partnered with the Department of Design at Cal State Long Beach to create future products. We also collaborated with style blogger, Almanac of Style, on a limited edition product.",1,
4102266,SPEAK UP ACROSS LA!,We will share the stories of 50 youth across LA to help turn their ideas in action!,Connect,2014111,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050connect/projects/YOUTHSPEAKUP.html,,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,"We want to present the voices of our future leaders. By 2050, the youth of today will be the generation that inherits Los Angeles. One of them may even be the mayor in 2050. So why are we not listening to them?
 
 We plan to film 50 young people across LA and develop 50 solution stories. These short films will be shown in nontraditional and traditional settings in communities throughout Los Angeles. These stories will inspire others to follow their passion and be the difference they want to see in their community. Viewers of these short films can learn from these stories and in turn new partnerships will form because of this candid and powerful form of sharing solutions.","We plan to work with our team of students and mentors to film these stories across Los Angeles. We have broken up the yearlong project into four stages, outlined below. 
 
 Story Outreach (2 months) 
 • Brainstorm with team, mentors and partners. 
 • Create outreach strategy and implement outreach campaign and story website to collect stories across Los Angeles. 
 • Create criteria for story selection and clear format for filming, editing and the interview process. 
 • Visit elected offices, neighborhood councils, nonprofits and community centers to present on our mission and vision to document inspiring stories from our young people. 
 • Select 50 individuals evenly spread out across the five main regions of Los Angeles (South LA, East LA, Central LA, West Side and Valley) 
 
 Filming (6 months) 
 • Arrange film times with the young people to be interviewed.
 • Partner with local nonprofits to schedule interview locations. 
 • Film stories 
 
 Editing (2 months) 
 • Edit all footage
 • Meet with interviewees again if necessary
 • Complete all 50 two minute films
 
 Community Outreach (2 months) 
 • Arrange film screenings as conversations in local community locations. 
 • Arrange larger film screening in an open location (like Grand Park) in Central Los Angeles. 
 • Film screenings would allow youth and participants the opportunity to speak up after each film screening. We plan for break out conversations around the topics the stories evoke.","It is our belief that young people have a need to give input and speak up. In the last years we have seen this in the students we work with and the staff on our team. When given the opportunity, they have the drive and ability to surprise us with amazing ideas. Through genuine listening and authentic conversation we can tap into the fresh outlook and wisdom of youth in our currently estranged communities. The guidance and mentorship of invested, caring adults can help transform Los Angeles into a socially connected, civically active community.
 
 The program enables students to share a powerful story, an example of how they plan to be the change they see in their community. Young people will be able share how they give back and inspire others to step up in volunteer roles in their community, schools and city. Sharing stories among the community, residents create the type of human connections that play an important role in civic engagement, emotional intelligence and self-confidence we need to succeed and create a more connected LA.
 
 Our project will create a more engaged generation across Los Angeles and develop a line of stories that bind our experiences and commitment to give back. Once we present the stories in the communities they were born, the stories will be connected to others and potential partnerships will form. 
 
 By the simple act of documenting stories and listening to each other we also see our project impacting our society at 2050. These films will remind one another of our shared humanity, strengthen and build the connections between people and creating a culture of understanding in our higher risk communities in Los Angeles.
 
 Every movement of change needs a spark. These videos will create the spark. The film screenings will fan this energy and create conversations between people that will spread and continue for years. In the long run impacting the individual telling the story and the people who heard their story. 
 
 Each story will answer the questions: What legacy do they want to leave in their community? How do they see LA in 2050 if we all volunteered our time? How do they currently make an impact in their community? These videos could be the first step towards creating the impact that we need to transform our community.","Our project will benefit a variety of groups. First, the individual. The person who tells the story will be valued and listened to. Their story and ideas will be viewed by thousands. Through this message their own experiences will be honored and they will be empowered to continue their efforts in the community. These short videos will give young students a platform not only to find their voice, but to let that voice be heard across LA. By sharing their story, these students will become more confident in themselves, more empathetic towards their peers, and more committed to their community. These students will inspire others by the simple act of telling their story and sharing their solution ideas for an issue in their community. 
 
 Second, the individuals who hear the story will be engaged with the message and will be encouraged to find a way to partner with the storyteller. Through our film screening sessions we hope to inspire new partnerships and collaborative efforts through these stories and films. 
 
 Our Youth Speak Media Solutions team of students and mentors will also benefit from this project as they will experience the stories first hand during the time of production. Our team of students also become inspired to give back to their communities after capturing such powerful stories and witnessing the positive work organizations are doing across Los Angeles.","We would love to partner with you! As a nonprofit we have worked with groups across Los Angeles, and we would love to hear from new young people and groups making an impact in LA.
 
 Currently we plan to work with and actively collaborate with the following nonprofit and business partners: Youth Justice Coalition, The Hub LA, New Leaders Council, Proyecto Pastoral, Boys and Girls Club of Venice, and Unusual Suspects Theatre Company. We plan to reach out to other established and grassroots organizations throughout Los Angeles in our target communities once the campaign is funded. 
 
 We hope to partner also with various marketing firms, public relation organizations and media outlets to communicate these stories to as broad of an audience as possible. Some of which include, MTA that could showcase these short films in bus routes across Los Angeles. We currently have media partnerships with LATV, CNN, NBC, Junker Wagner Marketing, Media Image Public Relations and AK Design Strategies. 
 
 Once funded we will also partner with civic leaders in our target communities along with local neighborhood councils and the elected council members in that district. We know that by partnering with elected leaders in local, city and state levels we can create conversations both at the community and policy levels to really affect change and give an avenue for the students solutions and voice.",
4102010,Becoming An Ally: Stopping Bias and Bullying in Los Angeles Schools,"ADL would like to bring its anti-bullying programs, Becoming An Ally, to 30 underserved schools across Los Angeles County.",Learn,2014113,2014,,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,"ADL contracts with over two dozen facilitators to provide training to interested schools in the Los Angeles area. They have been trained to ensure top quality programming and fidelity to the program models. The facilitators are overseen by ADL’s full-time Project Director for its A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE® Institute who handles all coordination and logistics for educational programming in the region. The Project Director is assisted locally by an administrative assistant and supported more broadly by ADL’s national Education Division and its network of 28 regional offices across the United States. All facilitators must go through an extensive background and security check prior to being issued a contract to facilitate in ADL’s A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE® Institute. Facilitators must renew contracts on an annual basis. All Becoming An Ally programs are guided by two facilitators who model the importance of an anti-bias approach to preventing and addressing bullying. 
 
 Rigorously evaluated and based on top notch research and evidence, the Becoming An Ally program utilizes cutting edge, interactive learning activities. Each school goes through a detailed needs assessment and an agenda setting process with ADL’s A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE® Institute Project Director in the weeks leading up to their program. Following each day-long program, the Project Director will then produce evaluation reports, identify next steps, and engage in technical assistance with the school to continue its work towards a bias-free and non-violent learning environment.
 
 Few schools are able to pay the full costs of the program. Initiatives like LA2050 and the foundations that support them are critical to making these programs available. ADL’s Pacific Southwest Regional Office has waiting lists for clients eager to access these programs but unable to pay for them. Funding from LA2050 would allow ADL to immediately begin implementing programs and addressing unmet needs at schools across Los Angeles County.","Today, far too many students in Los Angeles are dropping out of school, skipping school, and engaging in anti-social activities because they are targeted in school by bullying, violence and bias-related behavior. According to 2011 data from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 15 percent of Los Angeles students report that they have been bullied on school property while 29 percent report being in one or more physical fights in the last year. More than 12 percent report being the target of electronic and cyberbullying. Even worse, students in Los Angeles are significantly more likely to report a recent suicide attempt than students in other areas across the United States. 
 
 ADL’s Becoming An Ally equips students with the skills they need to be an ally to targets of bullying and positively shift social norms around bullying, harassment and other forms of aggression. As Los Angeles students then teach these values to their peers—and eventually their own children—long-term changes in norms will be sustained through 2050 and beyond. These anti-bullying programs will create safer and more welcoming school climates which result in students being more committed to and engaged with their schools—both as current students and after they graduate. 
 
 Anti-bias and anti-bullying education at all ages helps to reduce violence and community strife and promote safety. Bias- and bullying-free learning environments are crucial to good mental health for the County’s younger residents now and in the years ahead.","ADL can train up to 1,200 educators and school staff at 30 trainings across the County over the next year. Assuming each teaches 100 students per year, those 1,200 school staff will then use the skills acquired through their training to positively impact the lives of more than 120,000 students each year. The Becoming An Ally program is tailored for elementary, middle and high school educators and staff. K-12 students will benefit from their educators being trained through the project. They in turn will shift social norms regionally related to bullying and pass those values onto people younger than them as well as future generations. The primary beneficiaries (1200 staff members) will help secondary beneficiaries (120,000 students) shift social norms and create safer places for many thousands of future students, the tertiary beneficiaries. Further, all of the County’s residents will benefit from safer schools and communities.","At the national level, ADL has existing partnerships with the following organizations and initiatives to address bias and bullying: the Ad Council, the American Bar Association’s Anti-Bullying Initiative, Cartoon Network’s Stop Bullying, Speak Up initiative, Common Sense Media, Center for Safe and Responsible Internet Use, Cyberbullying Prevention Center, the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN), the Great American NO BULL Challenge, the International Bullying Prevention Association, MTV’s A Thin Line and Look Different campaigns, Not In Our School, the Olweus Bullying Prevention Program, PACER’s National Bullying Prevention Center, Share My Lesson, Stand4Change, StopBullying.gov, and the Human Rights Campaign’s Welcoming Schools Program. Each of these organizations and initiatives have partnered with ADL to make the anti-bullying programs successful and bring a wide variety of perspectives and resources to augment ADL’s anti-bullying work. ADL’s office in Los Angeles is ready to engage these partnerships to ensure the success of our anti-bullying work in the region.
 
 Education staff from ADL’s Pacific Southwest Regional Office also hold local positions on the Los Angeles Unified School District’s Commission on Human Relations, Diversity and Equity and the City Human Relations Commission’s Anti-Bullying Coalition. ADL also works closely with the Los Angeles County Human Relations Commission and other regional partners to plan local conferences including the Cyber Crime Prevention Symposium. Through its work on coalitions, commissions and similar partnerships, ADL can draw expertise and resources from law enforcement, elected officials, school officials and other human relations experts. ADL’s local partners assist in identifying schools in need of anti-bullying training and disseminating crucial information across diverse networks.",0,
4102012,Los Angeles Trade Tech - A 21st Century Urban Agriculture Curriculum,"Seafood for the Future is a community of people and businesses working to promote healthy, responsible seafood choices.",Live,2014114,2014,,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,Long Beach,"Seafood for the Future (SFF) works at all levels of the supply chain to bring about change, generates public awareness of ocean issues, and helps consumers make responsible choices about seafood that support family budgets, local economies, and our ocean ecosystem. We have successful partnerships with chefs, restaurants, fisheries, and distributors, and while we will continue to grow the business advisory aspect of our program, our focus now is on generating tools for the consumer. 
 
 Ultimately, the consumer controls the demand for seafood. By empowering the public with the knowledge and tools they need to make healthy, responsible seafood choices, we can shift the demand in favor of sustainable seafood options, healthier communities, and abundant ocean ecosystems.
 
 To do this, we need to educate the public about the health and economic benefits of eating a variety of seafood. Our consumer platform will create a number of new digital resources, our community’s preferred source of educational and consumer information, in collaboration with a nutrition expert and local chefs. 
 
 1. Instructional cooking videos and easy recipes for healthy seafood meals for busy, budget conscious families.
 2. A podcast series that discusses the future of seafood and how our food choices are affecting the ocean and local L.A. seafood communities from fisherman, to restaurants, to consumers.
 3. A social media campaign that catalogs recipes for healthy, affordable seafood meals contributed and reviewed by the public.
 4. An expanded web tool that showcases local restaurants and businesses providing seafood from responsible sources. Participating businesses will label responsible seafood items with the SFF California Local icon.
 
 Videos will be produced by the Aquarium's award-winning audio visual production team, which has won 14 international Telly awards. We will use existing relationships within the seafood industry in Southern California (chefs, fishermen, aquaculture farmers, scientists, and government and non-government organizations) to provide content for podcasts. The Aquarium's marketing department will inform and promote the social media campaign and digital resources to 1.5 million onsite visitors and 3 million visitors to the website annually.
 
 Seafood for the Future is a non-profit seafood advisory program based at the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, the second most-visited cultural destination in Los Angeles County.","In Los Angeles, the urban ocean is one-of-a-kind. Its beauty attracts people from around the world in search of inspiration, adventure, and rejuvenation. It offers an uncharacteristically forgiving oceanography, and the second-largest port system in the world, supporting local, national, and global economies. The ocean regulates our weather, supplies our food and medicines, and sustains all life on the planet. 
 
 But the ocean is in a state of duress–overfishing, bycatch, and habitat damage are threatening the health of our ocean and seafood supply. We have the opportunity and the responsibility, especially in Los Angeles, a coastal metropolis and one of the largest economies in the world, to model a balanced approach to seafood consumption that is healthy for people, communities, and the planet.
 
 The United States has the largest Exclusive Economic Zone (the area extending from the coastline out 200 miles) of any nation on Earth. And, the United States is a global leader in sustainable fishing—our fisheries are some of the best managed in the world. Yet 91% of our seafood is imported, (mostly farmed tilapia and shrimp that provide fewer nutrients), while we export a third of our heart healthy, omega-rich, sustainably-fished and farmed seafood. 
 
 Seafood is an important part of a healthy diet and Americans do not eat enough. With easy-to-use digital tools and access to educational resources, the public can make affordable, nutrient-rich, local sustainable seafood choices today. Consumers have the power to influence sourcing with our wallets, and Seafood for the Future’s new tools will guide consumer decision-making all the way from the grocery store to the dinner table.
 
 In 2050, we envision a new relationship between humans and the ocean–one that sustains healthy, abundant ecosystems and economies. Our ocean is resilient, and given the chance, marine species can recover from over-fishing. Since 1999, with a stringent U.S. protection plan and international cooperation, the swordfish population has nearly fully recovered from a state of severe depletion to healthy levels. By 2050, with low consumer demand, better management of fisheries, and conservation efforts in place, we can rebuild the population of many more threatened species while supporting a rapidly growing population (expected to be 9 billion by 2050) with access to healthy, nutrient-rich, and affordable seafood options.","Eating the right types of seafood is healthy for people and the planet. It will require a balanced approach that includes seafood from well-managed fisheries, responsible aquaculture, and imports from sustainable sources. This approach to seafood consumption will reduce pressure on wild stocks, promote ecologically responsible aquaculture, and reduce our climate impacts by balancing imports with local seafood sources. 
 
 Consumers: Seafood is a healthy source of heart-healthy Omega-3 fatty acids, low-fat protein, and a variety of vitamins and minerals. The U.S. FDA and EPA recently released updated advice that recommends pregnant women and young children to eat two to three servings of a variety of low-mercury fish per week to promote healthy brain development. This project will provide tools and resources for families on the go to enjoy quick, healthy, and responsibly-sourced seafood meals that balance our nutritional needs with our impact on the ocean. 
 
 Restaurants and Businesses: Heightened consumer awareness will strengthen SFF and other organizations' efforts to promote restaurants and businesses that are working to source responsibly. In addition, the education and outreach programs will offer information on where to buy local seafood and delicious recipes to inspire chefs and restaurants to diversify their menus to incorporate local seafood items such as sablefish, sardines, and rockfish. 
 
 Local Fishermen and Coastal Communities: Most of the seafood harvested in Southern California is shipped to international markets. The outreach tools developed by the project will make buying local easy and affordable. By supporting local seafood consumption, consumers will be connected to local fishing communities and committed to revitalizing our working waterfront to support fishermen, our coastal communities, and other projects such as environmentally-sound aquaculture.","LA Kitchen (confirmed): LA Kitchen is a nonprofit providing youth aging out of foster care and older adults in the prison system hands-on training for careers in the food service and health care industries. SFF works with LA Kitchen to teach participants about healthy seafood choices in the food service industry. Affordable options, exciting recipes, and the opportunity to promote the efforts of LA Kitchen participants are critical to a successful collaboration.
 
 Trace and Trust (confirmed): Trace and Trust is building a community of food professionals dedicated to celebrating the farmers and fishermen behind our food. Using the Trace and Trust platform, restaurants trace their menu items directly to the farmers and fishermen responsible for the food and share these stories with their patrons. Trace and Trust members include restaurants, distributors, fishermen, farmers, and ranchers in Southern California and other locations, as well as aquaculture farms. SFF is the first aquarium partner working with Trace and Trust to support local seafood communities and promote responsible seafood from the boat or the farm to the plate. This successful collaboration will include promotion to Aquarium audiences, diverse avenues to share stories from social media to onsite festivals, and connecting our partners with Trace and Trust's project and mission.
 
 Local Fishermen and Producers (confirmed): SFF works closely with local fishermen and aquaculture producers to promote healthy and responsible seafood choices. Our new tools will include education and outreach materials that feature local fishermen, directories of local fish markets where consumers can buy direct, and a local seasonality chart for chefs and consumers. These new tools will help bridge the gap between consumers and the source of their seafood.
 
 SFF Restaurant and Business Partners (confirmed): SFF has established a network of restaurant, distribution, and retail partners working together to promote responsible seafood sourcing. Our partner chefs will star in the video demonstration series, provide seafood for cooking demonstration and educational purposes, and host cooking demonstrations at outreach events.",1,

Divining LA will pair economically and culturally diverse community-based organizations with teams of university and professional designers. Each team will be challenged and supported to invent a water-smart future for specific neighborhoods. Teams will generate design visions and policy recommendations for their own small-scale, distributed approaches to a localized water future, appropriate to the scale, tempo, and flavor of their neighborhood, and the greater hydrologic function of the LA basin. 
 
 Divining LA provides an opportunity not only to residents and business owners to visualize climate adaptation and mitigation strategies; it also provides a much-needed, real-time opportunity for Los Angeles’ rich design culture to advance water-smart planning policy and building systems for a resilient future.
 
 Divining LA will bring together faculty, graduate and undergraduate researchers from Woodbury, asmall, private Hispanic-serving university, and collaborator design programs from around the region. Teams will have the support and involvement of engineers from public water agencies and leading global firms; NGOs with long track records of service to the communities of Los Angeles; and multidisciplinary research and design teams from universities and the design professions. In year one, Divining LA partners will build on existing relationships throughout its collaborator network to identify specific neighborhoods and community-based organizations for partnerships. Divining LA will partner with a range of communities facing specific hydrologic, economic, and cultural challenges that would most benefit from being paired with Divining LA planning and design teams. The goal is to generate a set of visionary water-management strategies for each of the disparate communities engaged, and to propose and advocate for new policies suggested by the design challenge. From these, a small number of projects will be selected as possible demonstration projects. Divining LA will widely publicize, encourage debate, document and disseminate the results of all projects.","LA benefits today in engaging citizens to design their own destiny. LA benefits tomorrow with water, energy, and carbon savings. Los Angeles River Watershed area, at 864 square miles and 65% impermeability, generates 350,000 acre feet of storm water runoff per year, enough for 2,100,000 people per year at current usage rates or with conservation measures in place, enough for 2,625,000 people. That translates to a gross energy savings of 700 gigawatt hours or the equivalent of taking 130,000 passenger vehicles off the road.","Divining LA outreach has the potential to bring advanced geospatial research to public benefit rapidly. It has the potential to optimize the hydrologic function of the arid built environment; uncouple the water-energy nexus; produce hydrologic planning, zoning, building code reforms; encourage small scale distributed water infrastructures as design opportunities that respect the cultural and biophysical attributes of communities and watersheds; promote building-integrated water systems innovation for the global marketplace; retool science and design curricula to creatively engage the challenges of climate adaptation; and increase participation of underrepresented communities.

To us, it is an integration of all of the different concepts in a way that they overlap and flow seamlessly to support one aspect that also supports the next one. A holistic approach. Our project is aimed at facilitating access to a space in which we can integrate all of our different ideas about the notion of living healthy lives and scaffold a conscious awareness amongst community members of how to apply them to their own lives by experiencing them here at the park. We will make Los Angeles the healthiest place to live by promoting a connection and appreciation for healthy foods, disseminating information about how to access these foods either through feasible outlets or growing them at home (even without significant access to space or resources), increasing canopy cover (reducing air toxins) at the park and beyond using fruit bearing trees, hosting physical engagement activities to fight obesity (and improve the bike/transit score through mobility), combating violent acts through restorative justice programming (guiding responsibility for actions that have hurt or harmed someone else rather than focusing on punishment and isolation from the community), exemplifying conscientious use of water resources and ways of reducing polluted waterways (through water diversion methods, reducing run-off, and and reducing use of harmful chemicals), while simultaneously engaging people’s need for interaction and creativity to sustain a healthy approach to life in the face of adversity and the prevalent socio-economic disparities that are rampant in Los Angeles.","The project will benefit young children in the vicinity with access to an open park space, it will benefit high school and college students who need an outlet for civic engagement to build skillsets for their future, low-income families seeking access to healthy food and preventive health information, families looking for a place to spend time together and enjoy cultural events, everyone in Los Angeles wanting to explore urban permaculture in a hands-on setting, community members seeking involvement in sustainable living issues, at-risk youth in the area needing mentoring and financial support, as well as creative and professional community members needing a supportive space (as well as stipends and materials) in which to share their expertise with others.","All of the following collaborators have been confirmed.

4102020,The Pathway,We offer a mechanism to provide for the immediate needs of a child living in poverty while helping families become self-sufficient.,Live,2014117,2014,,,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,,"We will implement this project through a four-pronged approach, 1) scale up a network of community-based organizations (CBOs) that directly serve target populations, 2) cultivate partnerships with aligned corporations to secure critical gear for families in need, 3) work with communities to “recycle” gently used items, and 3) tailor donations to specific needs. 
 
 Baby Buggy has operated in New York for 13 years using this proven approach. Recently, the organization merged with LA Diaper Drive, the nation’s largest diaper bank, to expand its efforts into LA to serve one of America’s most vulnerable cities. Though we currently work with several CBOs in LA, we will scale up a network of organizations that are concentrated in low-income neighborhoods and offer programs designed to give individuals the skills necessary to become self-sufficient. These programs include job skills training, GED prep, and financial literacy classes. With additional resources, we would have the capacity to more actively secure CBOs that meet our standards, while closely monitoring these anti-poverty programs. 
 
 Secondly, we will cultivate relationships with product manufacturers to secure critical gear. Using our NY program as a model, we will communicate needs to corporate representatives to funnel excess inventory through LA, thereby saving on shipping costs, or in unique cases, secure a non-profit discount to purchase product at cost. Baby Buggy will also provide a mechanism for the community to recycle items their child has outgrown. We will work with local businesses to operate as “drop off sites,” where individuals can donate gently used items in exchange for a tax deduction. 
 
 Lastly, we will tailor donations specific to an agency’s needs so that items are instrumental in increasing parental participation. Nearly all of our CBO partners in NY report that using donated items as incentives helps them leverage the impact of their programs. One partner found, for example, that they were able to increase the number of families accessing their services by 26% simply by providing a free pack of diapers to those who came in for benefits screenings. Once an individual gets in the door, they are then more likely to feel empowered to change their situation. We plan to do quarterly check-ins with these organizations to take an inventory of their needs, with a goal of fulfilling at least 60% of requests by end of year one. Our NY counterpart currently achieves an 84% success rate.","We believe our initiative will help to make LA the healthiest place to live by 1) improving the health and safety of children living in poverty in LA, 2) lowering the prevalence of children impacted by adverse childhood experiences, and 3) lowering the number of households living below the self-sufficiency standard by offering resources that help to halt the cycle of poverty. 
 
 First, our idea will improve the health and safety of children living in low-income households by providing parents with resources to safeguard a child from harm. Families cannot purchase items such as diapers, strollers, or cribs with food stamps, so children living in poverty often lack access to basic needs. Children without a crib often sleep in drawers or between parents or can be strapped into a car seat not designed to fit their size; both can lead to severe injury or death. Meanwhile, when a parent cannot afford diapers—an adequate supply costs roughly $100 or more per month—they report keeping infants in a single diaper for a day or longer. This can lead to infection and hygiene issues, while putting children at risk for social, emotional, and behavioral problems down the line. 
 
 Our initiative is also structured to lower the prevalence of children whose lives are impacted by adverse childhood experiences. When a single mother has basic needs met, she is more likely to leave an abusive relationship or avoid incarceration, which ultimately impact her children. In the same right, research shows that when a father can provide for a child, he’s more likely to have greater access to his child and play a greater role in his/her life. Aside from basic infant needs, our model also supports healthy child development by giving children tools like books and school supplies to get the most from their education. 
 
 Lastly, our initiative helps to lower the number of households living below the self-sufficiency standard, today and by 2050, by giving families resources to halt the cycle of poverty. For instance, most daycare centers require a week’s worth of diapers for enrollment. If a parent cannot afford a week of diapers, they may not be able to enroll their child in daycare, and thereby cannot work to support their family. Eventually, their children join the poverty cycle. We not only meet immediate needs to help families succeed, but also support long-term goals through life-improving programs.","Through a network of carefully selected CBOs, we will aim to benefit low-income families with children who live in LA’s most challenged neighborhoods. Neighborhoods of focus include East LA (Boyle Heights), San Fernando Valley (North Hollywood, Pacoima, Panorama City, Sunland), San Gabriel Valley (Alhamabra, El Monte, Glendale, and Pasadena), South Central (Jefferson Park, Watts), and parts of Central LA (Downtown and Hollywood) and South Bay (Inglewood, Torrance). We serve a large population of single and first-time mothers, predominantly from Latino and African American communities. We also serve refugee children from Iraq, Somalia and Afghanistan through a partnership with the Tiyya Foundation. Here is a snapshot of the children, parents and families we serve:
 
 43% are single mothers
 30% are homeless or live in a shelter
 27% of the children have special needs
 21% live below the federal poverty line of $22,350 for a family of 4 
 25% are working poor 
 12% are domestic violence survivors","It is inherent to our mission to collaborate with other non-profit organizations in LA to achieve our goals. While our goal is to expand our network, we currently collaborate with organizations such as Children’s Institute International (CII), Tiyya Foundation, Nurse-Family Partnership, and Black Infant Health to operate life-improving programs that meet our goals of helping low-income families become more self-sufficient. Through our partnership, we offer incentives to increase participation in these programs and classes. We also recently merged with LA Diaper Drive, an organization founded in LA in 2005, to expand our resources and deepen our impact in the LA community. 
 
 Here are three factors that are critical to the success of our collaboration:
 
 Factor #1 - Highly effective programs: In order for us to be successful in achieving our objectives, partners need to have highly functioning and independent programs in place to support individuals in improving their life situations. These programs must be run by trained and educated individuals who have experience dealing with the economic issues that plague these communities. 
 
 Factor #2 - Donated items: To improve the health, safety and well-being of children living in poverty, and in turn, the sustainability of our partners’ services, we need to have access to essential gear, products and services that will positively impact the lives of children and families we serve. 
 
 Factor #3: - Communication: Because we are not working directly with the individuals we serve, it is imperative that we have an open and reciprocal line of communication with partner CBOs. We must respond to their needs in a timely fashion, and they must strongly communicate the impact of our donations so we can continue to obtain items from generous corporations, retailers, and individuals.",0,
4102026,IamLA- Inspiring the future generation of Angelenos with a youth-led STEAM Awareness Campaign,Our youth-led IamLA Campaign will inspire Los Angeles youth to study and pursue STEAM related careers.,Learn,2014118,2014,,,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,,"For 77 years, BGCH has provided out-of-school educational and enrichment programs for underprivileged students. 9 Dots was founded in 2011 by three engineering alumni from Stanford University with degrees in mechanical engineering, environmental engineering, and computer science and a Ph.D student in UCLA’s Department of Education. 9 Dots provides homework help, math and literacy enrichment, and hands-on STEAM projects after school. BGCH and 9 Dots are both located in the Hollywood area of Los Angeles, a high-poverty area where the median income ($33,694) is far lower than the county’s ($56,241) and the state’s ($61,400), and almost a third of adults 25 years or older never finished high school. 
 
 BGCH and 9 Dots will collaborate to provide the IamLA ""Steam on the Go!"" Campaign. Activities include: 
 1) 20 youth will be identified to become IamLA Youth Leaders and the “STEAM on the Go!” Leadership Team. 
 2) Develop a creative STEAM curriculum for the IamLA Youth Leaders to present. 
 3) Train the IamLA Youth Leaders using STEAM training curriculum covering material relevant to the age groups the Youth Leaders will serve (1st-8th grades). Training will incorporate leadership development skills, classroom management skills, and public speaking skills.
 4) Build the “STEAM on the Go!” mobile lab (cart with all materials).
 5) Create IamLA “STEAM on the Go!” t-shirts. 
 6) Develop the IamLA-“STEAM on the Go!” resource guide. 
 7) Develop a website/blog run by the Youth Leaders for the Campaign. 
 
 IamLA Youth Leaders will participate in on-site visits with (1) professors and/or professionals in STEAM fields at UCLA, USC, and CSUN; (2) a civil engineer or architect at a construction site; (3) a physician at the Children’s Hospital or at the UCLA or USC hospitals; (4) animation crews at an animation studio to observe how computer science or graphic design components go into the animation of a video game or movie; and (5) professors in Archeology, Physics, or Chemistry, culminating with a visit to the Griffith Park Observatory and the La Brea Tar Pits. 
 
 The IamLA Campaign will conclude with a carnival where schools visited will be invited to send a team. Each team will have a booth and will present a STEAM activity/project to those in attendance. A panel of judges made up of city council members, school officials, STEAM professionals, and community partners will determine the winners, basing scores on creativity and audience engagement.","The IamLA STEAM Campaign will help the Youth Leaders strengthen their leadership skills, public speaking skills, and teamwork skills, while simultaneously empowering them to create positive changes in their community. Educational researchers have found that peer teaching and peer-to-peer collaboration are highly effective. Therefore, due to the youth-led aspect of the IamLA Campaign, the students that the Youth Leaders present to will be excited by STEAM subjects, how these subjects relate to everyday life, and what STEAM could mean to them in their future careers. Furthermore, students served by the IamLA campaign will be inspired and motivated to learn STEAM subjects and engage in discussions with parents and school officials about their futures in STEAM. This project will also build in the community by laying the foundation for developing more partnerships among organizations, youth, and individuals to further promote diversity in STEAM fields. In addition, the accessibility of the website and blog will create a space that will continue to raise awareness of STEAM and develop new ideas for partnerships throughout Los Angeles and beyond.
 
 The Campaign will be a catalyst through which BGCH and 9 Dots youth empower other youth by exposing them to STEAM fields that have traditionally lacked in diversity. The overarching purpose of IamLA is to disprove the idea that STEAM careers are out of reach for disadvantaged youth in Los Angeles.","The IamLA STEAM Campaign will primarily benefit Los Angeles youth in grades 1-8 in the Los Angeles Unified School District, a demographic that is predominantly low income and African American or Latino. The campaign will also benefit the community at large by creating more young role models and leaders working to better their communities. We believe that the age group we are targeting with our campaign is most likely to develop an interest in STEAM, as they have many more years of school left to continue developing their interest in and knowledge of STEAM before applying to college. In the long run, we hope to see an increase in diversity in STEAM fields.
 
 One of the goals of our awareness campaign is to instill in our youth the desire to expand their knowledge of STEAM through involvement in programs like BGCH, 9 Dots, and other STEAM programs. Developing an interest in STEAM during their crucial formative years makes it more possible for youth to pursue STEAM fields. When the youth we serve reach high school, they will be more likely to have a deeper understanding of STEAM, making it an accessible option when applying to college and pursuing a career. 
 
 Los Angeles is an enormously diverse city, and its youth provide an immeasurable wealth of experiences and perspectives that can shape the future of the city and its residents. We believe that if our youth, who will eventually grow up to become college students and young professionals, play a larger role in STEAM fields, Los Angeles will greatly benefit.","9 Dots Learning Center is partnering with the Boys & Girls Club of Hollywood to create the IamLA STEAM Campaign. BGCH and 9 Dots have existing partnerships with schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District, and have previously worked together to share curriculum and provide STEAM professional development workshops. Additional collaborations with local colleges and student organizations from UCLA, USC and CSUN will provide guidance, onsite visits with professors, and real time learning. BGCH has worked with the Office of Admissions from these local colleges and will continue to do so in order to gain access to professors and the hands-on learning experiences we plan to offer our youth leaders. 
 
 The factors contributing to our success are:
 1. The identification and training of Youth Leaders from Boys & Girls Club of Hollywood and 9 Dots
 2. Establishing working relationships with the administration at local schools
 3. BGCH’s 75+ years in youth development programs and 9 Dots expertise in STEAM subjects",0,
4102027,College Bound,College Bound's purpose is to introduce/expose Club members to idea of college and prepare them for a successful experience.,Learn,2014119,2014,,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,"We currently support 14 other boys and girls clubs in Los Angeles County in their efforts to implement our College Bound program, Further, we support 41 other organizations across the US. By adding additional resources we will help implement and support College Bound in the other Clubs in the Los Angeles area and
 other interested organizations.","Since we created and implemented the College Bound program in 2002, we have seen the high school graduation rates of our members
 improve from less than 50% to 98% in 2013. Of these graduates, 97%
 enrolled in a 2 or 4 year college/university this past fall.",We currently provides support services and case management to over 1400 students in grades six through twelve. College Bound staff work closely with and advocate for Club members to ensure that students are enrolled in the correct courses for high school graduation and college acceptance. This is a much-needed resource when almost half of the graduates in these communities do not have the required courses. Program staff works with students individually to identify educational and career goals. Each student receives assistance throughout the search and application processes related to college admission and scholarships.,"Our primarily partnership is with other Boys & Girls Clubs, although we also partner with the Los Angeles Unified School District and currently serve youth on eleven LAUSD school sites.",0,
4102028,Nutrition Education Program,We would provide on-site cooking classes at community gardens and local events to educate working families on healthy eating.,Live,2014120,2014,,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,"First, we would retrofit a food truck in consultation with cooking instructors. This requires not only a functional kitchen but also small groups of people to participate in cooking and larger groups to view the process at work. 
 
 Second, we would partner with community organizations to find locations and events where our lessons could be practical. These could include parks, schools, farmers markets, and community festivals. We would also seek partnerships with public health organizations, so our demonstrations could complement the work that they do.
 
 Third, we would take the truck into the community. At events like those specified above, we would provide two types of classes: hands-on classes with small groups that would allow community members to participate in creation of recipes, and demonstrations for larger groups that would showcase recipes. 
 
 Fourth, once the success of this project has been validated, we would seek sponsors for ongoing support. We anticipate that local supermarkets, for example, could be interested in the social goals of the project in exchange for logo recognition or as part of a corporate social responsibility campaign.","Many people do not prepare healthy meals at home because they believe it is expensive and time-consuming. Brown Paper LA wants to show low-income and working families that neither is the case. Making healthy food at home is easier and cheaper than they expect. 
 
 Teaching these families how to create healthy recipes at home will make LA a healthy place to live today. Our recipes will be simple and easy enough to demonstrate directly from a truck, using inexpensive ingredients that can be found at a local supermarket. Further, through our partnerships with public health organizations and local vendors, communities would have access to healthy foods and health awareness that they might not otherwise have. 
 
 Giving Los Angeles a broader appreciation for fresh food and cooking will make it one of the healthiest places to live in 2050. Food insecurity and lack of access are two major problems facing the city. This shouldn’t be the case, since California has some of the freshest ingredients in the world. We believe that by teaching citizens about how to prepare their food, they have a closer relationship to it and the world around them.","These cooking classes will benefit low-income and working families who may believe that they do not have the time nor the skills to cook healthy meals for their families. 
 
 We would provide these demonstrations in areas that face food insecurity, including high concentrations of WIC and EBT usage, high rates of dietary conditions including diabetes and obesity, as well as limited access to healthy foods.
 
 Brown Paper LA wants to encourage these families to make healthier choices and show that cooking healthy meals does not have to be an expensive nor time-consuming process. Further, we want to increase availability of healthy foods by encouraging partnerships with local farmers and food vendors who could sell their goods alongside our demonstrations. 
 
 By the same token, this project would also benefit local farmers and food vendors. We anticipate that our classes and demonstrations would attract captive audiences that could be potential consumers of fresh produce and other foods. This would create new markets that they may not have anticipated and provide them an incentive to serve low-income areas.","We anticipate that Brown Paper could integrate as an add-on feature to a wide range of events and community services. This project would only be as successful as the partnerships we create. 
 
 Strong potential partners could include: public health outreach campaigns, low-income health clinics, local grocery stores, community gardens, food truck events, farmers markets, and community festivals. Additionally, we could provide specific programming to incorporate into nonprofit events around nutrition, such as school education series. 
 
 We would also partner with healthy food vendors -- e.g. community-supported agriculture and organic farmers -- to sell their wares alongside our demonstrations. Our demonstrations would likely generate business for these vendors and, in doing so, create a means for low-income neighborhoods to access healthy foods.",1,
4102032,CARECEN - LA College Head Start,"College Head Start provides high schools students academic enrichment, college admission/financial aid assistance, and college transition.",Learn,2014122,2014,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,"For the past two years, CARECEN has been building momentum to continue expanding the College Head Start (CHS) Program, not only to those graduating seniors from within the Belmont Zone of Choice, but to creatively build a program that will be fully integrated within a local high school as a requirement for high school graduation. Since its inception in late 2012, CARECEN has provided over 50 students and their families with College Head Start Program services, with 100% of participants accepted to four-year institutions including: Harvard University; University of California, Santa Cruz; California State University, Los Angeles, other community and vocational schools.
 
 Nevertheless, as we continue to grow the College Head Start Program, it is our belief that in order for CARECEN to make a significant impact in the lives of Latino students, we must have the opportunity to fully integrate our program at a local high school, amongst graduating students (12th grade) and even younger (9th through 11th grade students) in an effort to increase high school graduation, college eligibility and enrollment, and increase college graduation rates for Latino students. 
 
 One way to implement this idea is working with a local high school, sharing CARECEN's College Head Start Program vision where college readiness and graduation are the standard! CARECEN has been approached by Civitas School of Leadership, a local high school located in Central Los Angeles, designed as a small school community, Civitas pursues high quality student learning through data-driven instruction, project-based learning, interdisciplinary curriculum, and vertical planning. With many of Civitas students approaching CARECEN to participate in their after-school tutoring and college counseling, school officials initiated talks with CARECEN regarding the creation and development of year long curriculum and classes to be offered at Civitas benefitting their students.
 
 In order to fully implement CARECEN's College Head Start Program, we (CARECEN) need to hire a program assistant to support current students enrolled in the program in order for the program coordinator to fully develop a school-year curriculum addressing graduating high school students needs as they transition out of high school, how to finance their education and their detachment from their family as they pursue higher learning. CARECEN will speak with Civitas' Principal, Parent Council and School Board to pursue funding.","CARECEN strongly believes that in order for our community to flourish we must first look toward our students, whose ongoing struggle to complete their high school education has been a task left unattended. Our College Head Start Program enriches students’ lives by encouraging them to become active participants in their communities, while also striving for academic enrichment and a successful transition toward college-life. By helping students reach their high school graduation goals, encouraging their path toward higher education, the City of Los Angeles will benefit from an elite class of hard-working and intellectual Latino students. 
 
 Having bright students incorporate their lives within the City of Los Angeles, local communities (many of which those same students grew up in) will return to their roots in pursuit of changing the community makeup make academic enrichment and college readiness the standard! For each student who successfully completes our College Head Start Program, they will not only become an asset to our community but will become our future community leaders.","CARECEN's College Head Start Program will benefit students and families residing in Central Los Angeles, specifically within the communities of Westlake/Pico-Union. Students, specifically those attending Civitas School of Leadership, are recruited from within a five to ten mile radius of CARECEN's Community Center located in Central Los Angeles community of Pico-Union. 
 
 Program participants are composed of 12th grade high school students; both high and low academically performing; first generation students attending college; students/families with limited financial resources, English as a Second Language (ESL) and English Language Learner (ELL) students, and undocumented AB540 students. The College Head Start Program will serve local City of Los Angeles students, ranging in age from 16 – 18 years old, with an ethnic breakdown including: 98% Latino, 2% Mixed Ethnicity.
 
 Many students coming to CARECEN seeking academic enrichment services have been labeled by community standards as underserved and at-risk due to a lack of college advisors at schools, and suffering through significant state budget deficits with continuous educational cutbacks. It is worth nothing that neighboring high schools among the Belmont Zone of Choice where Civitas is located, are among some of Los Angeles Unified School District's most underperforming schools, with a graduation rate of 34%. CARECEN’s College Head Start Program will prove that is core curriculum and student-led services provide significant academic support and individualized attention, addressing the unmet educational needs of disadvantaged, under-served, and at-risk students; filling the gaps that exists in local schools.
 
 We believe that academic success goes hand-in-hand with leadership development for students and parents, therefore, College Head Start’s goals are to create a sustainable high school impact program, geared to support graduating students among Civitas School of Leadership and many other among the Belmont Zone of Choice by: (1) monitoring students academic progress, (2) ensuring students access to academic support, (3) helping students earn a high school diploma, and (4) preparing students to attend a: university, community college, vocational and/or trade school.
 
 Real change and benefits derive from communities who are well-informed, have the necessary tools to advocate for quality education, and who collaborate with key institutions such as schools and community organizations.","Throughout its 31 year history, CARECEN has produced many successful partnerships and collaborations with local community based organizations, regional and out-of-state partners, sister organizations, schools districts and private and public agencies. The College Head Start Program collaborates and partners with local schools in order to request transcripts, grades, school involvement, and most importantly, to streamline the process of test scores (SAT or ACT) and credit completion as a requirement for college admission. 
 
 As the program continues to expand and funding is secured, CARECEN will partner with Civitas School of Leadership in the Westlake/Pico-Union community. As previously noted, Civitas is designed as a small school and part of the Los Angeles Smalls Schools Center, Civitas School of Leadership pursues high quality student learning through a variety of means, including data-driven instruction, project-based learning, interdisciplinary curriculum, and vertical planning. 
 
 A strong partnership with Civitas School of Leadership will enable CARECEN to integrate the College Head Start Program as a graduation requirement benefiting more than 600 graduating high school seniors each academic year. CARECEN has worked with Civitas School of Leadership for many years providing academic enrichment and parent education workshops at school campus and CARECEN's Community Center. Our successful and ongoing partnership throughout the years with Civitas has created a trusting relationship with CARECEN and the strength of our programs have demonstrated our effectiveness to aid students in reaching their highest academic potential. 
 
 Most notably, the three critical factors to the success of our partnership with Civitas School of Leadership are: 
 1. Creating a culture where academic enrichment and college readiness are the standard. 
 2. Partnering with local colleges, universities and other community-based organizations to create a network of collaborative partners willing to help students create a transition plan toward college-life. 
 3. Working together (CARECEN and Civitas) influencing a lasting change in the Westlake/Pico-Union community by raising awareness for higher academic standards and college readiness.",0,
4102033,Transforming school communities through digital learning,"CFY’s Digital Learning Program provides training & digital learning tools to teachers, students & families in LA low-income communities.",Learn,2014123,2014,,,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,,"CFY will provide wrap-around support for students, teachers, and families at 5 low-income LAUSD middle schools where we will implement our Digital Learning Program in 2014-15. The Digital Learning Program includes three key elements: Family involvement in learning, professional development for educators, and PowerMyLearning.
 
 FAMILY INVOLVEMENT IN LEARNING:
 
 CFY provides workshops for parents and students at our partner schools that are designed to increase students’ self-directed learning, empower parents, and provide access to technology at home. They include:
 
 1. Essentials of Home Learning: A highly engaging workshop in which families learn how to use home technology to improve student learning. Families also receive a free refurbished home computer that is theirs to keep. The workshop encourages families' ongoing use of the technology for learning.
 
 2. Additional workshops such as “The Internet as a Learning Tool,” “Supporting Student Learning at Home,” and “Planning for the Future with Your Student – High School and Beyond.”
 
 PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR EDUCATORS:
 
 CFY’s support for educators is designed to help them leverage technology in an instructionally effective way (not just to replace paper worksheets) so that they can provide personalized instruction to their students, make the transition to the rigor of the new Common Core standards, and take full advantage of the iPad roll-out in LAUSD. Support includes:
 
 1. Intensive in-school 1-on-1 coaching support for teachers to adopt blended learning strategies. Research indicates that this type of coaching is one of the most effective ways to help teachers adjust their instructional techniques in a sustainable way that respects teachers’ expertise and goals.
 
 2. Educator Workshops an entire school staff that introduce them to the benefits of digital learning and to PowerMyLearning.
 
 POWERMYLEARNING:
 
 PowerMyLearning.org is CFY’s innovative K-12 learning platform that enables students, educators, and parents to find and use thousands of carefully curated academic games, videos, and interactive simulations that are tagged by Common Core standard, subject, grade, Spanish-language support, and more. It includes powerful tools that enable teachers to fully personalize the learning experience for their students and it provides parents with a reliable source of digital content and helps them better support their children's learning.","Throughout the greater Los Angeles community, a substantial opportunity gap persists between low-income and higher-income families. Large numbers of students in LA’s low-income communities are not graduating from high school on time, and even larger numbers are inadequately prepared for college and careers. This, in turn, is contributing to an unprepared workforce and growing income inequality.
 
 Additionally, teachers are facing growing pressure to provide personalized instruction to large classes of students with diverse needs and learning levels. The new Common Core standards require teachers to re-focus their curricula and LAUSD’s related iPad roll-out means figuring out how to use these new tools effectively as well.
 
 CFY is addressing these problems by helping all the key constituencies in the learning process—students, teachers, and parents—use digital learning more effectively in school and at home.
 
 Our Digital Learning Program helps teachers provide more personalized learning for students. Instead of giving one lesson to their class, teachers have a CFY coach who empowers them to create playlists of digital learning activities (videos from different publishers, educational games, simulations, and more) and then assign those playlists to targeted groups of students. In this model, students receive instruction at their level in the areas they need the most help.
 
 This student-centered classroom experience also inspires students to be more self-directed learners. After completing their assigned playlist of activities, students are free to explore their passions and areas of need. This higher-level thinking and metacognition is essential for success in high school, college, and career.
 
 Home access to technology, along with an adult who is trained in how to use it for learning, can transform students’ home learning environments to create rich learning experiences. Families who participate in CFY family learning workshops leave empowered with the tools and knowledge to strengthen the learning environment at home.
 
 Currently, students and teachers in low-income communities have less access to personalized learning, high-impact professional development, and technology than their higher-income peers. CFY seeks to close this divide and provide equal access to students, families, and teachers regardless of their zip code.","CFY's Digital Learning Program targets middle school students, their families, and teachers at partner schools where at least 75% or more of students qualify for free or reduced-cost lunch. Last year, approximately 87% of CFY families in Los Angeles had annual incomes of $35,000 or less.
 
 Our program is designed to meet the needs of non-native English speakers and approximately 70% percent of our workshops are taught in Spanish by bilingual facilitators.
 
 We focus on the middle school years as research shows that this is the time period where the greatest drop-off in academic achievement occurs. According to an ACT research report, ""the progress toward college and career readiness that students have made by eighth grade is crucial to their future success.""
 
 Teachers are also direct beneficiaries of the Digital Learning Program. Educators receive one-on-one coaching with a CFY Blended Learning Consultant. We also provide interactive educator workshops to help all faculty access the benefits of digital learning and PowerMyLearning.org.","Please specify whether or not these collaborators are confirmed. What added benefit does each partner bring to your project? Have you worked together in the past? Please list three factors that are critical to the success of your proposed collaboration.
 
 In 2014-15, CFY has solidified partnerships with 5 schools as part of our core Digital Learning Program. They include:
 
 - Dr. Julian Nava Learning Academy of Arts & Culture (South LA)
 - Dr. Julian Nava Learning Academy of Business and Technology (South LA)
 - Valor Academy (Arleta)
 - Stella Middle Charter Academy (West Adams)
 - Jack H. Skirball Middle School (Watts)
 
 Additionally, we plan to work with additional school partners on select portions of the Digital Learning Program. We are still in the process of securing those additional partners.
 
 CFY also works closely with other leaders in the digital learning and educational technology space. We were a member of the Los Angeles Next Generation Learning Systems collaboration that submitted a proposal to the Gates Foundation to scale personalized learning district-wide. Members of the team included LAUSD, KIPP LA, and the Partnership for Los Angeles Schools. CFY has also partnered with Alliance College-Ready Public Schools to provide a portion of their blended learning professional development during their summer institute for teachers.",0,
4102034,Prototypes: Integrated Health Care for Women and Their Children,"To open 2 new retail health insurance enrollment shops in El Monte/South El Monte, one of the most underserved areas in Los Angeles County.",Live,2014124,2014,,,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,,"ChapCare’s Marketing Manager will manage the project. The Manager is a member of ChapCare's Senior Leadership Team.
 Upon award, scouting of enrollment shop locations in the El Monte/South El Monte area will begin. Based on previous experience, we expect to locate the 2 shop spaces within 4 weeks, with an additional 2 weeks required to operationalize the sites.
 To support marketing of the project in the community, ChapCare’s 11 member Outreach Department will launch an outreach and education campaign to generate leads that will be enrolled at the 2 shops. 
 Specifically, based on the Consumer Tracking Survey that Covered California conducted (May 6, 2014), we know that the vast majority of people are aware of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and their health insurance options, but what many have not chosen to do is enroll. What this means is that continued education is paramount to decrease barriers to enrollment. 
 We will leverage local partners in El Monte/South El Monte to conduct the majority of outreach work (i.e. making flyers available at their locations). These include the El Monte/South El Monte Chamber of Commerce, Greater El Monte Community Hospital, local school districts, community based organizations, libraries, etc. Outreach conducted by ChapCare directly will focus on locations where the populations live, work, shop, and play; and local high volume locations and events.
 Our main focus to get people to enroll in health insurance will be on planning an aggressive education campaign that will provide group presentations to capitalize on the awareness already created. Education presentations will provide general information about health insurance, and more targeted information that seeks to respond to consumer concerns.
 Referral cards will be available at enrollment locations, whereby a consumer can write a note to a friend about their positive experience enrolling into health insurance, and to encourage them to enroll. These will be mailed at no cost to the client. 
 The proposed strategy is cost-effective and reasonable based on our previous experience and lessons learned.
 During the first open enrollment period, 42% of individuals who enrolled at our enrollment shop in Pasadena did so after a friend or family member enrolled and told them about it. As seen during the first open enrollment period, we expect the initial Outreach & Education to launch a multiplying effect that will leverage limited dollars into a sustained wave of activity.","In the short-term, ChapCare’s proposed project will support increased health care access by stripping down barriers to care (lack of health insurance).
 By 2050, the proposed project will support improved healthcare outcomes, and healthcare as a key driver of economic viability. Studies have shown that many low-income individuals miss significant amounts of time at school and/or work because of poor health; in many instances, affecting their long-term financial viability. These affects can sometimes be so significant, as to be generational in impact.
 In order to shift long-term health in communities, preventive health care is key. In order for people to pro-actively access health care, health insurance is essential. 
 ChapCare’s enrollment shop model is a significant game-changer is this area since it promotes a culture of coverage in communities by normalizing the health insurance process. In most instances, for those who choose to enroll, they have to stand on long lines in a County office to enroll in Medi-Cal or call a phone bank in Sacramento to enroll in Covered California. For those who choose not to enroll there are many issues that need to be overcome such as: a lack of trust, cultural and linguistic barriers, and/or an inability to navigate the complicated health insurance system on their own.
 The enrollment shop is a clean, visible space integrated into the fabric of the community, supported by people the community knows and trusts, that makes enrolling in health insurance feel no different than going to the post office or grocery store.","ChapCare will open 2 new retail health insurance enrollment shops in the El Monte/South El Monte area in the San Gabriel Valley. 
 There are over 120,000 people living in this area, with over 50,000 living at or below 200% of the Federal Poverty Level ($22,980 for a single person) who have not accessed health care services. As a result, the area has experienced some of the worst health indicators in Los Angeles County; specifically, the area’s obesity rate ranks 116 out of 117 cities in the County, with over 31% of adults being obese, which has led to high rates of hypertension and diabetes.
 Many people in the El Monte/South El Monte area do not access primary health care services due to a lack of health insurance, which is one of the key barriers to people accessing needed medical services. In the proposed area, there are 39,438 low-income people (living at 400% or below of the Federal Poverty Level) that currently do not have health insurance; of which, 21,789 are eligible for Covered California, and 17,649 can access free insurance (Medi-Cal). 
 The proposed area is predominantly Latino (75%) followed by Asian (20%), with the Asian population being predominantly Chinese and Vietnamese, making services that are culturally and linguistically competent of critical importance.
 ChapCare’s proposed project will benefit the low-income populations of the El Monte/South El Monte region by providing easily accessible health insurance enrollment services. The project will provide services in a culturally and linguistically competent manner that is responsive to the needs of the community.",Not applicable.,0,

 --Provide an in-school structure for every senior to develop a postsecondary plan 
 --Impact college culture by serving students starting in the 9th grade
 --Deliver professional development for educators to deliver the College Summit curriculum 
 --Uses data to manage, evaluate, and continually improve programming to drive success
 --Achieve consistent and verifiable results
 
 Programming will include:
 
 SUMMER 2014
 • Student leadership training: Select rising seniors (Class of 2015) will attend our signature 4-day college-immersion Summer Workshops where they will be immersed in the college application process and trained as “Peer Leaders” to ignite a college-going culture in their schools.
 • Professional development and support for educators: Teachers and counselors responsible for implementing our curricula will attend our Educator Academy and become equipped to coach students from a college-savvy perspective and use our tools to collect data and track the application path of every senior. 
 
 SCHOOL YEAR
 • Innovative school-year curricula: 9th-11th grade students will receive our Launch program and be guided step-by-step through postsecondary preparation; seniors will benefit from our Navigator program by gaining the knowledge, confidence, tools, and support to identify their goals and plan for success beyond high school.
 • Support: Our School Partnership Managers will serve as a resource, helping educators create dynamic College Summit classroom experiences and supporting Peer Leader activities.
 • Actionable data: Our Milestone Reports will track student, classroom, and school progress toward achieving specific college enrollment goals are shared and discussed regularly to enable educators to proactively identify and respond to challenges and ensure optimal student success.","In today’s global economy, postsecondary education is increasingly vital to individual success, as well as to our country’s future. The knowledge, experience and skills attained through postsecondary education help sustain our workforce, which keeps the United States competitive in the global marketplace. There was a time when a high school diploma was all that was necessary to work at an auto plant or factory and earn enough to support a family. That time has passed.
 
 The Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce report on educational concentrations of employment in the United States shows that by 2018, 67% of job openings in California will require applicants to have a post-high school education. Yet, in Los Angeles, Census data finds that only 59% of public school graduates go directly to college, and only half the adult population has earned a Bachelor’s degree or higher.","Target population for 2014-15 is 4,800 low-income youth between the ages of 14-19 in the Greater Los Angeles metropolitan area. 70% of students served qualify for free/reduced meal plans (80% at most schools). 
 
 Students attend the following partner schools in the Los Angeles area: Academy of Science & Engineering Charter School; Academy of Scientific Exploration at Cesar E. Chavez Learning Academies; East Valley High School; Green Design Community School at Diego Rivera Learning Complex; Math, Science and Technology Magnet Academy at Roosevelt High School; Public Service Community School at Diego Rivera Learning Complex; Roosevelt High School; Thomas Jefferson High School; Arleta High School; APEX Academy; Arts, Theatre, and Entertainment School at Cesar E. Chavez Learning Academies; Communications and Technology School at Diego Rivera Learning Complex; Social Justice Humanitas Academy at Cesar E. Chavez Learning Academies; Sylmar High School; and Washington Preparatory High School.
 
 College Summit helps students like Alexis Cardenas (Class of 2014, ArTES Academy in Los Angeles). “Before College Summit,” she says, “the question wasn't whether or not I would go to college; it was always whether or not I'd care enough to finish…After high school, I actually just saw myself as working in some job I hated, studying something I disliked by night.” Then Alexia attended a College Summit workshop which helped her learn more about using college as a stepping stone to her future. Now, she says, “after realizing that everything I enjoy is indeed marketable in the work force, I became interested in going after my dreams.” Since returning to school in the fall, Alexia has recently been accepted into one of the eight schools to which she’s applied and is awaiting word from the others. However, what makes her most proud as a Peer Leader is having helped two of her friends who were on the fence about college to see its importance and apply; both, she is happy to report, have since been accepted into their first choice colleges.","School Partners (listed above): Because of the embedded nature of our systemic model, strong partnerships with schools are necessary; we deliberately nurture relationships at multiple levels of leadership. Even when changes in personnel have occurred, we have been able to maintain our services because College Summit has become entrenched in the culture of schools. 
 
 Higher Education Partners: Deep relationships with the college/university partners that host our summer workshops create a vital bridge to postsecondary entry for students. Students greatly benefit from campus exposure, access to admissions counselors, and timely and relevant information and support. Our college partners, California Lutheran University and the University of Redlands, represent a network of higher education institutions across the country that have a shared mission to increase college access. By hosting our summer workshops, partners minimize our workshop costs and low-income students are introduced to their campuses and their students.
 
 Significant corporate partnerships include: Deloitte brings expertise in managing and identifying areas of growth, fund development, and sponsorship of awards to honor the work of our partner schools; Darden Restaurants Inc., Foundation supports Peer Leader meetings at schools and Peer Leader awards. Collaborations provide access and information on grants and financial aid: Citi Foundation, Cash for College, Hispanic Scholarship Fund, Magic Johnson Foundation, and Junior Achievement. Community engagement: participating in the Valley Education Collaborative working on college access issues and policies in the San Fernando area; and assisting the Los Angeles Urban League in their efforts to increase the college enrollment of students in the Crenshaw corridor. The region has also formed more than 50 volunteering partnerships with local businesses, professional associations, and community groups to increase knowledge about college access issues and recruit volunteers from diverse backgrounds. College Summit has a pending application with the SoCal College Access Network (CAN), a regional network of 30+ college access organizations, to increase our visibility, identify us as a leader in the field, and provide access to resources, learnings, and best practices.",0,
4102057,Bringing the arts back to public education one school at a time one child at a time,"With professional artists, we bring a 6-week art program (music, dance, theatre and visual arts) to K-1 students in underserved areas.",Learn,2014133,2014,,,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,,"Dream A World Education founder, Grammy Award-Winner Bunny Hull brings a team of professional artists to your school. Through this six-week multi-arts residency, children learn music, dance, theatre and visual arts and discover the gifts that live within them. They learn the values of friendship, kindness, imagination and gratitude, as well as history, geography and social studies as they relate to each arts workshop. The residency includes a parent workshop, professional development, curriculum materials, a live performance, and culminates with a children’s presentation. Each week a performer/teaching artist from the initial performance brings a new art form to your school. Music curriculum kicks it off with the creation of an original class song with each class. Each class receives a recorded version of their song.
 
 The Secrets of the Heart’s curriculum guide for K-2 links the arts experience to academic achievement and critical thinking skills in Language Arts, Listening/Speaking, History, Social Studies and the development of interpersonal skills. This program reveals the arts to children as it relates to culture and tradition, gives them a little geography and history and teaches them, through self-expression, how to have greater respect for themselves and each other.
 
 This program is created to VAPA and Common Core Standards.","Research indicates that more than 80% of the children in Los Angeles schools are Title One – below the poverty line. The high school drop out rate in 2008 was reported at 62%.
 
 Every choice a child makes is based on how they perceive themselves and the world around them. It impacts their attitudes, the relationships they forge, and the way they interact with their families and figures of authority.
 
 There’s a good reason why Dream A World Education focuses attention on children K-2. Early lessons have a lasting impact on a child. It is said that all the milestones relating to a child’s development happen before a child turns six. Their brain is like a sponge and a memory bank for all that enters their senses. Along with coordination, poise and stamina, patterns are formed, skills developed and the understanding of concepts and vocabulary are learned. This is the age when children learn the difference between right and wrong. It’s a time when social relationships are developed as they interact with each other and new adults as they are introduced into a school setting.
 
 It is our aim to reach children in these most formative years. It’s true that the healthy evolution of a child depends on more than just their school experiences. They need a solid support system at home. Some children may or may not have that support, but we believe one unforgettable experience can change a life. It is our intention to provide that experience for every child we meet.","1. We Identify The Need
 
 We target schools that have not only a need, but a real desire for arts programming, especially those schools which are underserved. It’s important to us to work closely with principals and teachers to create a warm environment that inspires an exchange of learning and an atmosphere of cooperation.
 
 2. We Know Who We Serve
 
 Particular attention is paid to the population we are serving, their cultural background and to the educational, emotional or special needs of the children. Whether our program lasts for one day or six weeks, our goal is to recognize the individuality of each child.
 
 3. We Consult With Educators
 
 We are constantly meeting with exceptional elementary educators to determine what children need, what works with existing curriculum and to explore new ways to improve our programming. We have a lot to learn from each other. In addition, there is an emphasis on consulting with other arts organizations to share and compare ideas in order to achieve the most effective lesson plans and highest level of excellence for our teaching artists.
 
 4. We Know Where We’re Going
 
 It is the intention of Dream A World® to base our educational work in the Los Angeles area, and to then expand that outreach by targeting and identifying areas in the national and global community where our programs can be beneficial. Our future plans include developing educational programming for parents.","Weingart Foundation

4102061,GRID Project to Get Freight Containers Off Freeways,LA Beaches Forever will harness the diverse nature of Venice to create a vision that addresses climate change through adaptability.,Live,2014135,2014,,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,Tourists that visit from outside the County as well.,"Collect Water /Plant Trees/Community Invention
 
 Venice Beach, destination for 16 million tourist a year, is famous for its lovely beaches, canals, mussel beach, fancy shops and eccentric, healthy people. However few realize that Venice Beach is at risk of being transformed by global climate change. A recent report titled “Sea Level Rise Vulnerability Study for the City of Los Angeles,"" prepared by the University of Southern California Sea Grant Program, found that Venice is a “highly vulnerable population who may be unable to adapt to impacts of sea level rise because of social or economic challenges, including lower per capita income, lower education levels, linguistic isolation, older housing stock and high percentage of renters.” 
 
 Oakwood was originally set-aside as a settlement area for Black-Americans, who came to work in the oil fields, and build canals. Later it was populated by Mexican-American and other immigrants, as well as artists who tolerated the gang wars of the 80’s. Now it is a highly creative, mixed-use, mixed income neighborhood that is on the brink of being impacted by climate change. 
 
 Los Angeles Beaches Forever will tap into the inventive character of this community to address resiliency: the capacity to recover quickly from difficulties. Working with scientists, we will produce ideas that advance our ability to adapt. No idea is too crazy: build naturalized sand dunes at the beach, plant a green alley, and restore a beach lagoon. 
 
 We will hire and train twenty-five local youth to distribute information about the opportunities we have to adapt to climate change. We will plant three hundred trees which will reduce airborne pollution, cool surface temperatures, reduce skin cancer in our youth, absorb surface water, improve water quality at beaches, and reduce crime. We will reduce our water use by hundreds of gallons a year, by removing thirty turf lawns and installing fifty cisterns, rain barrels or rain gardens which slow sea level rise, reduce risk of salt-water intrusion and improve water quality. 
 
 We will build on three existing agency programs: City of LA, street tree planting program; and the Metropolitan Water Districts’ (MWD), Water Smart rain barrel rebate program, and turf removal program.
 
 We will launch an entire resiliency movement.","Los Angeles Beaches Forever will make LA a healthier place by instilling knowledge of environmental issues and developing long-term solutions. Our community will become more engaged and armed with tools to become a more resilient community. We will galvanize around a common cause and enhance our diverse community. 
 
 Local Impacts - Sea Level Rise- According to a report by USC, Venice is one of the most at risk communities as a result of sea level rise due to the highly vulnerable population who may be unable to adapt to sea level rise. Another report this month released by the Venice Neighborhood Council sites an LAUSD study that found our neighborhood children are 26 times more likely to get cancer due to Santa Monica Airport pollutants such as lead, black carbon and ultra fine particulates. 
 
 Los Angeles Beaches Forever will plant trees - By planting trees we will reduce carbon in the air and slow the speed of sea level rise. Trees absorb pollutants. Trees reduce the risk of skin cancer by providing shade. Trees will cool our streets by up to 10°F, by shading our homes and streets and reducing the heat island effect. Trees reduce the cost of running an air conditioner. Trees will provide habitat for birds and butterflies, which enriches the science-based education of our children. Additionally trees will reduce crime. According to a study in the June 2012 issue of Landscape and Urban Planning Magazine, ""a 10 % increase in tree canopy was associated with a roughly 12% decrease in crime."" 
 
 Los Angeles Beaches Forever will collect water - While sea level rise is our main focus, we will also address the drought, seawater intrusion and water quality. By collecting water we will reduce flooding and are more resilient when water is scarce. We will create clean beaches for our kids by reducing the amount of dirty water that ends up flowing into the ocean. Additionally we will reduce the risk of seawater intrusion into our underground water basin. According to the MWD “the risk for seawater intrusion is high” as the ground water is not replenished. Finally by collecting water we will save money. 19% of CA energy is used to move water around so by using less water, we use less energy as well. 
 
 We will train youth - Our youth leadership team will direct planting and water savings activities. They will become the face of climate resiliency, the problem solvers and activists that save our coastal community.","This project benefits children, renters, homeowners, tourists, businesses and the entire region. 
 
 By planting trees, removing turf, installing cisterns and creating a long-term vision plan for resiliency, we will benefit children who will be able to grow-up in this coastal community, as have many of their parents for generations. By planting trees, children will be protected from the risk of cancer from the over 100,000 planes that take-off and land over our community. Trees will protect children from skin cancer, the most common form of cancer in the US, by reducing UV-B exposure by about fifty percent. 
 
 Children will benefit from local clean beaches when polluted storm water is reduced. Storm drain runoff is the greatest source of pollution to local beaches, flowing untreated to the coast, potentially contaminated with motor oil, animal waste, pesticides, yard waste and trash. The Brooks storm drain, which drains a large part of Oakwood, is the only Venice storm drain to receive a wet-weather grade of F from Heal the Bay. With more trees absorbing rain, more residents collecting rainwater and practicing water-smart gardening as a result of this program, the water quality at the Brooks storm drain will improve making swimming, fishing and playing at Brooks Beach, a safer experience. 
 
 With more community trees, children will have better places to play and more learning opportunities, since trees act as landmarks that give a neighborhood an identity and encourage civic pride. Children in the neighborhood, many of whom live in apartments, will benefit from exposure to the critters, such as butterflies and birds, which are attracted to trees. 
 
 Parents will benefit from knowing their children are safe from air pollution, skin cancer and crime. Parents will see reduced utility costs due to lower energy-use and water-use. 
 
 Our entire City and region will benefit from the reduced threat of seawater intrusion into the ground water, reduced demand for imported water and reduced air pollution. And Venice Beach will continue to be a bustling tourist destination.","Youth - To engage our youth ambassadors, we will collaborate with Venice High School and Westminster Avenue Elementary School. In the recent past, we collaborated with Coeur D’Alene Elementary School (CDA) to create abundant gardens and plant dozens of trees. The project is so successful that a full time gardening teacher was hired, parents are planning on implementing the next phase of unpaving and two local schools used our school as a model in creating their own “rain gardens.” 
 
 Community - To get community buy-in and support we will work with Oakwood Neighborhood Committee of the Venice Neighborhood Council (VNC) and the Education Committee of the Venice Chamber of Commerce. We have received grants from the VNC on two separate occasion to be used towards environmental education. Duvivier Architects, a chamber member, will the leader this effort. They received the 2014 County of LA Green Leadership Award, and an US Green Building Council Innovation Award, for their pioneering work in the integration of water resources and architecture. 
 
 Agencies - We will augment established programs by the MWD and City of LA. We previously received three grants from MWD for doing watershed education work including creating environmental maps and signage. One map, Santa Monica and Ballona Watershed Green Map serves as an international reference—from India to Africa— has been viewed by thousands at Japan Expo and 20 other international venues. This map is in the permanent collection of the Library of Congress and the New York, Los Angeles and Toronto Public Libraries. 
 
 Experts – We will receive professional support from Loyola Marymount University and Santa Monica Bay Restoration Commission (SMBRC). We worked successfully with both of these organizations on a community-building document for the Ballona Wetlands Restoration. We received funding in the past from the SMBRC. In fact the Executive Director, said this of our partnership, “It was due to Duvivier’s involvement in the CDA Rain Gardens that my organization provided seed funding to start the project. Duvivier overcame many challenges and brought everyone on board with her vision. We use it today in our outreach to state and national agencies and technical professionals looking to implement creative, low-cost water pollution mitigation with added community and educational benefits.”",1,
4102070,Los Angeles Campaign for Grade Level Reading,The Los Angeles Campaign for Grade Level Reading equips families with fun and inspiring school readiness and out-of-school learning tools.,Learn,2014138,2014,,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,"In 2013, the national Campaign for Grade-Level Reading invited FIS to serve as the coordinating agency of the LA GLR Campaign, targeting three challenges to students’ reading success that are consequential and amenable to community solutions: 
 - The Readiness Gap-too many children from low-income families begin school already behind
 - The Attendance Gap-too many children from low-income families miss too much school; and 
 - The Summer Slide-too many children lose ground in summer.
 
 To address these issues, FIS will implement the following core initiatives, with a goal of impacting 150,000 LA County students. With LA 2050 support, FIS will both expand parents’ access to these programs, and deepen parent involvement by providing more site-based literacy workshops. 
 1) Million Word Challenge: For 13 years, FIS has convened parents, schools, and community leaders to challenge students, Pre-K through 12th grade, to read millions of words outside of the classroom. Early learning centers are prioritized as enthusiastic participants. In 2014, over 100,000 students in 300 schools logged the books they read outside of school under the supervision of their parent or guardian. After seven-weeks, each school selects one student winner to be honored. 
 
 FIS offers parent engagement workshops at select MWC schools to inform parents about the MWC and the value of out of school time reading, distributes a bilingual (English/Spanish) Family Reading Guide to parents, and has developed materials for participating schools that include a Launch Kit and MWC Hand Book. Parents receive weekly tips to help support their child’s learning at home. Parents report that as they spend more time reading together, family bonds also strengthen. With LA 2050 support, FIS will deepen its impact in each school with additional literacy support and resources to parents.
 
 2) Passport to Success: This innovative initiative reduces summer learning loss by encouraging families with preschool and elementary students to participate in free and low-cost summer learning activities. Throughout summer, thousands of families visit museums listed in their summer learning kit and collect stamps in a family passport that students submit to their schools for prizes. With LA 2050 support, FIS will be able to provide summer learning kits to more families and foster greater community building among participating families by expanding online engagement.","The Campaign will help make LA the best place to learn today by showing students and families that the entire community is an educational playground and learning is not just a formal, structured activity limited to a classroom. The initiative is not simply about increasing reading proficiency, it is also about creating the community conditions that support parents’ efforts to be actively engaged in their children’s learning. By engaging parents in accessible, inclusive, non-intimidating and fun out-of-school programs, FIS helps parents create a love of learning in their children that will last throughout their lives. 
 
 The Campaign meshes perfectly with LA2050’s learning goal, in particular with the “every high school student will graduate and be college and career ready” and “all parents will be engaged and empowered to direct their children’s learning” components. Programs such as the Campaign will help Los Angeles become a leader and innovator in the educational landscape, rather than a sobering statistic.","The Campaign seeks to increase the number of low-income LA County students of color who are reading at grade level by the end of 3rd-grade by impacting 150,000 students. Los Angeles County is facing an educational crisis. As aforementioned there is a significant gap in reading proficiency between low-income students and their more economically advantaged peers. Up until 3rd grade, children are mastering the art of reading. From 3rd grade forward, reading is the key to learning. When students cannot read at grade-level by 3rd grade, it has devastating consequences for the entirety of their education. FIS believes that focusing on communities with the largest concentration of students who scored in the lowest 25% on the California Standards Test (or new Smarter Balance tests), will yield the greatest improvements to overall grade-level reading in LA County. FIS has chosen to serve these students because we believe it is in these communities that our services can make a measurable difference. 
 
 Both Campaign initiatives, the Million Word Challenge and Passport to Success, invest in high need communities throughout LA County. MWC and PST increase access to resources and opportunities to engage in family literacy activities otherwise not present. These initiatives serve not only students and their families, but also their teachers and school staff. Participating schools receive parent engagement and literacy tools to help them better serve their families.","In addition to support from the national Campaign for Grade-Level Reading network, FIS is fortunate to have a number of thought partners and key sponsors in this critical endeavor:
 
 Los Angeles County Office of Education (LACOE): LACOE has provided technical assistance and outreach support for both MWC and PTS and has worked with us for over a decade.
 
 L.A. Compact: Los Angeles leaders from the education, business, government, labor, and non-profit sectors committed to transform education outcomes from cradle to career. The Campaign is aligned with the L.A. Compact and has a representative who serves on the Campaign's Steering Committee to help produce better outcomes for the youth of L.A. from cradle to career.
 
 First 5 LA: First 5 LA is a thought partner and Campaign Steering Committee member. They lead the work group charged with identifying policy related to early learning and best practices to be employed at demonstration sites.
 
 Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD): Both the MWC and PTS serve LAUSD schools for 13 years. LAUSD has two representatives who serve on the Campaign Steering Committee.
 
 Disney Citizenship: Disney Citizenship provides in-kind support by providing volunteers and incentives for student program participants. 
 
 Target: Target has provided ongoing funding for both MWC and PTS for over 3 years, enabling these programs to reach hundreds of schools. These programs have been instrumental in carrying out Target’s vision for improved literacy levels in LA County.
 
 Collins Foundation: For the past 2 years, the Collins Foundation has funded components of our literacy work through both MWC and PTS. 
 There are three factors contributing to the success of these partnerships:
 
 Communication: The success of these collaborations relies on the partners’ abilities to communicate amongst each other and communicate with the families within LA County. FIS facilitates that communication through the Steering Committee and other mechanisms. 
 
 Reciprocity: Collaboration works when it is mutually beneficial. Our education partners clearly share the goal of improved student success, the business community benefits from a more skilled and career-ready workforce and many of our philanthropic partners are able to support a vital community effort while exposing their brand to a broad audience.
 
 Clear Expectations: Partner roles are clearly defined to maximize efficiency and establish accountability to ensure all goals are met.",0,
4102073,Helping LA’s most vulnerable youth succeed,"FosterMore will recruit volunteers, mentors and foster parents to improve the outcomes for foster youth in Los Angeles",Learn,2014140,2014,,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,"When budgets are cut, those without a voice in government are the hardest hit. Foster youth are the most vulnerable Angelenos because the foster care system is overburdened. The hard working, well-intentioned folks working on their behalf have neither the time nor the means to develop, produce and execute a nuanced strategy to recruit their ideal candidates for foster parents and mentors. More than 150,000 child abuse investigations were launched in the county last year alone. Working with limited resources, we want and need the county’s social workers focused on one thing: the safety of all our kids. 
 
 FosterMore has done significant research and partnered with Hollywood storytellers to craft video and online messages to change the perception of foster youth and spark a desire to help these youth in need. The LA2050 grant will provide the necessary resources to launch a full-scale marketing and recruitment campaign.
 
 The campaign will combine well-researched and tested messages with the latest online marketing tools and tactics to generate leads, which will be followed up on by a local foster parent recruitment agency that has demonstrated a 500% increase in converting leads to foster parents over the past two years and the most high-impact program working with foster youth in schools to graduate high school.","Only 5 percent of foster youth are proficient in math and only 20 percent in English. Housing the largest population of foster youth in the state and second largest in the nation, we must do something now! 
 
 By recruiting dedicated and caring individuals to foster parent and mentor youth in care, we hope to improve outcomes. It’s a fact that four out of five foster youth have had to repeat a grade by the third grade. Children in foster care are at high risk for maltreatment and stress that cause developmental delays and set them behind as early as kindergarten. They are less likely to be enrolled in preschool and foster youth are twice as likely as the general population to leave high school without a diploma. Many foster youth experience more than five school changes. 
 
 The challenges these youth face from an educational and social emotional development standpoint are unimaginable to most. However, the well-researched and evidence-based models designed by the FosterMore coalition partners prove that with the right foster parents and mentors, these youth can succeed and thrive. 
 
 We anticipate that by reintroducing foster youth to Los Angeles residents in 2014, we can shift public opinion and support for these youth. As Los Angeles produces more and more foster youth success stories, we will continue to experience increased levels of support for foster youth, thereby increasing the number of foster parents and mentors as well as public support for the agencies tasked with their well being. This project is the first and most critical step in taking the foster parent shortage from crisis to surplus.","Last August The Los Angeles Times reported the county’s shortage of foster care beds had reached “a crisis point.” At that time “officials acknowledged they don’t have enough personnel to promptly feed children or change diapers.” 
 
 The largest immediate beneficiaries of this project will be the 28,000 kids in Los Angeles County’s foster care system. In addition, roughly 2,500 youth in the county “age-out” meaning they reach the age at which they can no longer remain a ward of the state in foster care, without having received permanent placement. This population of foster youth fares the worst, with more than half living in poverty, a quarter incarcerated the lowest high school and college graduation rates of all youth. 
 
 The FosterMore coalition’s project to recruit mentors and foster parents will have the secondary impact of generating more interest in adoption, and moving more and more kids into permanent homes. 
 
 The community as a whole will benefit because on average, for every young person who ages out of foster care, taxpayers and communities pay $300,000 in social costs like public assistance, incarceration, and lost wages to a community over that person's lifetime. With more than 200,000 youth aging out in the past decade, you can conservatively estimate this problem incurs almost $8 billion in social costs to the United States every year.","FosterMore will serve as the lead for the project. FosterMore is a coalition of nonprofit organizations and foundations united to increase opportunities for youth in foster care. Lead funding and strategic partners include, Casey Family Programs, The Entertainment Industry Foundation, Conrad N. Hilton Foundation, Anthony & Jeanne Pritzker Family Foundation, Stuart Foundation and Youth Villages. The effort is directed by co-founders, Jennifer Perry, Executive Director of the Children’s Action Network and David Ambroz, Director, Corporate Citizenship and Social Responsibility, Disney-ABC Television Group. Managing the effort is Mark Daley, of Propper Daley, A Social Impact Agency. 
 
 Raise a Child, a leader in foster and adoptive parent recruitment will work with potential recruits to see them through the long and often frustrating process of certification to placement.

We:
 
 1) Build mobile (in development) and web based (CaliforniaColleges.edu) college and career planning tools that allow each student to develop their own individual portfolio.
 
 2) Partner with K-12 districts to integrate our tools into instructional time and counseling practice (both school based counselors and partner CBOS/university based outreach programs) so that all students meet 18 college and career planning milestones.
 
 3) Facilitate collaboration between our district partners and local colleges/universities to use student portfolios for college recruitment, admission and first year academic placement.","By 2050, a student in LA will have ongoing college and career planning activities integrated into their educational experience irrespective of school district from 6th grade forward (likely earlier). All of those activities will contribute to their cumulative portfolio on CaliforniaColleges.edu which will be used to support counseling, recruitment, admissions, educational planning and the entire (seamless) application process to colleges, and financial aid/scholarship providers. The resultant rich repository for data about career aspirations and college readiness will be used by employers and educators in the state to support a rational and thougtful approach to developing native talent to meet our workforce needs and ensure a healthy and vibrant economy. 
 
 Today, we are proving pieces of this overarching concept, in real time with school districts, colleges and students themselves. Our progress on A-G analysis and planning tools during 2014-2015 will allow us to help districts increase the numbers of students who graduate eligible for admissions to a four year college or university. Increased awareness of post-secondary options and degree pathways will help students to more fully understand the steps ahead of them and arrive at post-secondary ready to succeed.","We view our work as accountable first and foremost to students, and we place them at the center of the equation at all times. While our work focuses primarily on 6th-12th grade students, we house resources on our site for community college students and both the college and career planning resources on the site are relevant to adult learners as well.
 
 Our secondary clients include:
 
 Middle and high school counselors: with the worst counseling ratios in the country, California's school counselors manage average caseloads of 945 students each. We provide tools, lesson plans and user support to help counselors maximize the efficiency with whichthey work with each student, and automate portions of their work (nagging students for forms can be accomplished by mobile app notofication) so that their time can be used for actual counseling.
 
 Schools and districts: benefit by being able to track students progress in ways they've not had access to before. This is especially important as we are likely to see college readiness become a key indicator in API scores, as well as Local Control Accountability Plans.
 
 CSU Admissions: By providing CSU with pre-verified transcript data (already used for A-G progress analysis with students), we prevent them from having to re-enter data, or hand check transcripts against the Doorways database at UC Office of the President. At scale, this has the potential to save the system $12-$15M system-
 wide. More important this increases their ability to provide timely and accurate financial aid packages, and to devote more resources to student guidance and counseling during the counseling and admissions process.
 
 Community Colleges: Despite growing recognition that high school transcripts are key to successful first year academic placement, community colleges (as open access institutions) do not and will not request or require that transcript data from students. Our system allows them not only to access transcript data for that purpose, but non-academic data about student's career exploration and aspirations that will support educational planning.
 
 Community and University based college preparation programs: Counselors in these programs generally lack access to student's transcript data. By linking their portfolio to approved providers (we have an approval process), we help to unify and maximize the efforts of all adults participating in a student's planning process.","We have signed MOUs with all five LA county school districts (named above), three of whom already have active data uploads to our system. The two newer districts are actively working on the file format that allows them to load data into our system.
 
 CCGI staff have been assigned to the districts and are actively working on 2014-2015 implementation plans.
 
 Outside of K-12 districts, we have very active partnerships with the following institutions of higher education:
 
 1) CSU Chancellor's office - has invested $170K in the engineering required to articulate CaliforniaColleges.edu with their CSU Mentor Application platform to allow for seamless application by students and receipt of pre-verified transcript data by their campuses offices of admissions.
 
 2) Rio Hondo Community College is piloting the use of data from our file format for first year academic placement of approximately 350 first year students who graduated from El Monte High school District in Spring 2014. Rio's Dean of Counseling works closely with CCGI to inform the development of counseling tools, messaging and the higher ed user role on our professional center/counselor facing portal - to maximize the use of our system for smoothing transition to community colleges. Our goals include expansion to all Rio Hondo's feeder districts (we are in three of six already) to prove the ability to place all incoming students based on transcripts rather than placement exams.
 
 3) We have initial conversations underway with LAUSD's Director of Secondary Education, Gerardo Loera, as well as local superintendent Bravo (ESC South), to pilot the use of CCGI tools in their high schools.",0,1,
4102077,Griffith Observatory--A pLAnetarium for 2050 now!,Create a new digital-animation planetarium show for live presentation that will inspire cosmic perspective in learners of all ages.,Learn,2014142,2014,,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"Griffith Observatory serves not only our local community, but also visitors from around the world and from across the nation.","Funding from LA2050 will be used to hire animators and special consultants required to create the thrilling visuals that inspire cosmic perspective in our audiences. These technical experts will enable Griffith Observatory’s graphic staff to re-imagine the School Field Trip planetarium show, Water is Life, and to create a brand new planetarium show on the intriguing, popular topic of life in the universe. 
 
 Having the tools necessary to translate complex astronomical information into compelling and accurate programs, and being able to deliver those to eager minds of all ages in an enticing environment is important to our community and the future of our culture.
 
 These planetarium shows will utilize a new, state-of-the-art , digital 8k projection system. The combination of the new equipment and a professional quality animated show guarantees a high quality audience experience. This is critical because our scientific stories vie with Hollywood commercial productions for the visitor’s attention and memory.","Our national economic prosperity and security require that the USA be a world leader in science and technology. We must develop the ideas to transform and strengthen the economy, ensure a skilled workforce for American industry, and guarantee that American students have access to the educational resources and tools necessary to fully participate in the science- and technology-based economy of the 21st century. According to the National Science Board, the earlier children are exposed to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) concepts, the more likely they are to be comfortable with them later in life. Improving the extent and quality of elementary STEM education should be a priority. But in California, students in elementary school have less than 15 minutes of science a day on average. 
 
 In addition, a study sponsored by the National Science Foundation reports that experiences in informal settings can significantly improve science learning outcomes for individual groups which are historically underrepresented in science, such as women and minorities. This study recognizes that learning is broader than formal classroom schooling. Informal science environments and experiences play a crucial role. These experiences can jump-start and sustain long-term interests that involve sophisticated learning later in life. In fact, research has shown that interest in sciences during elementary school is a better predictor than test scores of which students take advanced math courses in high school and college. 
 
 Planetarium shows at Griffith Observatory help to bridge the gaps that exist in formal learning by providing a variety of informal learning experiences that are accessible to children, youth, and families in an environment that is inclusive and inspiring. In an era that often substitutes superficial contact for knowledge and insight, and confuses entertainment with inspiration, Griffith Observatory avoids fashionable jargon and empty impact and continues to promote meaningful experience. Griffith Observatory is unique in being able to have a major impact on both individuals and on the economic health of the community.","Over 300,000 visitors, not only from the greater Los Angeles region but also from around the world, see a planetarium show at Griffith Observatory each year. A visitor survey identified a demographic profile almost identical to the State of California: 43% Caucasian; 36% Hispanic; 9% Asian American; and 6% African American. Underserved audiences make up nearly half of the Observatory's visitor base.
 
 In addition, over 26,000 fifth-grade students, most from Title 1 schools, attend special field trips that support fifth grade California educational science standards. The staffing and material costs are funded by FOTO so that all students may attend FREE. In additions, a “bus scholarship” may be requested to fund transportation.","The only confirmed collaboration at this point is with the Fiske Planetarium at the University of Colorado, Boulder. Fiske already has installed the 8K planetarium dome projection system we will be purchasing. Until the Observatory system is purchased and installed, Fiske has agreed to let our graphics team view their work on the Fiske dome in exchange for being able to perform our new life in the universe show live in Boulder after it premieres in Los Angeles.
 Conversations have begun with biology and other visualization experts to identify a core group of animators to support the development of the new planetarium show. Conversations are also being held with different groups of Disney animators to assist with animation. Visualizations from NASA/JPL are likely to be incorporated. Also, a variety of scientific experts are partners to ensure accurate, authentic information.",0,
4102080,Transforming College Access for Los Angeles’ Youth Through Gaming,FutureBound will transform college access through the wide-scale dissemination of its highly engaging and effective educational video games.,Learn,2014143,2014,,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,"FutureBound’s mission is to create a suite of fun, inspiring, and educational games that will increase the number of youth preparing for, applying to, and finding success in college. FutureBound’s games are a research-based and highly innovative effort to ensure postsecondary educational opportunities for all students, particularly those from low-income households. Since 2009, FutureBound (formerly known as Collegeology) has been working with students and educators in its quest to design useful, effective, and fun games about college. To date, FutureBound has created three games: FutureBound, Mission: Admission, and Graduate Strike Force.
 
 FutureBound has tested these games with over 3000 diverse students to ascertain their impact. Our research has shown that these games increase students’ confidence or “self-efficacy” of their ability to attend college and take steps towards reaching a desired career. 
 
 Based on this initial success, FutureBound will expand on this work and provide its games on a significantly larger scale throughout LA. To accomplish this, we will leverage our partnerships to cost-effectively expand our reach and maximize the number of students we serve. A key part of this strategy will include working with school districts, libraries, after school programs, and college access networks to take advantage of the existing relationships these entities have with students and educators. To support these organizations, a portion of FutureBound’s grant budget will be allocated to training staff at these organizations in best practices for implementing the games. FutureBound will also provide web-based training and support resources for these individuals. 
 
 FutureBound will complement these efforts through a variety of activities, including significant use of social media and other marketing tools. To provide sufficient staffing for our efforts (training, web/content development), FutureBound will take advantage of its relationship with USC to recruit highly skilled personnel –graduate students and recent post-grads.","Over the past 25 years, Los Angeles (along with the rest of California) has fallen in US rankings and now lags behind many other areas in the production of college graduates. Based on forecasts by the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems (NCHEM), it is projected that 41% of jobs in 2025 in California will require a college degree. Absent any significant improvements, NCHEM projects that only 37 percent of workers in California will have a college degree in 2025. The gap between the demands of the local economy and the supply of college-educated workers represents a serious impediment to an economically successful future for LA. 
 
 Despite government and institutional efforts to improve college access over many decades, fewer than 40% of LAUSD high school graduates currently attend some form of post-secondary education.
 
 To address these challenges, FutureBound has developed an innovative and engaging suite of educational video games that have significantly increased the number of youth—including under-served students—preparing for, applying to, and finding success in US colleges. The games have been proven to develop the skills needed to master the college readiness and entry process and to succeed in college and beyond. Game play extends developmentally sound practices of learning through play into the adolescent landscape like no other medium. Teens love games, especially technology-mediated games. Ultimately, games provide a fun space for gaining social capital related to college-going and career choice that cannot easily be replicated in conventional learning environments. All games are supported through wrap-around curricular activities and materials for teachers, counselors, and program advisors.
 
 With the LA2050 goal that every Los Angeles high school student will graduate and be ready for college and career, FutureBound is well positioned to support this goal. Through the use of FutureBound’s games, educators and practitioners will have the opportunity to cultivate college and financial aid application strategies that increase access to college by providing information about postsecondary and financial aid options. Additionally, our games will help cultivate college application and college choice strategies and will nurture critical thinking and decision-making skills related to college.","The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) encompasses 130 middle and 149 high schools serving 112,749 and 138,778 students, respectively. LAUSD charter schools serve an additional 95,207 students. FutureBound’s goal is to extend game-based college access tools to all students in LAUSD’s middle and high schools. As a secondary population, we will also target other school districts in the LA region such as Inglewood and Culver City. 
 
 FutureBound’s games will benefit middle school and high school students in LA by delivering crucial college guidance, teaching college preparation strategies, and increasing their confidence in their own ability to go to college. The games will have a particular impact on underserved populations and first-generation college-goers who currently have little access to college guidance and preparation. Helping these students get to college creates a beneficial cycle within their communities. When first-generation college students matriculate, they create a culture of college-going where there wasn't one before. They serve as role models to their families and larger social networks, modeling positive behaviors and outcomes—especially for younger students in the community.
 
 Additionally, FutureBound’s games will help over-worked guidance counselors, teachers, and parents by providing them with a set of tools to reach the students in their lives. College can be a difficult subject to broach with students who are anxious about their future. By reaching out through play, teachers, counselors, and mentors can communicate about this subject in a more relaxed way that facilitates a more productive discussion.
 
 Finally, this project also serves the many and varied colleges in the Los Angeles area, who will benefit from a larger and more diverse applicant pool if more of Los Angeles’ underserved youth are able to navigate the complexities of the college application process and make informed choices about how and where to apply.","We believe the most effective approach to engaging students and achieving the goals described above involves connecting with youth across multiple learning environments, including schools, college preparation and community-based organizations, and libraries. The primary goal associated with these collaborations will be to leverage their direct experience with and access to students and educators. An additional goal of these partnerships will be to leverage the recognition and public awareness associated with their organizations and services, as well as to create new positive associations for the combined offerings.
 
 The three factors that will be critical to the success of our partnerships include: (1) ability to enhance distribution and expand access to LA schools and students; (2) partner resources and capabilities to help provide some of the training to local schools; and (3) a strong track record among partners of working with LA youth in the area of college access. 
 
 FutureBound has existing relationships and has worked with the following organizations: Los Angeles Unified School District; Southern California College Access Network; USC Pullias Center for Higher Education; and USC Game Innovation Lab. Potential partners include: Inglewood Unified School District; Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District; Culver City Unified School District; TRIO & Upward Bound Program participants; Los Angeles Boys & Girls Club; LA's BEST After School Enrichment Program; and MESA Programs.",0,
4102081,Opportunity Fund: Transformative Education & Opportunities in Technology for Underrepresented Groups,An innovative scholarship program from General Assembly to provide education and opportunity in technology for underrepresented groups,Learn,2014144,2014,,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,"The pilot Opportunity Fund program kicked off this June in New York, with 6 fellows receiving scholarships. Over 300 online applications were received, and 3 more fellows were recently selected in NY.
  
 This November, General Assembly intends to expand into cities that have a high demand and need: LA and San Francisco.
  
 Working with our group of Benefactors, we are securing scholarships for underrepresented groups in each of these new markets and will begin marketing this opportunity in middle of August to have the first group of students in our November classes.","There is an unemployment problem in LA County, which has surpassed the national average since 2008. There also exists a diversity problem inside of this statistic, with many minorities making up a disproportionate amount of the unemployed.
  
 Meanwhile, if we continue on our current course of state budget cuts, education, which received the lowest rating, will remain a significant impediment to human development in LA County. These two issues are highly related and are at the core of the Opportunity Fund's mission.
  
 General Assembly delivers best in-class education in technology, business and design - essential skills needed for the 21st century economy. Not only do we provide practical experienced based learning, we are creating a globally connected group of entrepreneurs and practitioners invested in each others success.
  
 The Opportunity Fund, through General Assembly's flagship Web Development Immersive (WDI) program, is aimed at getting minorities and underrepresented groups access to this network and opportunity so they too can participate in this future.
  
 WDI is a proven job creator:
  
 -Close to 100% of all job-seeking WDI students have received full-time employment within a few months of graduating
 -We have over 2,000 hiring partners - including Twitter, Facebook, Google
 -WDI has a paid Apprenticeship Program that supplements in-class learning with on-the job experiential training and mentorship
  
 We have already started to leave a footprint in LA county: opening a campus in Spring of 2003, with 95% of job-seeking WDI graduates finding employment.
  
 By 2020, there will be 1.4 million computer specialist job openings, but universities are predicted to produce only enough qualified graduates to fill about 30% of these positions.
  
 Furthermore, over 1/3 of hiring employers reported difficulty finding suitable candidates.
  
 The Opportunity Fund can Increase the talent pool of candidates in LA right now, and specifically reward underrepresented groups with a chance to participate in a more prosperous economic future. The existing partnerships in place with tech education Non Profits will ensure Opportunity Fund fellows give back what they have learnt to their respective communities. 
 
 This volunteer work Fellows give to youth after graduation will serve to inspire the next generation and create a strong collection of talent and entrepreneurial community that can shape LA in 2050 and well beyond.","Here are a few statistics to demonstrate the problem:
  
 -Only 24% of computer science and math employees are women
 -Women account for just 6% of CEOs at the top 100 tech companies, and 22% of engineers overall
 -Only 1 out of 10 STEM professionals are minority women
 -African Americans make up less than 3% of all scientists and engineers, Hispanics 4% and all other groups 3%
  
 The reality however is that there is a shortage of employable talent at startups and technology companies: The current rate of unemployment for technology professionals is around 4% - half the jobless rate of the US.
  
 There is clearly a misalignment of opportunity and skill set. The Opportunity Fund will benefit underrepresented groups in technology and get them into the workforce.
  
 Specifically the Benefactors are currently working with have pledged to support Women, Veterans, Blacks and Hispanics. (We allow our Benefactors the ability to determine which group they wish to target and help.)","We have existing partnerships confirmed as per below:

 We will launch with outreach and education to community members in an effort to create awareness/acceptance around environmental health, energy-efficient homes, growing food locally, drought tolerant landscaping and gray water systems, and living more sustainable, green-focused lifestyles. 
 
 The next step will be to identify homeowners within a block radius that will participate and support Green The Block efforts. We will identify homeowners via local community groups, churches, neighborhood associations and school groups. Once we have homeowners identified, we will determine home & yard improvements via energy audits, soil tests and urban farming potential evaluations.
 
 Funders will be encouraged to sponsor particular areas of interest to their organization (Victory Farm, Energy Efficiency audits…) and homeowners will be encouraged to provide sweat equity to ensure engagement in the initiative.

4102092,Help build a Realtime Environmental Sensor Network,The project will assess the benefits of using salvaged materials in the construction of new homes to minimize climate change in Los Angeles.,Live,2014150,2014,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,"To implement the “Toward a Carbon Neutral House” project we propose to demonstrate the relative benefit of using salvaged materials based on a case study of the deconstruction of an existing house and the construction of a new house using salvaged materials from the former. The case study will include a cataloging of inputs and outputs of materials for salvage and disposal at each of the two house sites in Los Angeles for the purposes of a Life-Cycle Assessment (“LCA”). This LCA will establish an “energy budget” for the new house based on: 1) a calculation of the embodied energy of these materials; and, 2) a calculation of the projected operational energy use for the new house over its life-cycle.
 
 This total energy budget of the new house will allow us to further analyze and compare the case study with other cases such as a Baseline Case which meets minimum code requirements. Additionally, we will be able to find the associated CO2 emissions of each element of the new house, and add other external emissions to the Baseline Case such as from the landfill disposal of a typical demolition. This will allow a more complete picture of the performance of the new house not just in terms of its energy use, but its carbon footprint.
 
 If, through this case study, we are able to demonstrate there is a significant amount of reduced CO2 emissions from using salvaged materials to build a new home, then we would propose to use this assessment to advocate for the reform of the applicable codes and standards (e.g. Los Angeles Green Building Code and LEED for Homes). To accomplish this goal, we propose to organize and disseminate the results of our work for use by the relevant stakeholders and policy makers. We will use a variety of media and formats for communicating our results including a short video to be used online and at screenings for educational and advocacy purposes.
 
 The LA2050 grant will allow us to carry out a complete and thorough cataloging of the inputs and outputs of the deconstructed house and new house, and to conduct a Life-Cycle Assessment which will help quantify the CO2 emissions of salvaged materials in new home construction. With the proper funding of the “Toward a Carbon Neutral House” project, we hope to carry out this case study in a manner that will serve a range of stakeholders and policy makers, but in the end serve the greater community of Los Angeles through reduced carbon emissions and helping to create a more resilient city.","The “Toward a Carbon Neutral House” project will help make Los Angeles the healthiest place to live by serving as a launch pad for reforming the codes and regulations which shape the homes we live in, and therefore drive how we as a city produce CO2 emissions and contribute to climate change. In the Los Angeles region, we have both the blessing of beautiful landscapes and a history of environmental damage in the smog and pollutants we have produced, and the wildfires and droughts we have precipitated due to climate change. To mitigate this damage and make Los Angeles a more resilient city and region will not happen overnight, nor in a year, but if we take incremental steps like reforming the codes, we can achieve a steady progress toward a healthy environment in which to live over the long term.
 
 In the next year, we believe the “Toward a Carbon Neutral House” project will demonstrate the relative benefits of using salvaged materials in new homes, and we will begin to reform the necessary codes and regulations for all of Los Angeles and the region to be able to take advantage of this smart CO2 emissions reduction measure. In the long term (and definitely in 2050) the construction industry will, we believe, have embraced the use of salvaged materials as a standard practice, and the benefits of reduced CO2 emissions and minimized climate change will be enjoyed by all Angelenos.
 
 What this will mean for Angelenos is a more resilient city and region where the extreme outcomes of increasing climate change such as wildfires, droughts and rising sea level will be minimized. Like a firefighter taking the fuel away from the fire, these natural events will hopefully be minimized in their severity and frequency if we are able to minimize climate change. Similarly, the severity of smog and levels of air toxins in the Los Angeles region will hopefully be reduced if we minimize climate change due to the reduced CO2 levels and temperatures which contribute to particulates collecting in the atmosphere even.
 
 In 2050, Los Angeles will be a healthy place to live for all Angelenos due in part, we hope, to the early efforts of the “Toward a Carbon Neutral House” project to serve as a launch pad for the necessary documentation, advocacy and reforms to the codes and standards which shape the way we live.","The “Toward a Carbon Neutral House” project is intended to benefit all of Los Angeles's communities from the improved environmental quality associated with reduced CO2 emissions. To accomplish this goal the project proposes to first lay the groundwork for reforms to the codes and standards which shape the homes we live in, and how they treat the use of salvaged materials. Therefore, the project will at first be a documentation and advocacy tool for stakeholders and policy makers who work in the residential construction market in the Los Angeles region. 
 The specific stakeholders we are targeting include general contractors, sub-contractors, building materials suppliers, architecture and engineering professionals, sustainability consultants, and environmental and community groups. The specific policy makers include researchers, building officials at the municipal and state level, officials at the Los Angeles Bureau of Sanitation, and USGBC technical committee members. The benefits of this research will hopefully be to provide a foundation for future research, help to build a consensus on the issue of salvaged materials within both the private and public sector, and hopefully lead to real reforms of the applicable codes and standards such as the Los Angeles Green Building Code and LEED for Homes.
 The goal of the “Toward a Carbon Neutral House” project is to demonstrate how locally-sourced salvaged materials can be used to reduce our carbon footprint, and thereby improve the environmental quality of the world we all live in. The benefits of a reduced carbon footprint extend well beyond the city limits of Los Angeles, and will require the participation of many more communities to be effective, but that is the nature of environmental issues. Pollution, climate change, and other environmental challenges do not tend to respect borders, and consequently require a global response, but acting locally is always the first step.","The “Toward a Carbon Neutral House” project will be lead internally at Home Front Build by Derek Ryder, a licensed architect and LEED AP, who will serve as the sustainability professional and project coordinator leading the data collection, dissemination and project management activities with the project team.

We will support at least 19 entrepreneurs during the budget period. Most will grow at their own sites on an average of .01 acres, producing about 4000 pounds of food annually. When all are certified (by March 2015) the food hub will have the capacity to impact 200,000 residents in nearby communities. 
 
 Integral to our food hub is the online aggregator we developed. It represents the local food market -- populated and informed by local entrepreneurs, small yard farms, larger vacant lot farms, restaurants utilizing their produce and consumers. The area is seeing intense attrition and outright loss of large grocery stores. The online food hub fills some of that niche, providing information about local restaurants and healthy food markets that buy local, in addition to location and availability of production resources like our commercial kitchen. The online tool informs consumers about community-based distribution sites (for producers in the food hub) and allows producers to tell their own story about how, why and when they grow. In addition to facilitating connections between consumers and producers, it brings resources to the community and promotes social entrepreneurship and food justice. 
 
 In 12-months, we will undertake the following: establish a business incubator and co-working space for beginning food producers; launch farmer training and mentoring programs (including a three-month, farm development and certification curriculum) to support producers in their first through third years of establishment; offer four workshops for producers and community members to learn about local food access issues and solutions; and connect with local and national urban farming training organizations to share project outcomes and replicate best practices. 
 
 We are also pursuing acquisition of 67,000 square feet of growing space in the food hub area, which will significantly expand healthy food options.","Presently and in 2050, our project expands individual and community health by increasing access to healthy food options. It also expands health by reinvigorating and strengthening local economies that support healthy activities. Residents are more able to meet dietary recommendations when there is a positive and robust local food environment. 
 
 A food hub, by addressing the barriers small producers have to joining the food supply chain, increases access to fresh, local food. With the support of the food hub, small producers are able to participate in sales to residents who receive food assistance. The use of sustainable agricultural practices also contributes to local health by decreasing the negative impact of agriculture on the environment. 
 
 It is well-established that increasing the availability of local, fresh food options improves health outcomes now, and it follows that with increased opportunities and activities, this will be even more so in 2050. Implementing the project now, we can reduce food insecurity for 10% of area residents. Nearly two-thirds of adults in the area reported that it was difficult to access fresh fruits and vegetables. The California Agricultural Resource Directory reports that, per year, one acre of land in Los Angeles can produce 25 tons of fruits and vegetables, generate $220,000, supply 36 families fruits and vegetables and create at least three green jobs. Various studies about the area also show that every dollar invested in food production yields $6 worth of produce. Working pursuant to these factors, in 12 months the project and its 19 grower families will decrease numbers of food insecure families by: providing fresh produce, weekly, to nearly100 local households; providing approximately 75,000 pounds of fresh, locally grown produce to residents in South Los Angeles; and achieving a minimum of 360 unique food sales per month.
 
 Food security is derived from a sustainable food system. As more residents are engaged in the local food economy, the system becomes more sustainable. A local food supply chain, one that is also informed and supplied by local residents, improves the local economy and gives rise to food justice. It also encourages the local knowledge that bonds a community and inspires social equity. 
 
 We seek to improve community health not just physically, but socially and economically. All that we do now and succeed in will have positive impact and support future residents.","Our clients are all at (or very well below) the Area Median Income and live primarily in the wider communities of South Los Angeles. 
 
 The population of approximately 200,000 surrounding our site is primarily African-American and Latino with women heads of household in the majority. Ten percent of that population is children under five-years-old. One-in-six residents is low-income and food insecure. The unemployment rate in the neighborhood is near 74% higher than the county average.
 
 All of the project participants will be low-income, socially disadvantaged, beginning food producers. The entire project budget will be used to address this population.
 
 The target audience consists of food producers and consumers. Our producers are low-income food entrepreneurs in South Los Angeles. They are being recruited from approximately 200 households in the 1/4 mile radius of the homestead / business incubator site. They are at or below 50% of the Area Median Income (considered “very low” and “extremely low” income). Seventy-five percent of the residents we serve are at very low income – 50% of AMI. Fifteen percent are at extremely low median income – 30% of AMI. Five percent self-identify as homeless. The area has the highest rate of childhood obesity in Los Angeles County and 1-in-6 residents is likely to experience food insecurity.","Participants have been contacted and recruited through outreach and association with local organizations including Community Coalition, LA Green Grounds, and the Baldwin Hills-Crenshaw Farmers Market. New participants will be recruited in the same manner as well as through partners who sit on the Food Policy Roundtable of the Community Health Councils. All of our new participants are in the beginning phase of their businesses. 
 
 There is no food hub in South Los Angeles. Our work will be the first organized and developed system. In the immediate area, we have a relationship with the manager of the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw farmers market. Since 2010, we have worked with community organizations educating residents about access to healthy food options along with our own work supporting those who grow and prepare their own food for distribution. We also access a number of guerilla gardeners who are sharing and growing food with neighbors but could reach and connect with consumers in South Los Angeles on a broad scale through our food hub network. 
 
 Three factors critical to success of any of our proposed collaborations are: increased access to local actors already interested in food production and consumption of healthy food; increased access to people working in the food justice and social equity arena, so integral to community improvement and overall health; and increased access to people who are actively growing quality food in local spaces.",1,

 1. Expanding Market Match to 8 additional markets, with 4 located in areas Hunger Action Los Angeles does not currently serve, especially the San Fernando Valley
 2. Training current market operators; recruiting volunteers; continuing administration of program at 18 markets; conducting meetings to coordinate promotion of Market Match activities with current and future Market Match partners; 
 3. Creating specific outreach materials for seniors, families, and persons with disabilities","Market Match makes Los Angeles a better place to live by producing the following benefits:
 
 1. Reduces hunger as vulnerable individuals and families acquire additional resources to obtain more food. 
 2. Improves health as Market Match coupons can only be used on healthy items such as fresh apples, asparagus, beets and broccoli, rather than prepared foods that may be high in fat, salt and sugar. 
 3. Builds community by facilitating interaction between people in an open community space.
 4. Stimulates the local economy, as participating local farmers gain revenue generated by increased sales at the farmers’ market, rather than the money being sent out of state through the purchase of non-Californian produce. 
 5. Expands the local sustainable agriculture sector, improving the environment in the process.
 6. Creates connections with other nonprofit organizations working on similar issues, developing a network of readily available resources that participants can conveniently access.","The project specifically benefits the following populations: Families with children aged 5 and under: Seniors: Persons with physical or mental disabilities: Families and individuals using the CalFresh (""food stamp"") program: and persons with diabetes receiving Medi-Cal, who have been advised to adjust their diet to include more vegetables.","Currently participating partners include The Ecology Center, which is coordinating several Market Match programs statewide: SEE-LA, who operate 7 farmers markets in Los Angeles and also administer the program: and our partner farmers market organizations who host the program at their markets, including: Certified Farmers Market Management (Gardena and Adams/Vermont): Harbor Area Farmers Markets (Huntington Park and Long Beach): The Greener Good (2 other Long Beach Markets): Model Neighborhood Program (La Cienega and Kaiser South Bay markets): VELA (East LA and Valinda markets): Inland Valley Hope Partners (Pomona), Sprouts of Promise (Monterey Park), Thai CDC (East Hollywood), Altadena Farmers Market, City of Compton, City of Santa Monica, and Mar Vista Farmers Market.

4102096,Ignite Teaching,Empower students to create collaborative digital projects that increase achievement and quality of relationships through teamwork and equity,Learn,2014153,2014,,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,"Ignite has teamed up with experienced educators in LA and across the nation to build the best collaborative digital creation tool made specifically for the classroom. From their own device, students create beautiful digital projects with help from members of their group. The types of creations that were once only possible through tools with steep learning curves like Photoshop. Students leverage text, images and videos from around the web with tools built into Ignite’s editor. Projects can be edited in real time by other members of the group.
 
 In addition to the rich creation experience, we will build a wide range of teacher tools. We know that teachers don’t have enough time as it is so things like creating an account, classes, assignments is built directly into our workflow. We track individual student contributions and a produce progress report for teachers that clearly identifies what each student contributed. Individual responsibility can finally be fairly assessed in the group project environment with Ignite.
 
 Nick Sithi, a core member of our founding team is a full-time teacher with over 9 years of experience educating the youth of LA. He not only provides crucial product feedback but also runs Ignite’s private alpha which is deployed to a group of K12 educators. During this alpha phase we are receiving crucial, real-time feedback from teachers across the nation.
 
 Right now we’re all heads-down preparing the iPad app for our beta launch in September. Soon after we will focus on the following four areas;
 
 1. Cross Platform
 Although we initially launched with the iPad we plan to have cross platform support by Q1 2015. This means that Ignite will run on any tablet, PC, and across all major browsers. We will make sure any school can use Ignite regardless of their previous technology decisions (Chromebooks, iPads, etc).
 
 2. Teacher Tools
 It’s paramount that teachers have the ability to assess individual contributions to the project, check for plagiarism, and manage student workflow. Teachers will be provided with clear reports that provide this key information.
 
 3. Primary school use cases
 Once 1 and 2 are achieved, we will focus on making Ignite malleable for primary school use cases. The earlier we can get kids to create, the better. However, the ability of a 3rd grader is very different than that of a 7th grader. Teachers will have the ability to customize the Ignite’s creation process to take into account the varying skills levels.","According to Creating Minds*, “At age 5 we use 80% of our creative potential but by age 12 we drop to as low as 2% and stay there for the rest of our lives.”
 
 Today, LA has roughly 640,000 students in K12 among its 1000+ schools spread over 720 square miles. We believe a majority of those kids would not consider themselves creative because they aren’t labeled as artists or musicians. These are the same kids who are or going to be subject to an increased focus on collaboration in the classroom through the new Common Core Standards**. This is especially true in the subjects of English Language Arts & Literacy in History/Social Studies, Science, and Technical Subjects.
 
 Through Ignite’s blend of creativity, collaboration, and confidence building we are empowering teachers all over LA to give their students the critical experiences they need be better citizens of LA and the world. They learn how to CREATE, leverage technology to further their own understanding of subjects, explore new ideas, define their own interpretation of theories, contemplate subjects from different angles, and articulate things in their own personal way. They learn to COLLABORATE, how to communicate, how to navigate disagreements, how to voice their opinion, how to use other’s opinion to shape new ideas, understand how their individual efforts impact the success or failure of the group. They understand the importance of RECOGNITION of their own hard work as well as the hard work of others.
 
 We believe all these skills must be learned in the most crucial time in their lives when they are most malleable, that is,starting from kindergarten all the way up to high school. This is why Ignite is important TODAY.
 
 TODAY, there are the 640,000 students in LA trying to find out who they are, navigate adolescence, young adulthood, trying to form their own opinions, make friends etc. In 2050, they will be LA. They will be our inventors, creators, makers, entrepreneurs, educators, inspirers and leaders. The future Elon Musks, Barack Obamas, Sheryl Sandbergs of the world. And why? Because LA believed in a kind of 2014 that valued creativity, collaboration and technology in the classroom.
 
 * creatingminds.org/articles/age.htm
 **www.corestandards.org/ELA-Literacy/CCRA/SL/","Any student from kindergarten to high school. The younger they start Igniting, the better, because the sooner you explore creativity and collaboration, the more time you have to sharpen those skills. We want to make creativity a habit we learn as soon as we can start to read and write. By LA2050, we believe no one should be saying, “I’m not creative enough to do [something]”. They _will_ do it because of initiatives like Ignite that taught them how to think creatively especially with other collaborators. Students will take the skills they’ve learned using Ignite with them into the world, long after their formal education careers are over and pay off in dividends in every single aspect of their life.
 
 Teachers will also benefit from Ignite through its assessment features. Ignite generates a progress report for each group, detailing the efforts of each student involved. Concrete data will allow teachers to fairly assess and acknowledge contributions made by each group member, creating equity during assessment. Teachers can trust their students to become more responsible, knowing that they are held accountable for their actions.

4102097,I’LL BE THE 1 2 SEE THE LIGHT,Service learning programs that matter for secondary students & teachers.,Learn,2014154,2014,,,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,,"Through service learning educational programs, student made documentary films, social media campaigns, youth summits, educational art installations, literature publication, and online curriculum, IBT1 encourages youth to get involved and interested in larger social issues by using inspiring, creative mediums. 
 
 
 Presented with opportunities in the class room to address present day, real-world challenges students will take on projects that test out their critical thinking and team-building skills on issues that will immediately have an impact on their local communities, and they’ll build up their confidence in their ability to impact real change while doing it. Of course, we need to teach our youth the basics about the important global issues at hand, but it is also our responsibility to restore in them the belief that they can indeed make a difference and that their actions matter. We need to give them the opportunity to experience that they, indeed, can be the one to make a change for the better. 
 
 Our premiere program based on this philosophy, SEE THE LIGHT, will launch in over 10+ Los Angeles based Secondary Schools Fall 2014. Designed to walk teachers and students through an eco-challenge that impacts their school and/or community to which they must propose and vote on a chosen project to implement as a potential solution to the presented problem. 
 
 This fall we will address the five main topics of soil health, waste management, energy, air quality, and ocean health in that particular school and group of students. Each school participating will be provided with 3 visits from an IBT1 program lead. We will provide the following; three classroom discussions, a presentation about our program; actionable take home tool kit that addresses the eco-challenge; a sustainability plan for the school and student related to the challenge; tools for science, environmental and film clubs to launch peer-to-peer learning campaigns; access to our online tools, how to videos, social media engagement, and tracking system; comprehensive volunteer, internship, and learning database; and resources in English and Spanish language. 
 
 SEE THE LIGHT will empower students to take on an eco challenge, art installations, media campaigns, and documentary films that push forward social change. With our online portal students will be able to track their groups’ project, find and log volunteer hours, and earn points toward green products, healthy food, and scholarships.","SEE THE LIGHT is uniquely designed to take advantage of the rich resources we have in the LA metropolitan area – namely the bar-setting arts and entertainment industry and the thriving local non-profit community- and make them more available to the youth engaged in our programs. Many of these youth, especially those in the less affluent areas, would never otherwise have exposure to such resources. By creating collaborative partnerships between local non-profits (Heal the Bay, Tree People, etc.), the creative arts and entertainment industry, local governing bodies, and local schools we create a learning web for students that inspire them at a passion level so the learning flows naturally. We show them the benefits of cross-pollinating from the many sectors of society to come up with creative solutions to long-held societal problems. We create an “innovation-incubator” for our youth to nurture and build confidence in the budding leader inside. Through mentorship programs and youth summits in our programs and online community, we connect youth directly with places of potential future employment. 
 With SEE THE LIGHT, LA does become the best place to learn today because we bridge the gap between school and the community’s outside resources. We take the pressure off of schools to “do it all,” and we provide an avenue for outside agencies to bring their resources to the schools in an easy-to-use, immediately impactful way. What’s more, with every new year of the program, the learning web only grows stronger. The integrated community of learning that expands well beyond the walls of any one school grows bigger and more sophisticated every year. Graduates of the program can come back and act as mentors. Communications between schools, non-profits, and the entertainment industry get more frequent, more clear, and more creatively rich. We start to funnel well-trained youth into internship jobs at some of the collaborating non-profits or corporations that take part in out learning web. By the year 2050, other metropolitan areas will be emulating our model for integrated learning systems that empower our youth, our communities, and our local industries.","The youth of today – leadership training, direct hands on experience, opportunities to direct their future success and access to meeting folks who can get them in the job market
 
 The schools – we take over where they don’t have the capacity to take the students. Everything from teaching them emotional intelligence, conflict resolution, management skills as well as we connect schools to the local resources in the community that they wouldn’t otherwise have access to.
 
 The industries and non-profits– entertainment industry needs vibrant young minds with innovative ideas that address real world problems. We are a key component in that pipeline, getting the best of the best youth in position to be future employees at these places.
 
 Future generations and the planet – we are protecting the future generations of this planet by giving our best offering to this current next generation. We are teaching them from an integrated place, teaching them systems thinking so that they can address the complex problems we face with a holistic approach. We are teaching them how to be stewards of this earth. Like Einstein said “to solve a problem, you have to operate from a higher level of consciousness than the one the problem was created on.” We are offering that new high level way of thinking as a promise for a better future for all.","Non-profits – Tree People, Heal The Bay, Kiss The Ground, Global Green and ACE.
 
 Governing agencies – City of LA Mayor's office and their Sustainable goals. 
 
 Institutions of higher learning – partnering with film schools and Universities. We are working with UCLA. 
 
 Secondary Schools – University High, Amino Inglewood High School, Amino Westrside Middle School, Muse School (these are confirmed) and more to come. 
 
 CREEC- CA Dept of Ed.
 
 Arts and Entertainment Industry– partnering with film schools such as LA Film so students will be exposed to the entertainment industry through media projects we build with the students.
 
 Three factors critical to the success of our collaboration: 1) regular and open communication. Not a lot of institutions are used to working in such a collaborative and innovative way. There’s a lot of disconnects and “re-invent the wheel” stuff in the non-profit world and entertainment industry here. By putting the focus on the youth and not on any one organization, we give the power over to the people and encourage a much higher level of organization. There’s a learning curve in and of itself in this collaboration. We are staffed at IBT1 with experts in empowerment and leadership training and fully intend to have one of the first things we do to be to inculcate the collaborating partners into our new model of thinking. We need to walk our talk for it to work. In addition, we are staffed amply to do regular follow up with our partners and support a regular open flow of communication clearly. 2) acknowledgment for the system as it currently works. We do have our feet on the ground, even if our vision is to shoot for the stars, so to speak. We know we have to be palatable to the schools learning agenda, especially with standardized testing, so we are partnering with CREEC to ensure we are doing this in a way that’s approachable enough for the schools that they’re able to fit it in their scheduling. 3) a clear plan. High level collaborations are awesome, but they need clear strategy and direction. Through the discipline comes the freedom. We have big goals, but they start with small strategic steps. We have very clear game plans about who to engage in year one, and what we need from who to make this work. We constantly re-evaluate and course correct, but are savvy to the need for specific and measurable benchmark goals, especially in the early stages of partnerships until a more naturalorganic rhythm starts to unfold.",0,
4102098,SFCLA - Serving Hope and Veggies where LA needs it most!,IW proposes applying its 45 years of proven service to the mentally ill to helping homeless veterans and veterans suffering from PTSD.,Live,2014155,2014,,,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,,"We train and supply the professional theater artists, and continue our 20 year relationship with services at the Veterans Administration such as New Directions, the Salvation Army, and the California State Home for Veterans, as well as other veteran homes and services all over Los Angeles in serving their clients (the veterans), but on a larger scale than before by supplying more artists in order to serve 100 vets. We arrange for the meeting space, and then rent the theater spaces for performance","Scientific testing at the UCLA Semel Institute has shown that among those who suffer mental illness, participation in Imagination Workshop's theater workshops for the mentally ill leads to a higher functioning, better life, which includes improved social skills, higher functioning in job interviews, the establishing of ego boundaries through the experience of creating and embodying fictional characters, better participation in groups and programs, and the ability to stay out of the hospital. Our work with homeless veterans and those suffering PTSD in the past has been very successful and helped hundreds of vets live fuller lives. By helping 100 Los Angeles veterans live healthier lives, we help La become the healthiest place to live today. By creating a continuing program that reaches out and serves this many vets every year, we help make a heathy LA in 2050.","Our project will directly benefit 100 homeless veterans and veterans suffering PTSD, their families, and their community. Through professional theater presentations, we will reach audiences of several hundred theater-goers and share with them the nature of our work and the needs of our veterans.","In 2012, IW, with a a grant from Metabolic Studio, led 20 weekly sessions at the Calvet Center with 40 senior vets and homeless vets from the California State Home for Veterans and the Salvation Army Veteran Home that resulted in an original theater production at the Odyssey theater, seen by 150 people. From 2000 to 2010, IW ran a weekly group of homeless veterans at New Directions that resulted in three original theater productions at Theater Theater and The Greenway Theater. All of these organizations have issued IW a standing invitation to work with their vets, but have not, of late, been able to fund our work. With funding, IW is definitely invited to work with these organizations.",0,
4102099,Mission 3.0: Empowering Leaders on the Field and In the Classroom,"We will match student-athletes with a yearlong mentor, who will help imagine new futures for the students and devise a plan to get there.",Learn,2014156,2014,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Abraham Lincoln High School in Northeast Los Angeles,"ITC was founded in 2008 to develop leaders in urban communities through empowering families, building support networks, and improving academic achievement. We began in Lincoln Heights, one of the most underserved communities in all of LA County, and a partnership was quickly established with the local high school, Abraham Lincoln High School (LHS). In 2010, “Mission 3.0” was created to specifically challenge LHS student-athletes, who are historically some of the lowest academic achievers at LHS. Through collaboration with the coaches, ITC provided mandatory tutoring sessions for the student-athletes, pushing them to strive beyond the minimum 2.0 GPA required to play. The success of our “Mission 3.0” program relied on that collaboration. In this sense, much of the foundation for the success of our program has already been implemented at the institutional level. Our biggest push will be to establish a foundation for sustained achievement with our students and their families.
 
  
 
 ITC will start by matching students from the JV Football team with our mentors, who are trained to provide guided and up-to-date academic support. The first 10 weeks of the program, which will get students to rethink their perceptions of their education and their community, will coincide with the fall sports season. Our mentoring sessions will be planned around game and practice times—in other words, mentoring will be integrated into the athletics program. At the end of those 10 weeks, those who continue with the mentoring program will meet with their mentor weekly, providing student-athletes with much-needed structure even beyond the season. In addition to providing general guidance on the path to college, mentors will also teach their students very specific skills that will be necessary to get through college and eventually graduate. Workshops on topics as diverse as financial aid, SAT/ACT tests, and time management are part of our program.
 
  
 
 ITC will also hire a Parent Advocate who will be in charge of organizing parents and guardians of the team. Though a committee of parents will be created during the fall sports season, the role of the Parent Advocate will be to sustain parent organization throughout the year. Our vision is for parents to be provided a platform for organizing around the issues they believe need to be addressed in our schools. As our committee becomes stronger, so will our mentoring program, which will rely on heavier parent involvement during the off-season.","The path to college for many of our students is akin to a long, dark hallway. For many of them, the thought of walking down it has not crossed their minds at all. For many others, a plethora of fears grips them each time they venture to the entrance of that hallway. It feels out of reach. It is too dark; too easy to get lost, and too easy to never make it to the other side. These are fears that paralyze.
 
 Our program will make LA the BEST place to LEARN today by directly addressing the sense of hopelessness that characterizes public education in our most underserved communities. The approach is two-pronged—to illuminate the future that might exist at the end of the hallway, and to embolden students (and their families) to make it through to the other side. 
 
 Our program will undoubtedly contribute to higher graduation rates, as well as more LHS students attending and graduating from college. More importantly, however, our program will train students to be engaged in their community, to recognize what is at stake in taking ownership of their education. Students will learn to take the fears that previously paralyzed them, and to turn them into motivation.
 
 As we grow, our first move will be to partner with the feeder middle school to LHS so that we can begin to support parents and students even before high school. Eventually, we see our program expanding to neighboring high schools that face many of the same issues in preparing students to be active participants in their schooling. 
 
 It is our vision that by 2050, students throughout Los Angeles will not only have access to the resources and support necessary to get to college, but will also have the skill set needed to graduate and move forward. Parents will be informed, empowered, and organized. Moreover, students and their families will see themselves as part of a larger community, understanding the role that each of them has in making Los Angeles the best place to LIVE, LEARN, CONNECT, CREATE, and PLAY.","The most immediate beneficiaries of our project will be the student-athletes of Lincoln High School (LHS). Only 38% of Lincoln students and 29% of LEMA students (the pilot Media/Arts school that shares its campus and sports program with LHS) are on track to complete their A-G requirements with a C or better. For a student body made up of over 1300 students, there is only one college counselor. Over 95% of our students are categorized as economically disadvantaged and participate in the federal school meal program, and the majority of our students’ parents have not received a college education (only 5.5% of adults in Lincoln Heights have earned a college degree). All of these conditions contribute to a learning environment in which college-readiness is the exception rather than the rule. 
 
 Our ultimate goal is to transform the sports culture in Lincoln Heights to one in which college-readiness is considered just as vital to team success as physical training. Of course, the athletics program is just the start. As a heavier college-going culture is established at LHS, students outside of the athletics program will benefit from college-readiness being normalized on campus. 
 
 Parents of our student-athletes will also benefit from our project. The Parent Committee, headed by our Parent Advocate, will be an important resource for parents in learning how to best advocate for their children. In a preliminary meeting with parents of the JV Football team, we heard from many parents who expressed frustration with the difficulty in establishing communication with teachers and administrators. Our project will serve as an avenue for parents to become more involved, more informed, and more connected.
  
 As mentioned above, LHS is severely understaffed in terms of college counselors. Our project will immediately alleviate some of the pressure put on LHS' college counselor by getting students to start planning for life after high school as early as 9th grade. We aim for students to become their own best advocates, to get them to take ownership of their schooling. Teachers will also benefit from having students who are more engaged, curious, and motivated. 
 
 Finally, Los Angeles will benefit when the students and parents if its most undeserved communities are provided the necessary tools to participate in sustainable community engagement.","ITC currently collaborates with Abraham Lincoln High School. We work closely with administrators, coaches, teachers, and the parents of the community every day to ensure program effectiveness. Dialogue regarding implementing Mission 3.0 at surrounding middle and high schools has begun, and it is only a matter of funding and time before ITC’s Mission 3.0 program infiltrates the LAUSD. EduCare provides our program with afterschool snacks necessary during our tutoring and mentoring sessions (http://educarefoundation.com/after-school-programs). 
 
 We also collaborate with professionals within Los Angeles to better enhance the delivery of our services, through avenues of guest speaking, workshop facilitation, and tutoring and mentoring. These individuals include professors from Cal State systems, local pastors, pro bono lawyers, and financial consultants from highly ranked corporations.
 
 Moving forward, ITC will strengthen existing partnerships as well as establish new collaborations with surrounding colleges and universities, mentoring agencies, and parent advocacy agencies in East Los Angeles. These partnerships will be successful insofar as we see each other as vital in holistically impacting the trajectory of lives in East Los Angelenos; we can not view each other as competition, but must be able to share and utilize resources conducive to growth.",0,
4102100,Incubator School Programs + Playbook: Open Source 21st Century Entrepreneurial Education,"Building an entrepreneurial education for the 21st century, and a playbook to open source that education for all students and schools.",Learn,2014157,2014,,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,"Start up education is a new frontier, and the Incubator School is one of its pioneers. As a free, diverse, open enrollment LAUSD public school that launched in 2013, we are bringing innovation to the second largest school district in the country. In fact, we're one of the only schools in the world working to combine entrepreneurship and schooling for middle and high school students. 
 
 We're designing a thoughtful and comprehensive program where we add one grade per year and each grade builds upon the previous one. Our goal is for students take ownership: of their passions, interests, and behavior, their relationship to their peers, communities, and world, the impact they want to have on that world. Our program grows students’ collaborative capabilities and their ability to communicate to diverse audiences for diverse purposes. It also nurtures a solutions-orientation; we are training our students to empathize with others, assess needs, and deploy a variety of tools, techniques, and pathways to design responses to problems they see around them. In our program students explore non-profit projects and for-profit ones, and learn about social entrepreneurship as well as the fast paced world of Silicon Beach. We engage our learners in exploring the ethics of different choices and the impact of different decisions. In short, we start up students to become 21st century citizens.
 
 To accomplish this, we are continually testing, experimenting, and iterating. We observe and measure what works and what doesn't. We seek feedback from all our stakeholders. To start up students, we need to stay small and agile like a start up company. 
 
 Building such a responsive comprehensive program, as well as an online playbook that enables us to extend our reach to anyone who wants to borrow or adapt our program, requires time. Time, of course, means people. As a small LAUSD public school in a system that determines budgets based on the number of pupils, we were allocated 2.6 teachers last year; this year we have 6. Yet, these early years require the greatest amount of research and development, partnership-building, and training. 
 
 We will use the grant to hire additional staff to enable us to build out our program as well as our playbook to share our program. We will also use the funds to help grow the expertise of our teachers and bring in expert partners to help us design 21st century learning experiences.","Los Angeles is the third most vibrant startup economy in the world, yet that energy has not made its way into our city's schools. We want to change that. Schools and the ideas of young people should be the drivers of the future and feed their visions into the startup world. Los Angeles has to tap youthful, out-of-the-box thinking to grow the economy towards LA2050. For this to happen, learning in LA needs to flow in every direction through the vast, diverse interconnected ecosystem that is our city. The Incubator School is a connector that facilitates this flow.
 
 In an ecosystem every part is dependent on every other part, and needs to learn to value the other parts. We work with everyone to connect the complex and exciting parts of Los Angeles' learning energy.
 
 We bring social and for-profit entrepreneurs into our school to share their expertise so that our students absorb starting up as a mindset. We retrain teachers to collaborate with funders, engineers, artists, chief technology officers, game developers, conservationists, designers, and other experts to design curricula that reflect the 21st century. As they work with our teachers and students, these experts and entrepreneurs also learn from our students and teachers, thereby impacting how they think about the world. 
 
 We work with large and small companies as well as non-profits and service organizations. Our students have conference calls with CTOs of companies whose learning products and games they beta test. They were some of the first middle schoolers to work with LA Audubon Society; they proposed redesigns of Dockweiler Beach so that its facilities could meet the needs of both humans and the federally threatened snowy plover. Our students created apps that anyone in the city can use (free augmented reality apps for the Ballona Wetlands). Through these interactions, not only do our students change but so do the organizations with whom they work. They come to see middle schools as possible thought partners.
 
 We collaborate with foundations and other schools to launch conferences where students, adults, teachers, administrators, game designers, technology companies, nonprofits, and arts organizations connect and share expertise (innovatED.LA). Our students and staff participate in Startup Weekends, hackathons, makerspaces. 
 
 We connect as many parts of the ecosystem together as we can so learning can flow freely, and our playbook will extend this connecting even further.","We are a diverse, integrated LAUSD public school that anyone can attend: last year 39% of our students were low income, 47% were Latino, 32% White, 16% African American, 5% Asian; 19% Special Education, 15% Gifted and Talented. Our project will most immediately benefit them. This year we are expanding from 62 6th-7th graders to about 140 6th-8th graders. Each year we will add one additional grade. 
 
 However, our reach extends beyond our school. We host visiting teachers, administrators, foundations, non-profits, etc, every week. The US Department of Education and the State Department have visited us, as have delegations and journalists from Thailand, Korea, Japan, and China. Since we were featured on BBC News on July 4th, we've received requests for information and curriculum from England, Ireland, Hungary, Chile, India, Italy, Romania, and throughout the United States. Our free online playbook would allow what we're doing to spread all through the world. 
 
 Our goal, however, is to change education in Los Angeles. We want our students to become change agents even more than they are already. We want them to change what Los Angeles expects from its students, and we want the Incubator School to change what Los Angeles expects from its schools.","We partner with many organizations to grow our programs (New Learning Institute of the Pearson Foundation, LA Audubon, CoderDojo, GameDesk, Playmaker, Joan Ganz Cooney Center @ Sesame Workshop, Institute of Play, Everyone On, Pearson PLC), but for this grant we will be partnering with the Los Angeles chapter of the Network For Teaching Entrepreneurship to build our capacity to teach entrepreneurship and create a playbook for launching startups during middle and high school. 
 
 NFTE's mission is to provide programs that inspire young people from low-income communities to stay in school, to recognize business opportunities, and to plan for successful futures. To do so NFTE runs during- and after-school programs, as well as NFTE University, a mini-MBA program for teachers to train them in entrepreneurial thinking and practices. NFTE's programs have reached over 7,800 students in Los Angeles since 2007, and over 500,000 nationally. 
 
 The Incubator School believes that schools of LA2050 must be entrepreneurial. They need to understand the expertise they bring to the table, and work with others to grow that expertise as well as share it. Exchanges and partnerships need to be mutual. 
 
 We deeply value the expertise NFTE's mini-MBA program will bring to our instructional staff and plan to have NFTE train them. 
 
 However, we also plan to help grow NFTE's programs. Their middle school curriculum leads students to creating a business concept while their high school curriculum has students creating a business plan. 
 
 Our goal is for students actually to launch startups: in 8th grade in the school, and in 12th grade in the real world in Silicon Beach. 
 
 Our collaboration will thus enable both organizations to expand our capacities. 
 
 Three critical factors are:
 
 1) mutual growth
 2) the ability of both organizations to dedicate staff time to the collaboration
 3) the ability of both organizations to extend the reach of the curricula the collaboration develops
 
 We have not worked together in the past, but we greatly look forward to working together in the future.",0,

The pamphlets will include simple charts and diagrams outlining food pyramids, recommended daily levels, and recommended BMI levels. (2)Seasonal Food Plans: The next phase of Four Seasons of Food would be designing a diet plan with the food provided by Interfaith in mind. Interfaith provides clients with four bags of food: a “wet” bag (containing refrigerated/frozen items such as dairy and meat), a “dry” bag (containing canned goods, cereals, and other packaged, non-refrigerated items), fresh produce when available, and a bag of bread/tortillas. The food plans will take into consideration the items being distributed and offer recipes, preparation tips, and other information which would allow clients to use the food to the most of its nutritious and economic potential. Each quarter (season) would have its own detailed plan, and this would reflect the what is offered by Interfaith and also what is available at that time of the year. Information in both the informative pamphlet and seasonal plan pamphlet would be compiled by health/nutrition students in the area and PIH Health, under the direction of the program administrator. Clients would pick up these materials as they signed in before they received their food. (3) Food Preparation Demonstrations: The third part of the Four Seasons of Food program will be the offering of food demonstrations/cooking classes for clients. Every quarter clients will be invited to sign up for a demonstration in the on-site kitchen/preparation room or the facilities at Whittier Area First Day, which will inform clients of healthy/economical ways to prepare the food provided weekly. (4) Kitchen Items:The final phase of Four Seasons of Food will be the purchase and distribution of kitchen items at demonstration classes to complement each season and provide clients with a tangible tool to prepare/keep food. The items for each season will be as follows: spring will be a juicer, summer will be a smoothie maker, fall will be items to pack a healthy lunch (portion controlled, cooled lunchboxes), and winter will be a slow cooker/crock pot.","One in six American families are currently experiencing food insecurity, which is defined as not the total absence of food, but rather the constant fear that the next meal can not be counted on (National Geographic 2014). The majority of food insecure households have at least one working parent employed in a full time job, but due to low wages and high living expenses, the “new face of poverty” seen nationwide is one that is not only struggling to get by, but also lacking the time and energy necessary to prepare labor intensive meals with nutritiousness in mind. Melissa Boteach, vice president of the Poverty and Prosperity Program of the Center for American Progress notes in the August 2014 issue of National Geographic, that “the paradox that hunger and obesity are two sides of the same coin.” Many “make trade-offs between food that is filling but not nutritious and may actually contribute to obesity.” Continuing, the undeniable link between being overweight and having food insecurity is explained because “junk food [is] plentiful and often cheap, hunger and obesity are now parallel problems.” 
 A clear indication of the severity of food insecurity in the service area is found in the PIH Health Needs Assessment (PIH Survey, 2013), which indicates that in the Los Nietos School District (with three schools, all located in the designated service area), 100% of the student population participate in the Free and Reduced Meal Program, and in the South Whittier School District, 64% of the students participate in that same program. The clients served by Interfaith Food Center live in an area with an above national average poverty rate, with 15.7% earning less than than $10,830/person/year (PIH Survey, 2013). Additionally, 9% of the population served identify as a senior in poverty (PIH Survey, 2013). 
 The unfortunate link between obesity and food insecurity is something that has been proven by studies throughout the United States and is something that Four Seasons of Hunger attempts to tackle. Through this four pronged approach, beginning with broad information and concluding with specific action, the hope is that clients will be able to avoid becoming part of this trend and use Interfaith Food Center’s supplemental groceries to achieve healthy diets. A good diet is something that is passed down from generation to generation, and if healthy habits are instilled in the current population, not only will they benefit, but it will ensure a healthier LA in 2050.","The Four Seasons of Food project would benefit Interfaith Food Center's clients. Interfaith Food Center currently serves over 1,200 families, consisting of roughly 4,000 individuals living with food insecurity in the city and unincorporated areas of Whittier, and the cities of La Mirada and Santa Fe Springs in Los Angeles County. All clients will be given not only supplemental food, but also correct and current information about how to prepare it.","Interfaith Food Center currently partners with PIH Health, Whittier Area First Day, Whittier College, and Biola University, as well as having the support and resources of many talented volunteers. Specifically, PIH Health has nutritionists and chefs to assist in compiling informational pamphlets and menus. Whittier Area First Day is a local homeless shelter. The shelter just received a new commercial grade kitchen, which they will make available to Interfaith Food Center to conduct classes, if necessary. Both Whittier and Biola Colleges partner with Interfaith Food Center for internships and research classes, making them the perfect partners for program evaluation and implementation. The three factors that are critical to the success of the proposed collaboration are (1) access to nutritional information and menu planning; (2) ability to conduct classes and; (3) expertise and knowledge to evaluate and measure success. The proposed partners meet these critical factors.",1,
4102104,The TALK Project,"The #Invisible2Invincible Campaign raises awareness for challenges faced by homeless youth, systemic change, and develops youth leadership.",Live,2014159,2014,,,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,,"There are three main objectives for the Invisible to Invincible Campaign: 1) Political/Community change regarding the four challenges identified in our research & policy report, 2) increasing awareness & support for homeless youth within our community and neighbors, and 3) personal transformation for program participants. As Jovenes continues to expand our housing capacity, we also seek to identify and address policies and systems that push youth into homelessness or which contribute to the challenges they face as they seek to move their lives forward. 
 
 Our youth recently made a documentary entitled “From Invisible to Invincible” which tells powerful stories of how they became homeless and highlights their resilience. The Invisible to Invincible Campaign will utilize this film, along with our research and policy report, to educate our community and empower our youth to create change. Currently, Jovenes is offering three types of internships within this campaign:
 
 1. Invisible to Invincible Interns: raise awareness of youth homelessness in our Los Angeles, and advocate for potential solutions. In addition, interns will work with Jovenes staff to develop and coordinate new tools and activities to assist our clients and youth in our community overcome their personal cycles of homelessness and access the necessary resources for a better future. These interns also lead presentations and screenings of the Jovenes documentary. 
 2. Peer Healthcare Ambassadors: Obtaining health coverage is a priority for homeless youth, but navigating the healthcare system presents a constant challenge. Through partnerships with agencies that specialize in healthcare enrollment, Jovenes is able to create internship opportunities where our youth become trained in healthcare promotion and conduct youth focused outreach and education activities to help other youth receive the care they need. 
 3. Social Media Ambassadors: Create content through blogs, Facebook, and Twitter to create awareness for the Invisible to Invincible Campaign and the challenges faced by homeless youth.","This project has a chance to change the way LA sees and understands youth homelessness, and the ways homeless youth view themselves. By creating powerful content utilizing research, program-based data, and storytelling and utilizing the reach of social media, creative presentations, and strong partnerships, the #Invisible2Invincible campaign has the potential to help prioritize homeless youth as a population which needs every opportunity to succeed. 
 The young men housed at Jovenes come from a very diverse set of backgrounds and have many reasons why they are experiencing homelessness. We see youth who have recently immigrated to the US, youth recently released from jail, youth who have been institutionalized through the foster care system, LGBTQ youth who have been pushed out of their homes, youth with mental disabilities, youth leaving gangs, and a variety of ethnicities 
 Despite their differences, the youth (especially those who choose to participate in the #Invisible2Invincible Campaign) learn to see through what typically sets them apart and understand how to come together. Through Jovenes, youth learn that homelessness is just an experience that they are going through- it doesn’t define them or limit their dreams. This lesson exemplified in how youth begin to support one another, provide encouragement, and celebrate each other’s successes. Each of the youth has experienced times when they have been put down or made to feel invisible. By working together to tap into their inherent resiliency and strengths, they begin to feel Invincible and learn how to overcome their challenges in a positive and productive way.
 In addition to changing the narrative and raising awareness for homeless youth, this campaign can also make LA a healthier place to live today and in 2050 by advocating for increased permanent housing and ensuring at-risk and homeless youth have access to healthcare. Through Jovenes’ growing Continuum of Care, which is expanding to over 70 units of housing (including short-term shelter, permanent supportive housing, affordable housing, and subsidized rental units), we will be able to showcase the various ways our city can end youth homelessness through public/private partnerships. By creating youth-friendly healthcare outreach materials & presentations, this campaign can make the process for youth to enroll in healthcare a less daunting and more accessible opportunity.","On any given night, there are over 5,000 youth experiencing homelessness on the streets of Los Angeles. In the public schools surrounding Jovenes, we have learned that there are over 1,000 students who face housing instability. Although the youth we serve come from diverse backgrounds, common barriers to a stable future are found throughout our target population. The findings in our Research and Policy Report, titled From the Fringes - Understanding Homelessness Transition Age Youth in Inner City Los Angeles. This report identified four main challenges faced by homeless youth, which we are addressing through the campaign: 
 1. Barriers to safe, supportive, and affordable housing
 2. Challenges accessing basic benefits and health services
 3. Barriers to educational, professional, and economic development 
 4. Overcoming trauma and emotional illiteracy.
 
 The membership base for the campaign primarily comes from the young men Jovenes serves in our shelter programs and youth who have exited homelessness and moved into permanent housing. When working with homeless youth, we see that providing small stipends recognizes the immediate needs of our youth and values the commitment they make to this project. In addition, Jovenes will continue to work with partners and volunteers to create storytelling projects featuring the youth we serve in order to highlight their stories, raise awareness, and improve our youth’s sense and vision of themselves through art.
 
 Through this campaign, Jovenes seeks to provide internships and leadership development activities to approximately 20 youth each year. All youth are between the ages of 18-25, are currently or have recently experienced homelessness, and are predominantly Latino and African-American. We seek to have a broad impact through this campaign that could potentially benefit the thousands of youth who experience homelessness in Los Angeles each year.","In March 2014, the Invisible to Invincible Campaign began operating out of the brand new Wellness Center at the LAC+USC General Hospital, where we are able to engage in close partnership and youth development practices with the fifteen other organizations that are co-located at this facility. Basing these internships and activities out of the Wellness Center provides youth with valuable work experience in a professional setting. 
 Engaging with partners will be key to the success of the Invisible to Invincible Campaign. Partnerships are critical to advance our policy/systems change agenda, create additional opportunities for youth, and create storytelling projects. The following are key confirmed organizations and partners whom Jovenes is collaborating with to move this project forward:

We want to do three things for or with them during these visits:
 
 1. We will find out which science lessons they currently run without hands-on experiences due only to a lack of equipment and technical support.
 
 2. We will schedule the loan (delivery or pickup and return) of the necessary equipment items and technical support directly from our organization, if we have the equipment; if not, we will find feasible ways to obtain said equipment either by us for loan, or by the teacher to own.
 
 3. If the teacher has a storage space on campus that houses old science equipment that may be unknown or in states of disrepair, then we will identify and repair those items and show the teacher how to use them.","All over the country, disadvantaged kids sit through (or choose not to sit through) science classes where the major activities are pencil-pushing and page-turning. Our project will change this for over 1,500 students this year in Los Angeles. Next year, those same science teachers will continue to borrow our equipment; they will no longer need as much technical support, so even without funding we could manage to maintain the difference. 
 
 This means that one year of funding can bring hands-on lab experiences on a regular basis to over 1,500 new students every year. Kids will grow up learning science by doing, instead of only via the more passive, bookish routes. 
 
 Some of these kids will choose to pursue careers in science due to interests sparked by those teachers (our collaborators). LA will see a new generation of adults who have more awareness of science and the scientific method. Future generations will grow up with parents who foster an interest in science. Some of those who decided on careers in science will bring jobs in science back to LA, finding that LA has become a hotbed of science knowledge and technical skills. The market for informal learning opportunities will grow here, for the following generations. Innovation and invention will grow, solving problems using new technologies here. The low-income workforce will be replaced gradually by a high-income, high-tech one, mostly because of the hands-on science experiences that kids have had at school. The tech sector will keep on giving back to those schools, and those teachers will be accoladed and honored. LA will end up being the best place to learn.","Our project will benefit students at fifteen or more Title I LA public schools; thus, the specific LA population that will benefit from our work is the LA population of lowest economic means.","Without a budget, we have managed to work with five teachers at five different schools on a very limited basis over the past three years. Four of these five are confirmed collaborators (one of the five will move to a more well-equipped school where she may no longer require our services). This grant would empower us to increase our impact with our confirmed collaborators into greater significance for their students. The grant would also allow us increase the number of our collaborators by triple or more.
 
 Each collaborator brings two things to our project: first, each brings their own influence and responsibility over the science education of over one hundred students annually; second, each brings their own expertise and energy in hands-on science education, which we can share with other collaborators.
 
 This is an annotated list of three critical factors to our collaboration.
 1. The collaborator's personal professional interest and commitment to working with us: hands-on science activities are not necessarily part of a teacher's job obligations, and there is often extra time and effort involved up front; we can therefore only work with teachers who have a strong interest in engaging their students in this way.
 2. The collaborator's particular needs: we're looking for teachers whose classroom needs fit our skills, experience, and equipment inventory in order to maximize our contribution to each collaborator's work.
 3. The collaborator's accessibility: we've found that the teachers whom we can serve best are those at schools located near our staff, near bus lines that our staff uses, or near university campuses from which we can recruit volunteers.",0,

Futures has served hundreds of upper-division high school students who have gone on to higher education at twice the rate of their peers. Through partnering with creative organizations like TBWA\CHIAT\DAY, DDB, Ruben Postaer & Associates (RPA), The Phelps Group, GreyWorldWide, Muse Advertising, Saatchi & Saatchi and IgnitedUSA, the program has provided real world applications to college and career-bound initiatives within secondary public schools. Curriculum development and learning materials have been aligned with Common Core Standards with an emphasis on 21st century skills of creativity, communication, collaboration and critical thinking. Students enrolled in L.A. Futures participate in the program throughout their upper-division experience. Throughout their experience, students routinely attend sessions at the headquarters of the creative companies that serve as school partners. During these sessions, students engage in a comprehensive curriculum that imparts principles, techniques and tools for self-development in exciting new career roles. Mentored by industry professionals, students get an inside look at key projects from strategy through creative execution. They learn how business is managed and see how today’s creative professionals with across disciplines. Working in teams, students are also challenged to put their learning into practice by engaging with local nonprofits which become their clients. . For example, Dorsey High School senior class participants revamped promotional pieces for education, parenting and job training at Community Build, an inner city resource for underserved youth. In the end, students leave the program with increased social capital, practical tools, higher expectations and a clearer understand of the demands of today’s employer. We believe that L.A. Futures is a powerful link in the continuum of college-bound-to-career efforts at a critical time in their decision-making process.","California's leading educators are proponents of building smaller learning communities, such as ""pathways"" and ""academies"" which focus on broad industry themes, such as business and entrepreneurship, arts, entertainment and media, engineering and health services, et al.. In fact, this movement toward schools within schools is gaining quick momentum. Consequently, the Los Angeles Unified School District is showing marked interest in this model and work-based learning practices, in general. L.A. Futures is the connective tissue between the creative industry and schools and, as such, creates the dynamic partnerships that take it from theory to application. Jobs are the priority concern of our high school students. At the same time, creative companies in Los Angeles boast some of the most exciting career opportunities in which they're interested. Through direct exposure, the L.A. Futures program connects the dots for our students from where they are-to higher education-to the jobs they aspire toward. This makes learning exciting, real and tangible for them. L.A. Futures will help make Los Angeles the best place to learn in 2050 because our creative workforce will come for our own community--because the creative industry will be richer because of the multiple voices that are represented in its products and services--because industry will be able to meet diversity of employment goals--and because our workforce will be prepared and energized to shift culture through job roles and practices we don't even know the names of!","Participants of L.A. Futures mirror the ethnic and economic strata of local public school student populations. Current data describes our Academy student population as follows: 72.3% Latino, 9.6% Black, 10.1% White, 4% Asian, 2.1% Filipino and Pacific Islander, .04% Native Amer. & 1.9% mixed races. 67% of our students are classified as low-income and are eligible for the federally assisted free lunch program. By drawing from the current and future talent pool of our own community the creative industry is greatly benefitted if we bear in mind that 726,300 direct and indirect jobs, or 1 in 7 jobs, represent the human capital that vitalizes this industry.","Our confirmed business partner t confirmed collaborators are:

4102121,Health Care for 1 Million Uninsured Los Angeles Residents,Transforming Lincoln Heights by creating access to health services and nutritional food through new internal transportation networks.,Live,2014162,2014,,,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,"This project will create a framework to implement programs that address public health, connectivity, and maximizing local health infrastructure. The logistics will operate as two symbiotic initiatives: the “community hub” and the transportation network. Technology will also play a vital role. Mobile applications can facilitate the efficiency and integration of our programs. Using this technology, a user could purchase fresh produce located at the hub, track and easily access the shuttle service, and communicate with health service centers. This mobile app will also help to collect data, and create metrics of analysis.
 
 • Community Hub: 
 We envision an innovative entity that consolidates public services into a singular site. This hub will contain health services, a daily produce market (recently funded by USC), and a central transportation stop—the hub will be a point of ingress to LACUSC Med Center and throughout the community. Given the lack of access to fresh produce, we have already partnered with USC to create a weekly farmers’ market and daily produce market. Complimented by preventative health services, providing a consistent source of fresh produce will help a community that is vulnerable to nutritional diseases. As part of our comprehensive health program and effort to bring USC Med Center and Los Angeles County Hospital further into the community, we are partnering with the medical school to bring preventative health services administered by USC. Located on the same site, these services could include mobile testing units, health information kiosk, and an active residency/internship program.
 
 • Transportation Network: Lincoln Heights has internal gaps in transportation infrastructure, and barriers exist within the built environment that inhibit movement, access to public services, and connections to the larger network. To transcend these impediments and create a more robust system, we are creating a service network that connects the community hub, Metro Gold Line, the LACUSC campuses, and other underserved areas such as the Ramona Gardens Housing Projects. The community hub, therefore, becomes an emanation point to access supportive services, hard to access medical services, and the larger public transportation network. This program can be implemented quickly through local operators and become phased into MTA service.","In LA, mobility is an issue of equity. The size of LA has allowed a great diversity of people to live within its sprawl. The unsustainable compromise, however, is that this lack of density creates areas without adequate support. The result is that entire neighborhoods, often segregated by their socio-economic circumstance, are bereft of services and therefore vulnerable to poor health. In LA, access to transportation can define the health of a community. While the city is making improvements to the subway system, underserved neighborhoods need better pathways to connect to services and the larger transportation network. The LHHI model is designed to create access to health services, supported by community-based transportation and the concentration of public services. The Lincoln Heights’ demographics and risk factors are similar to many areas throughout East and South LA; the impact of creating independent nodes that support health would be profound. 
 
 This engagement reflects the disparate nature of the city itself. Within the sprawl, thriving diverse communities are isolated from one another. A healthier LA will be one that can move throughout the city with ease, within the neighborhood and beyond. If replicated, the underserved communities of Los Angeles will create nodal networks that overcome the disparities of access to health and healthy environments. Additionally, these nodes would generate investment and development, bending the built environment to service its most vulnerable residents. 
 
 Major health institutions will have a model for community engagement and accessibility that reflects the comprehensive care model mandated by the new Affordable Care Act. To wit, health care providers must institute preventative mechanisms to offset the unsustainable cost curve of treating chronic and endemic diseases prevalent in underserved communities. According to the American Public Health Association, 7 in 10 deaths in the US are related to chronic conditions such as obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease, which are often preventable. Shockingly, 75% of our health care dollars are spent on treating such diseases while only 3% are spent on prevention. 
 
 LHHI will target the nearly 40,000 residents in the neighborhood, supporting the population before the individual is affected. The project is designed to be replicated in similar conditions throughout the city.","The LHHI will represent a consortium of care providers, business leaders, and community partners that will drive holistic, community-based strategies for achieving a healthy, equitable, and sustainable LH. The initiative combines the best practices of an accountable care organization with a neighborhood improvement district to address simultaneously public health disparities and connectivity concerns. Its mission is informed by the alarming disconnect between the economic and spatial dominance of the LACUSC Med Center and the public health vulnerability of the community.
 In response to data describing the current condition in Lincoln Heights, it is apparent that a holistic development strategy would benefit the majority of the community. 
 
 48% - High School Graduation Rate
 46.2% - Experience Housing Burden
 $29.825 – Median Household Income
 65.8% - Federal Poverty Level
 
 Cross referencing the social determinants of health with the LH ethnographic data, the Latino and Asian/Pacific Islander populations are severely at-risk. The Latino population is at risk for metabolic, nutritional, and cardiovascular disease, while chronic hepatitis B and C are prevalent in Asian/Pacific Islander populations. Both are precursors for increased incidence of liver cancer. Untreated, these conditions can have serious health effects throughout a population. This project, however, is meant to reach beyond access to direct medical services and address the larger environment. The social determinants of health affect those in the population who are not necessarily sick, but do not have the resources to support healthy living and become vulnerable. These determinants are being increasingly recognized as interconnected. 
 
 Former Secretary of HUD, Shaun Donovan articulated this when describing new metrics for measuring housing affordability as factors of transportation costs, noting that for most families, transportation is their second-highest monthly expense after housing. This project will benefit the nearly 20,000 people who experience housing burden in LH who may not have the available resources to address health and transportation. Engaging quality of care on this scale will initiate a redistribution of resources that will affect other social determinants of health.","Citymart: is a tech company based in Europe that generates and disseminates “smartcity” solutions to governments and developers. We will contract with this forward thinking group to develop and license the mobile applications used our transportation and service networks. 
 
 LA PREP, LA KITCHEN: LA PREP will house incubator and training kitchens for local entrepreneurs and non-profits dedicated to social enterprise and culinary programs. These entities are confirmed partners and collaborators on our farmers’ market grant.
 
 Diabetes and Obesity Research Institute: DORI will provide medical and research expertise and design and administer the health metrics to measure success. DORI is located in Lincoln Heights and is familiar with the area, demographics, and health risks.
 
 USC Violence Intervention and Prevention Clinic: An early supporter of our initiative, Dr. Astrid Heger and the VIP work to create healthy environments and pathways to supportive services. Dr. Heger has acted as a consultant and facilitator within USC for the LHHI.
 
 UCLA-USC CENTER FOR POPULATION HEALTH AND HEALTH DISPARITIES: Like the DORI, this center is essential to facilitating and providing the best support for the public health of this population. We will collaborate with them to generate and analyze data, commission studies, and consult on strategy.
 
 EL ARCA: Provides essential services to the developmentally disabled population of Greater LA. EL ARCA operates a bus fleet to transport their clients throughout the city, which we may contract for our transportation network. We have worked closely with this group on the farmers’ market grant. 
 
 Clinica Romero: Another important community health center, as they conduct outreach to the Ramona Gardens Housing Project. We hope to learn from their experience and include them in the connectivity network.
 
 Arroyo Vista Family Health Center: Their services and presence will help to establish a wellness district along the Broadway corridor.
 
 LACUSC Med Center: The objectives of the LHHI, align with LACUSC strategic interests as it seeks to minimize costs and improve community relations.
 
 CITY OF LA: Aligns with many of the public health, transportations, and economic development strategies pursued by various city agencies. By pooling the resources of the city and health centers, the LHHI can promote the area as an ideal location for health targeted industry clusters and health infrastructure.",1,

We have built a coalition of local stakeholders and organizations, national resource partners, and public sector agencies. With capacity led by the Little Tokyo Community Council and our partners, we are recruiting volunteers to participate in research, arts and cultural activities, and civic engagement.
 
 Our innovative community-driven vision for Little Tokyo has gained national attention. Little Tokyo accepted an invitation to take part in the Clinton Global Initiatives-backed Target Cities pilot program – a two-year program of EcoDistricts, a national non-profit based in Portland Oregon that works to “amplify and accelerate district-scale community regeneration and create replicable models for next-generation urban revitalization” (EcoDistricts).
 
 As a grassroots, community-driven project, LTCC has created a Task Force, open to public participation, and a smaller Steering Committee working group. This structure provides a venue for community input and engagement to help shape the Cultural EcoDistrict concept, goals, and activities. Three work areas - Real Estate and Built Environment, Educational Initiatives and Community Engagement, and Arts and Culture – are defining tangible projects and outcomes for this two year initial workplan.
 
 These projects include pilot demonstration projects of cutting edge green infrastructure such as district stormwater retention and infiltration, district heating and cooling, ""living machine"" graywater filtration, landscaping, and a mini-solar electric grid. We are looking at enhanced green space, energy efficient buildings, and increasing walkability with complete and green streets. We are also engaging businesses and residents to implement water and energy efficiency measures, strengthening their bottom lines and household disposable incomes.
 
 We also seek to shift the behavior of the community in a way that resonates with community values. The Japanese concept of 'mottainai', which roughly translates out to ‘what a waste to shame’ or ‘too precious to waste’ is already a common cultural value in the community. We are taking the idea of 'mottainai' and using it to connect and engage the community to the work of Sustainable Little Tokyo, and exploring related arts and cultural programming.","Sustainable Little Tokyo is not just about creating a cultural ecodistrict in Little Tokyo, but also developing a framework for sustainability that can be replicated by other communities, neighborhoods, and cities. Through our groundbreaking approach that combines green infrastructure and initiatives with community organizing, arts and cultural productions, just and equitable economic development, we offer a model for other neighborhoods seeking long term economic, social, and environmental sustainability.
 
 As concerns over climate change continue to mount, global cities like Los Angeles must innovate policy, financing, infrastructure, and collaborative governance that reduces our carbon footprint and dependence on imported water and energy. We can also simultaneously improve public health outcomes, strengthen our local economies, and celebrate our rich cultural diversity. However, this future will take a tremendous amount of work, collaboration across many sectors, and leverage dwindling public resources with private capital investment. 
 
 We believe the Los Angeles of 2050 will have become a greener, healthier region one neighborhood at a time. We are just the first in what can be a network of interconnected neighborhood laboratories to discover new solutions, inspire future generations, and connect to our neighbors and our histories. 
 
 Neighborhoods along the Los Angeles River, along emerging transit corridors, and all throughout the region are struggling with questions and fears of gentrification and displacement. Without clear demonstrations and equitable public policy, Los Angeles just might tip back in the reverse direction of increasing greenhouse gas emissions, vehicle miles travelled, rising rents, and lost opportunities.
 
 At the neighborhood scale, the right approach can start to achieve the multiple benefits we are aiming for. Through district-scaled infrastructure, we can achieve water and energy efficiencies of 30-50% better than baseline. Businesses can join together with marketing and visibility as going green, saving money and attracting new customers. Residents and community members can come together and engage one another to share ideas about healthy living, saving resources, and improving their quality of life. Through the Little Tokyo Cultural Ecodistrict, we hope to demonstrate that we can accelerate the process of achieving the Los Angeles of 2050.","Like Little Tokyo itself, Sustainable Little Tokyo is both specific and broad, with overlapping layers. While there are direct benefits for those that live and work here, Sustainable Little Tokyo also serves the broader community and Los Angeles.
 
 At its most immediate, Sustainable Little Tokyo benefits Little Tokyo stakeholders – businesses, residents, nonprofits, tourists, and other community members. In building this Cultural Ecodistrict - with tangible environmental sustainability targets while retaining our historic and cultural context - we are working towards a future that preserves our sense of community, culture, and neighborhood while placing us squarely in the future of innovative environmental developments. By making our neighborhood greener, we make the lives of our residents, businesses, workers, and visitors healthier and vibrant. By preserving our cultural and historic roots, while focusing on the economic health of our community and in particular, small family-owned businesses, we maintain our distinct community identity.
 
 Because Little Tokyo holds a significant role and space in the larger Japanese American and Asian American communities, these broader communities will also benefit. Recognizing that Little Tokyo is more of a symbolic home than a residential home to most of the Japanese American community, there nonetheless remains a sense of urgency to maintain the community for future generations. Indeed, Sustainable Little Tokyo it is rooted in long-held cultural and community values passed down from generation to generation. We have integrated fundamental community values like 'Mottainai' (what a shame to waste), 'Kodomono tameni; (for future generations), and 'Banbutsu' (interconnectedness) into a contemporary environmental context.
 
 Sustainable Little Tokyo and the concept of a cultural ecodistrict is also something that benefits the entire city, region, and even the nation. Our groundbreaking and pioneering work can serve as a model to other neighborhoods, the city, and all across the country. Already public agencies have seen how Little Tokyo can serve as a place to pilot innovative projects that can be replicated across the region. Because the conditions of gentrification, development, and transportation planning in Little Tokyo are issues that are mirrored in marginalized communities across the greater Los Angeles region, we hope to create a model of sustainability in all the ways for communities to use for themselves.","The Little Tokyo Community Council is working with exceptional partners and collaborators. This project began with a small core of partner organizations developing a sustainability plan for Little Tokyo. It has grown to a cross-sectoral collaboration encompassing local community organizations and national resource partners.
  
 While many member organizations of the Little Tokyo Community Council are actively participating in this initiative, organizations providing committed key leadership include the Japanese American Cultural and Community Center, Kizuna, and Great Leap. These organizations provide deep cultural roots, a large and growing base of support throughout Los Angeles County, and staff and volunteer capacity.
  
 From the community development field, we are working with confirmed partners such as LTSC Community Development Corporation, Enterprise Community Partners, NeighborWorks America, the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, and the Low Income Investment Fund. These partners bring sophisticated understanding of real estate development and finance, equity and affordability, and capacity building. 
  
 From the environmental sector, our confirmed partners include Ecodistricts, the Natural Resources Defense Council, Global Green USA. These partners bring expertise around climate change, sustainability planning, and green technology.",0,
4102125,Block LA,1,Live,2014165,2014,,,1,1,1,1,1,0,,"In the next year, LA Community Garden Council will help an additional 150 low-income families grow healthy food in their neighborhood.","We envision a community garden network for Los Angeles where people of all ages live healthy, active lives in a clean environment by growing fresh food in their neighborhood. This network enables healthy lifestyles by providing access to healthy food and getting people outdoors exercising through gardening. It fosters the meeting of people from diverse cultures to share the best growing techniques in order to practice sustainable urban agriculture while growing sustainable communities. 
 
 In the next year, LA Community Garden Council will build three new community gardens in low-income neighborhoods to ensure that at least 150 families can grow their own healthy food in their neighborhood.","Within the first year, the three new community gardens will provide access to healthy food and exercise for at least 150 low-income families in LA County. Healthcare professionals are starting to recognize the need for a holistic approach to preventative care and a healthy diet and exercise are key components of this. From the existing LA Community Garden Council gardens, we have evidence that gardeners lose weight in their first year of gardening, which helps to prevent Type 2 Diabetes, cholesterol, hypertension, and heart disease. Gardening is relaxing and therapeutic and helps patients with mental illness. By getting children outdoors to garden instead of indoors in front of computer screens, we will help to create positive childhood experiences. We will encourage gardeners to walk, bike or take public transport to their community garden for their health as well as the community’s health.
 
 Building new community gardens creates a healthier environment for local residents. We will seek to have land leases that extend beyond 2050 and, preferably, ensure that the land is used as green space in perpetuity. Teaching organic gardening techniques, including composting and seed collection, will ensure that the garden is sustainable and it will lower residents’ exposure to unhealthy toxins. We will have rainwater collection systems in the garden to ensure the best water conservation methods are followed and to reduce dependence on imported water. We will plant trees around the perimeter of the garden to increase the tree canopy cover.
 
 By focusing on low-income neighborhoods, we will help families to reduce their grocery bill by growing their own food. Ultimately, this reduces the number of households living below the self-sufficiency standard, builds more resilient communities, and helps to reduce rates of homelessness. 
 
 We are confident that this three-fold focus on (1) access to healthy food and active lifestyles, (2) creating a sustainable environment, and (3) addressing economic concerns in lower-income neighborhoods will help to make LA the healthiest place to live in 2050!","Within six weeks of the completion of the new community gardens, at least 150 low-income families in LA County will directly benefit from eating the fresh produce that they are growing, based on each garden having 50 gardeners. As most avid gardeners know, a single harvest is often too much for your immediate family to consume and so you soon find yourself spreading the wealth and giving away tomatoes, zucchini, mint, and other edibles to your extended family, neighbors, school friends, and co-workers! 
 
 We are focusing on the Watts area of South LA for the new garden sites because of the immense need in this area where, according to the LA Times profile, the median household income is low at $25,161, the median age is young at 21 years (partly due to gang violence), household size is high at 4.0 people, only 2.9% of residents have a four-year college degree, and 38.9% of the households are headed by a single parent. 61.6% of the residents are Latino and 37.1% are black.
 
 There are currently 125 community gardens open to anyone in the community in LA County (this does not include gardens with restricted access, for example at schools, hospitals, or detention centers). Our goal is to build three new community gardens in 2015, four new gardens in 2016, five new gardens in 2017, and continue to build one additional new garden every year for the next 36 years. By 2050, there will be 863 community gardens in LA County. If each of these serves 50 families and the average family size continues to be 4.0, more than 172,000 people will benefit from growing their own healthy food in their neighborhood!","To acquire the land, we will partner with organizations including the LA Neighborhood Land Trust and the Trust for Public Land. We have worked with these organizations in the past and they bring expertise to the process of land acquisition.
 
 For the past 16 years, LA Community Garden Council has partnered with the LA Conservation Corps to employ youth from low-income neighborhoods to help with community organizing and construction of the community gardens. They bring skilled labor and efficiency in numbers. 
 
 We will continue to partner with the UCCE Master Gardener program to find knowledgeable and experienced teachers to lead our gardening classes. We plan to form new partnerships with healthcare professionals, especially nutritionists, to offer health programs in the community gardens.
 
 When there is surplus produce in the community gardens, we will continue to partner with Community Services Unlimited, a local organization that distributes fresh food through markets in South LA, selling produce at low prices in neighborhoods that are considered food deserts because of the lack of availability of fresh produce.
 
 Three factors that are critical to the success of these partnerships are (1) setting clear agreements and expectations in writing at the beginning of the partnership, (2) keeping channels of communication open and transparent throughout the project so that everyone is on the same page, and (3) debriefing at the end of the project so that we can determine ways to work together even better in future.",1,1,
4102126,Growing a Healthy Los Angeles,LAGetsThere is a regional storytelling campaign on mobility in Los Angeles County.,Live,2014166,2014,,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,"The National Partnership and LACBC will begin by hiring a media expert to oversee the creative direction and strategy for this regional mobility storytelling effort. The media expert will work with a team, including a photographer and videographer, to travel the county collecting stories and user-generated content. This media expert will also serve as the curator for both the professionally produced and user-generated content. We aim to have 100 professionally produced stories and hundreds of user-generated content, with both online and outreach event components. The stories will capture how, why and where everyday Angelenos travel, what they would change about transportation, and what they envision for the future of transportation in 2050.
 
 This effort believes in the power of Angelenos to shape the future of our region, in the multiplicity of how we actually move across the county. We are not, in fact, the ""car capital"" of the world when one looks at travel pattern data and numbers of car free households. The power to change this paradigm lies in using strategies inspired by ground truthing to capture stories and experiences from hundreds of voices across the Los Angeles region.
 
 Currently, these draft questions are:
 Where do you go? With whom?
 How do you get around?
 How do you feel when traveling in Los Angeles County?
 What’s your favorite regular trip?
 What transportation options do you imagine in 2050? How do you feel about transportation options now?
 If you had a magic wand, what one change would you make to transportation in LA?","Healthy communities require safe, equitable and accessible transportation, so that residents are able to access healthcare, housing, jobs, schools and other community destinations.
 
 The MyLA2050 report found:
 “The more we strengthen ties within families, between neighbors and across our diverse communities, the greater we can ensure that our regions provides a safe environment for all Angelenos,” and “We believe in the power of Angelenos to shape the future of our region.”
 
 This regional mobility storytelling effort seeks to get at the heart of those statements by creating space for inclusive and diverse narratives about mobility/sense of place. 
 
 This project aims to highlight how people across Los Angeles County are currently traveling and support a shared vision of not only regional success for mobility, but empathy and compassion for travel needs of all users—all ages, abilities and income levels. These stories can reframe the narrative on mobility in LA by Angelenos themselves, from their own experiences and hopes. By infusing important transportation policy conversations with real experiences from people throughout the region, particularly in traditionally underserved communities like Central, South and East LA, the Gateway Cities and San Gabriel Valley, we hope to unite diverse perspectives around common themes and galvanize support for a transportation system that improves safety and independence for all.
 
 Los Angeles County invests billions of dollars annually into its transportation network, thanks to repeated voter support of local sales tax measures that generate two-thirds of our transportation funding. Metro, the county’s transportation agency, is currently considering a countywide transportation ballot measure for 2016 that will fund a specific lists of projects to be finalized by the summer of 2015. The story we tell over the coming months about mobility will directly inform the projects funded by the measure and the narrative used to sell it to voters. If we are successful with this project, billions of dollars in the next tax measure could be available for walking and bicycling. Any future measure will literally build out Los Angeles County’s 2050 transportation system, so the policy decisions made in the next year will impact the built environment for decades to come. It is imperative that the narrative about this measure be inclusive of diverse community needs and accurately reflect the mobility solutions Angelenos desire.","This project will benefit those whose voices, needs and experiences who are not being reflected in current mobility policy and investment decisions for Los Angeles County. These voices are students, seniors, lower income workers, pedestrians and bicyclists--people who have important places to go, but may not happen to be commuting to work.
 
 Over the past two years, the National Partnership and LACBC have been supporting the Los Angeles Active Transportation Collaborative as a way to engage stakeholders in Los Angeles County to discuss the current policy and finance landscape for active transportation in the region. From public agency staff, elected officials, school districts, community-based organizations and other partners, we have consistently heard that the current lack of supportive policy, local revenue and a regional planning and finance strategy are all barriers to greater investment in walking and bicycling, despite overwhelming need and interest in our communities. Most recently, in the summer of 2014, the Los Angeles County Active Transportation Collaborative engaged over 60 partners across the County to encourage Metro to support the development of a clear investment strategy to guide county transportation policy and investments aimed at creating a multimodal system that serves all users of our transportation system.
 
 Many transportation conversations in the Los Angeles Region currently lack measurable goals for transportation and health in Los Angeles County and therefore do not provide an understanding of how alternative investment strategies could yield different outcomes related to mode shift, increased transit ridership, land use patterns or public health. This project would directly support addressing that gap by providing a professional campaign rooted in county transportation data trends for all trips and community and individual mobility stories of needs and aspirations. Ultimately all our policy work needs to be founded on real people with real transportation needs. Our region’s transportation policy has largely lost touch with this reality.
 
 With so much attention on efforts to repair city sidewalks, revitalize the Los Angeles River, expand CicLAvia, connect neighborhoods to transit and provide students with safe routes to school, this storytelling effort can weave these individual visions into a broader narrative, leading to smarter investments that improve mobility for people of all ages and abilities.","Safe Routes to School National Partnership (confirmed)

4102127,Seeding STEM at LA County Alliance for Boys and Girls Clubs,Seeding STEM is a collaborative education program for middle school aged youth developed by ELAC and the Jaime Escalante Math Program,Learn,2014167,2014,,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,"The curriculum was created by East Los Angeles College instructors in alignment with common core standards for a pilot program which ran from February 25 – May 22, 2014 with six LA County Boys and Girls Clubs serving 120 youth. The curriculum and staff training have been recorded and are ready to roll out to all clubs over the course of the 2014-15 school year. Funding will supply staff training, equipment and materials for the project-based learning projects (participants build a motorized toy car with electric gears, gliders that demonstrate the relationship between force and motion, gravity cruisers, and fuel cell vehicles). The West San Gabriel Valley Boys and Girls Club, a LACABGC member organization, will facilitate the training and tracking of program deliverables and participating clubs will be responsible for providing staff, space and 11-14 year old members interested in participating in this transformative engineering design experience. A STEMFest at the end of the twelve week program provides an opportunity for participants to show off their projects with peers and community stakeholders throughout the county.","Careers in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) are rapidly on the rise. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce by 2018 STEM jobs will have increased by 17% over ten years as compared to 9.8% growth for non-STEM jobs. In addition, STEM workers tend to earn 26% more than their non-STEM counterparts. Despite all of this growth, as a country, we are failing our youth in terms of preparation for STEM jobs of the future. The United States is ranked 49th in the quality of science and math education and only 16% of American high school seniors are proficient in math and interested in a STEM career. In order for the United States and specifically Los Angeles to remain a global leader there must be a shift to bridge this gap.
 
 Middle School is a vital time for young people. Kids are deciding where they fit in and what excites them. Capturing their interest in STEM at this age (11-14) encourages continued studies STEM courses in high school and college and post graduation career paths.
 
 Additionally, minority young people are at a statistical disadvantage for quality STEM education and are disproportionately represented in the Boys and Girls Clubs of LA County (2012 US Congress Joint Economic Committee report on STEM Education). The opportunity to serve and inspire Boys and Girls Club members through STEM opportunities supports the county’s workforce development needs for the future as well as fulfills the Boys and Girls Club mission to enable all young people, especially those who need us most, to reach their full potential as productive, caring, responsible citizens.","Over 500 youth members of Boys and Girls Clubs in Los Angeles County (see list below, 20 members and two facilitating staff per club) will directly benefit from participating in Seeding STEM as will the professional staff and volunteers trained to facilitate the program. Indirectly, the surrounding schools and communities will benefit from engaged kids in the classroom and neighborhood inspiring their peers towards STEM fields of study.

4102128,Project: SCHOLARS - empowering college and college bound students of all ages to succeed,creating pathways to and through higher education with financial and emotional support,Learn,2014168,2014,,,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,Long Beach,"In order to increase college graduation rates of low-income students living in Section 8 and Public Housing, the CDF will continue operating its longstanding HAR Scholarship program. This program has been in operation for 17 years and awards college and vocational training program students with scholarships up to $1,000. By 2019, the CDF plans to increase scholarship size to up to $2,500. Scholarship awards are disbursed to students throughout the school year based on meeting academic milestones. 
 
 Additionally, the CDF will continue to implement and expand the College to Career Mentorship program. This program was launched in 2014 and matches college students of all ages with a mentor that is currently working in their field of interest. The one-to-one relationship is meant to give students an opportunity to learn firsthand about their career field, build their network, and receive strategic career planning advice in a supportive environment. Most mentors are first-generation college graduates that are eager to share their experiences with students. Each mentor pair is expected to meet at least 4 times per year, including one mandatory job visit.
 
 Beyond these two currently operated programs, the CDF will take the baby shower model and start hosting College Showers. These events will celebrate the milestone of attending college and prepare students with financial and emotional support needed. Not only will students receive needed school supplies such as USB flash drives and extra-long bed sheets (for those living in dorms), but also with advice from college graduates. Similar to baby shower, the College Shower will be family oriented and provide a launching pad for student achievement and a rare opportunity to celebrate this important milestone.
 
 To fully implement these three components, the CDF will hire an Outreach Coordinator responsible for recruiting, outreaching, and creating a community for students and mentors. In total, the Coordinator will have a case load of approximately 250 people include students, parents, and mentors.","Project: SCHOLARS will make Los Angeles the best place to learn today by creating an equitable learning environment that all students regardless of income and background can expect to succeed. WIth both financial and emotional support, students will be engaged and posed for success. Additionally, Project: SCHOLARS will make Los Angeles the best place to learn in 2050 by removing the old stigma of Housing Projects being a place for drugs, crime, violence, and fraud. Rather those living in poverty will have the same chance and expectation to succeed academically and in their career as their higher income counterparts because they will have the positive role models as proof. If the least among us, those that have the greatest challenges, can succeed then all of Los Angeles can succeed!","CDF and Project: SCHOLARS benefit a specific sub-population of the Los Angeles Community: low-income housing residents, that is Section 8 and Public Housing residents. In Los Angeles County there are over 100,000 families enrolled in one of these two housing programs. This target population is made up of some of our region’s most disadvantaged youth and families that struggle from more than poverty. The vast majority of low-income residents are economically unstable and vulnerable and have also dealt with extreme adversity such as being formerly homeless, transition age youth (TAY) leaving the foster care system, victims of domestic or sexual violence, physically or mentally disabled, among other challenges. A particularly unique aspect of the CDF’s target population is that there are no age limits, and in fact, the CDF encourages adults to return to higher education. The CDF believes that while it is important to support youth transitioning from high school to college, supporting adults (especially adults with children) can be challenging but is also important to ending generational poverty. Parents returning back to school have the opportunity to not only improve their lives but also the lives of their children. Without Project: SCHOLARS, our clients are at-risk of being stuck in the vicious cycle of generational poverty.
 
 Although direct services are provided to low-income housing residents, the ripple effects of Project: SCHOLARS goes well beyond the individual participant. While the students receive the direct benefit of financial and emotional support as they persist through college, their family and the greater community gains a new positive role for educational excellence, perseverance, and resiliency as well.","The CDF will work with the Housing Authority of the County of Los Angeles (HACoLA) to implement Project: SCHOLARS. This partnership is confirmed and longstanding. The benefits of working with HACoLA is the ability to work directly with site staff to access residents that are college-bound or current college students.

4102130,Los Angeles Drama Club: A Creative Home for Young Shakespearians to learn create and grow,"Art saves lives. The youth in our community need a safe space to create, play, and grow as young Shakespeare scholars and performers.",Learn,2014169,2014,,,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,,"We are determined to have our own space within the next three to five years, but this grant will allow us to make it happen in one year. We have already begun to move forward!
 
 We are researching available space on West Adams, Washington, Venice, Jefferson, and Crenshaw, and have already targeted two possible properties. In addition, we have a working relationship with the City of LA and its relevant representatives on this matter. 
 
 We have a strong relationship with the West Adams and MidCity Neighborhood Councils and have built much support for this endeavor in District 10. 
 
 We will choose a building that will benefit the needs of LADC and the local community. Our location will be specifically chosen to cater to local schools and it will be centrally located in relationship to the communities we serve, establishing ideal proximity to our students and further simplifying, if not eliminating, transportation challenges. 
 
 We are establishing relationships with other artists and programs to whom we will rent space - benefiting our children, by giving them the opportunity to interact with working artists and professionals in the LA community, and the artists, who will have a safe and inspiring place to work. 
 
 We have secured volunteer professionals: IATSE LOCAL 33 trained stage technicians who will set up the performance space and help transform the space into a true “Arts Center” - free for the children of Los Angeles. 
 
 We will then hold an Opening Fundraiser in the New Space to bring awareness to our programs, to our mission, and to our communities. In future years, the space will host our star-studded Annual Gala Benefit (celebrities perform with our students as scene partners in excerpts from Shakespeare’s plays) again helping bring awareness to our organization and to the neighborhood.","We are the nation’s youngest Shakespeare Troupe and have had great success in creating a lens through which our players view Shakespeare’s plays, and discover a rich world that has immediate relevance in their lives. We are passionate about guiding our students on a journey to confidence and self-discovery. Some of our students come with dyslexia, ADHD, Asperger’s Syndrome and other learning & social challenges. Traditional school has not served these children well, but theater offers a learning environment that allow children with different strengths and learning styles to work together to create magic. 
 
 Come to one of our shows - you would be stunned to learn that the boy who is bringing the house down with his antics was too shy to speak when he first came to class. The child who is nimbly navigating the verbal twists and turns of that monologue had a hard time deciphering a single line just 14 weeks ago. The girl who is fighting for her character’s objective with focus and commitment has severe ADHD - after years of battling over lost homework and books left here and there, her parents have told us that she always knows exactly where her Shakespeare folder is. 
 
 During their time with us, students become intimately acquainted with as many as over a dozen of Shakespeare’s plays. We discuss and decipher and debate the morals and life messages for which Shakespeare is famous - imagine what will happen to our city as these children are let loose, and become the civic leaders of tomorrow. 
 
 We know, first-hand, the magic that theater can work. We also know that, within LA, there are communities that do not have the financial resources to experience to the cultural, educational, and artistic treasures of LA. The Los Angeles Drama Club serves as an access point for the youth of Los Angeles, and opens their eyes to the possibilities. We ask for the children’s participation, not only as performers in our Shakespeare productions, but as citizens in our community. As a parent recently wrote, “We are truly grateful for the chances you have given our son. He always came home excited about what he had learned. Thanks to you, a whole new world has opened up to him.”","We help children in Mid City, West Adams, South LA and beyond. While our primary focus is Los Angeles’s District 10, families bring their children from Inglewood, Compton, Lennox, Leimert Park, Norwalk and San Pedro. In our current neighborhood, there are few walkable community centers, active arts programs, or central merchant-lined streets. Yet, there are hundreds of youth on the streets who need a productive and safe way to spend their time - these children are our target. 
 
 According to the LA Times, the median household income in our target area is around $40,000, and the percentages of households that earn $20,000 or less and $20,000 to $40,000 are high for the county. Only about 20% of residents 25 and older have a four-year degree, and about 30% of families are headed by single parents. 
 
 These statistics paint a picture of a typical family that does not have a lot of disposable income to spend on enrichment programs, a parent who may not have first-hand experience with the benefits an arts education can provide, a parent who does not have the freedom and flexibility to chauffeur children across the city. These families are our target.
 
 There is no better way to explain the benefits of our organization, than to share with you some of the things our families have to say:
 
 “We are a low-middle class family, and there isn’t a lot of support when you’re in the middle. The fact that the classes were free allowed my daughter to experience this life-changing program while we focused on keeping the lights on at home.” 
 - Myshell Tabu, parent in Mid City.
 
 “L.A. Drama Club is an extraordinary organization that introduces kids to Shakespeare, not by dumbing it down or ""kid-ifying"" it, but by actually teaching the young actors to understand and interpret the text.” 
 - Dee Dee Cooper, teacher in Mid City.
 
 “You can see the impact that it has on the youth simply by witnessing a rehearsal, workshop, or performance. Bringing Shakespeare to Los Angeles youth is not only great for the children, it's great for Los Angeles and our arts community. This is a professional and passionate project of the heart that deserves your support.” 
 - Scott Fifer, Go Campaign","We have been sharing space and “playing well with others” for 9+ years. As we move into the next phase, we feel our organization will be best served by having the freedom and independence to make the artistic and administrative choices that will best serve our students, rather than making compromises that best serve the groups with whom we have shared space. 
 
 That said, we are drawing on the expertise of the following individuals: 
 
 Real Estate Professional (this individual has not been confirmed, though we are in discussions with three people) - Having a knowledgeable “eye” on the areas we are targeting will help insure that we are made aware of all appropriate spaces that become available. Three factors critical to our success:
 - An extensive knowledge of the real estate in our target area.
 - A passion for improving our communities.
 - An ability to think creatively about alternative space. We don’t expect an actual theater to become available, so we need to work with someone who can see the possibilities. 
 
 Stage Specialist (Dante Larsen, IATSE Local 33) - Dante will be instrumental in designing the performance space to be cost-efficient, environmentally-friendly, and above all, safe. We have been working with him since the beginning of our organization. Three factors critical to our success:
 - Extensive knowledge of stage construction and lighting set-up
 - A passion for helping young people succeed
 - A network of stage professionals to draw on for volunteer labor
 
 A remarkable characteristic of our organization is the enthusiasm it incites in those who discover our community: we have had many parents, friends, associates, fellow artists, community leaders, neighborhood councils, local merchants, and independent business take interest in our children and our mission. With our own space, we look forward to embracing more of the people who are interested in being a part of LADC. We envision a creative learning community and look forward to welcoming other like-minded organizations to our space, as we have been welcomed in our past, and giving them a place to grow.",0,
4102136,hello,Creating a healthy and sustainable LA through research and leadership development.,Live,2014171,2014,,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,"LASC will implement this idea through the following activities:
 a. Senior Fellows: Hire four temporary or part time “Senior Fellows” to be managed and coached by LASC Board and staff to oversee research and programs under each initiative area. Senior Fellows will be young professionals or graduate students, with demonstrated interest in Southern California sustainability issues. Each Senior Fellow’s job description is as follows:
 i. Perform continual oversight over multiple Research Fellows.
 ii. Identify and propose outreach and advocacy campaigns to advance each initiative area.
 iii. Work with current partner organizations and agencies to identify next steps, outreach opportunities, and additional research needed.
 iv. Identify/draft at least two new research ideas per initiative, network with potential partners, and solicit student interest.
 b. New Leaders in Sustainability (NLS)
 i. The NLS Program will fill a critical need in Southern California by helping train, empower, and launch new leaders within the environmental community. This would be the region’s first program of its kind. The NLS program will provide participants with access to leading industry experts, policy makers, and advocates; opportunities to attend and participate in policy briefings with regional stakeholders; and professional mentoring. 
 ii. NLS will provide participants with: 
 1. access to experts , policy makers, and other professionals; 
 2. one-on-one mentoring opportunities; 
 3. access to leadership and advocacy training seminars and meetings; and 
 4. an opportunity to organize policy/community briefings in collaboration with partner organizations. NLS participants will be selected from applicants with demonstrated interest in local sustainability and environmental advocacy. 
 c. Organizational Development
 i. Expand awareness of LASC’s mission and impact through increased education, fundraising, and public outreach
 ii. Support a 2-day strategic planning workshop for LASC Board, staff, and partners to 
 develop and start implementing new 5-year strategy. This will allow us to analyze our growth over the last 5 years and identify how best to advance LASC’s mission and sustainability in Los Angeles in the future.","LASC’s mission is directly in line with the goals and metrics of LA2050. We are not only making LA the best place to live, but also to play, connect, create, and learn today and into the future. We prepare our region’s future leaders with the tools and guidance needed to transform LA into a place with low obesity rates; clean air and water; access to local and healthy food; and plenty of green space Furthermore, our collaborations with academia, local government, non-governmental organizations, private businesses, and community groups, create invaluable partnerships which attract young and up-and-coming researchers and thought-leaders to Los Angeles’s growing environmental movement. By doing so, we will encourage innovative thinking, creative solutions, and exciting new partnerships to ensure LA will be more sustainable in 2050 than ever before.
 
 To date, LASC has funded and coached 17 graduate Fellows to research emerging, current, and local environmental issues. Each Fellow is required to identify opportunities to use their research to educate the public and advance our initiatives. Current projects include research on how to improve local food policy, create ways (including using alleys and freeways) to increase the number of urban parks, and identify best practices to conserve and protect water resources. Previous fellows identified how to reform parking policies, increase biking, and minimize air pollution exposure through urban design and traffic management strategies. Additionally, Fellows identified specific strategies emergency response and coastal agencies ought to employ to prevent and address the threat of a major oil spill off our coast. 
 
 All of our past and current Fellows’ research helps make LA the best place to be today and in the future. In the next year, with your support, LASC will create four new quality entry-level LA-based green jobs, fund 8-10 new research Fellowships, and pilot our New Leaders in Sustainability Program, which will provide our region’s future leaders with the tools and guidance needed to make LA the healthiest place to live by 2050. By then, LASC will have supported hundreds, if not thousands, of student research Fellowships, provided working experience and mentorship to our region’s young professionals, and training new sustainability leaders to make LA a healthy and vibrant environment. Additionally, LASC will lead the nation with the original model and headquarters for numerous Sustainability Collaboratives.","Over the next year, expanded LASC operations will benefit current fellows, a new class of 12-15 NLS participants, as well as LASC’s current and future partners and staff, which includes 4 Senior Fellows and 8-10 Research Fellows. With your support, LASC will create original research and policy recommendations, which will advance our initiatives and benefit all those who live, work, learn and play in the City of LA. 
 
 Current Research Fellows, students at 5 southern California based universities, will benefit from expanded support to educate the public and advocate for change based on their findings. These projects include how to improve demand side water management, increase wetlands resiliency in the face of climate change, reduce air pollution through urban design, and create a revitalized network of green alleyways. Current partners include the LA Food Policy Council and South Park BID. 
  
 New hires, new fellowship recipients, and participants of the NLS program will receive a valuable opportunity to develop their careers by working with preeminent experts in their fields of interest, actively engaging and contributing to the missions of respected environmental organizations in the region, and making a direct and substantive impact.
 
 In the long term, your support allows LASC’s work to benefit Angelenos, and also helps LA continue to lead the nation with innovative solutions, best management practices, quality research, top environmental professionals, and a successful model to create a resilient, healthy, vibrant, and sustainable city.","LASC collaborates with professionals in academia, government and the non-profit sector to identify current and emerging environmental and sustainability issues that impact the Los Angeles region and pinpoint research needed to address those issues. We then partner with those experts to fund and guide student Research Fellows, to identify and advocate for solutions revealed through their research. Current partnerships include Los Angeles City Council District 7, UCLA Institute of Environment and Sustainability, UCLA Luskin School of Pubic Affairs, Los Angeles Food Policy Council, and South Park Business Improvement District.
 
 Future partnerships depend on which issues are identified through topics/issues we decide to address, and can vary accordingly. We are currently exploring opportunities to collaborate with the LA Unified School District to update their sustainability plans. Some organizations we have partnered with in the past and would do so again include: Los Angeles Waterkeeper, Environment Now, City of Los Angeles City Council, UCLA Luskin Center for Innovation, USC Center for Sustainable Cities, CicLAvia, Los Angeles River Revitalization Corporation, Environmental Defense Fund, Natural Resources Defense Council, California Center for Sustainable Communities, The Bay Foundation, Heal the Bay, TreePeople, and EarthJustice.
 
 Collaboration, as our name suggests, is the foundation of our work. Our mission to create a more sustainable LA cannot be done alone and we strive to establish long lasting relationships with leaders in government, nonprofits, academia, and businesses. 
 
 While we have yet to identify partners for this grant period, we expect they will be confirmed within one to three months after the grant is awarded. Three factors that are critical to the success of our proposed collaborations are 1) adequate funding to staff our initiative areas with Senior Fellows; 2) growth and expansion in the number of Research Fellowships; and 3) sufficient operational revenue to support growing staffing needs.",1,
4102142,Clothes The Deal: Dismantling Barriers to Employment,MEND provides medical services to local poverty-level people at no charge.,Live,2014175,2014,,,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,,"Through the volunteer health volunteers, it provides basic ambulatory, hypertension, diabetic, vision, women’s health, acupuncture and chiropractic care to adults. The Eye Clinic provides eye exams, glaucoma testing and prescription glasses free of charge to all patients. Vision services are also provided to children. When more specialized services are needed, the patients are given referrals to appropriate nearby facilities.
  While the MEND health service programs extend over the wide range of illnesses and treatments of young children through seniors, a significant percentage of MEND’s medical activity is extended to the diagnosis and the treatment of hypertension and diabetes prevalent in the dominantly Hispanic population of the northeast San Fernando Valley. Nearly one-third of the MEND medical cash budget is directed to diabetic medications. The MEND Medical Volunteers have designed and implemented a comprehensive medical program that provides health care to poor uninsured families living in the northeast San Fernando Valley. The group includes physicians, doctors of optometry, a doctor of chiropractic, an acupuncturist, nurse practitioners and RN's, 
  Through a Holistic Approach, the Medical Clinic provides health education and exercise classes, including specialty clinics for diabetes, hypertension, women’s health and healthy aging; and has recently launched a 4-month Weight Management Course, the objective of which is to educate obese patients on nutrition and exercise, in a culturally-sensitive manner while helping them adopt lifestyle changes that can help them lose the excess weight. Our plan is to rotate 15 patients every 4 months through the course with the goal of helping them lose 10 pounds or lower their BMI score by one point.","From its humble beginnings in 1971, MEND – Meet Each Need with Dignity – has become one of the most comprehensive and empowering poverty relief agencies in Los Angeles County, serving in thousands of individuals each month with a full range of services designed to meet basic needs and move recipients on to self-reliance. Named the 2012 California Nonprofit of the Year by the Governor’s Office, MEND, to better meet the growing number client applications, has strategically worked to expand its volunteer workforce to more than 5,300 individuals supported by approximately 31 experienced employees, who gave the equivalent hours of almost 95 full-time employees in 2013. On-going collaborations are part of this leveraged manpower, with more than 300 universities and colleges, businesses, nonprofit and government agencies and community groups regularly working in MEND departments. MEND has a reputation for exceptional management, emphasizing high quality and innovative service delivery.
 
 As we move closer to 2050, MEND can strengthen its abilities to provide health options for individuals and families and to break the bonds of hunger, disease, and poverty providing a future-serving as a pathway to self-reliance.","For over 40 years, MEND—Meet Each Need with Dignity has been providing services that meet the basic human needs of individuals, many Hispanic, who reside in the northeast San Fernando Valley. All of MEND’s clients are below the Federal poverty areas of Los Angeles County. Many of MENDS’s clients are “working poor,” often holding down several minimum wage jobs and spending more than 70% of their income on rent. Others are single parents with small children who cannot afford childcare to enable then to work outside the home and, thus, must rely on welfare. Still others are individuals who suddenly find themselves unemployed and without financial resources. While some clients live in government subsidized housing, a large percentage share the rental of a house with other families and many still live in garages, shacks, trailers or other forms of substandard housing. MEND is the largest and most comprehensive poverty-relief agency in the San Fernando Valley and makes a significant difference in the lives of 3,100 people who, in 2013, turned to MEND for medical help.","The following collaborators are confirmed, and we have worked together in the past. Each collaborator adds its own specialty to complete the quality of the various medical services provided. These collaborators bring three critical aspects to the success of the medical service on a day-to-day basis: 1) their specific expertise, 2) key necessary research and 3) in-kind work to help MEND provide full medical follow through.

Los Angeles Water Network: A digital platform to help solve our water crisis,Wouldn't it be good if streams that run from the mountains to the sea could again be connected to form a new river moving through our city?,Live,2014176,2014,,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,"Undevelopment One will be the pilot project for a hoped for network of Undevelopments that could, over time, create a paleo-botanical eavesment by redefining our historic flood plain. We have counted around 25 storm drains and about as many potential brownfields that are candidates for Undevelopment. By Undeveloping we mean pounding out unused tarmac and concrete and adding water and letting the land regain agency. Lauren Bon and The Metabolic Studio are about to break ground on a waterwheel which will bring LA river water back up to the city. When construction begins in early 2015, the Harrison studio is proposing that cores be drilled down to the Eemian, 115,000 years ago, in order to conduct the appropriate pollen analysis to locate the species that had once lived there. Undevelopment One would take one of several possible sites along the edge of the LA River, reconnect it to LA River water, and establish on that site a greenhouse inside which potential future plant ensembles would be grown and released in the larger environment, in small experimental sites over the years as the weather warms. Our hope is that inspired cooperation among land owners and agencies will allow remediation without necessarily owning and controlling the land. We hope to educate through Undevelopment One that Another City Is Possible, one in which we are connected by a common goal to see LA survive into the future with a limited water supply and warming temperatures and see water as a human right and a social commodity. We see this as a kind of utilitarian prophecy that is at the same time a botanical adventure.","It should be understood that both the Metabolic Studio and the Harrison Studio see the Undevelopment proposal as a new urban narrative. Climatologists predict that the climate experienced during the Eemian Age is close to that which we will be facing in 50-100 years. We note that many cities in the world, perhaps a majority, have profoundly mistreated their river systems. The model that the Harrison Studio and Metabolic Studio wish to put in place is replicable as cities around the world realize that a new way to justify their relationship to nature and the larger environment within which they are embedded has been made available. Our hope is that all artists, engineers, politicians, urban planners and visionaries network plans, funding and initiatives to address entropy rebalancing—meaning that all living systems move toward entropy, but that rate of that process in contemporary society, the stress on nature and on all our living systems is such that we can no longer think of any individual city but rather of collective actions that can rebalance entropy.
 
 “Artists Must Create on the Same Scale that Society has the Capacity to Destroy.”",The LA River corridor and the broader Los Angeles watershed and community,"Each Undevelopment project will be a public/private partnership requiring local, state, and federal agencies and private property owners to cooperate. Our team working on Bending the River Back Into the City is poised to assist with the implementation and have been confirmed: engineers from Geosyntec, landscape/construction professionals from Valley Crest, public affairs advocates from KindelGagan and climatologists from UCLA. The Metabolic Studio, in collaboration with the Harrison Studio, is applying for support for a pilot project for a network of Undevelopment projects.

  - Reach out to school administrators, councilors, and teachers, as well as youth group leaders from local churches and community centers.
  - Utilize our existing network of leaders to establish support partnerships
  - Establish a community of sponsors and collaborators
  - Work with teachers and school administrators to give school credit for ""Wellness Council"" membership
 Step 2: Invite youth to become part of Wellness Council
  - Through references from our partners
  - Visiting school sites
  - Use of community outreach collaterals
  - Social media
 Step 3: Staff will assist youth to identify the needs of their peers and train them in project planning
  - Weekly meetings of Wellness Council
  - Establish a framework to guide council in implementing events
  - Recruit guest leaders from local community
  - Develop time management, communication, teamwork, and additional skills needed for project planning and success in life
 Step 4: Youth will work with staff to plan and host free health/wellness/pro-social educational events

 Step 5: Staff will provide ongoing leadership training and mentorship to this growing youth community
  - Provide a curriculum focused towards each individual's needs
  - Staff serve as mentors and role models to the work groups
  - Local and community contacts establish a support network
 Step 6: Youth and staff will collaborate to evaluate and celebrate their accomplishments in learning to live, learn, create, and play in wellness-minded ways.","TODAY:
 Today, we know that activities that engage the body and mind have greater impact on what a person learns today but more importantly are retained throughout life. Our program empowers youth to embrace a life-long learning approach to health & wellness.Through education and discussion, this project will increase youth awareness that choices made today effect both present and later-life health and wellness. 
 Our focus will be based on MetroHealth Station's ""whole-person"" approach to health and wellness, which includes:
  PHYSICAL HEALTH
  - Nutrition and how it affects cognition, physicality, and exercise
  - Obesity prevention
  - Physical health and wellness
  ORAL HEALTH
  - The importance of oral hygiene
  - How nutrition affects teeth, tongue, and gums
  MEDICAL HEALTH
  - Diabetes prevention
  - Sexual and reproductive health
  - Nutrition, the immune system, and health
  - Medical health and wellness
  EMOTIONAL HEALTH
  - Anger management
  - Bullying/Violence
  - Sexual respect and responsibility
  - Self Esteem
  - Healthy Body, Healthy Mind (connection between nutrition/physical health and mental health)
  - Effective communication and listening
  - Comfort with one's self and with others
 
 We expect that our positive model of health and wellness will be associated with:
  - Creation of a sense of community and camaraderie within local youth
  - Reduction of gang participation by offering community and responsibility
  - Reduction in crime
  - Increase in school attendance
  - Reduction of violence and bullying
  - Reduction in teen pregnancy (increased awareness and practice of safe sexual practices, including abstinence as an option)
 
 2050:
 Over time, as students internalize the ideas and apply them to their own lives while helping others to adopt them as well, the effect will amplify. We see our project having long term goals of:
  - Reduction in overall gang presence
  - Reduction in drug use and overdose
  - Increased school truancy/dropout prevention
  - Instilling mindfulness of personal wellness, helping them to avoid joblessness, homelessness, addiction, and incarceration
  - Students' passing of skills they have learned to the next generation
 
 Successful implementation of this project will lead to its reproduction in other locations, spreading wellness and health across all of Los Angeles.","Health & wellness affects everyone! Each life stage from infancy, through grade school and high school to young and older adulthood is associated with health benefits and health risks. The Healthy Teens LA program will focus on the health of youth 12-17 yrs but teens will learn health information that will affect them, their friends and family, and the community.
 
 Specifically, we expect that our youth leaders will be health ambassadors for their own school. In addition, our youth leaders will be part of our community outreach activities used to recruit other youth from other schools.
 
 All youth participants will be involved in mentoring programs where older youth supervise younger students in lower grades. Our past programs sponsored with LAUSD Foshay Learning Center has taught us that youth are the best health advocates....especially for other youth and their families.","Confirmed partners include:
 
 SCHOOLS:
 LAUSD Foshay Learning Center - We have cultivated relationships with the local schools in the Southern LA area, with the strongest connection being with LAUSD Foshay Learning Center. This school, home to 1st through 12th grades, has partnered with MetroHealth Station on many occasions, ranging from a 5k fun run, to a very successful health education activity night. Foshay Leaning Center is a confirmed collaborator that will contribute students, faculty insight, advertising and outreach support, and organizational support. They will also act as a key contact point when we are reaching out to other schools to join in the project. Other area schools have expressed interest and agreements are in discussion.
 
 CHURCHES & NON_PROFIT PARTNERS:
 West Angeles CDC & the West Angeles Church of God in Christ - MHS is located on the northeast corner of W Jefferson Blvd and Crenshaw Blvd. The Church is not only our landlord but a supportive advocate for our work. West Angeles Plaza has been instrumental in our outreach efforts with the MetroHealth Station thus far, and will continue to collaborate with us on this project. The church of over 22,000 members, as well as multiple social outreach organizations and groups, has offered to publicize on our behalf, advertising in their church services, youth groups, and social outreach groups. The church is a hugely influential and well respected presence in South Los Angeles, and together we will be able to reach a very large and diverse population. Each day, more partners ask to join our efforts at building a healthier South LA.
 
 BUSINESS COMMUNITY:
 MHS is a member of both the Crenshaw Chamber of Commerce and Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce. Both chambers support our efforts and recognize the value that healthy youth become healthy workers. Our relationship with Foshay Learning Center was fostered though the Pillar ""Principal for a Day"" program. We expect continued support in workforce and youth development from our Chamber partners who we will involved in this project.",0,

Users can zoom around LA to see their community as it compares to other communities. 
 
 B. Inventory and geolocate water projects that are already occurring in Los Angeles. Research and outreach to organizations and agencies in the San Fernando Valley (for the pilot study) to gather information about water related initiatives. These projects will be uploaded to the mapping platform for users and other organizations to learn more about them and find out how they can get involved or work together.
  
 C. Design mechanisms for organizations to upload content (images, data, opportunities to volunteer or donate) for existing projects or to add new projects & content to the map.
 
 II. Test and improve the app: Pilot test in the San Fernando Valley
 Recruit residents and organizations in the San Fernando Valley to participate in a pilot program. Arid Lands Institute has already conducted significant research on the opportunities and constraints for projects in this area and is very active in this community. Using this network and research, we will test the viability of the program. Based on this feedback, we will work to improve it prior to launching city-wide.

In addition, climate change is expected to reduce the snowpack in Sierra Nevada by 25%, which is a key contributor to LA’s water reservoirs. LA currently imports 85% of its water. As population increases, we need to improve our efforts increase our local supply of water so we can be closer to water independence. 
 This proposal seeks to address the issues related to drought by means of raising awareness and creating incentives for citizens to become active in the solution. By providing a transparent interchange of information, this tool will encourage citizens to become active participants in larger scale sustainability interventions for the city. This tool will also highlight priority areas and opportunities for future projects that can help us work towards water independence by 2050.","This project will benefit the larger population of Los Angeles. By improving our efforts to increase our local water supply and reduce our water consumption at the neighborhood scale (as well as the city scale), we can work towards obtaining water security for the city as we grow in the coming decades.
 
 This project will also benefit the many organizations, agencies and non-profits who are working hard to solve our water crisis by providing them with a larger platform to showcase their work. By increasing transparency and providing a centralized platform for water-related projects, this work can be bolstered through a stronger network providing opportunities for sharing resources, getting volunteers, and getting donations to continue their work.

4102153,My Name My Story,MNMS is creating the next generation of Empathetic Leaders by taking our Inspire Empathy Days and School Club programs to schools across LA.,Learn,2014181,2014,,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,"MNMS currently has 20 school clubs in 4 states, most of which are based right here in Southern California. MNMS currently offers schools the opportunity to create MNMS School Clubs, host Inspire Empathy Keynotes, Leadership Days and Inspire Empathy Days to accomplish the goal of creating the next generation of “empathetic leaders.”
 
 With the support of LA2050, in 2014-2015 trained MNMS School Club Advisors will lead Inspire Empathy Days on school campuses, providing in-depth workshops that take students through the process of becoming a Changemaker. We believe that when youth talk to youth, they listen, so School Club Advisors and MNMS Founder 16-year-old Amit Dodani spend time training student leaders from within schools to take on leadership roles during the event. Students are exposed through interactive workshops and exercises to the skills of an empathetic leader: storytelling, teamwork, leadership and service.
 
 Inspire Empathy Days are supplemented by Leadership Training for School Club Leaders. What makes MNMS unique is that we provide an ongoing, student-driven vehicle to continue Inspiring Empathy on their campus and in their community. Each school club is provided with a Resource Guide and a School Club Advisor who is accessible for support year-round.
 
 MNMS’s goal is to provide the “Inspire Empathy Day” programming to as many schools as possible; however, not every school can afford the costs associated with the program. Financial support allows us to make this programming accessible to schools that may not otherwise have access to it.","According to Bill Drayton of Ashoka “those that don’t master empathy, will be marginalized.” We believe that MNMS can create future leaders who understand the skills of an empathetic leader at a deeper level. They are able to work in diverse teams, lead purpose driven organizations, and mobilize their own communities to identify and solve problems that they are passionate about.
  
 What if by 2050 we could have thousands of these changemaker stories originate from LA? Imagine a world in which youth are inspired by other youth. These young Changemakers will not wait to be given a fish, but will identify ways to fish for themselves.
  
 The lack of empathy is the root cause for many of the issues faced by today’s youth, like peer harassment and a high dropout rate. Research shows that more often that not, anti-bullying programs are ineffective because most students are neither the bully nor the victim. Additionally, the word “bully” has been used so much that students and faculty are almost desensitized to its implications. MNMS believes bullying to be the symptom, not the cause. Our aim is to solve the problem, i.e. the lack of empathy, by engaging the entire student body, faculty, and administration, as well as the local community. In order to create connectivity and unity, we believe we have to create a culture of empathy.
  
 Along with the impact of inspiring empathy in the student body, the MNMS program solves significant problems faced by our schools: a lack of leadership opportunities, a lack of connectivity within the student body itself as well as between students and teachers, and the lack of a relationship between the school and the surrounding community.
  
 MNMS School Clubs solve these issues by providing leadership opportunities to students that may not fit into the existing hierarchy of student councils and volunteer groups. Students are given the tools to take initiative and pursue projects that use their own passions to benefit their school and local community. “In-school” projects connect students with other students, as well as with faculty and administration. Community projects connect students through book drives, care packages, etc. to the people around them.
  
 We envision a 2050 in which everyone is moved to be a Changemaker in his or her community. By mastering empathy, Angelenos will be empowered to engage with one another and succeed in a diverse world in which people from different backgrounds work together to succeed.","The Los Angles community, schools, faculty, students and families are some of beneficiaries of the MNMS programming. 
 
 The support from LA2050 would allow MNMS Inspire Empathy Day programming in 2014-2015 to reach 30 new schools that may not otherwise have been able to afford it. This will directly impact around 7,500 students in the LA area and the indirect impact will reach thousands of teachers, students and citizens in Southern California.
 
 Additionally, local communities are impacted by School Club activities such as book/food/toy drives, care packages, clean-ups, etc. and our social media network allows the story of every Inspire Empathy Day to reach hundreds of young people all over the country and world, highlighting the changemakers of Los Angeles.
 
 Please invest some time and read the MNMS 2013 Impact Report to experience an example of what young MNMS Leaders have done around the country.

 Ashoka
 Peace First 
 Teach for America
 KIPP LA
 CADA
 These organizations are thought leaders in various focuses like empathy, peacemaking and education. Each one of them has added tremendous value to MNMS.
 
 At MNMS we believe in the power of collaboration and engaging the entire community; we partner with specific institutions in LA to connect kids to people in their local communities. For example, MNMS book drives run by school clubs in LA have partnered with the UCLA Olive View Hospital, the Van Nuys Library, the Platt Library, KIPP LA and other organizations and community centers to bring books to people in these communities, who may not have access to them. Other school clubs have read to children in local elementary schools, donated to shelters for at-risk youth, and made care packages for individuals in need- all relevant ways of connecting schools and students with members of their local community.
 
 We have partnered with Ashoka and Peace First. They have been content providers for some of our larger events- including the Social Entrepreneurship Camp for Young Changemakers- and continue to provide strong support for MNMS.",0,
4102164,Make A Choice Campaign,"Make A Choice Campaign, a youth-created & youth-led teen dating violence prevention & awareness campaign utilizing a multi-platform strategy",Learn,2014184,2014,,,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,,"Ongoing: Youth leaders have developed a Tumblr for the campaign and meet twice a month as a group to discuss its content, which is populated with a campaign overview, messaging, and user-generated photography. 
 
 The September-June 2014: The school wide distribution of campaign posters will begin in September shortly after the school session begins. The campaign posters’ hashtag will lead students to Tumblr, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter where students receive prevention education information—this includes monthly prompts to use an additional hashtag that expands the dialogue to include other topics related to teen dating violence and its prevention (i.e. #silenceisviolence is an opportunity to discuss the importance of speaking out against dating violence and a prompt to break the silence and stigma around these issues). 
 
 February 2015: The community wide print roll out (billboards, street posters, bus shelters) of the campaign will be implemented in February 2015. February is nationally recognized as Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month. This will afford the campaign heightened visibility, media coverage and prime opportunities to elevate the dialogue on teen dating violence and the promotion of healthy relationships. After several months of engaging youth on these issues, the campaign will widen to engage community members who are cued by the print campaign to connect online about how they can support youth and model healthy relationships.
 
 Ongoing: Youth leaders continue to participate in a weekly segment of The Beautiful Struggle on KPFK to speak about the issues impacting them, with a specific focus on preventing relationship violence. The teen dating violence PSAs they created will continue to run throughout the year, with heavy rotation in February.","This project will engage students and adult allies through creative outreach and social media strategies. Together; youth and those who care about youth, will create communities and campuses that promote safety, nonviolence and support for youth who have experienced interpersonal violence. The campaign empowers youth and provides them with tools to build healthy relationships, to prevent dating and sexual violence and to educate adult allies on how to support them in building lives free from violence. 
 
 Beyond educating youth and adults, the campaign’s call to action: Make A Choice will mobilize students, parents, educators and community members to support the implementation of LAUSD’s Resolution to Promote Healthy Relationships and Prevent Teen Dating Violence. This resolution was passed in October 2012 following the murder of Cindi Santana, a LAUSD student, by her boyfriend on their school campus. The resolution, which calls for the development of a district wide policy on how to respond to teen dating and sexual violence, as well as an across the board training for staff on these issues, is currently being piloted in three schools (a formal collaborative project between Peace Over Violence and LAUSD). This campaign has the capacity to garner attention for implementation across the entire school district, which will create systems change and ultimately, climates of safety and support for youth so that they can succeed on a social-emotional and academic level.","This project will directly benefit students of the Los Angeles Unified School District (over 671,000 students). Dating and sexual violence continue to impact youth in the U.S. at rates higher than any other form of violence in this age group. One in three adolescents in the U.S. is a victim of physical, sexual, emotional or verbal abuse from a dating partner— a figure that far exceeds rates of other types of youth violence. Additionally, young people, 12 to 19 years old, experience the highest rates of rape and sexual assault (U.S. Department of Justice-2009). Experiencing teen dating violence and sexual assault has severe consequences for youth; these forms of violence are associated with higher levels of substance abuse, violence, victimization, as well as lower school achievement. Dating violence victims present a strong, consistent pattern of exposure to, and participation in, a broad range of high-risk behaviors, including eating disorders, sexual risk behavior, pregnancy, and suicidal ideation. This project will support the development of healthy relationships and healthy lives for this target population at LAUSD schools campuses and surrounding communities.","Los Angeles Unified School District-confirmed
 Peace Over Violence has worked in collaboration with LAUSD since 1991, implementing its In Touch With Teens relationship violence prevention curriculum and youth leadership development activities throughout middle and high school campuses. POV & LAUSD are currently partners on a Department of Justice federal grant (STEP), piloting a violence prevention policy, campus wide staff training and response protocols in three schools in Highland Park, LA. This is the second largest school district in the U.S. and a key partner in engaging youth, parents, educators and stakeholders.

4102175,SCI-Arc/Habitat LA Housing Project,COPA transforms Physical Education into a fun and engaging experience for all elementary school children. Children love COPA PE!,Live,2014187,2014,,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"Project will benefit schools in Artesia, Long Beach, and 4 additional LA County communities that have not been selected.","Step 1: Identify Schools. We are currently identifying 6 urban public elementary schools that are located in lower-income communities within Los Angeles County (at the time of submission, 2 school districts are confirmed). We are selecting lower-income schools because historically, these schools have cut PE teachers from their budgets and have left PE Instruction to classroom teachers. The problem is that those classroom teachers have very little, to no training or experience in PE instruction or in outdoor classroom management skills. In the South Bay region of LA County, we have found that teachers in these communities are eager and willing to learn new techniques and skills to improve how they deliver PE. 
 
 Step 2: Conduct pre-assessment of Physical Education environment of each school campus. Present report of findings to school staff and parents.
 
 Step 3: Meet with teachers at the school to recruit them into the program. Over our 11 year history, we have found that teachers are more engaged and supportive when it is a voluntary program. Our experience is that 90% of teachers at a school do in fact volunteer to participate in the COPA program.
 
 Step 4: Conduct a large group teacher training at each participating school. Training will include laying out program expectations, introduction to web-based COPA support system, and having teachers play PE games, so they can be reminded of the joy of play.
 
 Step 5: Begin one-on-one peer coaching with participating teachers at each school. Over the course of the year, each teacher and their students will receive 4 individually tailored, outdoor, peer coached PE sessions.
 
 Step 6: Provide individually-tailored technical assistance to launch events/activities to promote PE/physical activity on campus. We will work with the school wellness committee, parents, teachers, students or any other stakeholder interested in physical activity – and provide technical assistance to improve the culture of PE/physical activity on the school campus. In the past, examples have included, launching a Walk to School Day event, creating a one-day Cardio-Carnival for students, designing a rainy-day schedule that still allows for PE instruction, training student leaders on organizing PE equipment. 
 
 Step 7: Conduct post-assessment of PE environment at each school. Provide report on improvements made during the school year and recommendations for future. Present findings to school and parents.","Decades ago, parents felt safe letting their children run freely in their neighborhoods, being active for hours before being called inside for dinner. That was the norm. Today, it simply isn’t happening. Right now, many if not most urban public elementary school children in LA County are NOT getting a chance to be active. In the communities COPA targets, parents just don’t feel safe having their kids run freely in their neighborhoods. On top of that, their children’s schools have cut their PE budgets, so children really can go days before they participate in any kind of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. 
 
 COPA can change this for children. Today, COPA can make LA the healthiest place to live by reintroducing PE into schools in a fun, interactive, and all-inclusive way. It gives classroom teachers – who otherwise would be intimidated and unprepared – the tools and skills that they need to teach PE. It gives children an opportunity to learn proper movement skills and create a culture of activity within their own lives. COPA makes LA the healthiest place to live today because it teaches children – at a very young age – lifelong movement skills and the joy of being active. 
 
 COPA makes LA the healthiest place to live in 2050, because by then it will have created a generation of adults who will view daily physical activity as the norm. By 2050, COPA children today will be raising children of their own. They will have the expectation that their children will have PE instruction every day and they will instill this expectation in generations to come. By 2050, childhood obesity will no longer be an epidemic. The rates of childhood obesity will be so low that looking back, we will be shocked that we ever even allowed the rates to have been so high!","Students’ enthusiasm for COPA PE is an eye-opener for teachers. They are able to interact with their students in a different, more relaxed setting than the classroom – through play! COPA means no one is waiting in lines and everyone has a piece of equipment, so there are fewer behavioral issues, which equates to higher motivation for both students and teachers. COPA is a positive PE experience for all.
 
 In COPA, children in grades K-5 learn developmentally appropriate movement skills, personal responsibility, how to stay safe while playing, how to assess their own exertion, respect for others, cooperation, and teamwork. Schools that have been in COPA for several years, report decreases in childhood obesity and independent evaluations of the program across multiple school sites show that COPA increases the time children spend in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) during a PE lesson.
 “COPA taught me the value of exercise and how to make it fun…I feel that COPA has been a great addition to the school”.--Ray, 5th Grade COPA Student
 
 Elementary school teachers benefit from the personal one-on-one peer coaching from a Providence Little Company of Mary Medical Center (Providence) PE Specialist. 150 teachers will receive COPA’s PE curriculum (aligned with California PE Standards), have access to their school’s new PE equipment, the COPA website, and will receive instruction on developmentally appropriate motor skills and outdoor classroom management. Working with their Peer Coach, they observe, co-teach and then independently teach the PE lessons.
 
 COPA helps teachers meet the longstanding state law in California of 200 minutes of PE every 10 days – an achievement that most schools are not reaching. COPA results show that there is an increase in the number of teachers who are confident in teaching PE and an increase in instructional time devoted to PE instruction. COPA also helps teachers achieve national standards of excellence in Physical Education instruction by making sure that at least 50% of their PE lesson is spent in MVPA.
 
 “The COPA Peer Coach Program made me a better PE teacher. I learned that although PE is an activity and ""fun"" for students, it needs to be taught just as if I was teaching a math lesson in the classroom. I learned once students are given the exact steps to be successful they have more fun which makes teaching PE fun for me.”--COPA Teacher","Providence will partner with 6 LA County elementary schools that have never had COPA, serve children who live in lower-income communities, have high rates of childhood obesity, and that don’t currently offer systematic implementation of Physical Education. Two partners are confirmed - John F. Kennedy School in Artesia (part of the ABC Unified School District) and Robin Samana, Director of Elementary and K-8 Schools at the Long Beach Unified School District to identify schools in the LBUSD. We are in discussions with additional schools to confirm more sites. The “added benefit” that the participating schools will bring is that they are ready and willing to make a change within their school to improve student health.
 
 Three factors are critical to the success of our partnerships with participating schools. 
 
 1. Principal support. The Principal supports and encourages teachers to participate in this voluntary program. They need to create an atmosphere that supports PE as an added benefit to teachers – something that will keep their students more focused and that can improve academic achievement – rather than an added burden to the teachers’ schedules. 
 
 2. Teacher buy-in. We introduce the program to teachers and design a peer coach training schedule that accommodates their teaching schedule. 90% of teachers voluntarily enroll; 90% of enrollees complete the program. 
 
 3. Relationships between the teachers and the Peer Coach is critical to success. COPA teachers report high satisfaction with their relationships with their Peer Coach. A focus group of COPA teachers across 3 school districts agreed that the most significant factor in changing their instructional practice related to PE was their peer coach relationship. This is a direct result of the PE Specialist setting a tone of trust and openness. We know that most classroom teachers have little to no training in PE; we know that most teachers are apprehensive about taking a group of 30 kids outside with the expectation of teaching age-appropriate motor skills; and we know from our 11 years of experience that there are teachers who have their own personal memories of PE that are not so positive and that definitely don’t motivate them to teach PE themselves. The peer coach takes all of these factors into consideration, is able to work individually with the teacher and their students and build a relationship of trust and mutual respect that overcomes these barriers to teaching PE.",0,

Implementation of its services is ongoing throughout the year. The NEP is led by Maria Paz Quiroga, M.S., R.D., Nutritionist, and available at all three of SCC’s sites, name the Beverly Health Center, S. Mark Taper Foundation Health Center, and Wallis Annenberg Children and Family Health Center at Hollywood Wilshire Health Center (WAC). The Pre-Diabetic and Fitness classes will be a new component to the NEP. Ms. Quiroga has already begun developing the curriculum for the Pre-Diabetic and Fitness classes. One-on-one and group education session will be held at all sites and classes will be held at WAC. Education session will be provided during regular business hours and each class will be offered on a bi-monthly basis every Saturday in one hour sessions. Each class will have between 20-30 students and will be provided throughout the year.
 
 The Pre-Diabetic class will covers topics such as identifying and defining diabetes and obesity, the effect of diabetes, how nutrition is linked to chronic disease, the importance of exercise, and more. Fitness classes will comprise of circuit training which incorporates a breadth of exercises such as strength training, cardio, and stretching. An education component will also be included to help participants perform the exercises at home. Participants will receive a diet journal to monitor food intake and utilize measuring tapes and calipers to evaluate progress.
 
 Upon notification of funds, Ms. Quiroga will purchase the necessary equipment and hire a contracted co-trainer to begin classes. SCC will use in-reach efforts to inform medical staff and providers of the services available as well outreach efforts to publicize NEP and its additional services.
 
 SCC’s in-reach efforts include posting posters at medical exam rooms and front desk as well as distributing informational flyers at the registration and discharge rooms. In terms of outreach efforts, SCC’s Managed Care Manager leads a team of Outreach Specialists to promote SCC’s various programs and services, including the NEP. The Managed Care Manager coordinates and leads culturally-sensitive and linguistically-appropriate outreach activities such as maintaining contact with agencies, initiating collaborations and partnerships, and participating in community events. The Outreach Specialists visit schools, local community and faith-based organizations, and other service centers.","The NEP will make LA the healthiest place to live by providing access to quality and affordable health care, health education, and fitness classes to those most in need. According to the County of Los Angeles’s Key Indicators of Health by Service Planning Area report (2013), 19% of adults in SPA 4 live in neighborhoods that do not have walking paths, parks, playgrounds, or sports fields, thus limiting spaces to exercise. Further, 25% of adults reported their health to be fair or poor, and only 17% of adults say they consume five or more servings of fruits and vegetables a day. These statistics are amongst the highest of the eight LA County SPAs and shows the potential impact the NEP’s services can make. 
 
 One-on-one and group education sessions and the Pre-Diabetic class will teach individuals how to eat healthier, how to maximize their limited funds to purchase healthy foods, appropriate portion control, and much more. Fitness classes will provide individuals a free space to exercise as well as lessons on proper fitness regimens and exercise routines. 
 
 As participants gain more knowledge about nutrition and fitness through the NEP, they will be able to utilize and share them with their friends and family to promote a healthier and more active lifestyle. By 2050, SCC hopes that the network of persons reached will be great enough to have a significant impact on the Los Angeles community. SCC is confident that the NEP will have a positive effect on the communities it serves. SCC has already received positive remarks from patients on how the current NEP and its services have transformed different areas of their health including weight loss, eating habits, blood pressure, and medication intake.","The NEP will benefit both SCC’s current patients and individuals in SPA 4 who are at risk for or suffering from chronic disease.
 
 Over 7,000 patients at SCC are currently at risk for and or suffering from chronic disease. In Fiscal Year 2012-2013, 27,188 patient visits were related to chronic disease, accounting for more than a quarter (27%) of SCC’s total number of patient visits. SCC saw 5,653 patients for hypertension and 3,039 for diabetes. Most if not all of these patient can greatly benefit from the NEP and its free services.
 
 Chronic disease is also prevalent within SPA 4. According to the County of Los Angeles’s Key Indicators of Health by Service Planning Area report (2013), major chronic health concerns prevalent among SPA 4 residents include hypertension and high cholesterol. The percentage of hypertension in SPA 4 has increased from 14% in 1997 to 20% in 2011, and the percentage of high cholesterol has increased from 15% in 1999 to 24% in 2011 according to the same report. Diabetes in SPA 4 is also a health concern according to Kaiser Foundation Hospital - Los Angeles’s 2013 Community Health Needs Assessment. In SPA 4, the prevalence of diabetes is 17% and the hospitalization rate is 186 per 100,000 persons. Furthermore, uncontrolled hospitalizations is 22 per 100,000 persons. These statistics are amongst the highest of the eight SPAs. As such, it is clear that many individuals in SCC’s service area can benefit from the NEP.","Yes. The Nutritionist is currently researching and contacting local food banks and researching local grocery stores to provide a list of healthy and affordable food. Local food banks in SCC’s service area include the Greater West Hollywood Food Coalition, World Harvest Food Bank, Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, Project Angel Food, and more. 
 
 Three factors critical to a successful collaboration are the following:
 1. Large Capacity. SCC and local food banks and local grocery stores must have reasonably sized resources to accommodate the need for healthy food.
 2. Trustworthiness. SCC and local food banks will need the trust of the community, including those serves, for retaining patients in the NEP. 
 3. Locality. All partnerships and collaborations must be local and accessible and in proximity of patients.",0,

Our network of mobile sensors is tried and tested, and we're now building out a static realtime network and adding other environmental data to that - air quality, weather, etc. We have a prototype network up and running now, but would love to deploy a full network in Los Angeles as the first US initiative.","With our radiation data we changed the established method of reporting data as huge averages to giving pinpoint data down to a specific GPS location, giving people the very granular data they needed and were unable to get anywhere else. We're hoping to do the same thing for air quality and other environmental data so right now Angelenos can get very vague data - air in LA is OK today, air in LA is bad today - etc. Our sensors and network will change that and tell people exactly what is different street to street, moment to moment.

Imagine being able to pinpoint pollution sources and make changes to correct these problems at the source.","Individuals who are interested in their environment, researchers who need concrete data for their work, and policy/government who currently have limited data with which to make decisions.",For Los Angeles we won't need any partners to deploy this.,0,0,
4102196,Los Angeles Beaches Forever,"SCI-Arc and Habitat for Humanity are partnering to develop creative, innovative, sustainable, and affordable housing for residents in LA.",Live,2014191,2014,,,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,Westmont; LA County,"In order to implement this project, starting in September 2014, SCI-Arc and Habitat LA will begin a series of design-build studios whose structure is set up to complete one SCI-Arc/Habitat home per academic year. The fall semester (Sept-Dec) of SCI-Arc’s academic schedule will be devoted to the student design of a home, the spring semester (Jan-April) will complete final documentation of the project, and during the summer semester (May-Aug) SCI-Arc students will join Habitat LA’s volunteers in order to acquire firsthand building experience during the construction phase of the project. During this time, students may also use facilities at SCI-Arc to build components of the home at the school to then attach to the building on site. 
 
 Managed collaboratively, the SCI-Arc/Habitat LA Housing Project will be a partnership which bridges Habitat for Humanity’s mission to bring people together to build homes, communities, and hope with SCI-Arc’s mission to educate architects to engage, speculate, and innovate. Engaging with Habitat LA, residents, and the local community will play a vital role in the student design and build process. Offering students the educational opportunity for community-based involvement, whether through Habitat and resident input, or volunteering on site, will not only inform the project design itself, but can also have a meaningful impact on subsequent projects and the student’s future careers in architecture. 
 
 SCI-Arc’s goals include: 1) examine everything about the built environment—from design and materials to culture and experience; 2) ask provocative questions to prompt new theoretical constructs; 3) lead the discussion on the future of architecture; and 4) create designs that change how people interact with each other and their environment. Each of these goals complements the very nature of this initiative and collaboration, which on the one hand brings innovative design with a focus on health and sustainability to the development model of Habitat LA, but also offers SCI-Arc students the opportunity to engage with real-world clients, local residents, and their greater LA community towards the final goal of a home for someone to live in and enjoy.","Understanding that where one lives contributes greatly to one’s physical and emotional well-being, this project will help make LA the healthiest place to live by helping low-income residents access mindful, creative, and environmentally sustainable design within their own homes and communities. Just as Habitat believes that everyone deserves a decent and affordable place to live, SCI-Arc believes that everyone equally deserves that place to be the best design and quality it can be.
 
 Innovative designs which respond to specific contexts and users allow a building to become more than a space that supplies crucial shelter, but also one that elicits great pride and ownership, and in turn improves emotional and mental well-being. In addition, tailored design decisions with a focus on health and sustainability can allow for a reduction in future energy costs, as well as increased quality of air, and life, for the residents.
 
 With a timeline that would complete its first home in 2015, this project would begin making LA a healthier place to live with its first studio. Bringing good design to all levels of society is a goal that can improve the well-being of individual residents and help foster overall community pride. Allowing room for respectfully adventurous architecture in affordable housing can reinvigorate a sense of civic belonging in a place, something that can have lasting effects beyond one home. 
 
 Looking to 2050, the intention for the project, a replicable model, is to evolve and grow in the coming years, keeping in mind the long term goal of making LA a healthier place to live. Last semester, SCI-Arc held a seminar on mitigation strategies that reduce air pollutants and foster healthy home environments. This research focused on a problem that is not only of national concern, but also a very real issue in the car-commuter culture of LA. SCI-Arc plans to continue studying such strategies for near-road conditions, especially given that project sites in the future may be freeway adjacent. Together with partners at UCR, modeling software will be used to test reductions in pollution from mitigation measures that can be implemented in future designs. Lastly, as the architects of tomorrow, this opportunity to develop creative, innovative, and sustainable design, in consultation with Habitat LA, residents, and the local community, is a tangible way to inspire students to work on these types of civic centered projects throughout their future careers.","The spectrum of whom this project will benefit extends from individual homeowners, to students, to the wider population of LA County. 
 
 Habitat for Humanity will determine an eligible owner for each home, which will be built in partnership with the families and individuals it supports, with each taking part in the construction of their home with up to 500 hours of ‘sweat equity.’ Once the home is complete, homebuyers are offered a 0% interest loan from Habitat LA.
 
 SCI-Arc is lucky to partner with an organization that already offers such an important program to an underserved segment of society in LA. In turn, as with many successful partnerships, this project hopes to create something bigger than the sum of its parts. SCI-Arc’s collaboration with Habitat LA will further benefit residents because the collaboration invites participatory design into Habitat’s existing model. Important health metrics are not only physical, but must include emotional and mental well-being. As an architecture school, SCI-Arc believes strongly in the power of design to better people’s quality of life. This tenet crosses all programmatic barriers, and this project advocates that the same rule does and must apply to affordable housing as well, as every individual in society deserves the positive impact of design. 
 
 In addition to helping low-income families afford homeownership and have access to creative design, this project equally benefits the students participating in the project. As the architects of our next generation, these students will be defining the future of building in the years to come. More immediately, this project allows them the invaluable chance to design and help construct homes, as well as learn firsthand about the challenges that the real-world presents and the skillsets it demands.
 
 More broadly, this initiative benefits the greater population of LA County. Planned as a multi-year and replicable initiative, the project has the potential to make a meaningful impact on the urban scale, with multiple homes planned for underserved communities in LA. Conceived as a project informed by its context, the communities where SCI-Arc and Habitat LA will be involved will play a crucial role in design development. Not only will these houses become a place to call home, each resident is a meaningful contributor to the civic process, helping to shape the communities they exist within.","Confirmed:

 While SCI-Arc’s main collaborator for the project is Habitat LA, the partnership would not be possible without pronounced help from LA County, who has provided the necessary land for this initiative. The first year’s home will be designed in Westmont, an unincorporated area in South LA. In addition, SCI-Arc has also been working with faculty and PhD students from UCR’s Bourns College of Engineering who have developed dispersion modeling software which can be used to measure reductions in pollution from mitigation strategies that will be tested on SCI-Arc’s campus and ideally implemented in future designs. This is the first time SCI-Arc has worked with all three above mentioned parties. 
 
 Three factors that are critical to the success of the SCI-Arc and Habitat LA partnership are:
 
 1) Shared project goals: The SCI-Arc/Habitat LA Housing Project is a collaboration in which all parties hope to further build upon a mutually beneficial platform. Through the initiative, SCI-Arc is excited to expand its design curriculum to reach underserved communities of LA, and to include a program that allows its students to be involved, for their educational benefit, from design to construction of a real-world housing project in their community. Habitat LA is eager to test new grounds for design innovation within its affordable homes and to integrate new strategies of sustainability into its model. 
 
 2) Pace/Patience: Keeping up with the annual ‘design-document-build’ timeline is crucial to the project’s success. It must, however, be done thoughtfully in order to respond to the needs of the residents and community. As the project progresses, resident input, both past and future, can be a key part of this process.
 
 3) Commitment/Leadership: The success of the collaboration is also dependent on the full commitment to the project by both main collaborators. To highlight each other’s commitment, both parties have drafted an MoU to better frame the goals and timeline of the initiative. In addition, SCI-Arc has appointed faculty member Darin Johnstone as the project coordinator and lead. A practicing LA architect, Darin is also the director of DID, SCI-Arc's introduction to design program for high school students.",0,
4102200,Green The Block,Eliminate Los Angeles’ food deserts by ensuring low-income families have free access to fresh produce and nutritious groceries.,Live,2014192,2014,,,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,East Hollywood,"SFCLA will open access to nutritious groceries and fresh produce at three geographically and culturally diverse food deserts in Los Angeles: East Los Angeles, Boyle Heights and East Hollywood. Fortunately, SFCLA has the expertise and infrastructure already in place at its headquarters downtown to implement the project with relative ease. Our 600 square foot refrigerator can house thousands of pounds of fresh produce and perishable items, and SFCLA already owns two delivery trucks. By rotating produce in and out of our refrigeration system at a higher frequency as we expand service to more areas, we will maximize the freshness and amount of food that is available to the people we serve. It is a win-win for all involved!
 
 To get the project up and running, SFCLA and parish staff and volunteers will commit to a set schedule that can be advertised to the public and relied upon by the community. We’d like to note that our partners, the 3 Franciscan parishes of Los Angeles, share SFCLA’s philosophy of serving any person in need, without judgment or religious consideration, and without any type of obligation in return. 
 SFCLA has a large and dedicated volunteer base that helps cook and serve meals, organize and distribute donations of food and clothing, and even provide administrative assistance. Whether they are part of a volunteer organization, from a local high school, or individuals with a heart for their community, SFCLA has historically and consistently been fueled by the efforts of dedicated volunteers. Last year, SFCLA engaged more than 2,100 volunteers in nearly 20,000 hours of service, which is equivalent to having 10 full-time employees! We will be delighted to put more volunteers into service to help drive our expansion. It is community helping community to make Los Angeles a healthier place.","SFCLA’s fresh produce pantry project will help make LA the healthiest place to live today by providing free groceries filled with fresh produce and balanced, nutritious ingredients, many of which are hard to come by at other pantries. Our high-tech refrigeration system will allow us to receive donations of fresh meat and dairy and deliver them to the sites safely. We will start service on a bi-weekly basis and transition to weekly service by the fourth quarter of the grant year. 
 
 For many people in Los Angeles, the terms “vegan”, “gluten-free”, and “organic” are familiar terms that describe a lifestyle that is health-conscious. These labels can be found in the grocery stores where they shop, at the farmers markets they visit, and the restaurants they frequent. This concept is so common that the idea of living a nutrition-centered life is indelibly linked to the personality of Los Angeles. Unfortunately, for too many families in our county, access to healthy groceries and fresh produce is NOT a reality. The reality for many low-income families is that large grocery stores and their vast selections and lower prices can be few and far between. The groceries and produce they do have access to are of poor quality or are over-priced. As a result, many meals come from fast food restaurants that are inexpensive or are made from ingredients that lack nutritional value. Anyone who has been to a grocery store has seen that you can get a bag of Cheetos for $1.50 but it costs a family twice that amount for a meager bag of spinach.
 
 Our project will help make LA the healthiest place to live in 2050 by ensuring the long-term health and well-being of LA's residents. Providing groceries and produce to families in need is not only about sustenance, but about the long-term effects of improving the health of a family. Often times, diseases like diabetes can be avoided when children are given fruits and vegetables instead of fast food or processed treats that come so cheap. While a fresh salad to many in Los Angeles is just another meal, it can make all the difference to a child who needs those nutrients to develop properly. By giving all Angelenos the resources they need to live healthy lives, we are investing in our society as a whole.","This project will benefit extremely low-income families, youth, seniors, veterans, and disabled adults in Boyle Heights, East Hollywood, East Los Angeles and downtown LA. The federal poverty level for a family of four is $23,550, but families who utilize SFCLA’s current pantry services have an average monthly income of only $1,020, HALF the federal poverty level (SFCLA 2013 internal census). 
 
 88% of pantry participants at our downtown LA center self-identify as Hispanic or Latino, 9% as African American or Black, 2% as Caucasian or White, and 1% as Asian. 
 
 Extremely low incomes combined with Los Angeles’ expensive housing market means that the majority of our guests’ income is going to shelter. 
 
 Currently, SFCLA provides fresh produce and groceries to 400 families per week - over 20,000 families a year. This satellite pantry project will allow SFCLA to increase the number of families served to at least 600 per week, or 30,000 annually by the end of the grant period. This is a 50% increase in the number of families SFCLA serves annually!
 
 “With my family, we began to eat more vegetables and fruits. Instead we eat at home more instead of take out. We read more labels on foods.” - Anna, 15 years old. 
 
 As a nation with so many resources and such an abundance of wealth, it is IMPERATIVE that we see the future prosperity of our society as an issue that is rooted in the well-being of all citizens, no matter their tax-bracket.","SFCLA has the confirmed partnership of the Franciscan parishes of Our Lady of Victory, Assumption, and Saint Francis of Assisi. These 3 parishes bring a unique awareness to the partnership: that of the specific trials, needs, concerns, and hopes of the communities they serve. The history of working to meet their constituent’s spiritual needs is now being translated into our combined efforts to meet the physical needs of their parishioners. Because the parishes serve as vibrant community centers in these neighborhoods, they are ideal locations for distributing groceries to those in need.
 
 We have longstanding partnerships with many food suppliers – from large chain stores to regional food banks – that donate the food we distribute. Last year, SFCLA distributed over 1.1 MILLION pounds of food, the vast majority of it donated. Some of our key partners include Lucky Supermarkets, LA Food Bank, Heart of Compassion, and Food Finders. 
 
 Every month new volunteers join our existing rank of hundreds. Half of our volunteers come as individuals, half come with organizations. They are high school students involved in a service-learning project, volunteers from corporations, churches and service groups. Some give a few hours of their time, others have volunteered daily for years. The diversity of our volunteers with regards to background and regularity is remarkable. Without these valuable members of our team, SFCLA would be unable to deliver its services so efficiently or to cultivate the personal relationships with those who come to us in their time of need. 
 
 Our mutual history has yielded so much success due to many factors. (1) The deep commitment to not only provide for the immediate hunger of those in need, but also for their long-term health, is first and foremost; 
 (2) the diversity of those we collaborate with is also imperative for creating the greatest impact through our program. If we had volunteers but no food, or food but no sense of the comprehensive needs and wishes of our families, it would be impossible to serve people in the way that we do; 
 (3) The shared heart-centered philosophy of serving without judgment or obligation is imperative to our success.",1,
4102201,LA Agri-Corps: Youth HEALers for Food Justice,Promote introduction of Vision 0 policies in to reduce fatalities and injuries from crashes and unlock the health benefits of safer streets.,Live,2014193,2014,,,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,,"Project partners will engage residents and advocates in a campaign to adopt Vision Zero (V0) policies in the City of Los Angeles and at least two other jurisdictions in Los Angeles County with high rates of fatalities from vehicle collisions and/or political leadership on road safety. The campaign will combine outreach, collaborations, media and advocacy to educate the public and policy makers about the need for and benefits of V0. Project partners will kick off the campaign with a 'shoe in' event at Los Angeles City Hall displaying 100 pairs of shoes representing the approximately 100 pedestrians killed each year in the City by vehicle drivers. The campaign will involve the public in developing and advocating for V0 through monthly workshops and walks in communities throughout the City of LA and at least two other cities. 
 
 Workshops will be creative exercises led by James Rojas in which community residents use model-building through a V0 lens to envision how their local streets can become safe healthy routes and places. Los Angeles Walks will lead walks in these same communities to allow residents to identify conditions that contribute to unsafe streets as well as changes they want to see on their roads and sidewalks. 
 
 Feedback from workshops and walks will help project partners develop a V0 platform to guide advocacy. Participants in these workshops/ walks will be organized to advocate for safer streets and adoption of V0 policies. Streetsblog Los Angeles will provide media coverage of V0 campaign activities and road safety issues to generate additional interest in the issue. To strengthen the campaign, partners will also link with other advocacy and community organizations, Neighborhood Councils and environmental groups to collaborate on a V0 platform. 
 
 After engaging and mobilizing residents and partners, the project will arrange meetings with policy makers responsible for street safety such as municipal Departments of Transportation, Police Departments, and City Council persons to advocate for introduction and adoption of Vision Zero principles as legislation and/ or packages of administrative actions. We will assist in making contact with the city staff and leaders using our connections, but the most compelling testimony will come from friends and families of victims of vehicle collisions and community members who face dangerous streets on a daily basis. The project will help community residents become the voice of Vision Zero.","Vision Zero will make LA the healthiest place to live by drawing attention to road safety concerns, by saving lives and preventing injuries, and by unlocking the health benefits of increased walking, cycling and social interactions. Our goal is to empower communities and residents to become the voice for Vision Zero to make traffic safety a higher priority for the city.
 
 Road safety is a critical public health challenge facing Los Angeles. Unsafe driving kills and injures tens of thousands of residents. It further harms public health by discouraging residents from walking and cycling. Motor vehicle crashes are the third leading case of preventable death in Los Angeles County for all age groups. In the City of Los Angeles alone, 31,012 people per year -including 2790 pedestrians and 1771 bicyclists - are killed or severely injured in vehicular-related collisions. These deaths and injuries have a ripple effect beyond their immediate tragedies by creating an often-accurate perception that our streets are designed to speed cars along rather than to create good routes and places for people. 
 
 Dangers from vehicles therefore discourage active transportation, reducing the extensive health benefits or walking and cycling. Vision Zero for Los Angeles will help make Los Angeles the healthiest place to live today by increasing awareness of the need for safer streets and accelerating transformation of road design and regulation. By 2050, Vision Zero will have been achieved, saving tens of thousands of lives and preventing hundreds of thousands of severe injuries. 
 
 Free from the fear of getting killed or injured by vehicles, more residents will walk and bike for transportation and recreation, leading to improved fitness, physical and mental health, a reduction in diseases related to overweight and physical activity, a reduction in exposure to air pollution, and greater levels of social interaction.","Vision Zero will benefit all residents since vehicle crashes and unsafe streets harm people from all corners of Los Angeles County, from all walks of life and drivers, passengers, cyclists and pedestrians. Some groups will see especially high benefits from safer roads. These include children and young adults since vehicle crashes are the leading overall cause of death for Los Angeles County children ages 5 to 14 and the second overall cause of death for residents 15-44. 
 
 Residents who regularly walk and bike will also see tremendous benefits. Pedestrians account for a third of traffic fatalities in Los Angeles City, almost triple the national average, and three percent of those killed by vehicles are cyclists, nearly double the national average. Pedestrians and cyclists will be able to travel with fewer worries and enjoy the benefits of the types of changes brought by Vision Zero: better designed streets, slower vehicle speeds, and better enforcement. 
 
 Low income residents who are more likely to not own a car and to live in places with busy roads and higher rates of deaths and injuries to pedestrians and cyclists, will also see disproportionate benefits from Vision Zero. Women and the elderly, who currently are less likely to bicycle because of the discomfort of riding in fast and dangerous traffic, can be expected to bicycle at greater rates when Vision Zero is implemented.","Vision Zero Los Angeles is a confirmed collaboration between Streetsblog Los Angeles, Los Angeles Walks, and Place It. The project will also partner with and provide stipends to ten community organizations (to be chosen later) on workshops, walks, and mobilizing members to advocate for Vision Zero. We will partner with Neighborhood Councils, bicycle and pedestrian advocacy organizations, bicycle co-ops and other community partners serving low income communities such as Pacoima Beautiful or Building Healthy Communities in Boyle Heights, South L.A. and Long Beach. The three main partners have worked together before and bring complementary strengths to a campaign for Vision Zero. 
 
 Streetsblog Los Angeles reaches thousands of readers with award-winning journalism on street issues in the Los Angeles region with a strong focus on safety for pedestrians and cyclists, including in-depth coverage of South Los Angeles, Boyle Heights, Long Beach and Santa Monica. 
 
 Los Angeles Walks is a pedestrian advocacy organization working to make walking safe, convenient and fun for all Angelinos. LA Walks has experience advocating for policy change and engaging residents through local walks to evaluate the walkability of the streets in various neighborhoods and to experience the history, culture and architecture of the area. 
 
 Place It founder James Rojas has led hundreds of creative planning workshops to allow community residents to envision how their built environment and streets can change for the better. These three organizations have formally and informally collaborated in the past as individuals leaders and/or as organizations. 
 
 Factors that are critical to the success of the proposed collaboration include: (1) the ability of community members to learn about road safety and opportunities to help shape and advocate for Vision Zero; (2) the capacity of the project to inspire participants in workshops and walks to advocate for safer streets; and (3) the ability of advocacy to influence decision makers to adopt Vision Zero policies. We believe that the Vision Zero Los Angeles team can provide synergy through community-based journalism and outreach, community-engaged advocacy and community-led visioning for safer streets in order to achieve project goals.",0,

Strivers.LA gives students time management tools and involves their social networks and employers in their education. 
 
 New Economy Campaigns and the Strivers.LA team have already built a working beta version of the Strivers.LA application, which is the first step to creating the kind of comprehensive application students need. We'd like to reach more students in order to get the needed feedback to improve the application. 
 
 Funds from the 2014 LA2050 grant would be used to support:
 ● Developing a revised version of the application in early 2015 based on student feedback from testing during summer and fall 2014.
 ● Planning and developing new components of the application to facilitate participation, increase automation, and expand scalability.
 ● Developing a method for gamifying student participation, creating class vs. class and school vs. school metrics.
 ● Recruiting students to use the app (incentives) and funding community manager support (staff time)
 ● Supporting the Los Angeles City College Foundation in providing incentives and outreach to current LACC students.
 ● Partnership outreach to local businesses to seek ongoing sponsorship and marketing incentives to students.
 ● Planning and implementing a comprehensive evaluation strategy.
 
 We will recruit students to use the Strivers.LA app through:
 ● Online outreach via Facebook, twitter, and Instagram, using a content-driven strategy to engage students with fun and useful content about school success (and dealing with exams).
 ● In-person outreach through Los Angeles City College Foundation, student organizations, and nonprofits.
 ● Recruitment incentives for students to reach out to their peers and refer them to Strivers.LA. 
 
 We aim to create a culture of focus on exams, planning ahead for studying, and increasing student engagement generally on community college campuses in LA, improving education outcomes and increasing graduation rates.","Currently, California is one of the toughest places to be a community college student in the country. Our college completion rates are far below the national average, and our students arrive from high school without good study habits; they often require remedial classes before they can begin college-level work. Strivers.LA can help students today improve their study habits and increase their likelihood of completing a degree or certificate. Young people (as well as older students) who are balancing part- or full-time work with studies and family obligations understandably have a tough time.
 
 Securing a college degree is central to a student having an increased standard of living throughout his or her life. Some studies show a lifetime differential of more than $1M between those completing a four-year degree and those who do not. Increased graduation rates result in better outcomes for the community overall. 
 
 Over the long term, Strivers.LA will help to create a culture of academic success and responsibility within our community college system and in the LA region overall, by recognizing the students who are working hard to succeed, as well as the employers and educators who are supporting them. We’ll give local businesses a way to recognize and reward students who are making an extra effort (and potentially find future employees through our network someday). We’ll give local leaders a way to see which businesses and campuses are stepping up to support students. 
 
 We’ll celebrate all of LA’s Strivers as they learn and succeed.
 
 In 2050, if our initiative is successful, our community college system will have educated tens of thousands of better-prepared, employed and employable students, ready to work in growth industries that will power the LA economy for the subsequent 50 years; healthcare, technology, hospitality and tourism. We’ll demonstrate success by increasing the percentage of students who successfully complete college; we’ll improve profitability for businesses by reducing personnel and retraining costs, encouraging increased hiring and local investment. Most importantly, we’ll have created deep relationships between our community college system and local employers, developing a collaboration that understands that supporting student workers will result in an improved economic environment for the entire community.","Our Strivers.LA app is designed for low-income, working community college students, but any high school or college student can benefit from its reminders to study, prompts to share their academic calendar with friends, family, and employers, and motivational study messages. Our app will benefit anyone who is seeking to better their life and employment prospects through education – it can be used freely by anyone who signs up to participate.
 
 Nationally, 74% of students worked during the academic year, and 15 % are working full-time. Juggling work and school schedules leads to skipped classes, inadequate sleep, and even no-show exams. Research shows that every extra hour a student works above 10 hours/week lowers GPA by a measurable amount. Sixty percent of community college students work more than 20 hours per week and 25% work more than 35 hours per week. Among 18 countries tracked by the OECD, the United States finished last (46 percent) for the percentage of students who completed college once they started it. In California, fewer than 28% of students who begin a two-year college program complete a degree within six years; for those studying part time, this percentage falls to less than 12%, in both cases significantly below the national average. Los Angeles must improve its college completion rates in order to reach its economic potential. 
 
 Through our partnership with Los Angeles City College Foundation, we’ll be focusing our work on engaging LACC students. LACC's student population is among the most diverse in the nation. Of the College’s more than 18,000 students, 54% are immigrants to the United States and 45% are first-generation college students. Current LACC students are low-income, with 70% receiving a Board of Governors waiver for tuition and 53% receiving some form of financial aid. A number of students are even homeless and hungry. Through our partnership with LACCF, we will be able to engage directly with this population, helping to bolster the employment that most students use to support their educational goals and improving their likelihood of completing an associate’s degree or transferring to a four-year school.","STRIVERS.LA is being incubated by New Economy Campaigns, a digital strategy consultancy that has created national and global programs to leverage technology for social impact. Creating accessible ways to engage with causes that matter is the cornerstone of New Economy Campaigns’ work. The New Economy Strivers team includes a digital strategist, a designer/ developer, a project manager, an educator whose experiences teaching inspired the project, and a community manager. Collectively, we bring more than 75 years of experience to building Strivers. Our team is made up of ""strivers"" and we believe in educational access for all. 
 
 Strivers.LA is partnering with Los Angeles City College Foundation for implementation of our app and outreach to students. LACCF is a 501(c)(3) corporation established in 1968 to increase the educational opportunities for students of LACC. The Foundation creates and promotes new initiatives to meet unfunded programmatic needs of the school community. LACCF will ensure access to LACC students during product development, pilot, and implementation phases, as well as assist with program evaluation.
 
 Los Angeles City College serves approximately 18,000 students annually, and they have one of the most diverse, and most economically challenged student bodies in California. LACCF is confirmed as a partner and participated in the development of this application, and will receive a portion of the grant funds if we are successful, in order to support on-campus outreach. LACCF provides us with direct, on-campus access to students, and will act as a liaison with the College overall and with the broader Los Angeles Community College District.
 
 If our partnership with LACCF is successful, we hope to expand this partnership throughout the Los Angeles Community College District, which serves more than 250,000 students annually.
 
 New Economy Campaigns has consulted for LACCF on digital outreach and engagement strategies, and we have developed a strong working relationship. 
 
 The three elements essential for the success of this partnership are:
 ● Reciprocal benefit for each partner; Strivers.LA will have access to a student population that’s perfect for our application, and LACCF will have access to a digital tool that will help its students succeed.
 ● Common goals: wanting to help struggling students succeed and complete a degree or certificate program, or successfully transfer to a four-year institution.
 ● Clear expectations and communication.",0,

No such process currently exists for people with developmental disabilities. 
 
 It is our hope that we can demonstrate to HRSA the merits of designating people with developmental disabilities as a special population. Consequently such a designation would allow us to get the proper reimbursement rate for services rendered as well as allow us to receive continued HRSA grant funding. 
 
 In that regard, we believe that a significant portion of funding could be allocated to the efforts of our CEO and additional consulting support as Achievable looks to streamline operations, ensure federal, state and county compliance, grow our patient base and ensure that we are properly compensated for the care we provide to our clients.","The groups of people we serve are amongst the most medically complex individuals in the county. By better serving their needs, we can help the healthcare safety net better deal with the impacts via reduced hospitalizations, visits to ER's and better management and prevention of chronic health conditions that can be reduced via on-going, culturally competent and timely care. The impacts go beyond the thousands of clients we serve, to their families and other care-givers which often neglect their own health even as they care for our patients.","The Achievable Foundation is a nonprofit organization founded in 1996 with the mission of significantly improving the health and quality of life of under-served individuals living in Los Angeles County who have developmental disabilities such as autism, intellectual disability, cerebral palsy and epilepsy. 
 
 Individuals with developmental disabilities have numerous complex health care needs and experience poorer health than the general population, including disproportionately high incidence of chronic conditions and preventable mortality. Although state and federally-supported Community Health Center programs provide significant support for meeting the needs of many vulnerable populations, there is no specific framework for addressing the unique challenges posed in serving a patient base made up primarily of individuals with developmental disabilities.
 
 We aim to serve the tens of thousands of potential clients that may seek our services from across the entire county of Los Angeles.","The Achievable Clinic is leveraging our strategic partnerships with organizations like the Westside Regional Center (WRC)--where we are co-located-- to offer a growing spectrum of health care services to the expanding number of individuals with developmental disabilities who have MediCal insurance coverage through L.A. Care Health Plan. Based on the latest information from L.A. Care, there are over 2,286 clients at WRC (or roughly one third of all WRC clients) signed up with one of L.A. Care’s health plan providers. 
 
 As part of an extensive outreach plan, Achievable is looking to become the medical home of choice for many new L.A. Care clients. Serving as a medical home to L.A. Care clients places our clinic in a strategic position to contribute significantly towards L.A. Care Health Plan’s Triple Aim goals of achieving excellent patient outcomes, excellent patient experiences, and cost effectiveness and efficiency on behalf of our shared clients. To that end, we seek to improve patient experiences while minimizing long-term medical costs through an integrated, whole-person approach to addressing the ongoing healthcare needs of our community members. 
 
 If we can demonstrate the effectiveness of this strategy working with WRC, this could be expanded to the other Regional Centers across LA County that together serve tens of thousands of individuals with developmental disabilities.",0,

 - Link to Google + community site with instructional videos, list of materials, and other resources. 
 
 Phase 2: Orientation Workshops and Training
 The first 100 educators will be invited to attend one of the 3 orientation workshops. These workshops will walk the educators through how to implement Tinker.Make.Innovate curriculum in their classrooms or library programming. This workshop will cover: 
 - Basic electronics, prototyping techniques, 3D modeling for 3D printing & laser cutting, electronics for textiles, engineering with paper, and other making techniques. 
 - How to incorporate Next Generation Science Standards and Common Core Standards into the Challenge
 - The use of Design Thinking process to encourage design and innovative thinking 
 Each participant will then be provided with a Make-It box full of tools and materials that will help them facilitate the challenge with their students. * the exact tools and materials will be determined by donations in kind. 
 Phase 3: Ongoing Development and Documentation
 Educators will receive further development and support through monthly Google Community Hangouts. These Google Hangouts will serve as an online community for the challenge participants to share tips and techniques, document their students’ progress, and receive assistance/mentorship from Maker Guild’s professional staff. The online community will serve as a way for us to continue to inspire and learn from one another. 
 Phase 4: Showcase
  During the first week of May 2015, educators will submit their students projects to be showcase","The current structure of our education system is failing our students which in-turn is failing LA. According to the National Assessment of Educational Progress in 2013, only 22% of California students tested proficient or above in science. We also know that science, technology, engineering, arts, and math (STEAM) equip students with the skills they need to be innovative thinkers. With the implementation of this program today: 
 
 - We will empower our teachers and librarians by providing the tools they need to feel confident integrating STEAM into their programs. 
 
 - We will support our educators to grow too. More than 85% of elementary educators have not received science-related professional development in the last three years. In the Orientation Workshops, and through our Google Community, educators and librarians will receive mentorship and ongoing professional support. 
 
 - We will expand the reach of the classroom. If we provide libraries with these tools, students will not have to stop their learning when they leave school. 
 
 - We will lessen truancy and expulsion rates. When students are engaged in their learning they are excited about going to school.
 
 - We will build a culture of entrepreneurship, innovation, and problem-solving. Through this challenge, our students will be immersed in real world applications of STEAM, design thinking, and an innovative mindset. This will open them up to the possibilities of high-school electives, college degrees, and even careers in STEAM. 
 
 Changes in the way LA students learn today will lead to a brighter LA in year 2050:
 
  - Where students work with their hands, hearts, and minds to create innovative solutions to real-world problems. 
 
 - Where the way Los Angeles students learn and the way our teachers teach becomes a model for school districts throughout the nation. 
 
 - Where libraries are not merely places to read a good book, but are also innovation hubs where students and families are introduced to new technologies and ways of learning. 
 
 - Where students are well prepared for universities and even their careers, and leave high school with a portfolio of innovative projects under their belts. 
 
 - Where student showcases involve the larger community and are a regular tradition with hundreds of submissions from students of all ages, backgrounds, and demographics.","The Tinker.Make.Innovate Challenge will directly benefit 100 librarians and educators, and 3000+ students throughout Los Angeles. Through the Google community and the challenge manual, thousands more students will be able to take part in the challenge in their schools and libraries. The showcase has the potential to benefit 40,000 students, families, educators, and community members by inspiring them and opening their eyes to the possibilities of STEM. As this program continues beyond the 2015 funding year, it has the power to inspire the 687,534 students enrolled in LAUSD schools, over 30,000 teachers, and more than 100 librarians in Los Angeles County directly.","The Exploratory: Maker Guilds will work with the Los Angeles Unified Public School District, Santa Monica Unified School District, Science Teachers Network, and Los Angeles Public Libraries to inform teachers and librarians about the challenge and curriculum toolkit. Our collaboration with Pearson Education Corporation will enable us to make our curriculum and project ideas easily accessible to teachers and librarians to integrate in their programs. 
 
 Through our partnership with The Summer/City of Learning, students connected with our program will have the opportunity to participate in digital badging, a program sponsored by Mayor Garcetti’s Office. This program will enable students to map their progress through their projects and show skills gained to colleges and future employers.",0,
4102213,Everybody Dance!: Transforming Lives Through High-Quality Dance Education,"everybody dance! will collaborate with 3 public schools to provide 2,400 students in kindergarten through middle school with dance classes.",Learn,2014201,2014,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,"We use dance as a means of transforming the future for at-risk children and youth, instilling in them the life skills – resiliency, self-discipline, teamwork and respect for themselves and others – that we want them to carry over to their personal, family and community lives.
 
 In the 2014-2015 school year, everybody dance! will provide over 200 in-school and after-school dance classes per week at six sites in Central and South Los Angeles. 
 
 Instruction is enriched with master classes taught by leading companies such as Alvin Ailey and Diavolo, field trips to view professional performances, and frequent performances at community events and annual sold-out performances at USC’s Bing and Bovard Theaters. 
 
 We work hard to create a culture of high expectations. Students are expected to be punctual, attend class consistently, respect their teachers and classmates, and understand the value of a strong work ethic. Dance requires effort and dedication and our students learn quickly that there are no shortcuts. 
 
 Parent engagement makes our program thrive. We build commitment to everybody dance! by requiring families to volunteer 15 hours annually. The benefit of prioritizing family engagement is that parents bond together across ethnicities while working together even as they model the value of ‘giving back’ for their children. The result is a tight-knit community of parents and young dancers in neighborhoods traditionally split by gang affiliations and racial divisions. In annual surveys, many students and parents describe everybody dance! as ""family."" 
 
 These combined elements – program breadth and quality, high expectations, consistent instruction and parental engagement – are what we believe make our program succeed.","A growing body of research confirms that arts education plays an integral role in children’s lives. With relatively low household incomes, most inner-city residents cannot afford to enroll their children in costly private arts programs. Arts education budget cuts of nearly 50% in Los Angeles Unified School District over the past six years [1][2] have increased the need for accessible programs in the city’s underserved neighborhoods.
 
 As a result of their participation in our dance program, students will demonstrate: 
 
 • Increased proficiency in the language and skills of dance; 
 • Increased appreciation for the arts;
 • Increased sense of community; and 
 • Increased positive self-development.
 
 
 For the nominal fee of five dollars per month, everybody dance! students have access to a range of dance classes – in ballet, jazz, tap, hip hop, choreography, boys’ aerobics and modern– taught by our team of dance educators, heralded by the Los Angeles Times as “some of the best children’s dance instructors in the world.”
 
 Our students dance an average of 2.5 hours per week and some attend class daily. For the majority of our students, everybody dance! provides not only an opportunity to engage in art and practice dance, but also a safe haven from the crime and poverty they face in their neighborhoods. Within this safe, nurturing community, students are supported by our dedicated staff as they develop the skills necessary to succeed academically and professionally.

The population per square mile ranges from 13,545-50,125, a vast difference from the population per square mile for the County (2,480) or State (247).","everybody dance! will work with three long-term key collaborators to implement the proposed project. 
 
 1) Gabriella Charter School: We provide daily dance instruction during the school year to 436 K-8 students at Gabriella Charter School, a dance-themed Title 1 elementary and middle public school. As the School was formerly a program of The Gabriella Foundation,, this is an especially close partnership. The School provides us with studio space and shares administrative resources.
 
 2) Camino Nuevo Charter Academy: Since 2000, we have provided weekly school-day classes to Camino Nuevo Charter Academy. This year, we expect to provide 45 weekly classes to over 1000 students in the summer/fall and 25 weekly classes to nearly 400 students in the winter/spring at the three K-8 campuses of Camino Nuevo Charter Academy, a Title 1 public inner-city charter management organization. In return, Camino Nuevo Charter Academy provides us with studio space, for our after-school program, shares resources and allows us to reach even more underserved areas of Los Angeles’ inner-city.
 
 3) LAUSD’s Ramón C. Cortines School of Visual and Performing Arts (the School District’s downtown arts high school): Last year, we began providing dance classes after-school at LAUSD’s downtown arts high school. We plan to increase enrollment in FY 14-15. The School provides us studio space and shares resources. This collaboration allows us to reach more students and to expand our reach in the City’s downtown core.
 
 Critical to the success of these collaborations is open communication between dance program and school staff, mutual commitment to the project and a shared belief in the importance of arts education to academic success.",0,
4102217,Mobile Forum: Architecture and Urbanism To-Go,We are building 75 more Learning Gardens (in addition to the 38 we have already built) in schools across LA county.,Live,2014203,2014,,,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,Long Beach,"To implement this project, we will install 75 more gardens in LA in the next twelve months.
 
 By augmenting our existing 38 Learning Gardens with an additional 75 gardens, we will have over 100 gardens installed in Los Angeles. This presence will enable us to enter into larger conversations with district decision-makers and funders about policy changes that can fundamentally change the role that schools play in promoting healthful learning and play for young Angelenos now and for years to come.
 
 We work with community members, landscape architects, researchers, designers, policy makers, teachers, parents, and kids to revolutionize the concept of a school garden entirely. Our Learning Gardens are a lightweight, durable, modular, and interactive, designed as both an outdoor classroom and living play place, that is also easily customized to fit a wide variety of school needs. Our beds can be placed on asphalt, on rooftops, in school entrances, and even safely on top of toxic soil, and are also ADA-compliant handicap accessible. 
 
 To build these gardens, we will raise funds through a network of like-minded foundations, donors, businesses, and organizations. With proper funding, we will be able to increase garden construction and build our team capacity in LA. We will continue working with local partners in the construction of our gardens and in the sourcing of our materials such as soil, seeds, and irrigation parts, and will also be incorporating data from our evaluations to make continual improvements upon our gardens and our services.
 
 LA is the second largest school district in the country. If we can build a successful garden model here, not only can we make LA the healthiest city in America, we can also make LA a model city for others to look to when seeking to significantly impact the health and future of our nation’s children and families.","Obesity is one of the biggest health concerns facing LA today, especially children. Recent research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association shows that nearly one in every three children in America today are obese or overweight, putting them at significant risk of developing serious health problems and positioning our nation for a future of crippling debt and disease. According to the Mayo Clinic, unhealthy lifestyles marked by poor food choices and inactivity are the leading cause of obesity in children. Latino youths suffer disproportionately from obesity, and LA alone contains 4.9 million Hispanics (9% of the nation’s entire Hispanic population).
 
 Armed with this knowledge, we believe that there is no better way to promote a healthy lifestyle for our youth than by ensuring that all young Angelenos have access to a high-quality school garden, designed with their needs in mind. By teaching kids about how food grows in a setting that is playful, accessible, and safe, we help set them up for healthy success now and in the future. 
 
 Learning Gardens connect kids to real food, helping them learn to prize snap peas over sodas, carrots over candy, and peppers over poptarts. In a Learning Garden pilot study, we found that students increased their awareness of nutrition goals by 13.7%, and increased their preference for vegetables found in the garden by 12%. Learning Gardens provide exposure to a world of healthy food choices before unthinkable to many students, and help them to take necessary first steps towards living active and healthy lives.
 
 The health benefits of school gardening are not just physical. Over 60 years of research demonstrates the benefits of school gardens on children’s mental health as well, helping kids deal more effectively with stress and resist violent activity. In our own pilot study, we found a statistically significant reduction in competitive play around Learning Gardens and a complete absence of violent activity around the Learning Gardens (despite violence occurring in other areas of the playground).
 
 And most importantly, by working strategically to bring Learning Gardens to scale, we make sure that these opportunities will be made available to all children and families in LA, not just a select few. 
 
 In 2050, there will be thousands of Learning Gardens in communities across LA, fostering new generations of healthy thinkers who know how to grow, harvest, and share nutritious food.","Our Learning Gardens help foster a more positive and healthy educational environment for students. Over 75% of our students qualify for Free and Reduced Lunch and over 75% of students are either Black or Latino/Hispanic. Our research shows that students with Learning Gardens value and enjoy them, with 95% of students reporting that they want a Learning Garden at their school and with 40% of those students visiting the Learning Garden daily. 
 
 Our Learning Gardens are designed so that the children who use them feel a sense of ownership. With curvilinear raised beds that can be painted or mosaiced, and interlocking pieces that can include benches, lights, shade sails, sundials, and more, teachers can let children freely explore the garden without fear of trampling plants, and kids can interact with soil, seeds, and plants at eye-level. 
 
 Learning Gardens are also attractive and practical outdoor classrooms for teachers, complete with seating, shading, and a comprehensive workshop series with materials that help teachers integrate lessons on nutrition, health, science, math, technology, art, and a host of other subjects into their curriculum. 
 
 With the addition of another 75 gardens in LA, we will be able to expand our offerings to comprise more comprehensive teacher workshops that will help our teachers better integrate the Learning Garden into their lesson plans. Having a wider variety of schools and teachers attending these workshops also helps foster more collaboration and sharing of ideas between schools.
 
 By working within the school district to install gardens at scale, we will be able to unlock the potential to have our workshops and trainings count toward teacher’s Professional Development credits, helping teachers fit our workshops into their existing schedules.
 
 Our project will also benefit families. Not only do families have the opportunity to get involved in the garden itself through build and harvest days and volunteer programs, they also benefit from the addition of the Learning Gardens to existing school, after school, and summer programs. In our pilot study, we found that 96% of parents surveyed wanted a Learning Garden at their school.
 
 Designed by certified landscape architects, Learning Gardens also serve to beautify communities, and are as attractive as they are practical.","Three factors that have been critical to our past success and will be crucial in our project going forward have been found in partnerships that:
 
 1. Take advantage of existing school infrastructure.
 
 We have a deep relationship with Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) via their Sustainable Environment Enhancement Developments for Schools (SEEDS) program. SEEDS is a $4 million bond fund set up for green projects in schools that awards funds in installments. New installments can only be awarded after existing funds are spent.
 
 To ensure effective deployment of these funds, we will work both in tandem with LAUSD and our schools to apply for funding to be used towards the construction of a Learning Garden, significantly reducing the cost of a garden to the school and making sure that funds from the bond are awarded rapidly so that more funds can be released and more schools can have access to them. 
 
 We will work with LAUSD with the intent to fund 60 Learning Gardens together. We have also worked with LAUSD on using our gardens specifically for nutrition education and obesity prevention, helping them to use our gardens as part and parcel of their messaging and curriculum.
 
 2. Compliment our gardens with quality programming
 We partner with a number of organizations that have developed excellent curriculum that can be put to use in our gardens. For example, we have partnered with Enrich LA and GrowingGreats on pilot projects to bring their curriculum to bear on our Learning Gardens in Compton and Hawthorne.
 
 We also partner with after and summer school programs to ensure our gardens get the most use possible. Some of our programming partners include Beyond the Bell (an after school program) and the Child Development Center (a summer camp organization).
 
 Through this project, we will be seeking new curriculum and programming partners to strengthen the efficacy of our gardens. 
 
 3. Include highly influential people and organizations
 We work with The California Endowment Fund through a substantive grant to install gardens in schools that fall outside of the LAUSD. We will continue nurturing this partnership and others in hopes of unlocking future funds.
 
 Our organizational ties to LA-based companies like Space X enable us to reach a targeted population of highly influential individuals and organizations, building our network through these channels.",1,

4102221,Seafood for the Future,"Mobile Forum is a truck on a mission: to bring together communities, designers, developers, and policymakers to build the future of housing.",Live,2014205,2014,,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,"""Mobile Forum"" is a typical box truck turned migratory research hub and exhibition instigator. A demonstration of advanced ideas about home and housing, the vehicle gives a public presence to residential design discourse, one with the freedom to roam, solicit, and activate the region’s communal and creative capital. ""Mobile Forum"" instigates discussion by taking design questions and proposals on the road, encouraging people to talk to one another about the future conditions of living. It issues an open invitation to participate in the identification of neighborhood-by-neighborhood design cases and it provides the opportunity to bring the inventories to those with the means to influence change − and vice versa.
 
 ""Mobile Forum"" is a combination gallery space, lecture hall, and activity center that packs up and ships out. It employs the ecological and physical footprint of the truck in cues to reconsider the desirability of the proximate, the small, and the shared. It provides the LA Forum with a flexible, opportunistic, and responsive platform for the staging of events. Loaded with an assortment of audio-visual, display, and workshop devices and equipment, the project caters to disparate deployments and facilitates interactions with groups and sites typically beyond the reach of fixed-location programming.
 
 ""Mobile Forum"" sets out through the initiation of a series of community workshops. After locales are selected from an open call to neighborhood groups, the truck establishes temporary outposts for designers, locals, officials, and organizations to take stock of existing conditions and to speculate about the future of LA housing. Participants act as ad hoc interdisciplinary design teams, producing examples of how domestic spaces might shape the city of 2050.
 
 The collected designs and visions created in these on-the-ground efforts form the content for the next iteration of ""Mobile Forum"" − a traveling gallery and advocacy vessel. The truck, retrofitted with displays of the accumulated new ideas for living, returns to the communities as a visual and spatial provocation to action.
 
 All ""Mobile Forum"" work will be published − as it occurs through online and social media, and in its entirety as a building manual. The documents will be used to incite local developers, governments, and sponsors to break ground on the suggestions.","What’s the future of housing in LA? Livability, mobility, affordability. The LA Forum for Architecture and Urbanism believes that design is a tool that supports sustainable and healthy lives. Through design’s lens, learning, living, playing, and creating are actualized as physical environments. ""Mobile Forum"" extends the agency for the imagination of how all of these elements connect across the constituents, experts, and leaders for whom LA is home.
 
 Typically, the question of what constitutes the spaces in which we live is the decision of developers responding to economics and government codes. If designers are involved, it likely is at the service of those pre-determined terms. And, residents simply chose from amongst the outcomes. “Mobile Forum” reverses and mixes up this practice, asking how we might understand needs in order to impact building regulations and developer decisions. It puts designers in a bridge position, enabling them to draw out how good living and good spaces come together. It does all of this by unifying all of these unique voices, by providing a platform for dialogue between communities, residents, builders, policymakers, artists, and creatives to take shape as actionable visions.
 
 By focusing on housing, ""Mobile Forum"" taps into LA’s dominant source material − domestic space. Urban transformation begins with home and prepares the way for a thriving 2050. It literally gives shape to the conditions that will make LA the best place to live today and tomorrow. It shows how to maintain quality while fixing costs per square foot. It enables urban resilience by making sustainability inseparable from building practices − by revealing desirability and efficiency in reduced housing footprints, by demonstrating seamless integrations of living, working, playing, and moving, and by encouraging a valuation of these conditions. It models interdependent environments where the lines between open space, community space, and private space blur, where all of the amenities and relationships crucial to a healthy and fulfilled existence are proximate. It suggests that empowerment depends on literally building interaction into the expectations for the everyday surrounds. It holds the American dream up for review and encourages the development of an alternative ideal around which to construct the future.","“Mobile Forum” targets residents living around new and proposed transit routes that are seeing or will see significant redevelopment growth and changing property valuation. These areas are subject to rapid reconstruction, displacing existing populations through eminent domain or rent inflation. The LA Forum project seeks to provide a sounding board for those involved in and impacted by the urban transformation. It aspires to produce concrete examples for building that innovates design inclusive of both established communities and of densification efforts.
 
 The LA Forum will identify ten communities along new or pending light rail corridors. “Mobile Forum” will interact with these communities in a series of information gathering and idea generating engagements that pool human resources in the planning of how to adapt. It takes advantage of the infrastructures of streets and lots to set-up a vast array of unexpected public venues. Wherever the truck parks, an event unfolds, revealing glimpses of locational potential and catalyzing the forces to realize them. Lessons learned at each stop travel from point to point, distributing insights from one community to another. The city and its citizens are encouraged to observe and shape each other in hands-on exploration.
 
 The interactive and cumulative nature of “Mobile Forum” benefits the direct participants − who learn the mechanisms for influencing the development taking place around them − and their communities − by mobilizing the agents required to alter the expectations for and outcomes of comprehensive neighborhood restructuring. It also has the potential to act as a global conversation starter, to model for the world best practices for light-touch living and to reinstate LA as the residential laboratory to envy and emulate.
 
 Peripherally, “Mobile Forum” reminds LA about the profound role of the design and construction industry, a significant part of the creative capital for which the city is known. It reinvigorates the energy and economy around literal world shaping, helping to maintain the diversity of the region’s productions and of the people drawn to be a part of the excitement of creating and making.","The LA Forum expects three types of collaborator-partners for “Mobile Forum” − community groups, governing bodies, and development organizations. If awarded the LA2050 support, “Mobile Forum” will consist of a team of designers and urbanists − from the LA Forum − between eight and ten community groups and/or governing bodies and two development organizations. This perfect storm of agents for the built environment will pool resources to cultivate the intellectual and material content of a proposal for a new approach to living.
 
 As an example, the LA Forum has a confirmed collaboration with the City of Glendale and intended collaborations with the be.group and with Enterprise Community Partners (or similar). In this hypothetical relationship, “Mobile Forum” would work on-site in Glendale in its proactively anticipated light rail corridor. The City of Glendale would share the resources of its planning and policy offices and would provide guidance and structure to the event staging and to institutionalizing outcomes. The be.group, a local advocate of Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities and Aging in Place Initiatives, would host the workshops through the perspective and in consideration of the needs of their constituents. Enterprise Community Partners would provide the development and economic expertise and connection to fiscal enablers. And, the LA Forum would establish the framework and act as the intermediary and translator (from conversations to building proposals) for a cooperative research and design effort.
 
 “Mobile Forum” would organize similar, but circumstantially unique arrangements across the city − amassing a variety of both tailored and universal approaches to responsive development by design. Other collaborator-partners to which the LA Forum has reached out and/or with which the LA Forum has the potential of working include the City of West Hollywood, Skid Row Housing Trust, El Proyecto del Barrio, and the Housing Rights Group, to name a few. The LA Forum’s board members, all well established design and urbanism professionals, have respected histories working with an extended network of organizations appropriate to fill the collaborator-partner positions and will activate that network in order to secure involvement in “Mobile Forum.”
 
 The three factors critical to a successful “Mobile Forum” collaboration-partnership are: (1) a distributed and representative audience, (2) connection to decision-makers, and (3) promotion.",1,

 School and student outreach: For the pilot year, 8 LAUSD high schools were targeted. For 2015, we will target 25 high schools with Linked Learning pathways. Our goal is to support between 60 and 72 students and provide them with highly competitive paid internships and support.
 
 Integrated coaching program: The LA Fund hired a seasoned coach with deep experience in mentoring and training youth to support our pilot cohort. We will continue with and expand this model, which included training on business skills, workplace culture, on-line communication and networking strategies, professional and personal growth and goal setting, as well as ongoing one-on-one support.
 
 Business partner outreach and support: The LA Fund and its Board will again leverage relationships to recruit business partners and provide high-touch support. We will again hire a program coordinator to serve as a liaison with LAUSD and support businesses as they, in many cases, create new internship programs.
 
 Communications and documentation: We both filmed our pilot program and asked interns to document their experiences to understand the impact and challenges of the program and to create communication tools for LAUSD and LA Fund for program expansion. Video and written journals and blogs are being edited and will soon be pushed out on social media and other channels to engage the community.
 
 Planning and project management support: We will work with LAUSD to support expansion of Linked Learning programs, business partnerships, and student internships.","In LAUSD, 80% of students come from economically disadvantaged communities and do not have the educational opportunities and support systems they need to achieve their potential. They often lack professional role models and stable community support systems, fail to complete high school, and face high rates of poverty. Furthermore, we know that competing in today's economy requires more than a high school degree, and real economic opportunity requires much more. Providing meaningful internships and support not only engages students in their high school studies but also helps them build the confidence they need to pursue college and careers.
 
 Helping schools make connections with businesses, providing students with internships, and supporting the growth of Linked Learning will be transformational for LAUSD high schools. Businesses participating during the pilot year have responded with a strong desire to continue their involvement and others have heard through word of mouth and want to join next year. Schools, teachers and parents are thrilled that their students are getting access to unique and rewarding internship opportunities. Students have raved about their work experiences, and how they have developed new relationships and learned new skills. LAUSD is primed to expand their Linked Learning pathways and need partners like the LA Fund who can help make connections with businesses and create meaningful opportunities for our students. The time is right, the partners are in place, we have experience in providing internships for students, and have the capacity to grow this work.
 
 It is our goal to build upon this momentum in the coming year and work in partnership with LAUSD and continue to support the Mayor’s summer jobs program to reach more schools and students and transform the high school experience.","There are four constituents that benefit from an expanded TIP program:
 
 Students and their families: A summer internship is a transformative experience that has long-lasting effects on a student’s academic life and future career. Selected LAUSD students receive paid internships (at least the minimum wage per hour) at leading, high-profile businesses that are in their fields of interest. Developing partnerships that will provide students the unique skills and experiences garnered by an internship can positively impact the workforce of our city in the future (National League of Cities, 2012; Darling-Hammond and Post, 2000). This has an exponential potential to affect students, their families, and the communities they live in.
 
 High-profile, LA-based businesses: These businesses are able to onboard stellar LAUSD talent to provide meaningful internship opportunities within their community. Businesses are able to hire LAUSD talent in an easy fashion given the work the LA Fund performs in sourcing LAUSD talent and providing an integrated coaching program. Anecdotally, the businesses participating in TIP are reporting a boost in their company’s morale.
 
 The City of Los Angeles: More established links between businesses, schools, and students only serve to benefit the quality of life in Los Angeles by increasing employment and creating closer social bonds with public schools and local communities.
 
 Those who access social media: The experiences of TIP interns are being distilled in a way that is easily accessible and digestible via social media. Students and businesses from around the world can learn about the experiences of TIP interns and business partners.","Business partners during the pilot year were carefully selected based on their leadership and innovation in their respective industries, their excitement to host a TIP intern and take part in the TIP pilot program, and their willingness to ensure that the three factors for a successful collaboration would be met:
 
 1. Commitment to pay at least the minimum wage per hour for each TIP intern.
 
 2. Ensure a meaningful work experience that would challenge a TIP intern and inform his/her future career direction.
 
 3. Provide the on-the-job mentorship and training needed to ensure a positive experience. In some cases, the TIP internship is a student’s first experience in a professional setting.
 
 The TIP 2014 pilot included the following, high-profile internships:
 
 Atom Factory (entertainment)
 Bad Robot Productions (entertainment)
 Border Grill (culinary)
 Chernin Entertainment (entertainment)
 El Rey (entertainment)
 Fullscreen (entertainment)
 Illumination Entertainment (entertainment)
 Kaiser Permanente (healthcare)

 The LA Fund (nonprofit education)
 
 JJ and Katie Abrams financially supported the research and development of the TIP program and Samsung Electronics provided a cash donation and an in-kind donation of 15 Samsung Galaxy Note Tablets for interns to support the social media component of the TIP pilot.
 
 The LA Fund has received positive feedback from the above business partners regarding the work of each TIP intern and their experience in acting as a host. It is our hope to work with all business partners during summer 2015. We are also beginning conversations with new businesses now for summer of 2015 participation.",0,
4102223,Project SPIN: Suicide Prevention Intervention Now,Project SPIN is a bold initiative to bring systemic changes to school communities that will end conditions that contribute to LGBTQ suicide.,Learn,2014207,2014,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,All of the Los Angeles Unified School District,"Project SPIN’s main focus areas include Policy and Advocacy (developing inclusive policies and best practices for systemic change), Mental Health Care Coordination and Support (support LGBT students with crisis support and resources), Safe Schools (continuing to work with schools to develop a comprehensive approach to addressing hostile environments, promoting connectedness, and building a culture of kindness), Transgender Support (support districts in developing policies that enumerate gender identity and gender expression), and Capacity Building (build capacity to create safe and affirming school environments). 
 One of the most prominent of these programmatic elements is the 2013 launch the Out for Safe Schools Campaign – a collaboration between LAUSD, The California Endowment, and other organizations to create OUT for Safe Schools badges to demonstrate visible support of the LGBTQ community by LAUSD staff. The badges have the word “ally” in seven languages, which provide an opportunity for school site personnel to declare that they support LGBTQ youth. With last year’s launch of OUT for Safe Schools, nearly 50 LAUSD staff and students filmed I’m Coming OUT for Safe Schools Public Service Announcements, including the LAUSD Superintendent, chief of school police, bus drivers, students, teachers, principals, parents, grandparents and many more – reaching an audience of 15 million with national media exposure. More than 30,000 badges distributed to 1/3 of all LAUSD staff and administration. 
 
 The District and the Center recognize the critical importance of SPIN’s anti-bullying education and programs in addressing these issues. But we also know that the bullying of LGBTQ youths and other psychological acts of brutality in school are usually at the end of a long chain of societal homophobia and transphobia that has battered the self-esteem of young people long before they arrive at the schoolyard. A serious approach to protecting all students and decreasing suicidal ideation requires a comprehensive approach by school systems that incorporates anti-bullying efforts as well as collaborative partnerships with parents, mental health providers, social services agencies, and law enforcement and religious organizations. This is exactly the approach that Project SPIN is taking, closing in on its goal of genuine systemic change that can be replicated across the nation.","LAUSD is the nation’s second largest school district and has been a leader in addressing issues facing LGBTQ youth for many years and has initiated innovative programs in this area. The Los Angeles LGBT Center is the largest LGBT organization in the world and has been at the forefront in offering services to LGBTQ youth and, in particular, at-risk youth. By working with LAUSD and in collaboration with a variety of other organizations and communities, Project SPIN will collectively create an environment in all district schools where students feel safe to come to school, be true to themselves, and advance in both their education and careers. Project SPIN’s curriculum and response training, systemic and policy restructuring, and unified support of all people in our community can create a 2050 Los Angeles where mindsets are shifted, equality is achieved, and internal happiness and justice is restored for the marginalized youth that are presently suffering so many deficits. Our staff works relentlessly and with the utmost passion to create transformational impact that will allow our youth to be given the opportunity to reach their fullest potential and to become future leaders one day.","This project will benefit all lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning (LGBTQ) youth, as well as other youth in LAUSD who will benefit from the creation of a genuine safe space in their school community. LGBTQ students in particular are at far greater risk of dropping out of school and they experience depression, violence, harassment, substance use and addiction, homelessness, HIV infection, and the ultimate tragedy – suicide – at much higher rates than their heterosexual counterparts. Together with LAUSD, we want to ensure we are working collaboratively to support our students and staff sending the message that it’s safe to be you in our schools. In addition, Project SPIN will benefit many other members of our community – teachers, principals, families, police officers, bus drivers, and the other individuals that will be given the tools necessary to create a safe and inclusive environment for LGBTQ youth.","Project SPIN's main collaboration partner is the Los Angeles Unified School District –a partner since the beginning of its existence. Working with LAUSD allows us to take our mission for Project SPIN and implement it in the more than 1,200 schools that are a part of the District. With their support, we are able to create systemic changes on a larger platform, leaving a lasting impact for future generations in the public school system. The factors critical to the success of our collaboration include funding for resources and implementation, prior success in the work that we do, and a unified belief in Project SPIN's mission.
 
 In addition to LAUSD and The Los Angeles LGBT Center, the SPIN effort includes the collaboration of the GSA Network, the Trevor Project, Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles, Trans Youth Family Allies, the ACLU of Southern California, the Latino Equality Alliance, PFLAG, the L.A. County Dept. of Mental Health (DMH), the Los Angeles Police Dept. and a dozen other organizations. Representatives of these groups meet regularly and developing an action plans to reduce homophobia and transphobia in district schools and get young people the support they need. Project SPIN brings together agencies that are primarily focused on mental health (DidiHirsch and DMH) as well as LGBTQ-specific agencies to bridge the gaps in supporting schools and build stronger collaborations. 
 
 We have also partnered bargaining units (SEIU, UTLA, and ALAA), GSA Network, and others to produce our OUT for Safe Schools badges – part of the OUT for Safe Schools Campaign. All of the partners listed are confirmed and were part of last year’s Project SPIN campaign. 
 
 Lastly, Project SPIN has recently partnered with ONE National Gay & Lesbian Archives at the University of Southern California to develop educational materials for implementation of the California FAIR Education Act (2011). In June of 2014, Project SPIN created a resource guide of inclusive curriculum that teachers can use as supplement to textbooks.",0,
4102227,Creating an equal opportunity to succeed by mentorship from someone that has the career you want,Giving everyone who wants to better themselves a fair chance and an equal opportunity to succeed from high school and beyond.,Learn,2014208,2014,,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,"We have already started implementing the project on a small scale by completing the first release of the website.
 
 Currently the website has grown to 50 mentors and with the $100,000 we can scale much more quickly by adding dedicated technology resources and incorporating the students themselves in the growth process.
 
 The methodology used to implement the project will be the same technology product management/project management I learned from my prior career experience. For example, I follow the same project management techniques I learned at Goldman Sachs, the marketing experience I used when at Adobe, and user adoption/strategy from Live Nation/Ticketmaster.
 
 I have extensive experience in leadership functions and was the Class President of the USC MBA Program in 2011.
 
 More importantly, to gain mass adoption across college, community college, and high school campuses you will have to get buy-in and understand the perspective of users. In many previous jobs I have assembled teams of interns and helped them use their problem solving skills to take ownership of the product and building out the strategy within their own schools. After all they themselves are the target demographic, they will just need guidance and feedback as I let them take on a leadership role themselves.
 
 Gather the feedback of students and have them lead the deployment within their own communities and help them learn the business aspects by observing and guiding them throughout this process.
 
 Work with administration in universities, community colleges, and high schools to launch the product on a large scale. Continue to network with outside parties at education conferences to identify other means of deploying and gaining exposure for hte product.
 
 Work directly with leadership in student organizations to have them promote and reach out to the constituents to promote the product and get their feedback as well to refine the product.
 
 Work with teachers and professors to launch the product to their students as well as gain feedback from them regarding the product.","Today our project will help students will be able to identify and define career paths that they did not even know exist and jobs in industries that are growing rapidly (renewables, etc.). Students will be able to look for jobs they did not originally believe to be in their career path, they can experiment with different careers without spending years deciding whether or not they will like them, thus decreasing employee turnover. The medium in which we employ to help students throughout this path will incorporate social elements and gamification concepts to keep it interesting for those with the lower attention span. General advancement of skill sets directly related to these jobs would be great as well since the mentors will also be generating webinars, slideshows, and other content for students to learn from.
 
 Underemployment will decrease as the students are better able to market their skills and abilities to employers so that they can best use the skills that they developed attaining their college degree. Much of the reason for underemployment is students not being aware of how to translate their skills into the workforce.
 
 Students will be able to determine whether this career is a good fit for them through information interviews with anyone in the mentor network as well as eventually computer simulations so they can understand what a particular job function is like without having to spend years in a career to have that experience.
 
 By the year 2050 our dream is to have technology and processes in place where students can get help for their studies, guidance on careers, surveys that identify careers for students based on their personal passions, and virtual experiences in careers without having to experiment themselves in the workforce.
 
 Help everyone who wants a job get exactly the job that makes them happy.","1. High school students - help high school students figure out which school is a great fit for them based on their passions and future goals (even if the goals are uncertain)
 
 2. College students - help students prepare to build skills and experience early to get internships and subsequently a full time job
 
 3. Career transitioners - help people see that they do not have to be stuck in the same job for 10 years just because that is all they have done. There are transferrable skills that one can market and new and emerging industries where no one yet has experience in that field. We can help guide people to career paths they did not foresee as possible.","University of Southern California (confirmed)

4102231,RUN FOR YOUR LIFE,"The Trust for Public will transform trash-filled alleys in South Los Angeles into walkable, bikeable, beautiful green alleys.",Live,2014210,2014,,,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,,"The Avalon Green Alley Network Demonstration Project is leading efforts to green the nearly 900 linear miles of alleys in the City of Los Angeles. These largely overlooked spaces represent nearly 2,400 acres of potentially open space. Project goals include demonstrating innovative and cost-effective means to improving water quality, contributing to the restoration of local ecosystems through the improvement of water quality and conservation of water resources, facilitating investment in green infrastructure through the development, implementation, and testing of new methods for urban greening, and engaging local residents in the design and development of new green spaces within their community.
 
 The project will implement replicable low impact development stormwater management measures in a keystone alley that is included within a larger master plan for a local network of green alleys. The Avalon Green Alley Network will retrofit a network of alleys spanning 6 blocks (approximately 37 acres) of the South Los Angeles neighborhood near Avalon Boulevard for improved pedestrian connectivity and integrated stormwater management.
 
 Within the Avalon Green Alley Network, The Trust for Public Land and partners will conduct extensive renovation and construction on two alleys (Tier 1) and will complete general improvements throughout the rest of the alleys (Tier 2). Improvements will include replacing dark, impervious pavement with porous, light-colored paving stones that reflect heat and allow water to penetrate rather than running off into sewers; planting the edges of alleys with espaliered fruit trees to make them cooler and more inviting; and adding signs, lighting, and pavement markings to encourage residents to use the alleys as green pathways through the neighborhood. Additional improvements will include native and drought tolerant plantings that will green and beautify the neighborhood, a fitness loop, and a range of techniques to capture and infiltrate stormwater from nearby residences and streets. When complete, the network of green alleys and streets will connect two parks, an elementary school, a high school, shops and businesses, bus stops, and a grocery store.
 
 The completion of the Project will serve as a demonstration of stormwater management low impact development interventions that can be replicated in other communities throughout Los Angeles and California.","The Avalon Green Alley Network Demonstration Project presents a major opportunity to transform blighted, polluted, and overlooked spaces into walkable, bike-able, and playable green spaces, creating new recreational opportunities for residents who have few places for safe outdoor recreation in their neighborhood. The project will serve as a practical improvement to residents’ daily lives, adaptively re-using existing infrastructure to integrate green connecting corridors into the fabric of the neighborhood. The alleys will also create safe routes to school for children. These corridors will serve as vital links between homes, nearby schools, parks, and services. By encouraging walkability within the neighborhood, residents will be less likely to drive to reach nearby destinations, leading to increased opportunities for physical activity, and effectively reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality.
 
 Enlivening, renovating, and greening these overlooked corridors will lead to increased usage and stewardship from residents, which will have an important impact on decreasing crime, illegal dumping, and pollution. Community art, native plantings, and natural, edible landscaping will create a welcoming community space. Interpretive signage and design-based information inlaid into the paving will highlight for residents a sense of place within the Los Angeles River Watershed, and educate residents about pollution prevention and green infrastructure benefits. A fitness path through the alley network will make this community green space a nexus for outdoor exercise, positive community interaction, and play. The integration of espaliered fruit trees along the alley walls and fences introduces an agricultural element to a heavily urbanized area. Benefits also include opportunities for residents to engage in community building activities, thus fostering community pride and a sense of ownership. 
 
 In addition to these benefits to the immediate community, the project will serve as a model for similar dense and residential low-income communities throughout California, and will break new ground in interagency collaborations for the permitting and construction of low-impact development.","The South Los Angeles neighborhood where this project is located is a Severely Disadvantaged Community where the median household income (MHI) within a half-mile radius of the project site is $31,256 (53 percent of the statewide MHI), and where 6,939 people live below the poverty line. Residents of this area are disproportionately affected by poor air and water quality, and suffer from high rates of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. According to the California State Parks Community Fact Finder, the neighborhood surrounding the project site has only one acre of open space per 1,000 people. 
 
 On a broader level, the project’s impact on water quality will benefit all of Los Angeles County. Currently, the alleys are used as dumping grounds, leading to the accumulation of various pollutants during dry months, including oil, heavy metals, nutrients, trash, total suspended solids, and bacteria. During rainy months, untreated and contaminated stormwater runoff flows through the alley into storm drains that lead to the Los Angeles River and out to the ocean. Contaminated stormwater runoff is the number one source of ocean pollution in Southern California. Cleaning up the alleys and implementing stormwater capture technologies in them will eliminate a significant source of water pollution. 
 
 The project will also impact water supply in our drought-stricken region. Los Angeles imports 89% of its water at tremendous environmental and financial cost – the large use of energy in California is pumping water south – and yet we waste almost all of our rainwater. Our city’s stormwater infrastructure was designed with the sole purpose of preventing flooding, and as a result all the rain that falls is quickly funneled into storm drains that empty into the ocean. By implementing stormwater capture elements such as permeable paving in the alleys, rainwater will be able to recharge the local aquifers and increase our local water supply. In the current drought, it is more important than ever to demonstrate sustainable solutions to our water crisis. Ongoing monitoring of the stormwater captured by the alleys will provide valuable information that will be used to inform policy at the local, regional, and state level and will benefit all Californians.","TPL has facilitated nearly 30 community meetings, platicas and clean-ups since April 2010. Through these meetings, planning events, and alley clean-up activities, the project has engaged the support of the following groups:
 o Los Angeles Conservation Corps –LACC helped TPL organize alley clean-ups at the project site Partner on the Tree Planting grant and will be helping with outreach, permitting and planting for the new street trees
 o The Coalition for Responsible Community Development: a nonprofit community development organization in South Los Angeles, is working with TPL on alley clean-ups.
 o Community Health Council (CHC)/ Coalition for an Active South Los Angeles: The Avalon Alleys have been highlighted by CASLA as a priority project for improving community health. TPL participates in monthly meetings with CASLA, a branch of CHC, who will continue to advocate for a network of green alleys in South L.A.
 o Food for Less, the closest and largest grocery store to the project site, has assisted TPL with outreach support and has contributed food and refreshments for community meetings and alley clean-ups.
 o Magnolia Missionary Baptist Church – Located on the southwest corner of the T-alley block, the church has provided free space for hosting community meetings and events. 
 o TreePeople, an environmental nonprofit provided support and co-facilitated monthly platicas and co-hosted community tree planting event
 o Jefferson High School – Jefferson High School hosts a Green Design Academy, whose students have partnered with TPL on outreach activities.
 o Maya Angelou High School- Hosts monthly platicas and important partner for outreach and student engagement. Three academies within the school participate in clean-up events and will participate in the monitoring of the alleys and on-going tree care for new street trees.
 o City of Los Angeles Bureau of Sanitation: Primary partner and support for the project. BOS will maintain the BMPs and is the key partner for designing and building the alleys 
 o Council for Watershed Health: Monitoring support for stormwater BMPs
 o Council District 9: Important partner and supporter for project. Essential support with alley closure piece and other logistics and community relations support

Harbor area and Harbor Gateway,"We completed our first full year of implementation as one of only five recipients (out of over 250 applicants) of the national Toyota Family Learning grant (toyotafamilylearning.org). This project is a new six-year nationwide initiative led by the National Center for Families Learning (NCFL) and funded by Toyota. This prestigious award provides us with partial funding to more fully execute this model over the next three years. Our planned programming includes the expansion and provision of: 
  
 1. Parent Time/Education - Education will include ""Raising Thriving Kids"" (5 week asset building program), Muffins for Moms (home literacy) and Donuts for Dads (engaging dads in education). 
 2. PACT Time - This past year, we began providing a joint parent/child literacy program for pre-school aged children. For our older children, we offer two evening (at pickup time from 6:00 - 7:30 p.m.) teacher-led PACT programs. The first is a family homework support program where parents and children jointly work on strengthening homework and test-taking skills. The second is a study skills program where families jointly learn to improve study strategies, school behaviors, time management, and organizational skills. 
 3. Family Literacy/Shared Reading - In conjunction with our Family Literacy program, our families utilize TNC’s library to select books for reading together. Families are shown how to use the dictionary to understand the meanings of words and how to identify the type of text structure presented in the material. 
 4. Developmental Assets® Programming - Direct instruction and development of building blocks is provided to children throughout all of our programming.
 5. Family Mentoring Program - We wish to expand our current mentoring program to include family mentoring focused on academic success. We will also offer e-mentoring using technology such as Skype.
 6. Grandparents as Parents - We are partnering with this local organization that offers weekly small group parenting programs for those (e.g., grandparents, aunts, uncles) who have previously parented and find themselves parenting again. 
 7. Family Service Learning - We have begun offering innovative family service learning opportunities. When families engage in service together they are spending quality time learning about their communities and adults are acting as positive role models for their children.","Our Family Learning Program will help make LA the best place to learn in three critical ways:
 
 1) This program can break the cycle of poverty through its innovative approaches to intergenerational family learning. Family literacy/learning programs provide enduring benefits to individual family members as well as the family unit as a whole. 
 
 2) It fills a significant service gap. For example, our families lack access to affordable preschool and parent education classes, placing them at a great disadvantage. 
 
 3) It provides an opportunity for our families to truly reinvent themselves and develop a different kind of hope for the future. It takes a significant amount of resources to coordinate the necessary comprehensive services our families require and to offer them all at one central location. This ""wrap-around"" approach allows us to provide the space and innovative programming our families want and need. Our families, in turn, bring the energy, motivation, dedication and hard work. Working together, we have the ability to bring about real and sustained change for our families.
 
 We are working to give our families a ""hand up"" instead of a ""hand out"". Our ultimate goal is to build futures and offer hope. We do so by taking a different approach. Although many programs seek to involve parents in their child's learning, our program is unique in that it requires ongoing engagement from parents. Each family works together to create goals for the family as a whole. With assistance, these goals form the basis of a family asset development plan that holistically meets that family's unique needs. Parents spend a minimum of 10 hours per week working to reach the full potential of the entire family. Also, our innovative service learning and advocacy components take our program out of the ""institution"" and into the community and our clients' homes. Our parents gain skills/confidence and then practice applying this new knowledge in real life situations. Many of our families have never had these opportunities before. This is a powerful approach.","Our services are available to all individuals in the Harbor Area of LA. Due to the location of our main campus, many of the families we serve come from the Barton Hill/Rancho San Pedro neighborhood of San Pedro. This area is located in the northeast corner of San Pedro—the town’s major core of poverty level families. Seventy-eight percent of Toberman's families are Latino/Hispanic. Currently, 96% of clients are below 50% of area median income, with 58% having incomes of less than $15,000. Many of the families we serve reside in the Rancho San Pedro low-income public housing project, and every student at the local elementary school qualifies for participation in the Federal free lunch program. 
 
 The needs in our community are complex. In addition to increasingly widespread gang activity and crime, our community also suffers from elevated high school dropout rates and low educational attainment. Only 61% of students entering 9th grade at San Pedro High School in 2008 graduated in 2012. In addition, only one quarter of high school graduates enroll in college. The vast majority of our kids live in neighborhoods with significant gang activity, have poor parental supervision, perform poorly in school, and have very low incomes. Our most recent reading assessment on our newly enrolled children indicated that half are reading below grade level. In addition, a full 71% of the children we serve live in abused, neglected and/or extremely challenging situations (e.g., incarcerated parents, foster care). A number of our children live in chaotic homes and are unable to focus on learning because they are focused on survival. For many, school attendance is spotty which translates into a true lack of opportunity.
 
 Our families face persistent challenges and hardships. One of the underlying causes that link all of these problems is a lack of literacy in the home. In addition to traditional definitions, we also characterize literacy as the ability to handle information, to express ideas and opinions, to make decisions and solve problems. It involves a continuum of learning in enabling individuals to achieve their goals, develop their knowledge and potential, and participate fully in their community. We know that the power of literacy lies not only in the ability to read and write, but rather in an individual’s capacity to put those skills to work in shaping the course of his or her own life. Our program can effect tremendous lasting change for our families.","We have formed numerous collaborative relationships to ensure we are offering ""best in class"" programming, providing those specific holistic ""wrap-around"" services our families want and need, and continuously evaluating the impact of our services. All of our partners/collaborators are crucial to our success and each has been confirmed. The National Center for Families Learning (NCFL) is our prime collaborator and partner. We have worked with this inspirational organization for the past three years; 2 years piloting our literacy project and this past year implementing our Toyota Family Learning program. NCFL is a confirmed partner for at least two more years. Another critical partner is Marymount University. On a weekly basis, Marymount provides us with dozens of tutors for our after school program and is providing us with a federally funded work study intern for our literacy program. Our third prime partner is the Search Institute (developers of the 40 Developmental Assets® framework for youth development). We continue to work with them as pilot site for the Institute's Assets Profile for Pre-Teens (DAP-P ). Other confirmed partners include Harbor Preschool and Bandini Elementary School Healthy Start Program (parent literacy), DMH/South Bay Mental Health (on-site mental health services), Free Arts for Abused Children (arts for parents/youth), the South Bay Center for Literacy (ESL, family literacy) and the San Pedro Public Library (on-site literacy programming).
 
 We also receive significant support from our 352 volunteers: 18 Board Members, 122 Auxiliary members (thrift store), 50 program volunteers (tutoring, enrichment/recreation), and 164 evening meal volunteers (provide a full meal for youth every day). In our after school program alone, volunteers contribute 3,005 hours each year with an estimated dollar value of $74,374. In addition, we receive tremendous support from local funders who share our commitment to the children. Some supporting foundations include Toyota/NCFL (Toyota Family Learning) Dwight Stuart, Parsons, Ahmanson, Rose Hills, CA Community Foundation, Boeing and Kaiser. Finally, we also connect to our community through regular standing meetings with law enforcement and government officials to proactively address neighborhood issues, meet regularly with local child care organizations to ensure open youth-focused dialogue occurs and have instituted several avenues to maintain open and ongoing communication with our local schools.",1,

 Populate
 TreeMapLA calculates eco-benefits (carbon dioxide captured, water saved, etc.) and monetary benefits for each tree and rainwater feature mapped. The more populated the map, the greater the calculated benefits, further motivating community action to increase canopy coverage and local water supplies. Over the next year we will:
 
 ● Activate our 10,000-strong volunteer base to participate in mapping events
 ● Train volunteer leaders – TreePeople’s and those of our partners - to lead their own mapping events
 ● Provide teachers with a STEAM-based curriculum to lead their students in tree mapping activities
 ● Seek municipal agencies and non-profit organizations with tree inventories to upload
 ● Broadly invite partners who can utilize tree mapping and activate their constituents 
 
 Innovate
 Inspired by the open source ethos of the OpenTreeMap platform upon which TreeMapLA is based, we intend to find and include features that will allow TreeMapLA to be the most efficient and user-friendly tool we can build, knowing our work will benefit all OTM users. Over the next year we are planning:
 
 ● Addition of Alerts & Actions enabling stewardship to mobile app
 ● Increased social media connections
 ● Bulk data upload, to upload tree inventories from municipalities and partners
 ● Content editing functionality, to keep the map timely and relevant 
 ● A bridge between TreeMapLA and our database, Salesforce, allowing us to better communicate with TreeMapLA users, provide more specific educational and action opportunities, and facilitate ongoing stewardship, e.g. allowing us to send an email that says, “We see you planted a tree a month ago. Have you watered it?” along with specific resources. 
 
 Communicate
 With teachers: To fulfill TreeMapLA’s educational potential, TreePeople has created curriculum for teachers, and will provide professional development training to use it. We’d like to provide free field trips to teachers who get the most students involved with TreeMapLA.
 
 With the community: Through social media, additional videos, tree ID and mapping events, and engaging partners and their constituents, we will be communicating about TreeMapLA to many audiences throughout LA.","Los Angeles’ urban ecosystem is broken and our future is at risk. Angelenos are in need of a healthier and more climate-resilient city – one with sufficient tree canopy to protect our neighborhoods, and more locally-sourced water. We urgently need our urban environment to protect us from extreme heat waves, droughts and floods, and related health and economic problems happening now -- and forecast to intensify in our future.
 
 Trees capture, filter and store rainwater, save energy, significantly cool surrounding areas, and absorb carbon dioxide and airborne pollutants. Some areas of LA have canopy coverage at nearly 40%, while others are only in the single digits. This geographic disparity corresponds with socio-economic and chronic health issues, leaving many of our most vulnerable residents even more at risk in years to come.
 
 The City of LA currently imports nearly 90% of its water from remote and increasingly contested sources. Meanwhile, every time it rains an inch in the city, 3.8 billion gallons run into the ocean. The city “throws away” an estimated $400 million worth of rainwater every year. This pollutes our ocean, leading to beach closures, sickness, and costly fines, and damages marine life.
 
 TreeMapLA shows the community specific eco-benefits of each tree and watershed feature, and the urban watershed as a whole. Each benefit is directly, or indirectly, related to the health of our city:
 
 ● Energy conserved (reducing energy-related carbon and particulate pollution due to cooling temperatures)
 ● Stormwater filtered (adding to cleaner local water supply)
 ● Air quality improved (reducing respiratory disease)
 ● Carbon dioxide removed and stored-to-date (reducing climate change)
 ● Stormwater runoff reduced (reducing pollution and toxicity)
 ● Water conserved (increasing water supply).
 
 Too often, because the environmental issues facing people seem so overwhelming, they feel powerless and paralyzed, unable to believe they can make any meaningful change. Research and our own experience tell us that when people see the difference they make, they are motivated to do more. We know that once people begin to notice and learn about trees, they never see the city the same way again. Noticing and learning are the first steps towards valuing. Living in a way that values, promotes and protects nature even in the most urbanized areas of LA improves our health -- now and in the future.","TreeMapLA is a shared resource for LA’s people and organizations to co-create, revitalize, and steward a healthy urban forest watershed. By bringing people together with a shared vision for growing a more sustainable LA -- and a way of measuring their actions -- this collaborative tool can help all residents improve their communities, their health, and their well-being.
 
 TreePeople is reaching out to specific audiences to take a leading role. These include:
 
 1. Teachers and students. Using our 4 decades of experience developing environmental education, TreePeople’s TreeMapLA curriculum teaches all 5 “STEAM” areas--Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics--as students analyze canopy coverage and water needs of their school, map existing trees, identify species, understand eco-benefits, and use alerts to identify trees needing care. Rainwater harvesting projects can be identified and implemented, later using water saved to care for the trees schools have planted. 
 
 2. Partner organizations and their audiences. TreePeople is actively seeking partners to use TreeMapLA to advance their own goals. We are developing a set of best practices, promotional and outreach materials, and tips and tools that other organizations can adopt and make their own. 
 
 3. Those who can restore a functioning ecosystem (all of us). With spiraling costs to fix our broken ecosystem, and diminishing financial resources to do so, government agencies alone cannot plant or care for all the trees needed to achieve an ample urban tree canopy, nor can they provide a sustainable local water supply through traditional methods. For LA to be healthy and viable in the future, all of us need to become active managers of the urban watershed and ecosystem, taking personal responsibility for the trees in our lives and our city, and the rainwater that falls on our properties.
 
 4. A movement of active tree stewards and rainwater harvesters. As TreeMapLA is further developed and collaborators join, it’s an ideal platform for building a movement -- where those who are taking action can learn from and help others, where agencies can track water, energy and pollution savings and provide incentives, where neighborhoods, schools and cities can define their portion of the urban watershed and set goals and programs to improve them.","Early conceptual and design partners include LA City Recreation & Parks, LA City Urban Forestry Division and City Plants (formerly Million Trees LA). All provided invaluable insight into the need for collaborators to 1) feel a sense of ownership, 2) use the map to help achieve their own strategic goals, and 3) find ways for TreeMapLA to fit into their current programs.
 
 Partners currently providing direction on community and user engagement include Industrial District Green, a Downtown LA group increasing the livability of Skid Row and the Arts District by planting trees, UC Riverside, and the Earthwatch Institute, which engages people worldwide in scientific research. 
 
 IDG has been instrumental in helping to beta test TreeMapLA. Since the map launched, IDG has been partnering to map all the trees and empty tree wells in their area to create a master tree plan to plant the empty wells, determine where new trees can be placed, and better provide maintenance. What’s exciting about this partnership is its replicability in creating neighborhood-level master tree plans and tackling low-canopy areas.
 
 Our newest partnership is with Earthwatch Institute, an international non-profit, UC Riverside researchers, and several local non-profits to use TreeMapLA for ground-truthing that compares actual tree data to visual data collected by NASA flights to determine water use and growth rates of different species in different locations within the LA area. The goal is to predict which trees might be more sustainable as the climate in Southern California grows hotter and drier. To participate in a Citizen Science project that could literally change the urban forestry landscape in Los Angeles is incredible, and TreePeople sees this as only the first of many such projects, partnering with local non-profits and universities to collect and share usable scientific data through TreeMapLA.
 
 In the next year we’ll form a TreeMapLA Advisory Committee, and have identified urban forestry and related organizations to invite. We hope to bring in diverse ideas and ownership to make this the most valuable tool possible for our entire region.
 
 Our most important and long-term partnership, however, is with the people of LA. Our 40 year history has been one of partnering with people from all walks of life to educate, empower and motivate them to heal our environment. TreeMapLA makes it easier for all of us to join together and share knowledge to make our city more sustainable.",1,
4102241,Mapping Los Angeles Air Pollution through a mobile application to create awareness and engagement.,"Create a incentivized app with an easy User Interface including aspects such as food, health, fitness; while promoting local businesses",Live,2014216,2014,,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,"With a population of close to 4 million individuals, it is a stretch to make LA the healthiest city with campaigns and small scale projects. Rather it is more beneficial to approach the issue of quality of life and health care from a holistic point view accessible by ease from everyone while looking at preventative as well as clinical care. As such, we will need to approach the goal of a healthy city by determining metrics that are related to each other and their prevalence in their respective communities. 
 
 Phase 1 will consist of developing a easy to use sensor (to detect different environmental measurements) and placing said sensors in multiple communities of LA to determine the air quality, toxin levels while also measuring bike and transit scores. Sensors will provide us with live regional data as well as detailed data which to benchmark against the whole of LA as well as against other parts of LA. We will then develop an artificial intelligence program and code it within a simple mobile device application which will be created alongside the program that can be accessible across various platforms such as tablets, phones, computers, etc. The application will consist of 4 programs when opened: Eat, Health, Life, and Fitness- all of which will provide access to several different options. 
 
 Phase 2 will be establishing a wider range of local businesses to provide incentives to LA residents to one: use the app, and two: provide discounts to residents from supporting local businesses. Incentives will however be only be used for the Food and Fitness aspect of the application. Within the Health option, we will create an AI (same program with different variables) that determines preventative care for basic ailments through the use of over 1,000,000 data points from past clinical care while providing access to local and state healthcare services from which to receive care from for more severe cases.","Our project may seem like a simple application however it uses complex algorithms, not introduced to a free market before, to target an entire city rather than just concentrate on a specific group of individuals. Los Angeles will be the first city to have an app dedicated to its’ residents and their well being. It seeks to bring preventative healthcare to all (through multiple methods) while basic clinical care onsite to others and access to clinical care to those with more severe cases. The software will be ready to use upon release to the public as information will already have been collected for recommendations to be made upon individualized data points. Individuals will be aware of their dietary, fitness and health habits everyday and will be provided with recommendations and incentives along the way for improvements to their health. Through the integration of social networks, LA, by 2050, will be fully aware of their eating, fitness, and health. The AI system will have more than enough data points to reference to create more sophisticated regiments for individuals. 
 
 
 By 2050 we will have a platform with an AI that can provide healthcare to much more complex cases with the wider base of data points available by then. In terms of air pollution and water metrics, we will have determined areas in LA most prone to elevated levels of air toxins and water usage through the use of sensors which can later be placed at more locations for a very low cost. We will be able to provide the city of LA within the next 5 years a thorough recommendation for improving water conservation and addressing air quality indexes. 2050 will see a less polluted city of LA after the introduction of incentive based programs (free bikes -already in progress in conjunction with local start ups, parking etc) for communities and individuals when participating in alternative transport such as biking, walking, public transport, and carpool.","Our project aims for a top-down approach. Our aim is to initially approach several regions of LA for beta testing and sensor placement. This includes but is not limited to Westwood, Santa Monica, Venice, Downtown LA, Hollywood, Beverly Hills, Pacific Palisades, East LA, and Bel Air. This project will benefit three levels within LA. It will benefit 1) the population down to single individuals, 2) their respective communities and 3) City of Los Angeles. Based on the results from receptiveness of the population, the City of LA will be given extensive review and recommendations for improvement and or addition of low cost sensors to reduce and eliminate unhealthy air quality and pollution in the city. More specifically, this program will be accessible to anyone with a mobile device or computer ( from home, work, or pocket). Those without a mobile device will be able to easily access the program through a public library as everyones profile will be unique to them and their location. There is no separation of income barrier as this project is intended to target every individual from different communities. According to the CDC, obesity rates are rising in LA County–24.3% of adults while more than 20% of students in junior high school are obese. While this program will benefit everyone, there will be several more incentivized based models for age groups between 12-18, and 18-40.","We are collaborating with a range of individuals and groups, all of whom who come from various backgrounds and expertise. All of the following collaborators are confirmed and all of whom we have worked with in the past on several successful projects. 
 UCLA Department of Medicine- Faculty members as well as leading departmental doctors will help develop the AI program for preventative and basic clinical care while advances in the program will allow for more complicated cases to be assessed by the the program. 
 UCLA Advanced Heart Failure Lab- With extensive research in social network as well as Multi-Organ Dysfunction, the lab will provide their expertise in demographic participation on a zip code level and the most effective method of targeting populations 
 UCLA School of Engineering will help acquire/ develop sensors for testing several dream metrics; walking, air, pollution, toxins etc. They will also provide us with a team of undergraduate students for continuous support throughout the development and post development phase. 
 UCLA Computer Science Department will provide us with app developers and coders who will create the UI as well as the AI program. Several students have worked for and are currently working for very successful and publicly traded startups and have extensive knowledge in AI software building and scaling such a system on a massive scale. This team will be available on hand throughout the project and after the projects success. In the past we have created for UCLA Medical Center its' first Heart Failure Calculator which uses several algorithms to determine mortality rates in patients with heart failure. 
 UCLA Sociology Department faculty members will help with analyzing complex and big data sets. 
 UCLA Life Sciences Division undergraduate students in conjunction with the School of Medicine and local fitness trainers will help develop multiple healthy dietary regiments based on user profile and needs.

4102243,Caregivers & Kids - License-Exempt & Child Inclusive Nutrition and Physical Activity Education,"UCLA's ""Hotter LA Project” pursues 100% sustainability in water, energy, and nature in the LA region by 2050.",Live,2014217,2014,,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,"Three key resources underpin the economic, social, and environmental well-being of the LA region: the energy that powers our economy, the water that supports life and activity, and the weather and physical landscapes that shape our lifestyles and culture. All three are essential to our quality of life and are deeply intertwined with climate change and the immense challenges and opportunities it represents. The world must get on a path to renewable energy to avert the most extreme consequences of climate change. Even if the transition to renewables occurs immediately, significant climate change is inevitable, and water scarcity may be its most important consequence. 
 
 Resilient communities will need to simultaneously mitigate and adapt. LA can lead the way. By becoming self-sufficient and sustainable in energy and water in harmony with the region's ecosystems and cultural identity, we will ensure our own access to these critical resources as well as a healthier and more prosperous future. Our example will drive similar transformations in urban areas across the globe and create worldwide demand for local expertise and products. 
 
 The Hotter LA Project unites dozens of UCLA’s most prominent scientists and scholars with key public and private stakeholders around a common goal: full sustainability in the LA region by 2050. By 2019, we will produce a plan detailing the new technologies and efficiencies required to obtain all energy and water from local and renewable sources in a way that’s economical, socially equitable, and supportive of the LA region’s unique biodiversity. We will map out the required actions to modernize energy, water, and transportation systems; enhance the built and natural environment; define new policy and legal frameworks; and heighten social responsibility, thereby transforming the urban fabric and mitigating the effects of climate change.
 
 In the 1-year grant period, we will focus on the following objectives:
 a) Creating a working outline of the 2019 Plan and a project management timeline
 b) Increasing the number and depth of partnerships with critical stakeholder groups
 c) Raising public awareness of and support for the effort
 
 In summary, we are committed to making all parts of the city resilient in alignment with the LA2050 goals.","Raising awareness about the Hotter LA Project, gathering support, and developing the infrastructure for this intense and complex collaboration TODAY lays the crucial foundation for the success of this project and a healthier, greener Los Angeles. We will realize benefits from these transformations long before 2050.
 
 Here’s how achieving the Hotter LA 2050 objectives makes LA the healthiest place to live in 2050:
 
 -The transition to renewable energy and a carbon-free transportation infrastructure will eliminate the public health burden associated with fossil fuel--taking us off the list of US cities with the worst air quality. 
 
 -Transformed urban spaces and cleaner oceans offer greater opportunities to be active in natural outdoor spaces where our unique biodiversity can be celebrated.
 
 -The creation of substantial bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure will provide active commuting options that improve health and quality of life—reducing the number of vehicles on the road as we currently have more than any other urban area in the world.
 
 The compound effect of these changes will result in the LA region becoming healthier, eliminating current environmental injustices so that all communities have minimal environmental health risks. We will see a notable reduction in asthma attacks, heart attacks, and premature death.","By 2050, it is estimated that 70% of the world’s population will live in cities and face the same urban environmental concerns currently present in the LA region: limited resources, smog, water waste, traffic congestion, increased heat and rising sea levels.
 
 The Hotter LA Project is designed to achieve maximum societal impact. Even before we reach the 2050 goals, the steps made in approach of 100% sustainability will have positive benefits for all citizens and communities in the entire LA region. Millions of people will have cleaner air, safe, sustainable energy and water, and improved quality of life. We expect this effort to become a model for how other megacities might achieve sustainability through goal setting and cross-sector collaboration. Lessons learned here will be shared with communities across the state, nation, and globe.","Robust partnerships with a wide variety of stakeholders are critical to the success of the project and to the eventual implementation of the 2019 Plan. Key stakeholder groups include: 
 
 Local, State, and Federal Government: LA City and County leaders and even the White House administration are aware of this project and have confirmed broad support for our goals. Members of the Hotter LA team have active research and consulting engagements with the City of Los Angeles, County of Los Angeles, and federal agencies. Critical Success Factor: We must expand relationships with all government stakeholder groups, become fluent with their complex structures, and find ways to connect beyond existing relationships to ensure that the right people are engaged, improve the feasibility of the 2050 plan, and obtain buy-in from groups that will have significant responsibility with implementation.
 
 Industry: The expansion of industry partnerships is a priority for this Project. Through early engagement of industry, we gain a greater understanding of needs and aligned interests as related to the goals of the project. Critical Success Factor: While a number of relationships currently exist, we must develop more extensive relationships with industry and foster more entity-level engagement.
 
 Philanthropy: Hotter LA represents our most ambitious fundraising effort to date. We believe that there is great opportunity to engage supporters of the university in new ways. Critical Success Factor: We must capture the imagination and commitment of individuals passionate about meeting the goals of the project.
 
 UCLA Campus and Other Universities: With full support from the UCLA Chancellor and the 140 faculty members involved, UCLA is deeply committed to this effort. Critical Success Factor: We will extend our reach outside of UCLA to include academic partners who can stimulate innovation and fill gaps.
 
 Public: We will shift our public communications from broadcasts to dialogues. With increased interaction, we hope that LA citizens will learn about the proposed project, draw inspiration from it, and get involved. Critical Success Factor: An engaged and supportive Los Angeles community is essential. 
 
 With our partners, we will create a shared vision of the future, communicate openly and directly about opportunities and challenges, increase access to all types of resources (monetary, intellectual, data, etc.), and make progress on our collective commitment to the 2050 goals.",0,

 The first action will be to invest a portion of the funds dedicated to creating further investment by government and foundations charged with advancing healthy communities measures by pragmatic and measurable means. 
 
 Scientific & Engineering Community
 We will engage with colleagues from public and private industry to develop a government briefing document. Experts will confirm the variables: numbers of cars travelling to work each day, number of miles on average for LA County, the results that could come from some local hiring percentage of the workforce. Experts will work with us to define reasonable parameters to Los Angeles and its best case for reducing emissions. The concept here is to provide insight to leaders on the type of carbon capture that is achievable, to begin creating the stage for action.
 
 Public Outreach
 Short-form video, social media and community meetings – all multilingual – will brief, educate and engage the public regarding the benefits from employer, resident and commuter perspectives. Outreach will be designed to attract start-ups and entrepreneurs, who will be part of the system making those stronger connections to employees.
 
 Government Action
 Once briefed, city officials will be asked to discuss possible employer incentives working with council leaders responsible for sustainable communities’ planning and economic development. After local hiring program briefings are established, employers will be invited to participate in the menu of incentives available on a city, county and state level. 
 
 Technology Experts
 In the first year, technology, social media, HR experts, IT engineers will be invited to begin developing the framework to create stronger connections between employers in search of local talent and residents in search of the jobs suitable to their experience at all levels. In addition, the applications that are currently available to help employers measure the emissions savings they achieve through local hiring will be assessed. 
 
 Pilot Program
 Working with data experts, we’ll identify Los Angeles’ existing emissions standing and define the potential reduction of emissions and/or improvement to air quality resulting from an initial pilot program of employees hired within a certain radius of local employers.","With each local hire, employers will help reduce miles travelled across Los Angeles’ freeways. In Los Angeles, the average 1 way trip to work is 14.3 miles. With each mile less than 14 there is a measurable reduction in emissions. Over time, these reductions will challenge the staggering economic costs of pollution in the state which have been cited to be “10 billion annually"" (Based on RAND report) The combined health and economic costs are explained below through an in-depth study by the RAND Corporation, which also stated:
 
 “The analysts identified substantial health and cost benefits from cleaner air. Nearly 30,000 hospital admissions and ER visits could have been avoided over the two-year period, with resulting savings of about $193 million. Because public insurers such as Medicare and Medi-Cal paid most of the pollution-related health care bill, they have a lot to gain from cleaner air. But employers and private insurers also have sizable financial interest in reducing air pollution. The number of adverse health events that clean air would have prevented, and the resulting savings, varied across the state, depending on the local level of pollution.” 
 
 We are starting with the worst metropolitan rankings on air quality in the nation with a tremendous health care and human cost for Californians. Local hiring can be tagged as a “preventative” health measure, improving daily life for residents with a plan that thwarts emission release. Our Local Hire initiative, once applied, will provide a new principle of urban hiring that results in shorter commutes, cleaner air, and more time for residents to improve their quality of life. 
 
 Los Angeles will be one of the first in the nation to develop a sustainable model that includes a behavioral shift that addresses traffic congestion and meets environmental, economic public policy objectives, thus creating a new path for LA's future.","Our program aims to benefit everyone. The public (children and adults at-risk by air pollutants). Local Businesses. The Environment.
 Non-Profits with A Healthy Communities' Agenda and the Government. 
 
 If you have asthma and heart disease affected by allergens and irritants living in Los Angeles, travelling through the city can be stressful and dangerous. Many lower-income residents live close to major thoroughfares and freeways where particulates and other emissions are significantly higher. They are often less able to monitor pollution-related medical problems and maintain good health due to lack of adequate health care. 
 
 Many cities across the nation, grappling with traffic impacts and attempting to define sustainable measures to deliver a measure of health in urban environments, may assess, adjust and revise the model to meet their own objectives. 
 
 According to NASA’s recent shared findings from satellite derived studies regarding NO 2 (fossil fuel emissions) show that “Even though larger cities are typically more energy efficient with lower per capita emissions, more people still translates to more pollution. For LA County’s almost 10 million residents, the concept that we can provide a method to prevent emissions from adding to existing levels of pollution should warrant support for implementing a model. http://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/nasa-scientists-relate-urban-population-to-air-pollution/#.U9V8_o1dXIo.","Fixing Angelenos Stuck in Traffic – FAST.org (Confirmed)

As the average miles lessen in Los Angeles from 14, options for alternatives become viable. 
 
 City Government | County | State (In Briefings)
 As a former city council deputy, land use planner and legislative aide, my job will be to discuss the proposal with city council members vested in economic and environmental matters and develop an incentive based program that will reward employers for the contribution to the local economy. Incentives could range from awards of recognition for leadership to financial savings. The first step is to examine what’s possible in a post-recession climate. The critical aspect to developing local hiring is to ensure that actions taken support a normal course of business rather than to attempt to control business through regulation. 
 
 TMS Transportation Demand Services (Proposed Consultant)
 I worked with TMS, a specialist in transportation management in 2009 to discuss the concept of local hiring as a transportation demand management measure and to identify a means of calculating savings in vehicle miles travelled across the city. TMS is an advisor to business and government nationally on adaptive measures and transit alternatives that solve congestion. A portion of the budget will be retained for their counsel in synthesizing the technical data and adding insight to discussions with leaders in the state on the adoption as a sustainable communities action consistent with clean air mandates.

Experts predict that the biggest risks to LA are the impacts to our aging infrastructure. Broken water pipes, downed power lines and collapsed roads could leave Angelenos without water, power or access to food for days, weeks or months, undermining the very fabric of our city. The more that communities can rely upon alternative sources of water and energy, locally grown food, and connections between neighbors, the better able we will be to survive without outside support in emergencies, and the better our everyday quality of life will be. Our team will develop a rating system that leverages existing resilience toolkits to help decision-makers implement resilience strategies for projects ranging from new construction to existing building operations at the scale of single buildings to entire neighborhoods or campuses. 
 
 Well-designed rating systems can change the world. The USGBC’s LEED systems transformed the building industry, moving green building into the mainstream. Enterprise’s Green Communities Criteria (EGC) raised the bar for affordable housing nationwide. We will build on these approaches to design a tool to take projects beyond green to true resilience. 
 
 To do this, we will assemble an Advisory Committee of diverse technical experts and community leaders. We will train two interns from LA Community College District to build capacity in resilience. We will survey two test case projects: the development of an emergency preparedness plan for LACCD, and an urban infill adaptive re-use development near a large regional infrastructure project. We will evaluate the best available existing resources from LEED, EGC, 100Resilient Cities, Los Angeles County Community Disaster Resilience Project, USRC’s CoRE program and Arup’s REDI program and others to ensure that our system builds on and complements work that is already being done. We will reference existing processes or strategies that are relevant to our target audience; where none are available, we will develop them within the scope of this project, or we will pursue additional funds or collaborators to create them. The rating system will include a process for engaging stakeholders and evaluating risks and a library of best practices and performance targets for resilience strategies. The system will balance simplicity and technical specificity so building projects can act, and will reward qualifying projects with third-party certification and recognition","LA faces many threats beyond earthquakes. Climate change will bring more drought, more heat waves, bigger storms and rising sea levels, as well as disruptions in agriculture, energy supply and other economic impacts. Add to this our aging infrastructure, rising housing costs and high unemployment. Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy have given us a preview of coming attractions of what can happen in a disaster. Without taking drastic action, LA is at risk. We must prepare for the worst by helping to create the best LA now.
 
 The good news is that resilience strategies can solve more than one problem at a time. The answer lies in making our core systems stronger, our built environment more durable, our infrastructure more distributed, and our communities more connected. For example, using reclaimed water or on-site solar power not only can support what the Resilient Design Institute founder Alex Wilson calls “passive survivability,” they also reduce utility bills and carbon emissions. Community gardens not only support a distributed food supply, they also provide fresh and healthy food, exercise and opportunities for community members to connect. Tree plantings not only provide shade in a warmed climate and help with stormwater management, they also provide cleaner air, habitat and beauty in the short term. Community-based healthcare facilities not only decentralize the location of potential first responders, they also enable broader access and programs that are tailored to local populations. And the work needed to implement all of these strategies for the future can create good jobs today. Moving toward resilience not only will prepare us for disaster, it will provide an opportunity for us to create the LA of our dreams. 
 
 The goal of the of the LA Resilience Rating System is to provide projects with a road map for tackling tough issues in ways that achieve measurable results, prepare them for disasters in the future, and enable them to recover quickly and fully to a place of health and vitality. Investing in preparation for the future means improving quality of life today.","Overall, this project’s implementation will help anyone who lives or works in or around a building that employs this rating system, improving quality of life in the near term and mitigating catastrophe in the long term. Residents and employees at participating buildings will feel the benefits most directly, but it will also help achieve the goals of property owners, developers, community development corporations and city leaders. With specific processes, best practices and performance metrics, this project has the potential to elevate the evaluation and implementation of resilience at a range of scales. 
 
 In particular the L.A. Resilience Rating System will:
 • Provide resilience-related technical guidance to our test case projects
 • Give technical guidance and recognitions to anyone working on a building-related project in the region, including building owners, developers, campuses, community groups, planning/design/construction professionals, and facilities operators 
 • Provide a process for project teams to actively engage communities within or adjacent to their projects
 • Provide clear performance criteria that can be used by those involved in evaluating, approving, regulating or funding projects, including local officials, community groups, banks and lenders, or insurance providers, in order to verify that projects reduce risks and serve the public good. 
 • Offer a usable model to other organizations and cities seeking to address resilience
 • Create an opportunity for interdisciplinary collaboration and collective learning among members of the Advisory Committee
 • Support emerging leaders from LACCD campuses and build capacity around resilience
 • Provide a resource for all USGBC and Enterprise stakeholders on topics that are not fully currently addressed by existing rating systems, including social equity and disaster preparedness","The US Green Building Council’s LA Chapter (USGBC-LA) will lead this project in collaboration with the Enterprise Community Partners Southern California office and the LA Community College District. USGBC-LA is a non-profit whose mission is to promote sustainability in Southern California’s built environment by delivering access to knowledge, resources, recognition and networking. The USGBC is the nation’s foremost environmental coalition, and innovator of the LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Rating System. 
 
 LACCD is the largest community college system in the USA with 9 campuses and 250,000 students. USGBC-LA and LACCD have been in partnership on training, building, and strengthening the green workforce in LA for the past ten years. Projects include yearly conferences, trainings on sustainable facility operations, and the City's Green Business Certification Program. LACCD is about to launch a process to develop emergency preparedness plans for each of its nine campuses. The diverse facilities, communities and programs that each campus represents will provide real world test cases for our team to consider in order to ensure that our final products are feasible, relevant and effective for a wide range of conditions. We will also offer two 6-month funded internships to LACCD students from relevant disciplines.
 
 Enterprise Community Partners is a national nonprofit community investment company providing expertise for developing affordable housing and building sustainable communities. Enterprise has worked closely with USGBC National on a variety of projects including the development of the Enterprise Green Communities Criteria. Enterprise has invested more than $1 billion in Southern California to expand the supply of green, affordable housing and is committed to advancing equitable transit-oriented development. They bring technical expertise in rating systems development as well as the direct and test case projects development, financing and implementation of new construction, adaptive reuse, renewable energy, and green infrastructure projects. 
 
 The keys to the success of this collaboration are open communication, mutual respect and a clear work plan.

4102253,Sustainable Little Tokyo: A Cultural Ecodistrict,WCLP will help the state and county expand health care to the 1 million LA residents who remain uninsured after the Affordable Care Act.,Live,2014223,2014,,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,"Western Center will help the County of Los Angeles and the State of California develop and implement specific and sweeping policy solutions to ensure health care access for the remaining uninsured. 
 
 For nearly five decades, Western Center has successfully blended effective policy advocacy and strategic impact litigation to achieve major system-wide victories for poor Californians. With offices in Los Angeles, Sacramento and Oakland, we are able to work with state and local governments and stakeholders throughout the state to achieve policy changes on behalf of millions of poor families and individuals.
 
 To address the eligible but unenrolled, we will engage in a collaborative process to create pathways that make it easier for LA residents to enroll in coverage. We will conduct detailed program analysis of Medi-Cal and Covered CA; identify procedural enrollment obstacles and inefficiencies; review enabling regulations, All County Welfare Directors Letters, notices to consumers, website designs, training materials and marketing materials; deliver detailed recommendations to policymakers and advocate for their adoption. Beyond internal systems, we will work with stakeholders who are developing media savvy messaging aimed at persuading “young invincibles” to enroll in affordable health care programs . 
 
 We will engage in local, state and national advocacy to address and resolve the family glitch issue. The most likely “fix” involves a reasonable and simple change in the definition of affordability within the Affordable Care Act to permit family members who can’t obtain affordable employer sponsored insurance coverage to access subsidies in the Exchange (Covered CA). 
 
 We will educate policymakers about the remaining uninsured, including undocumented people. We will develop helpful tips informing advocates and consumers of how to maximize underutilized resources for the remaining uninsured including county indigent care mandates under Section 17000 of the CA Welfare & Institutions the Ability to Pay program, Healthy Way LA Unmatched, Medi-Cal for DACA eligible youth, the Kaiser Permanente Child Health Program, selected Medi-Cal services, community health clinics and emergency rooms, and the Hospital Fair Pricing Act. We will simultaneously seek a system-wide solution to ensure coverage for all Angelenos, regardless of immigration status.","Healthy communities offer quality, affordable and available health care to all of its residents. Families and individuals can take advantage of preventative and primary care, rather than relying on costly emergency rooms. People have health insurance and patients don’t “fall through the cracks."" The entire community is broadly committed to expanding access and improving the quality of health care services and systems.
 
 Quite simply, Los Angeles falls short. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which ranks counties within states by the quality of the clinical care available to residents reported that in 2014 Los Angeles ranked 49th among California’s 58 counties. The Foundation cites access to care as one of the principal pathways to improve health outcomes. 
 
 By helping the state and county expand health care access, Western Center will have a direct positive effect on 1 million people in Los Angeles and simultaneously improve the health of the community at large.
 
 Expanding coverage and access makes also sound financial sense. The UCLA Center for Health Policy Research notes in their May 2014 study, A Little Investment Goes a Long Way: Modest Cost to Expand Preventive and Routine Health Services to All Low-Income Californians, that expanding coverage to those who are uninsured would cost about 2% of the state’s Medi-Cal spending and would be substantially offset by increased sales tax revenue and reduced county spending.
 
 The expansion of health care to all Los Angeles residents will not simply help people today but will establish the programs and systems that will be able to deliver high quality health care services to our community for years to come.","The project will directly benefit the 1 million people who do not currently have health care coverage. For these families and individuals, it will improve their health; limit preventable, early deaths; and reduce financial and emotional stress. As noted above they include:
 
 1. Undocumented residents (≈40%) who are not eligible for coverage under the Affordable Care Act.
 2. Families caught in the family “glitch,” that makes family coverage unaffordable for low wage workers (≈30%-40%). This means families with one or both parents working at low paid jobs and receiving individual, but not family health insurance through their employment. The current Affordable Care Act regulations provide that even if the uncovered spouse and children are financially eligible for ACA insurance and subsidies, they may not take advantage of that opportunity. Their only choice is to pay for prohibitively expensive family coverage through the employed parent’s work.
 3. Individuals eligible for but not enrolled in Medi-Cal or Covered CA (≈20%-30%). These people fall into two sub-categories: those who are eligible for free care via Medi-Cal or subsidized care through Covered CA and those who simply refuse to purchase health insurance, often believing that they don’t need it. The latter group has been dubbed “the young invincibles”, young healthy people who don’t believe they will get sick or need medical care.
 
 The project will also benefit the broader community. It will minimize uncompensated care; reduce reliance on overstretched emergency rooms, increase the health care system delivery capacity; strengthen the local economy; and improve public health.","Western Center’s partnerships with California’s 95 legal aid organizations, including 20 in Los Angeles, are well known. We deliver in-depth legal support, including technical assistance by email and phone, on-site trainings, conferences, webinars, publications and litigation support to 700 legal aid attorneys in the state. 
 
 Equally important are our longstanding, working partnerships with virtually every significant policy organization working on health care issues. This includes organizations such as Health Access, Consumers Union, California Pan-Ethnic Health Network, California Immigrant Policy Center, Insure the Uninsured, Tenants Together, Los Angeles Community Action Network, and CA Partnership. Our work is recognized and supported by the California Endowment, the California Wellness Foundation and other philanthropic organizations dedicated to improving the health of Californians.
 
 In addition, we maintain strong relationships with local, state and federal public sector stakeholders, including Covered California; the California Departments of Health Care Services, Managed Health Care, Housing and Community Development, and Social Services; County Welfare Directors Association, California State Association of Counties along with legislators and legislative staff. We are a unique highly effective voice in Sacramento representing the health care needs of low-income Californians, and collaboration is part of the fabric of our work.
 
 Three factors critical to Western Center's collaborative success are:
 1) This is a winnable but immensely complicated project with many moving parts.
 2) There are distinct yet intertwined roles for each of the partners that must be appropriately woven together.
 3) The partners will need to maintain a nimble and flexible strategy that fluidly adjusts to shifting policy currents.",0,
4102254,No More Bullying Bias and Fights: Making Schools Safe for all Los Angeles Kids & Teachers,WJC Institute for Safe and Inclusive Schools trains teachers and students to address bias and bullying and to resolve disputes positively.,Learn,2014224,2014,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,LA County,"WJC will provide a mix of programs for students and educators to teach them about bias, bullying and conflict resolution, and to give them the support needed to create and sustain safe and inclusive school environments. The ABCs of Conflict will train 40 to 60 LA County K-12 educators (at no cost to them) to resolve conflict positively, to teach their students to do the same, and to create and run peer mediation programs in their schools. Potential participants in the five-day, 30-hour The ABCs of Conflict training will complete an online application. Since ongoing support is key to sustaining a safe and inclusive school, each educator will show personal and organizational commitment to creating new or nurturing conflict resolution or anti-bias programs at her or his school. 
 
 WJC Program Director Emily Linnemeier and mediator Jason Harper will conduct Days 1-3: the basics of conflict; understanding and dealing with conflict positively; and the role of culture, identity and power in conflict. Educators will learn to use mediation and arbitration to solve conflicts; they’ll learn to set up a peer mediation program. WJC Associate Executive Director Lori Nelson and student actors from our Encompass Service Learning Class at Los Angeles County High School for the Arts will focus on bias and the educator’s role in bullying prevention and intervention on Day 4. Restorative Justice specialist Schoene Mahmood will conclude the training. 
 
 All participants will have access to Haven School Tools, an online source of information and lessons about conflict resolution, bias and bullying. The site also has talking points and videos that show the need, efficacy, and value of these programs. These materials help teachers gain support from administrators to work on creating a safe and welcoming climate.
 
 We’ll celebrate peer mediators at our annual Peer Mediation Invitational where elementary, middle and high school students can sharpen their skills in mock mediations, receive coaching and talk with peer mediators from other schools in LA County.
 
 High school mediators and their advisors will be invited to join Haven, our social network for students who are members of organizations (peer mediation groups, anti-bullying clubs, gay-straight alliances) working to make their schools safer and more inclusive. Haven gives these teens 24/7 access to videos, interactive training modules about conflict resolution and prejudice reduction,and forums.","What will an investment in WJC make happen? This year, students and educators in 50 LA County schools will learn to create more just schools and communities. They’ll make places where kids feel safe and welcomed, schools where students want to be. There will be less anger, less fear, more understanding and acceptance. Schools will be places where kids can achieve, where they learn to their full potential.
 
 The National Education Association estimates that every day, tens of thousands of kids choose to stay home and not go to school. They are frightened, desperately unhappy. To these students, school is a place where they are not safe, where they are not wanted. It’s not a place to learn. They don’t do well, they act out, get suspended and fall behind academically and emotionally. Then they drop out...or they stay, miserable and distracted, never achieving their full potential. Instead, let’s make school a place to learn!
 
 The ABCs of Conflict, Peer Mediation Invitational, Haven and Haven School Tools teach kids, teens and adults to change the ways they think about differences and how they respond to conflict. Those lessons – about solving conflicts collaboratively, that you don’t have to be afraid or hateful of difference – go home. They go into the community.
  
 Much of a child’s life is spent in the classroom. His or her performance there has ramifications far into the future – in terms of socioeconomics, health, happiness. But too often educators and students are unschooled about how to resolve disputes, even small ones that disrupt the learning environment, or how to understand and accept difference and to work against bullying and bias. 
 
 That’s where WJC programs make a lasting difference. Educators and students learn about conflict, bullying and bias…how it plays out in class and on campus, how she or he can stop it. Some teachers even start student-run mediation programs. Teens working to make their schools safe and welcoming are supported by peers as part of our social network exclusively for high school students and their advisers. Teachers, students, families – anyone with a stake in resolving conflicts peacefully and making schools safe – have online access to lessons and helpful tips.
 
 This is the future you’re creating for Los Angeles with an investment in WJC as part of LA2050: schools where kids are safe and happy and achieve to their full potential, communities that welcome rather than intimidate.","Forty to 60 K-12 educators from schools across Los Angeles County will participate at WJC headquarters in a five-day, 30-hour session of The ABCs of Conflict. WJC will select a group of participants that reflects a variety of experiences and perspectives. Educators will represent diverse school types – public, charter, and secular and non-secular private – and a range of socioeconomics, ethnicity and race. The majority will teach underserved students. This selection enriches the training, creating the potential for both positive and difficult interactions based on difference – an element that underlies conflict and that educators and students often do not know how to address in a positive way.
 
 On average, each educator will teach 150 students a year. That means that the 40-60 educators trained in The ABCs of Conflict – in solving disputes positively and working against bias and bullying – will directly and positively affect 9000 students. In turn, these students will have better interactions with countless others at school and beyond.
 
 Another 30-hour session of The ABCs of Conflict will comprise on-site training for the full 15-member staff of LAUSD K-5 Village Charter Academy in Canoga Park. The Academy is opening in August 2014. The school’s co-directors have invited WJC to help create, from day one, a culture of inclusion and safety. The Academy will enroll up to 250 students, the majority being English learners from underserved populations. 30-40 4th and 5th graders will be trained as peer mediators. Again, they will positively affect family, friends and community.
 
 The approximately100 peer mediators at our Peer Mediation Invitational attend elementary, middle and high schools throughout Los Angeles County. WJC will invite current and former participants of The ABCs of Conflict to send their student mediators to the event, and will also invite students from any LA County peer mediation program. In addition, dozens of adult mediators, educators and judges and lawyers from the WJC Board volunteer to coach, mediate and present.
 
 Approximately 50 high school groups (500 students and advisors) that are addressing bullying, prejudice or violence issues will join Haven social network next year. Additionally, more than 1000 teachers, parents, students, grandparents –anyone interested in understanding conflict resolution, bias and bullying and what an individual can do – will use Haven School Tools.","WJC depends on collaborators – funders, participants and program specialists – to help create and implement our programs. We seek funding from individuals, foundations and corporations that share our commitment to creating schools that are safe and welcoming and that in turn create a Los Angeles that is more civil, just and peaceful. For example, WJC is committed to delivering The ABCs of Conflict at no cost to educators. In addition to individual, foundation and corporate support, WJC will encourage districts and individual schools to help defray costs through providing professional development funds that replace the modest stipend WJC gives teachers as part of this program since they typically attend on their own time. Village Charter Academy, with the full backing of its co-directors, has already agreed to include this program in their teacher training and to assist with raising funds; they are collaborating with us to create a healthy, safe and inclusive school environment.
 
 Our Encompass Service Learning Class is a collaboration with Los Angeles County High School for the Arts (LACHSA). Student actors and artists from LACHSA demonstrate the impact of homophobia, racial bias and bullying on the classroom; they work in our Peer Mediation Invitational; Creating Bias-Free Classrooms; Haven and Haven School Tools programs.
 
 Haven is currently being tested by a volunteer team of 50 students and educators from LACHSA, Social Justice Schools: Global Issues Academy and University High School. They test the site and report needed fixes to the program consultant who is creating the site structure. The testers also evaluate content and technology to ensure that WJC is creating a user-friendly and youth-empowering product that addresses the needs of high school students committed to creating better schools.
 
 WJC values collaborations with the leadership and staff of individual schools. A single educator cannot create and/or sustain a safe and inclusive school; administrators and other school staff members must also support conflict resolution as a way to create a school climate that promotes learning. We look for this collaboration as we implement each program: educators who have the support of their administration to start an anti-bully or anti-bias or peer mediation program; a principal’s validation that students and advisers from his or her school should participate in Haven; a school’s suggestion that parents check out Haven School Tools.",0,
4102255,CUT MY COMMUTE: CHANGING LAS QUALITY OF LIFE THROUGH LOCAL HIRE,"When kids are free of trauma and abuse, their brains form architecture key to lifelong physical, mental & social health--we know how to help",Live,2014225,2014,,,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,,"Through it's therapy and consultation work WIN affects the lives of 1000s of individuals yearly, and the core of our program is our intensive clinical work: WIN will provide in-home, dyadic child-parent psychotherapy and individual therapy for parents along with integrated health, early care/education and social services through our referring partner agencies to 350-400 children, parents and family members annually. Our bilingual, master’s-level therapists will work with young children (prenatal through 3+) and parents whose relationships have been disrupted by trauma, neglect and mental illness to affect substantive, measurable improvement in 1) secure attachment, 2) children’s social, emotional and cognitive development, and 3) parental stress. While WIN therapists provide these direct services, our partner agency case managers ensure that families get intensive, cross-agency early care, social services and health clinic support before and throughout the therapeutic process, such that unmet basic needs don’t interrupt treatment. We will manage the entire network of services in “real time” via WIN’s innovative communications infrastructure and web-based data system to make sure families facing substantial challenges get what they need, when they need it, without the service barriers of an agency working in isolation, and without the “red tape” typical of cross-agency collaborations. Along with these services, WIN will help families build relationships and social networks though our monthly Family Night gatherings. And, in order to positively affect the lives of children and families beyond the geographic reach of our direct services, we will also provide professional-level early childhood mental health training to clinicians and providers throughout LA County, and mental health consultation to Early Head Start programs and other agencies, including Venice Family Clinic, Westside Children’s Center, El Nido Family Center, Pediatric Therapy Center and St. Joseph Center.","Just like adults, infants and toddlers suffer from mental health issues. But untreated, impacts can be far more pernicious and entrenched, developing into lifetimes of mental and physical illness, behavior and educational problems, with root causes deeply embedded in brain structures and chemistry. Children’s brains are particularly vulnerable to stress and trauma during this critical period from prenatal through three years old, when brain architectures are being formed, but therapy during this window is also more impactful than at other times in the human lifespan. WIN’s early therapeutic and case management interventions work to prevent long-term, ill effects for children and families, as well as ongoing social costs to educational, medical and legal systems. 
 
 Early childhood mental health issues are often caused or exacerbated by parental/caregiver lack of attunement, or abuse or neglect resulting from caregivers’ own depression, unresolved traumas or other mental health issues. By providing both in-home, child-parent dyadic therapy and individual therapy for parents, as well as critical, integrated basic services including health care, food pantry, employment training, and early intervention for special needs, WIN comprehensively addresses intergenerational mental health issues and unmet basic needs, while re-attuning child-parent relationships, building resilience, and helping families move on from past traumas.
 
 Since the strongest indicator of the type of relationship a child will have with a parent, is the relationship that parent had with their parents, abuse and neglect have a tendency to move from generation to generation, bringing along with it the cognitive, mental health and physical health issues and societal costs associated with toxic stress (see Harvard University Center on the Developing Child's research : http://developingchild.harvard.edu/key_concepts/toxic_stress_response/). However, if children are securely attached to parents, their brains are in the best possible position to develop to their full potential--and their children are highly likely to benefit from the same strong, resilient parenting. The research is clear: if every kid in LA has a happy childhood, LA becomes more creative, more innovative, less violent and a better place for all of us to live, in 2050--and beyond.","WIN targets low-income families with children prenatal through three who are facing attachment issues across 26 Los Angeles Country zip codes from Inglewood to Hollywood, Venice to West LA. Annually, our intensive clinical program serves 350-400 individual children, parents and family members who are facing critical challenges (approximately 75-90 families). All (100%) of our clients are from low income families across 26 local zip codes including Inglewood and Mar Vista. Of current WIN clients, 83% are Latino (most are recent immigrants from Mexico and Central America who speak Spanish or indigenous languages); 2% are multiracial (Asian/African American/Latino); 5% are Caucasian; 8% are African American; and 2% have other ethnic backgrounds). We typically work with families for 12-18 months—and the process is an intensive one. Our consultation program provides 700 hours of direct service to 125-150 staff of 5 agencies in LA to affect the lives of 1000s of additional children and families annually.","Since 2006, WIN’s network partners have included Venice Family Clinic, Westside Children’s Center and St. Joseph Center. Respectively, they bring a host of high-quality medical care; early care and early intervention services; and food pantry, housing support and homelessness support to our shared clients. All of the families who come to WIN are referred from our three partners, and that allows us to ‘nest’ our intensive mental health care within the context of their home-agencies services. WIN’s partnership relationships are some of the most deeply rooted we’ve encountered, and are critical to our success with families. 
 
 All WIN families receiving therapy get a home visiting case manager from their home agency, as well as a Master’s level WIN therapist. Because WIN pays the salaries of partner-agency case managers, our web based data system rates services on a monthly basis, which helps ensure high quality care. Because WIN releases its clinical outcomes biannually, our partners know how their families are doing in our care.
 
 Lead clinical staff from each agency and WIN meet to coordinate work at our monthly Program Committee Meetings, and partner agency case managers and supervisors, plus WIN therapists and our clinical director meet weekly for shared case reviews. WIN trains its partner agency staff with 20-40 hours of multi-disciplinary training each year, plus provides dedicated, weekly mental health consultation to the Early Head Start and/or programmatic staff of each of our partner agencies.
 
 Thanks to WIN’s HIPAA-compliant data system (a system that has become the model for one the state of Connecticut has adopted for its early childhood mental health services), WIN and its partners coordinate care for each family though a jointly prepared on-line service plan that is updated by each agency regularly. The system reports monthly on how well we’re helping families achieve their goals, and allows staff to communicate in ‘real-time’ regarding family progress—as well as to coordinate care during emergencies. The system tabulates our biannual outcomes, gathering data input by staff at various levels from all partners, and reminds case managers and therapists when screenings, assessments and releases are due.",1,

We work with school district officials to gain permission to distribute materials to elementary school children. Our brochures and reply cards are given to the schools and sent
 home with children with a plan to have the children's caregivers learn about gun safety and how to TALK about it. We are putting together a coalition of funders to support the project in specific school districts. We have approval of Long Beach Unified, LAUSD and backing of the City of Los Angeles in addition to lawmakers and law enforcement. We just need the financial backing to get the lifesaving materials in place.","Programs like this work! The evidence is clear and substantial: public
 education campaigns, such as those for seat belt use and anti-smoking, resulted in significant behavioral change. We believe that The Talk Project will produce the same life-saving results! Here are some interesting facts we include in our TALK brochure from a few
 studies conducted regarding guns: In 2013, in the United States, more than 5 children a month under the age of 12 – more than 1 a week – were killed at a family member’s home or at a friend’s home by guns that were improperly stored and secured. Research shows that storing guns locked and unloaded reduces the risk of both injuries and suicide by about 70%.
 – Journal of the American Medical Association (2005)
 The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that the safest home for a family is a home without guns. If there is a gun in the home, the gun should be stored unloaded and locked, with ammunition stored separately.
 – American Academy of Pediatrics Policy Statement: Firearm-Related Injuries in the Pediatric Population (October 2012)
 22% of children who live in a house with a gun handled a gun without their parents’ knowledge.

 WAGV not only intends to open an affirmative dialogue about guns and gun safety where proactive and preventative
 discussions did not exist, we expect to save lives as a result of this campaign.
 According to LA County Public Health, firearms-related deaths in our county are higher than the national average.","In order to reap the benefits of other healthy activities, we must work on TALKing about guns to ensure our community is healthy today and in the future. 
 Research has shown that we must reach children when they are still in elementary school to be able to make change happen.
 Our education and safety campaign will enable us to assist in opening a dialogue about guns where one does not exist. Our specific audience will be caregivers of young children to help them learn about protecting the children in their care.","So far, we have collaborated with All Saints Church in Pasadena to launch our campaign in Pasadena schools. They provided the funding to make this happen as well as opening a door to the school district. We have worked with All Saints for 20 years and their partnership has been invaluable. 
 
 Occidental Entertainment Group Holdings is a new partnership formed in 2014.

4102260,The Junior Fellows & The Soft Studio,"The Soft Studio, a pop-up incubator & pre-accelerator, is an inflatable research space for budding social entrepreneurs in junior college.",Learn,2014227,2014,,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,"The Soft Studio aims to be the nexus of collaboration between Los Angeles County based junior colleges, four year institutions and startup accelerators with the ultimate goal of helping a student contextualize their education and actualize their idea. The Soft Studio seeks to be perfectly positioned - both literally and figuratively - to increase the mere 13% transfer rate from the junior colleges to four year institutions. 
 
 When the Soft Studio sets up shop on a junior college campus the inflatable pop-up research space allows our team of mentors to personally interact with each student and help them identify their inherent strengths and intrinsic motivations. We provide access to the appropriate resources, prompt discussions, plan workshops, facilitate role playing and conduct creative exercises all to invoke self reflection and the forging of new connections.
 
 To generate these insights we guide students through the five stages of design thinking — discovery, interpretation, ideation, experimentation and evolution — as they try to provide a new perspective or propose a solution for the social problem of their focus. 
 
 After the student has taken inventory of their existing skills and knowledge sets, built creative confidence and gone through all the stages of design thinking they can attempt membership to the Soft Studio and become a Junior Fellow. Membership will yield more resources, seed-funding and continually advising until an idea is ready to go to market.","We’ve heard it all before; the US economy will never be as robust as the last generation’s, global competition has lead to the outsourcing of even our white collar jobs, the internet has eaten away at every major business model and the U.S is lagging in educational rankings but scores highest in student debt. Not to mention that we Millennials are rejecting the social conventions that built this country while on track to becoming the most educated generation in American history with the least amount of “opportunities.”
 
 But, we’re a bit more optimistic than what these catastrophic cliches would have us believe. The Millennials have created a world where we can crowdfund ideas, crowdsource a task, create compelling content in a few strokes with virtually no funding and a wifi signal is all we need to connect and share our lives. We can start a business within days, raise awareness for a cause within hours and delve into the digital archives to learn about any topic at a moment’s notice.
 
 In years prior, money was a major prerequisite to most creation but the economies of scale that the internet has made possible leaves only restrictions of the imagination. How do you teach someone to come up with the next socially disruptive technology? How do you prepare students for jobs that have not been created yet? How do you help someone spot an opportunity?
 
 Currently, as a stopgap measure, we co-teach the Junior Fellows Program, a transdisciplinary research seminar that empowers students to craft new insights into social phenomenons, at Woodbury University. Students are selected after submitting a research proposal making an inquiry about a major societal problem such as food deserts in low income communities, the rise of autism or blatant election fraud in developing countries — social problems that can’t be understood from solely one disciplinary lens making a transdisciplinary approach necessary.
 
 For higher education institutions to remain a viable economic option they have to help students be self-directed learners who use procedural knowledge, analytic abilities and strategy to synthesize prior experience to creatively generate original work that will result in the formation of new knowledge.
 
 The Soft Studio is our attempt to reach beyond our campus and use our methodology to cultivate and empower emerging leaders county-wide. We hope to activate education for the purposes of social innovation.","The Soft Studio targets the crop of millennials who, currently floating in and out of junior college, are in a distinct predicament of wanting to pursue something of personal significance but feel anxious over the diminishing options in this increasingly automated and global economy. 
 
 Our pre-accelerator is a scalable and approachable solution for any junior college student because we first redefine social entrepreneurship as turning “problems into pay.” The Soft Studio is very frank in its approach to the sometimes idealistic notions of social entrepreneurship. We believe students can both provide a very valuable solution to a real world problem and still fulfill their needs for economic stability and growth at the same time.
 
 Often junior community college students on the lower end of GPA spectrum find the front loaded General Education requirements irrelevant or unrelated to their interests which can lead to increased chances of dropping out. Given the recent surge in research on early intervention and its effects on retention, the Soft Studio will focus on students who may not fit comfortably into the sequence of higher education but who may be more entrepreneurial in spirit. 
 
 Although the Soft Studio’s goal is to provide practical and profitable ideas around a student centered problem, we use the studio as an intervention to also establish creative confidence for all participants who complete the workshop.
 
 Our students have gone on to take their research to inform a business plan, serve as the foundation for a non-profit or be the motivation for product design. Ultimately, we want to help them develop a strategic plan for their life’s work that will enable them to be the type of ‘career mash-up artist’ that will thrive in this contemporary environment.","The Soft Studio seeks to be the intermediary between all the junior colleges county-wide, regional four year institutions and the local network of startup accelerators to establish a pipeline of support for emerging social entrepreneurs.",0,

While girls have enjoyed learning songwriting at Disney Hall and poetry at the Autry Museum, we have seen that girls need the consistency of a calm and positive space that’s just for them.
 
 In the fall, WriteGirl will move its headquarters to a 2,100 square foot space in the new Goodwill Community Enrichment Center in Glassell Park, near downtown LA. This space will not only house the WriteGirl offices, but a large area will be built as a library and writing center for teen girls – a safe and exciting place where girls will want to connect and learn.
 
 The Write Place for Girls will be a comprehensive afterschool writing and college guidance program for teen girls, offering small group workshops, one-on-one mentoring, special guest speakers, innovative writing activities, film screenings, group discussions and quiet reading and writing time. All programming will be offered at no cost to participants. To implement this program we will conduct extensive outreach throughout Los Angeles, including students, parents/families and schools. WriteGirl will expand its volunteer base to provide ample mentors, as well as recruit and train additional staff members to manage programs and members, develop new curriculum and establish new community partnerships.
 
 This new Write Place for Girls will be a center for creativity, collaboration and community for LA teen girls. WriteGirl is about transformation. When girls are given the space, time and support to just be themselves and say what they feel, all the while surrounded by creative and dedicated mentors, they excel and their confidence soars. We know that this new space, and the exciting programming it will offer, will give girls a foundation for individual growth.
 
 This grant would support staffing and outreach needed to double the amount of programming hours WriteGirl offers. Girls in our Core Mentoring Program currently receive 10 hours of programming per month through group workshops and one-on-one mentoring. In contrast, the Write Place for Girls afterschool program will offer a minimum of 30 hours of group programming monthly, in addition to 90 hours of mentoring time. WriteGirl leverages the skills of hundreds of women writers to inspire teen writers, training them to lead workshops and mentor girls individually and in small groups.","WriteGirl is an esteemed educational model for organizations across the country. In 2013, WriteGirl received the National Arts and Humanities Youth Program Award, the highest national honor awarded to exemplary afterschool and out-of-school time programs from across the country. In 2014, WriteGirl Executive Director Keren Taylor was named a CNN Hero. In expanding WriteGirl’s presence through this new Write Place for Girls, WriteGirl will be a more visible inspiration for other nonprofits and educational institutions throughout Los Angeles, helping to make 2050 a time when all youth have inspiring places and mentors to guide them to their full potential. 
 
 For 13 years, WriteGirl has been an important gathering place – a sort of town square for girls to connect with other girls, meet accomplished women and be inspired; a place to stand up for their ideas and ideals and most importantly, to celebrate their own unique voices and identities. Research supports that girls, who may be overly self-critical in the presence of teen boys and men, learn best from other girls and women. Girls learning in single-sex environments are more self-confident, have heightened career aspirations, develop broader interests, are more willing to accept challenges, engage in more leadership opportunities and embrace achievement in academics, the arts and sports.
 
 The Write Place for Girls is designed to meet the unique needs of teen girls, expanding on what WriteGirl has been building and refining for over a decade. We always keep it fun, fresh and creative, but at its core, WriteGirl is a rare and vital pathway for girls to find their way forward, to grow confident and clear in who they are, what they believe and how their ideas and choices matter, in their families, communities and in the world. The center will offer a lending library of books on writing as well as college entrance handbooks, special guest speakers, computer and internet access, specialized workshops in everything from resume-writing to novel writing clinics and field trips to LA landmarks. 
 
 Teen participants will be published in WriteGirl’s award-winning anthologies and on the WriteGirl blog. WriteGirl teens are increasingly published in many prominent outlets and featured as guest performers throughout the greater Los Angeles region, from events sponsored by Mayor Eric Garcetti to public readings at Skylight Books, the Los Angeles Public Library and onstage at the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books.","Building this center for girls in Northeast Los Angeles is a deliberate choice, recognizing the urgent need for creative programming for diverse youth in the area. Glassell Park, Atwater Village, Eagle Rock, Montecito Heights, Highland Park and Cypress Park have very few community centers to serve this low-income, high-density region of LA. Less than a dozen community centers serve the 243,000 residents in this area, and only several offer academic and creative programs for teens.
 
 The large schools in the region are unable to serve the individual needs of teen girls, such as offering specific college application and financial aid assistance, help with family or emotional challenges or even academic and literacy skill development. Guidance counselors, charged with facilitating the college application process, often are assigned hundreds of students, prohibiting access to higher education. 
 
 Many of the girls in our program are facing some of the most intense challenges a teen girl can face, such as pregnancy, incarceration, unstable home environments, clinical depression, suicide attempts and homelessness. WriteGirl provides a sanctuary and positive atmosphere that builds skills and confidence, sending girls into the world with the tools to succeed. WriteGirl fosters a powerful intercultural exchange among ethnically and economically diverse participants, allowing unique cross-generational relationships to develop between girls and women who would otherwise never meet. 
 
 Continuing WriteGirl’s longstanding policy of inclusion, all teen girls in Los Angeles County will be welcome to participate at workshops and events. The Write Place for Girls program will make a focused effort to enroll girls specifically from Northeast Los Angeles communities in a roughly five-mile radius of the Goodwill Enrichment Center. WriteGirl will have a greater opportunity to connect with parents and the surrounding community as this unique space offers many family-friendly amenities, including ample parking and a cafe, that will make parents feel welcome to wait while their girls participate in program activities.","WriteGirl has developed relationships with dozens of partners, including the Goodwill Enrichment Center, the Los Angeles Times, Fox Studios, Writers Guild of America, and others that provide wide-ranging resources from venues to volunteers to financial support. We have worked with most of our partners for many years, and they have increased their support as we have grown. Our newest partner, the Goodwill Community Enrichment Center, represents much more than a new space, but a powerful collaboration for hundreds of youth and their families.
 
 Goodwill is offering far-reaching support, including daily security, affordable onsite catering, meeting spaces, staff support and ample free parking for 400 vehicles. We haven’t even moved in yet and we are already collaborating with Goodwill by leading writing workshops at Goodwill sponsored youth events and bringing several WriteGirl events to the facility.
 
 We have dreamed about creating a center for girls, and this Write Place for Girls center will allow us to fulfill that vision. The move will be more than just a physical one. It signifies an important next step in our organization’s development and exemplifies the kind of partnerships we hope to cultivate in the future. This move symbolizes what we’ve strived so hard to achieve and it illustrates the trajectory of our growth.
 
 Three factors that are critical to success in all our partnerships: 1) Financial health in order to remain stable and support each other. 2) Similar values – for example, positivity and respect are key components in building community and successful programs. 3) Making decisions with an eye to the future, and having a shared vision for the health of Los Angeles. After all, 2050 is not that far away!",0,

We’ll particularly focus on gaining participation of traditionally underrepresented young adults including young Latinos, young African-Americans, young parents, community college and other non-traditional students, foster youth, young immigrants, and young workers. The Tour stops and stories will be both compelling and timely, and will drive significant media coverage to the issue and to accompanying solutions. At the same time, our policy team will provide the background research needed to accompany the Tour and resulting Agenda.","Our Tour stops will also provide a means for the most impacted young adults to offer feedback on and build support for state and local workforce development solutions amongst relevant stakeholders, including employers. Together these policies will help to shape our policy agenda, which we can highlight in our networks and through the media, and build public. Our 5 LA Tour Stops will focus specifically on local challenges and local solutions. In addition, Young Invincibles will publish research predicting the economic consequences of youth unemployment in Los Angeles and localized specific youth unemployment fact sheets, providing participants at tour stops the ability to localize the serious challenges facing our generation.","Our project will benefit:
 
 - The trained young leaders who can advocate for our agenda going forward.
 - Policymakers and stakeholders as they gain an understanding of key issues and challenges facing young people seeking employment pathways.
 - Young unemployed and underemployed adults from the communities we focus on.","Young Invincibles has a strong track record of working effectively and closely with diverse partners, from local service providers to statewide advocates to employers, across all our campaigns. For this project, our goal is to partner with no less than 5 organizations already advocating for and addressing the needs of unemployed and underemployed young adults in Los Angeles. In each community on the Tour, we will work with local partners to amplify the voices of unemployed, underemployed, and undereducated youth in the community and their desire to work. We also intend to incorporate employers in the conversation and stakeholder engagement, as we know that it is important to include them in the conversation.",0,
4102267,Vision Zero Los Angeles: safe streets for healthy living,"Convert a former mechanic shop into a center for sustainable demonstration, ecological skills, and land art exhibitions, called The Shed.",Live,2014230,2014,,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"Northwest Pasadena, Altadena","Zanja Madre is a non-profit organization based in Los Angeles County that aims to impart how the built environment directly impacts the quality of our lives. We provide classes, workshops, installations and exhibitions centered around the landscape, including watershed, food system, and land art, at our 30,000 square foot space called “The Shed” in Northwest Pasadena. Barren landscapes in turn create barren communities, which have led to increased violence, health disparities, and the depletion of fresh water supplies, increased urban runoff, and groundwater pollution. We act on the knowledge that the landscape is one of the first opportunities to repair decades of poor design practices and policies.","Since 2012 we have been working on converting our former commercial auto mechanic shop into an ecologically friendly and inspirational community space called ""The Shed."" We have designs for sustainable renovation, including installing a green roof, food forest, rain barrels, removing impermeable asphalt and concrete, installing habitat water conserving gardens, green living walls, converting shipping containers into workshops and studios, a commercial kitchen for harvesting, food preservation, and nutrition education as well as other improvements that will provide a sustainable demonstration, training, and inspirational center for Los Angeles County.
 
 With a grant from LA 2050 we can amplify the facilities of The Shed to host educational classes that promote our three-point approach to watershed restoration, ""slow it, spread it, sink it,"" in order to reduce urban runoff, replenish groundwater, combat the drought, educate our community about the water crisis and eventually heal the watershed. 
 
 Los Angeles is not a desert, but a Mediterranean climate with fresh water springs and aquifers that are not getting recharged from the innocuous development of concrete and lawns. Through courses like reeducating professional plumbers in greywater and rainwater harvesting, block-by-block lawn removal, and impermeable hardscape removal, we can heal the watershed, putting fresh water back into the landscape, instead of diverting it to the channelized LA River and straight out to the ocean. We are all tied together through the quantity (how much) and quality (how well) we utilize our natural resources. Water conservation is paramount to our ability to play, connect, live, create and learn especially during a time of one of the worst drought in California history. 
 
 We plan on having the on-site examples (sustainable demonstration gardens), hands on classes (ecological education for professionals and invididuals), as well as events and art exhibits (focused on land, urban and earth art) to have a holistic approach to long term watershed restoration and “urban healing.”
 
 We need water for a vibrant future and with this grant we can help to inspire, and transform Los Angeles and build a place that will demonstrate the potential power of true sustainability.","Inspired by the name of the original earthwork aqueduct that brought water from the LA River in 1781. The Zanja Madre was a low impact system that brought water for both domestic and irrigation use for the “Pueblo de Nuestra Senora La Reina de Los Angeles.” 
 
 Zanja Madre is a local historic metaphor for the eternal spring of renewal and community. To remind Angelenos of a geographic history and to inspire socially responsible sustainable landscapes that encourage health, safety, community, connection, and recharge local groundwater supplies, and encourage water conservation. 
 
 73 feet of the original Zanja Madre (mother ditch) was recently unearthed in the Blossom Plaza project in Chinatown in April of 2014 underneath the old Little Joe’s restaurant. Most of the archaeological ruin was removed, but parts will be exhibited at the Los Angeles State Historic Park and Metabolic Studios. 
 
 By providing a place like The Shed, a sustainable venue for people to come and experience the benefits of ecologically sound principles, permaculture, placemaking and provides hands on examples of a landscape that feels good, benefits health, increases safety, creates habitat and provides a campus for ecological education in LA County. By providing the public with reasonable and affordable seminars, we want to help with educating our community on the benefits of rainwater harvesting, urban agriculture and water conservation, and tie together environmental and ecological content with earth, land and urban art. 
 
 The unique play between and arts, education and environmental organization at The Shed will create a space for the opportunity for many different communities to engage and interact with each other and build collaborations across diverse fields. We aim to protect our waterways, create more open space, build a sustainable environment, fostering cultural diversity and inclusivity and help folks find new ways to repurpose their skills and talents to “help Los Angeles become the best place in the world to learn, create, play, connect – and the healthiest place to live.”","The Shed sustainable venue, classes and exhibits, will benefit the children, adults, senior citizens, professionals, individuals, families, and communities of Los Angeles, especially Northwest Pasadena, Altadena, North East Los Angeles, and the San Gabriel Valley. Our project will also benefit: the unemployed; plumbing, landscape design professionals, contractors; students, landscape architecture and permaculture design graduates. 
 
 Events at The Shed over the past year have already brought over 1,500 attendees with just ten events with visitors from San Diego, the inland empire and even out of state. 
 
 We have had a diverse and inclusive list of local, national and international presenters. Zanja Madre the operating nonprofit, is a female and minority owned business, and we aim to be inclusive and help champion more diversity in sustainability, and the arts. We feel confident that we will continue to attract as well as reflect the incredible diversity of Los Angeles.","We have worked with all of our proposed and confirmed partners to the project. 
 
 Factors that are critical to the success of our proposed collaboration are outlining: 1) Memorandum of understandings 2) Mutual benefit to ensure commitment 3) Milestones/metrics

4102007,A traveling documentary film festival revitalizing public spaces with free community events.,Fosters community & starts cross-cultural dialogues via a mobile cinema platform that showcases nonfiction narrative films.,Connect,2015007,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050connect/projects/BringAmbulante2CA.html,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,Santa Clara and Boyle Heights,"Ambulante USA is a nonprofit based in Los Angeles that focuses on supporting and promoting documentary film as a tool for social and cultural transformation. One of the principal programs, Ambulante California, is an annual film festival tour that travels to areas with limited access to film in an effort to diversify and democratize documentary culture. Its aim is to reach a broader audience by screening films in a wide array of alternative venues and offering its programming for free. In partnership with community organizations, the goal is to create unique exhibition spaces and make accessible stories that reflect LA communities’ diverse heritage and enhance cross-cultural appreciation of other viewpoints.","For Ambulante USA and its director, Christine Davila, the process of identifying, meeting and nurturing alliances with local organizations is a fundamental and never-ending process. The organization’s traveling platform and grassroots personal outreach finds a wealth of humanistic and social service organizations compassionately serving its base. Ambulante California aims to be a cultural aggregator of this network by promoting the work of each partner and in turn strengthening the collective interdisciplinary efforts to meet their goals. This speaks to the community base aspect.
 
 By design, Ambulante California is a participatory platform that grows to meet the increasing level of public engagement and response to it. At each screening Ambulante USA invites local businesses, artisans and artists to be part of the program. We develop and activate our audiences to creatively involve their community, and influence the type of festival event they want to experience. For instance, through Ambulante California ’s website the public has the opportunity to vote on where they would like to see a screening event take place. The general public is invited to submit their short films to the festival programmers to consider selecting as part of the program. Audience members are surveyed to ask what kind of films they would like to see programmed. This speaks to the audience driven aspect, interactive and feeding the model to fine tune it to adapt it best to serve the communities needs and wants.
 
 In order to distill the complexities and provide a deeper context for discussing films’ themes and issues, Ambulante California invites experts in correlated fields to moderate conversation with the filmmaker and audience. Ambulante USA believes in enriching the cultural activity and missions of other nonprofits. Collaboration with private and public organizations is at the core of Ambulante’s model. This serves to provide a contextualized space to engage in dialogue and inform a critical society.
 
 Ambulante California also stimulates the revitalization of urban public spaces to foster neighborhood community. By inhabiting our public spaces as town halls to discuss necessary topics or to discover a variety of viewpoints, it indicates to local government the need to invest and sustain clean, secure recreational parks and plazas.","Ambulante USA in the California context seeks to integrate its participatory platform with the diverse ecosystem of sub-cultures found within the sprawling and decentralized population to foster artistic expression and connect communities.
 
 Today, there is strong desire to link the fragmented in Greater Area of Los Angeles. There is no other traveling film festival in Los Angeles that reaches out directly to low income communities and the general public in an effort to bring a relevant curation of non-fiction film programming for free. Since the nature of the festival is to be constantly in motion, the vast potential to reach diverse, multicultural and fragmented audiences is particularly potent. Another unique aspect of Ambulante California is that it is by nature inclusive. Ambulante’s amorphous virtue and open-sourced development consistently forges mutually beneficial collaborations with local, private and public organizations. 
 
 Although a number of film festivals in Los Angeles offer outdoor free community screenings as part of the overall program, this is the main component of Ambulante USA and Ambulante California. 
 
 Ambulante California offers an entertaining, stimulating, thought-provoking and educational movie-going alternative to the limited choices found in commercial outlets, especially for working class families and low to moderate income communities in Los Angeles. 
 
 The festival tour may take place once a year, but the nonprofit’s plans include a year round program of monthly screenings on a smaller scale with local community and institutes. The intention is to create a movement in Los Angeles of “Ambulantes” or residents who can share using the power of documentary cinema, who can discover new public spaces by attending screenings in safe and makeshift public spaces, and who are transformed by the dialogue generated in their own communities.","While the City and County of Los Angeles has a vibrant social and fine art scene, the reality is there is a high density of decentralized populations in the greater metropolitan area that is often overlooked: residents who do not have the resources to access a variety of culture and art exchange either because of the price of admission or exclusive settings. Ambulante USA addresses this extreme disparity in accessibility by going directly into these communities to offer interactive documentary events for free, with the consciousness of transforming the cultural exchange to each new geographical and social context. 
 
 Rather than serving one specific demographic, the model attracts and brings a cross section of the public together to share an experience, resulting in a resonant and unparalleled connection among the fragmented sprawl in California. The organization will venture to areas traditionally marginalized, like the Skid Row area, and concentrated Spanish language speaking neighborhoods. Ambulante USA’s goal is to integrate all residents, especially those systematically left out of the conversations that documentary film provokes and reflects. 
 
 Beyond the projected audience of the 10,000 people we expect to reach, the most consequential impact is the diversity and multi-tier of class, gender, age and race the attendance figure represents. In addition to the audiences, the approximately 100 volunteers recruited, sourced from each community Ambulante California visits, will undergo production training and orientation of the themes and subjects of each documentary. An essential aspect is building morale, motivation and empowering the volunteers as ambassadors of the festival. In that respect we will offer volunteer screenings of the films in advance of the festival so they may adequately and passionately speak about the merits of the program.","Ambulante USA in the California context seeks to integrate its participatory platform with the diverse ecosystem of sub-cultures found within the sprawling and decentralized population to foster artistic expression and connect communities.

 The participation of each site we visit includes not just audience engagement but volunteers from each area. Our volunteers are trained and given a level of independence, confidence and boosts of morale. We attract young go-getters and older film lovers as volunteers. Our films are family driven but are also emotional which can really affect adults. 
 
 Ambulante California does not impose any ideas or restrictions on the communities it enters, creating a safe space for people of all races, genders, sexual orientations, and socioeconomic backgrounds to participate in important dialogues."
4102008,Connected + Engaged = Resilient Communities,"To launch an innovative, volunteer-run community engagement project that will create a more resilient Los Angeles.",Connect,2015008,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050connect/projects/communityambassadors.html,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,"We also believe in the power of Angelenos to shape the future of our region. In terms of community resilience, the future is in our hands more than we realize. We are long overdue for the “Big One” — a catastrophic earthquake that is predicted to wreak havoc. Consensus among experts is that LA residents in the event of a catastrophic earthquake will need to be prepared to take care of themselves for 3 to 7 days until outside help arrives. Our idea is to implement a community engagement project that incorporates a neighbor-to-neighbor preparedness approach as well as a preparedness smart phone app in an effort to create a more connected, and therefore resilient LA. It is after all in the coming together that we are strongest.","Our project plan will combine some old-fashioned community networking via Map Your Neighborhood with new technology via the Team Red Cross App. 
 
 Map Your Neighborhood (MYN): This initiative is designed to improve disaster readiness at the neighborhood level, teaching neighbors to rely on each other during the hours or days before first responders may be able to reach them. A neighborhood leader, in this case at first a Red Cross Community Ambassador* and then his/her trainees, holds MYN neighborhood meetings to: identify the skills and equipment inventory each neighbor has that are useful in an effective disaster response; create a neighborhood map; develop a neighborhood contact list; and produce a plan to work together as a team to evaluate the neighborhood after a disaster and take the necessary actions.
 
 Team Red Cross App: This brand new app provides solutions for how to best spread preparedness and relief information as widely as possible. It also utilizes the corps of spontaneous volunteers — everyday humanitarians who emerge to support their neighbors during disasters of all scope and size— by digitally educating, coordinating, and mobilizing volunteers who are ready to help at a moment’s notice. Through this app, that will be promoted by our Community Ambassadors during the Map Your Neighborhood sessions, users will: learn about the responsibilities of a spontaneous volunteer via simple steps, short videos and quizzes; receive and respond to push notifications for volunteer jobs based on their location and preferences; share situational awareness and First Aid content from the app to those around them and affected by disaster; and earn different badges for their activities.
 
 Neighborhoods that are prepared for emergencies save lives, reduce the severity of injuries and trauma, and reduce property damage. And neighbors working together toward this goal improve the overall quality of community life.
 
 * Community Ambassadors are leaders who have been selected to serve as community representatives of the Red Cross to promote and increase volunteerism and preparedness in neighborhoods where they live and work. Our new preparedness project will be launched through our Community Ambassador Program. In order to serve the needs of our vast and diverse Los Angeles population, the American Red Cross Los Angeles Region works side by side with a network of Community Ambassadors.","In Southern California, it is not a matter of if, but rather when a catastrophic earthquake will occur. In fact, by most accounts we are 150 years overdue for the “Big One,” an earthquake of a magnitude 7.8 or higher. If an earthquake this size jolts the lower half of the San Andreas Fault, this could mean thousands of lives lost, billions of dollars in property damage, close to a half a million businesses and 4.5 million workers impacted; potentially crippling the area’s economy. 
 
 As the Red Cross has witnessed first-hand and as studies demonstrate, being prepared is the most critical step in mitigating risk and enabling a community’s ability to recover. A County of Los Angeles Public Health survey found that 100% of Los Angeles residents believe a catastrophic earthquake is imminent, but only a mere 6% of households in Los Angeles reported being “completely prepared.” Since predictions also point to the need for LA residents to be prepared for a minimum of 3 to upwards of 7 days until outside help can arrive, implementing a new multi-faceted and multi-generational preparedness strategy via a highly successful Community Ambassador Program will serve the preparedness needs of Angelenos today and will create better outcomes for our tomorrow. Neighbors working together now will create resilient communities that can face any emergency. While we cannot predict the exact timing of disasters, we can do everything we can now to come together now to create a more hopeful future. 
 
 It will be because of the efforts we collectively take now that will allow for a 2050 that is a year of resilience and hope and not one of devastation and loss. The connections and bonds that are made now through this community-based work will also make for a well-connected, and therefore stronger Los Angles overall. A Los Angeles that is full of residents who can rely on one another for support. A Los Angeles where residents volunteer to help their fellow community members. A Los Angeles that because of this unity can stand in the face of disaster and not fall.","Currently, Community Ambassadors represent more than 100 communities throughout Los Angeles County, with more Community Ambassadors being selected every quarter: Playa Vista, Del Rey, Marina Del Rey, Venice, Pasadena, Altadena, South Pasadena, East Pasadena, San Marino, San Pasqual, Alhambra, San Gabriel, South San Gabriel, East San Gabriel, La Cañada Flintridge, Arcadia, Whittier Narrows, El Monte, North El Monte, South El Monte, Temple City, Rosemead, Monrovia, Bradbury, Sierra Madre, Duarte, Mayflower Village, Baldwin Park, Claremont, Industry, Pomona, La Verne, San Dimas, West San Dimas, Ramona, Glendora, Azusa, Citrus, Vincent, West Covina, Valinda, West Puente Valley, La Puente, Hacienda Heights, North Whittier, Avocado Heights, Diamond Bar, South Diamond Bar, Rowland Heights, Walnut, Charter Oak, Irwindale, South San Jose Hills, Lancaster, Leona Valley, Northeast Antelope Valley, Northwest Antelope Valley, Palmdale, Northwest Palmdale, Quartz Hill, Sun Village, Acton, Lake Los Angeles, Desert View Highlands, Littlerock, Southeast Antelope Valley, Angeles Crest, Agua Dulce, Green Valley, Elizabeth Lake, Lake Hughes, Glendale, Atwater Village, Glassell Park, Cypress Park, Mount Washington, Highland Park, Eagle Rock, Montecito Heights, Vermont-Slauson, Hyde Park, Vermont Knolls, University Park, Exposition Park, Leimert Park, Jefferson Park, West Adams, Baldwin Hills, Crenshaw, Hawthorne, El Segundo, San Pedro, Harbor City, Harbor Gateway, Hermosa Beach, Gardena, Monterey Park, Covina, Van Nuys, Valley Glen, Valley Village, Culver City, West Los Angeles, Santa Clarita, La Crescenta, Inglewood, Lakewood, Cerritos, Whittier, Long Beach, Manhattan Beach, Santa Monica, Torrance, Redondo Beach, Compton, Cambodian Community in Long Beach, La Mirada, Montebello, Rancho Palos Verdes, Palos Verdes Estates, Rolling Hills, and Rolling Hills Estates.","The following on-going partnerships will support the implementation of our new project: Community Emergency Response Team (CERT), Washington State Emergency Management System, Community Police Advisory Board, City of Los Angeles Office of Emergency Management, LA County Office of Emergency Management, Neighborhood Councils, and Emergency Network Los Angeles.

4102029,C5LA’s Youth Leadership Development and College Preparatory Program,"C5LA's proposed project develops future leaders, helps youth graduate high school and attend college, and teaches the value of giving back.",Learn,2015024,2014,,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,"C5LA will offer leadership development, mentoring, college preparatory, and service learning programs to 300 students in grades eight to twelve over one year. With the goal of helping youth: 1) graduate high school; 2) navigate the process of applying and enrolling in college; and 3) pursue a career path of their choosing, the C5LA program is structured as follows:
 
 Year One—Learning to Take the Lead: Eighth graders begin with a team building program that prepares them for the adventures that lie ahead. During the school year, youth participate in a two-day high ropes challenge course where they learn the importance of leadership and teamwork. In the summer, students travel to Hyattville, Wyoming for four weeks for Camp Paintrock–Leadership U. At camp, they learn about themselves and others, developing fundamental leadership skills while participating in adventure activities.
 
 Year Two—Leadership in Practice: Students apply newly developed leadership skills in challenging real world settings. Throughout the year, youth prepare for their upcoming summer experience through a variety of planning programs and a three-day camping trip. Year two culminates in the 12-day C5LA Bridges/Paintrock Leadership Challenge—a backcountry leadership adventure in Montana and Wyoming, where youth make decisions, solve problems, and learn to work together effectively.
 
 Year Three—Exploring My Future: Participants explore choices for post-secondary education and careers through The Road to College, a 7-10 day college campus tour. While on the tour, teens engage in a volunteer service project in one of the communities they visit. 
 
 Year Four—Visionary Leadership: Students spend a week on a college campus where they identify the needs of community members, create potential solutions to the unique problems faced by the community, meet people who are making a difference in the community, develop a multimedia presentation about their experience, and teach others about the importance of giving back. Youth continue their college preparation through seminars and attendance at college fairs.
 
 Year Five—Looking Ahead and Giving Back: In their final year, youth develop and host the C5 A.C.T. Now Summit. This culminating day-long college access event is presented to their peers—students who share similar life experiences but lack the resources, skills, and preparation that our C5LA students have obtained through their years with the program.","According to recent studies, only 45% of all LAUSD freshmen ultimately receive a high school diploma. For ethnic minorities, the graduation rate is even lower. Nationwide, African-Americans drop out of school at almost twice the rate of Caucasians, and Hispanics at over three times the rate of their Caucasian peers.
 
 A lack of education impacts a person’s whole life. High school dropouts are 72% more likely to be unemployed, three times more likely to be arrested over their lifetimes, and the less formal education one has, the worse one’s health tends to be. Ultimately, low graduation rates impact entire communities, as historically under-served populations lose potential talent, leadership, income, and access to credit and capital—all of which could otherwise invigorate local economies.
 
 Key to the future success of all youth is a high school degree. Research clearly demonstrates that teens with successful role models earn higher grades and have greater self-esteem. Unfortunately, C5LA students lack such role models, as they become the first people in their families to attend college. 
 
 C5LA makes Los Angeles a better place to learn by providing education and supports to under-served youth and encouraging and facilitating high school graduation and college matriculation. The impact of our program on today’s youth is clear: for the past two years, 100% of our students have graduated from high school and gone on to college.
 
 C5LA is also helping make Los Angeles the best place to learn in 2050 by preparing program graduates to be leaders in the community and to take their education and leadership skills into their neighborhoods, schools, and places of work to perpetuate a cycle of improvement for others. These benefits are particularly important in Los Angeles’ low-income neighborhoods, where there are too few examples of success with which youth can identify. 
 
 Giving back to the community is essential and all youth are required to spend at least 30 hours per year engaged in community service activities. The program also cultivates continued service through its Counselor in Training in Program (“CIT”). CIT provides C5LA graduates an opportunity to further develop the skills they obtained through their five years in the program. “C5ers” participate in either the Leadership Camp in Wyoming or the Road to College Tour and the ACT NOW Summit. Students build skills that help create well-prepared and high-quality counselors and prepare them for the future.","C5LA’s Leadership Development and College Preparatory Program serves Los Angeles students who are at high risk for school dropout based on family poverty, single or no-parent homes, precarious living circumstances, and prevalence of gangs in their neighborhoods. 
 
 C5LA participants are Latino (56%), African American (22%), Asian/Pacific Islander (11%), Caucasian (7%), and other backgrounds (4%). One hundred percent come from low-income, working poor backgrounds and most live in homes where the annual income is less than $10,000 per family member. The average student in our program comes from a family of five members with a total annual income of $21,000. One hundred percent of C5LA youth participate in the federal free lunch program and over 90% are the first in their families to attend college. 
 
 More broadly, C5LA benefits the community by developing college-ready youth who have self-confidence and positive self-esteem, value diversity, and function effectively in a multicultural environment. The success of our youth as first-to-college family members, peer mentors, and community leaders also directly impacts the lives of their families, friends, and community: siblings/friends gain a positive role model and the community gains an engaged citizen. Successive generations will be more likely to attend college and their futures will change dramatically. Financial stability, better health, less violence and incarceration, and greater opportunities for advancement and retirement security are all likely outcomes of a college education.","C5LA works with organizations such as Educare, the Posse Foundation, Champions, Impact, and UCLA Uni-Camp to collaborate on serving more youth through our leadership programs. We are also partnered with the Fulfillment Fund and Princeton Review to enrich our college preparatory programming, including our youth participating in their standardized test taking prep classes and the Fulfillment Fund’s Destination College fair. 
 
 C5LA also partners with 18 schools in the LAUSD through the Beyond the Bell Program, an initiative that provides after-school enrichment opportunities for underserved youth. Because C5LA aims to prepare youth for college through programs like the Road to College, the agency has developed extensive partnerships with dozens of colleges and universities, including throughout California and into Oregon and Washington for the Road to College and across the country as students have explored and entered universities around the country for more than 10 years. In addition to the Road to College, the A.C.T. Now Summit enables students to spend a week on a local college campus designing and developing a day-long college access and awareness event for other at-risk students. Each year, A.C.T. Now impacts not just the lives of our program youth, but 500 others as well in the culmination of the program when C5 youth deliver the fall college preparatory program to hundreds of peers. 
 
 As a result of our participation in the Los Angeles Social Venture Partners's “Fast Pitch” program, C5LA partnered with South Central Scholars in the creation of the “College Access Brain Trust,” which now includes leadership from several key organizations, including the National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship and the former Magic Johnson Foundation. 
 
 We ensure our collaborations are successful by:
 • Working closely with existing collaborative partners to further develop our program;
 • Seeking out relationships with college preparatory programs that have been proven effective; and
 • Constantly exploring how we can partner with new organizations that serve a similar youth demographic.",0,
4102039,Making Los Angeles the most technologically progressive and healthy city in the country,Climate Cents is an online platform that connects Angelenos to local projects that improve LA’s environment and reduce greenhouse gases.,Live,2015037,2014,,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,"Climate Cents is in the process of launching. We are in the beta-phase now, creating a website and testing the user-experience of it with a group of beta-users, while also experimenting with organizational partnerships and data-collection. During the beta phase, the test group will be donating to the Kelp Restoration Project at The Bay Foundation. Since nearly 40% of the CO2 in our atmosphere is absorbed by our oceans, kelp forests have been identified as effective carbon sinks that can sequester carbon and mitigate the effects of climate change. Climate Cents has already formed a relationship with the Bay Foundation for this purpose. As users follow the project they have funded, we will track how they experience the interactive process. 
 
 Once the beta phase ends in September, we will take what we have learned and refine the concept and execution. We will hire a digital designer to create a full-fledged, robust website by December. We will also sign partnership agreements with three additional environmental groups, including TreePeople, LAANE’s Repower LA (a partnership with LADWP’s Utility Pre-Craft Trainee (UPCT) program), and Harbor Community Benefit Foundation. We will refine data and photo-gathering procedures, and iron out organizational kinks. In preparation for a January 2015 public launch, we will hire a marketing team and work with them to garner significant publicity. We also plan to hold a series of Climate Cents parties across LA in January, February, and March 2014 to build support and secure a large number of initial sign-ups. Through 2015, we will be conducting extensive outreach to neighborhood councils, religious institutions, schools, housing associations, environmental symposiums and events, and other community-based groups to gain new supporters. 
 
 Climate Cents will allow individuals to broadcast their carbon reduction notifications to their friends and networks. Through the power of social media, we will constantly demonstrate that we are not powerless in our fight against climate change, and that something can be done. This positive feedback feature is crucial to Climate Cents. Many of the strategies to combat climate change do not engage people on a personal level. We will encourage residents to take pride and invest in their city, while also cleaning our air and bringing people together for a common cause.","The most measurable pay-off from Climate Cents, both now and in 2050, is increased funding for tree planting, urban farms, ocean revitalization, and energy efficiency projects that will make LA a healthier, more pleasant, and more connected place to live. These will contribute to a city in which people don’t face environmental health hazards, where they can breathe clean air, drink clean water, relax and exercise among ample greenery and in the oceans, and eat good local food. 
 
 But the truth is that no single project can make LA the healthiest place to live — it will take a collective effort. So Climate Cents works to improve L.A.’s environment and to counter climate change in ways that complement existing efforts. We amplify funding for effective local environmental initiatives and helps them to more carefully measure, track, and broadcast their outcomes.
 
 LA has long been a city seemingly separate and definitely unequal, especially on matters of health, environment, and livability. What makes Climate Cents unique is to catalyze a city-wide collaboration to tackle the problems we ultimately all share. We will drive funding from more affluent areas toward remedies for some of the city’s worst environmental hotspots. Residents from across LA will be able to invest in tree-planting and energy efficiency projects in their own neighborhoods. The result is a renewed sense of civic pride and purpose.
 
 No place, especially LA, will be able to remain even as healthy and livable as they are today without tackling climate change. Rapid climate change has already begun to harm ecosystems globally. It’s contributing to rising sea levels, intensifying droughts, and rapidly melting snowpacks across California. In LA, rising temperatures will lead to “adverse effects on human health, including increases in heat stress, respiratory diseases, and infectious diseases.” (C-Change.LA.)
 
 It’s important to take on this challenge locally. So many of the efforts to fight climate change are distant from people’s ordinary lives and will start working only over the long-term. Before policy reforms and technological transformation become a reality, we need to make incremental efforts that get regular people engaged. While there are programs that fight climate change, there’s no comprehensive organization that groups these efforts, develops a central hub to fund them and to track progress in reducing carbon emissions. That’s the special role Climate Cents will play.","Climate Cents will help people and neighborhoods all over Los Angeles, with specific benefits in low-income and disadvantaged communities that have suffered the worst effects of environmental injustice. LA’s environmental problems are severe. Our area has some of the worst air quality in the nation, which results from a combination of industrial production and automobile exhaust, especially from the port/trucking sector. And the brunt of pollution falls disproportionately on low-income neighborhoods, in predominantly Latino and Black communities. Since these communities are three times more likely to live close to hazardous facilities, their exposure to air toxins is fifty percent greater than other Angelenos.
 
 We aim to concentrate our partnerships and environmental projects will be concentrated in low-income neighborhoods. Planting trees across South LA, the Eastside, and the Northeast Valley will be vital to making those places healthier and more livable. The removal of particulate matter and toxins from the air is vital. Urban gardens can help provide quality food. And increasing the percentage of tree canopy cover can make the city more beautiful and more walkable, leading to fitter, more resilient communities, with more opportunities to reduce the mental and physical stresses of urban living. 
 
 The project will benefit those in other neighborhoods because pollution doesn’t stop the boundaries of zip codes. Trees in South LA help clean the air of toxins, particulate matter, and carbon that would soon spread elsewhere. Kelp forests in the Santa Monica Bay clean the water that circulates among all the region’s beaches. Energy efficiency upgrades reduce costs and free up capacity for everyone on the network. 
 
 The city as whole will benefit from Climate Cents too. Mitigating climate change is important on its own and by galvanizing the city’s population into cross-neighborhood collaboration, we will create a sense of civic purpose and pride. Residents from across LA will be investing in one another and their shared future. And Climate Cents members will gain personally too, as they gain a sense of agency and connection, seeing the benefits their projects all around the city they live in, creating a virtuous cycle of publicity, excitement, and greater investment.","We have confirmed a partnership with the Bay Foundation to fund their Kelp Restoration Project as part of our beta-test. We are in talks with three more groups, listed below, for the January 2015 launch of Climate Cents. There’s a standard relationship between Climate Cents and its partners. We provide funding for the partners to amplify the impact of their environmental projects and in return, the partners facilitate CC’s calculation of carbon reduction per dollar invested and the visual documentation of the project’s impact.
 
 1. The Bay Foundation will expand its work of restoring kelp forests in waters off of LA. Reversing the 75% decline in these forests over the past century will help our local ecosystems, clean the water, and sequester a significant amount of carbon from the ocean, which absorbs nearly 30-40% of the atmosphere’s carbon dioxide.
 
 2. TreePeople will expand its work of planting tens of thousands of trees across LA, sequestering many tons of carbon and creating better environment for Angelenos. 
 
 3. LAANE’s Repower LA program, in partnership with LADWP’s Utility Pre-Craft Trainee (UPCT) program, will expand its work, which offers free home energy-efficiency retrofits and trains low-income Angelenos in electrical work. 
 
 4. Harbor Community Benefit Foundation will expand its tree planting initiatives to counter abysmal air quality for communities near the Port of LA.
 
 We are exploring partnerships with other groups for the future: Urban Food Gardens, the National Forest Foundation, Tree Musketeers, and Northeast Trees.
 
 The success of our collaborations will depend on a trusting relationship and clear expectations about each party’s responsibilities and deliverables. We are creating a standard memorandum of understanding, which will minimize the risk of miscommunication and divergent expectations. For Climate Cents, we must have guarantees that our funding contributions will flow directly and completely to the pre-set projects, and not be diverted to other programs or administrative costs. We must also regularly receive updated information about the results of the funding, with specific metrics such as trees planted and pounds of carbon reduced. We will also need to access to the partner’s project sites so we can document them with photo and videos. In return, partners should have a clear expectation of how roughly much funding they can expect from Climate Cents and on what basis and conceivable schedule it will be provided.",1,
4102040,Solar in the Sunshine Capital: LA is known for its abundant sun. Let’s put it to use.,The project will work with non-profit organizations to provide business attire and employment/vocational training to low-income job seekers.,Live,2015040,2014,,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,"Clothes The Deal has established several collaborations. Partnering agencies that refer clients have provided needs assessments to estimate the number of clients needing services as well as funding available to cost match service expenses. Collaborating organizations involved in the project have also pledged to raise internal funding to sustain services after the project period ends. Clothes The Deal currently has two programs that we would like to expand: the Business Clothing Program and the Dress to Impress Workshops. 
 
 Business Clothing Program: Through a network of corporate clothing drives, donation drop-off locations, and donations directly from local manufacturers and retailers, Clothes The Deal collects ready-to-wear items for thousands of job ready clients. Clothes The Deal continually looks for new clothing drive sponsors by outreaching to local businesses and organizations throughout the LA community for clothing donations. 
 
 Dress To Impress Workshops: Workshops are designed to help educate and enhance the participant's self-esteem and professional image for job interviews. Topics include professional image, business etiquette, self-confidence, hygiene, skin and hair care. Workshops are interactive public forums for discussion of dress codes in various work environments. Workshops also address non-verbal and visual communication between coworkers/customers/clients, sample scenarios, problem solving situations and team building activities. Clothes The Deal makes it easy for participants to attend a workshop by bringing the clothing and services to them.","The majority of Clothes the Deal’s clients have endured traumatic events resulting in psychological barriers. Common traumatic events include abuse, post traumatic stress, foster care, domestic violence, substance abuse, and mental health impairments. Clothes The Deal’s services and the care provided within the network of nonprofit organizations break down barriers to employment and provide a boost of self-confidence during critical moments of our clients’ lives.
 
 Today, Clothes The Deal’s services help clients get back on their feet and gain employment by removing any barriers that may be in their way. Subsequently, our work will help decrease the number of people living on the streets and the number of families who live below the poverty threshold. In addition to higher living wages, clients served will ultimately achieve a higher quality of life for themselves and their families by obtaining health insurance, purchasing healthy foods, and providing/obtaining a quality education.
 
 The more people that Clothes The Deal empowers today, the more community leaders we’ll have giving back to low-income communities tomorrow. By 2050, services will help reduce the number of disadvantages and barriers to employment faced by most low-income individuals. Clothes The Deal will also help more businesses and community organizations invest in their communities by hold clothing drives and volunteering. As a result of the project, Clothes The Deal envisions safer neighborhoods and a higher quality of life for families in low-income communities.","Clothes The Deal serves low-income individuals in all of Los Angeles County. Men and women, old and young, people of all nationalities qualify for our services. The majority of our services are focused in communities with above average poverty and unemployment rates. 
 
 Clients must meet the following requirements: 
 1) Low-income (according to the Federal Health & Human Services poverty guidelines) 
 2) Currently unemployed 
 3) Enrolled in an employment program, vocational training or educational institution
 
 Some of the clients that we have had and currently have include veterans, homeless individuals, at-risk youth, mentally or physically disabled individuals, those recovering from mental illness or substance abuse, and foster youth.","Over the past 19 years, Clothes The Deal has built partnerships with many programs and non-profits throughout the county. The majority of collaborating organizations are in need of Clothes The Deal’s services but do not have funding available for service expenses. Some of the partnering organizations include Community Career Development Center, Enki Mental Health Services, Friends Outside Los Angeles, L.A. Works, Children's Institute Inc., Puente Learning Center, The Salvation Army Bell Shelter, Single Room Occupancy Inc., Skid Row Development Corp, Substance Abuse Foundation, U.S. Veterans Initiative, Volunteers of America, Weingart Center, the Workforce Investment Board, and Youth Opportunity Movement Watts (YO WATTS).
 
 Partners provide clients referrals and help with client intake procedures to ensure all clients are low-income and ready for employment. By partnering with employment and vocational agencies, services are provided to a diverse population of people coming from different backgrounds and cultures. A small percentage of collaborating partners will provide a cost match of percentage of service expenses during the project. All collaborating organizations have pledged to raise funding for service expenses once the project period ends. 
 
 Clothes the Deal also collaborates with the community and service leaders. A few examples of how we accomplish this: 
 1) Attend networking events focused on employment and vocational programs, including those hosted by POWER (Providing Opportunities with Essential Resources), LA United Job Creation Council and the Department of Mental Health Case Manager Meetings. 
 2) Build relationships with local businesses and organizations that in turn provide clothing donations and host clothing drives to generate donations for us. 
 3) Annually, we have about 40 volunteers serve a total of 5,550 hours. Volunteers include youth interns from youth employment programs such as YO Watts, community service volunteers, philanthropy groups, Temporary Subsidized Employees, and ReEmployability employees.",0,
4102056,We Are All LA: a socially conscious business network to end womens homelessness through jobs,DWC leverages the power of for-profit/non-profit partnerships to work toward ending homelessness for women in Los Angeles.,Create,2015051,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050create/projects/DTwomenscenter.html,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Skid Row,"1. Build a business coalition
 2. Place participants in jobs
 3. Provide support to employers and employees to ensure job retention
 
 In order to facilitate employment opportunities for women who have experienced homelessness, we will launch a DWC-led business coalition. We will leverage our established partnerships and cultivate new relationships with local businesses who understand that a strong economy is necessarily inclusive. Together, we will proactively shape the economy our community wants to see in Los Angeles in 2050. DWC’s business coalition will serve as advocates to end homelessness in the Downtown Los Angeles community, train and/or employ homeless women, and leverage their networks to grow the coalition.
 
 We will catalyze action among business leaders through convenings that will facilitate dialogue and brainstorm business-smart solutions to employ program participants. The collective of social-conscientious and business-savvy leaders will help us ensure that we train our participants in the skills most in demand, and that we approach job placement in the most effective way. Our partners will provide job opportunities for our women, provide participants with specialized training in specific industries, and help us expand our network. We will hold a quarterly convening for prospective local business partners to meet with our long-time partners and learn of the strategies and benefits of employing DWC participants. 
 
 To support these efforts and put more women back to work, DWC will also grow our extensive Education and Job Readiness programming. Homeless and extremely low-income women will participate in enrichment classes that ignite their creative and enterprising spirit such as product design, candle-making, and the art of baking. We will also offer job counseling, and workshops that promote technological proficiency and teach essential skills like resume building and critical thinking. 
 
 DWC will not only connect women with employment, but provide ongoing support to participants and employers to ensure job retention. Participants will be hired and/or trained in our café and boutique and also by diverse partners like Bloomingdales, the Music Center, and local small businesses like the Pie Hole and Groundwork Coffee. Additionally, places like LAX and Bloomingdale’s will carry products created by our participants, MADE by DWC. Over the next 12 months, we will aim to place 60 women in jobs or internships.","The core of creation is the exercise of agency. DWC’s Education and Job Readiness Program empowers women to exercise their agency while our proposed local business coalition encourages businesses to emerge as leaders in the community by effecting positive change. The task at hand is to create the city we envision for 2050 and this project represents a strategic way to engage the wielders of power and the disenfranchised to move forward—together—to make a better LA. 
 
 In addition to job placement in creative enterprises, DWC’s Education and Job Readiness Program offers a variety of opportunities for participants to express their creativity as they ready themselves for the workforce, engaging in artistic activities such as the repurposing of old books into journals, creating charming tea-cup candles, manufacturing scented soaps, and other hand-made products that are then sold as the MADE by DWC product line. We have also recently launched a new creative initiative for our participants in which women create designs featured on products like tote bags and prints with the guidance of professional artists. As part of our social enterprise, these products would be manufactured locally and distributed nationally to help sustain the very enrichment programs that yielded the designs. By 2050, our social enterprise alone may be employing dozens of DWC participants in the designing, manufacturing, and distribution of our MADE by DWC product line, and our business coalition will have powered the employment of the women who currently avail themselves of our services.","This project will directly benefit homeless women on Skid Row. There are 58,000 homeless people in Los Angeles County, and most of that population is concentrated in downtown Los Angeles. Women make up almost a quarter Los Angeles’ homeless. The women DWC serve include war veterans, older women who find themselves homeless after their spouse passes, victims of the economic downturn, and trauma survivors. The 2013 Needs Assessment, conducted by the Downtown Women’s Action Coalition, surveyed women on Skid Row to get a better idea of the services needed. Employment opportunities ranked among the highest needed resource in Skid Row. Computer classes and educational opportunities also ranked high on the list of needs for women in our community.
 
 DWC aims to provide safety and basic needs to all our participants, and once those urgencies are met, we also want our participants to strive to thrive. Our proposed program provides targeted services that meet the specific educational and vocational needs women have voiced. We believe in them and believe that more empowered women means a stronger society, and more self-sufficient women leads to a stronger economy. 
 
 Our proposed solution is the beginning of what we believe to be necessary long-term, systemic change, involving the community as a whole and not just service agencies. Businesses who partner with us will benefit as they take positive action toward a better future while gaining networking opportunities and receiving one-on-one support from DWC and other experienced business partners to help them manage employees from this unique population. 
 
 The greatest benefit in the long run, however, will be for Los Angeles as a whole, as the city cannot hope to prosper with 58,000 of its people languishing in extreme poverty. We are all LA.","Confirmed partners include Strategic Action for a Just Economy, Groundwork Coffeee, Bloomingdale’s, Evy, UCLA School of Nursing, Dr. J’s Vibrant Café, The Pie Hole, ROC-LA, and LA Kitchen. We are aiming to forge partnerships with Farmer John, Charlie’s Brownies, Sonax Behrouzon’s Printing Company, Povertees, Nancy Clark (Designer), The Giving Keys, Wells Fargo, Dean Management, LLC, Manifesto Café, Wurstkuche, and Piece by Piece.
 
 We have worked with our established partners in a variety of ways. Some partners offer specialized training in their industry, others offer paid positions or give special consideration to our participants in their staffing searches. We are looking to expand these past partnerships as well as create new partnerships to help us improve our job readiness programming, amplifying our impact in terms of job placement, and offering the added benefit of networking and creative brainstorming among our partners as they seek to grow themselves. 
 
 In harnessing the power of collaboration for our business coalition, three factors will be critical to our success. The contribution of expertise and network of our current partners is of utmost importance to the success of our initiative, as is effective and engaging training and workshops that help women stay on track in their personal stability and in their path toward self-sufficiency. Lastly, because a growth initiative like this one often takes a backseat to programming upkeep, funding for this innovation is crucial.",1,
4102069,Creating Safe Engaged Schools: Facing History and Ourselves Los Angeles Expansion,"Our LA Partnership Schools Network will connect 500 teachers and 12,000 students as they lead the way in creating safe, engaged schools.",Learn,2015061,2014,,,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,,"Facing History reaches students through their teachers, providing professional development (PD) to help middle and high school educators explore issues such as discrimination, stereotyping, and the importance of civic participation through curriculum-based critical analysis of historical case studies. Facing History’s PD includes workshops, seminars, classroom resources, and on-going follow-up services. In-depth training introduces teachers to topics such as the steps that led to the Holocaust, race and membership in American history, the Armenian Genocide, and the 1992 Los Angeles riots. This training, paired with individualized coaching and follow-up support, prepares educators to use these case studies to engage students around the importance of civic participation. 
 
 Through their Facing History classes, students at these schools learn to make connections (not simple comparisons) to self, society, and other events in history. They make meaning of history by examining primary and secondary sources; apply lessons they have learned to current issues and think deeply about what they are reading, hearing, and seeing, all within the emerging civic space of their classroom. Students often reflect on their Facing History experience as the first time that school was relevant to their lives. By connecting the dots, they begin to understand that their choices matter.
 
 Through Facing History’s unique school partnership model, Facing History staff members work closely with faculty throughout the year to integrate our program across grade levels and disciplines, and to create school community events to address school climate, including strong student and parent participation. Facing History conducts three events per year for the Partnership Network, to which each school sends a cohort of students, teachers, administrators and parents to share best practices, discuss issues in urban education, and continue learning about Facing History’s resources. This model brings multiple stakeholders together from different schools on a regular basis to foster community-wide engagement in a local context.","The educator’s most important task—to shape a humane, well-educated citizenry— has never been more vital to sustain civil society, democratic values, and human rights than it is today. Yet education on the whole seems to be failing in this task; the reality for urban schools is particularly bleak: 
 
 • High school graduation rates In Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) hover around 66%.
 • More than half of all new teachers in the U.S. leave the profession during their first five years. This high turnover undermines the educational system, as teaching expertise is developed over years of practice and improvement.
 • Teachers find themselves ill-equipped to foster safe environments that support learning.
 
 The Los Angeles Partnership Schools Network draws upon innovative research in the key areas of urban education: closing the achievement gap; creating safe, inclusive classrooms; and structuring sustainable, supportive networks for teachers and schools.
 Facing History revitalizes teachers, and helps them integrate social emotional learning within rigorous academic coursework that aligns with Common Core State Standards. Facing History increases students’ motivation and engagement, because our resources and approach link academic content to students’ lives. Facing History trusts young people to wrestle with complex moments in human history, and help them understand the range of human behavior.
 
 Students understand the danger of prejudice and discrimination, the experience of vulnerable groups in society, and the importance of solving differences through discussion and dialogue, not violence. Students learn that their choices matter and that they can be agents of positive change. As they explore the complexities of history and human behavior, students consider how they can make a difference today and in the future.
 
 Facing History’s impact occurs on multiple levels and is leveraged over time. As students become more engaged in their learning, they are more likely to have greater academic success and to graduate. They impact the people around them, including family and peers. As teachers become revitalized, they’re more likely to stay in the field. Facing History teachers continue to use the program every year they remain in the classroom, reaching new groups of students annually. Many Facing History educators become school leaders, shaping the vision and academic goals of their school for years to come.","The Los Angeles Partnership Schools Network will provide training and support for approximately 500 teachers in 31 middle and high schools this year. These educators will then reach an estimated 12,000 students across Los Angeles annually with the tools and lessons to participate positively in their school communities, and to succeed in school, career, and civic life. Current partnership network schools are located in East Los Angeles, South Los Angeles, downtown, and the San Fernando Valley. All schools are Title I, high poverty schools and all are either public or charter schools within Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD). Seven middle schools joined the network this past year through a pilot project focused on school-wide anti-bullying practices.","We launched the LA Partnership Schools Network in response to a need from teachers to collaborate and build bridges among the diverse communities that make up Los Angeles. Our primary partnership is with each individual school, including a contractual agreement signed by an administrator and designated teacher liaison on campus. Facing History staff work with faculty at each school to integrate our program across grades and disciplines. Clear contracting, high-fidelity implementation and sustainability planning are all critical elements of a successful collaboration.
 
 Last year we added seven middle schools to the Partnership Schools Network through a pilot project focused on school-wide anti-bullying practices. The project was conducted with support from the Los Angeles Fund for Public Education and Youth Policy Institute (YPI). YPI contracted with Facing History to provide in-depth professional development for schools in Hollywood and Pacoima, high-poverty areas of federal revitalization focus, as part of its $30 million grant from the U.S. Department of Education for the Los Angeles Promise Neighborhood initiative.
 
 In addition to the work with individual schools, we convene teachers, administrators, students and parents from partner schools across Los Angeles, both in person and online. Teachers, who too often work in isolation, can now regularly connect with educators from other schools who face similar challenges. Collaboration and idea-sharing within the network has been greatly enhanced through the Los Angeles Network blog (lanetwork.facinghistory.org). The blog provides a flexible forum for educators and Facing History staff to share ideas, challenges, and solutions for addressing issues they confront in the classroom. This online community serves as a networking tool for teachers within and beyond the Los Angeles Partnership Schools Network. 
 
 Facing History is investing significantly in a core group of exemplary Facing History educators to serve as mentors for other teachers in Los Angeles. Teacher leaders are early adopters in piloting Facing History’s new resources, and are instrumental in supporting liaisons from the Los Angeles Partnership Network. Collaboration with our teacher leaders is a critical factor in helping Facing History respond to the needs of teachers, build stronger school-wide programs, and continue expanding to more urban schools.",0,

 We will create surveys & communication plans that monitor each staff member's understanding and ability to implement lessons in an authentic way, and by the end of the year hope to be able to certify many LA’s BEST staff in the FLY Methods. Staff will bring these creative tools to their endeavors beyond their time with LA’s BEST, reaching more with their efforts in creative play and arts education.
 
 Finally, to keep true to its vision and spirit, FLY will create video/ audio recordings that will aid in introducing and leading exercises. In addition, FLY will provide curriculum materials (lesson plans, intentions, teacher handbooks, and student worksheets), as well as classroom materials and equipment for LA's BEST Schools to run our program for a full calendar year.","FLY will introduce thousands of young people and educators to the joys of Artistic Play! In doing so, we will bring Arts Education to low income communities, empower students to academic success, increase attendance in after school programs, and plant seeds of healthy living.
 
 Our LA schools are in crisis. The impact of strict testing and low budgets is generally one of low morale and low self-confidence among students and staff. 
 
 The quick fix both in schools and at home is to ""plug in"" the kids to their iGadgets. We have all seen the socio- emotional consequences and lack of civility that is a result of too little human connection, too little creativity and too little self-understanding. While new technology is amazing for efficiency and entertainment, these tools rarely engage our physical bodies and creative minds: the main instruments for experiential learning. 
 
 FLY has seen the vast benefits of bringing balance through Arts education to every social and economic community. Through FLY, teachers take kids out of their seats, out of the box and into their bodies. Our innovative training establishes community, enhances healthy self- image and communication, trains the right brain, improves focus, and keeps kids excited to come to school each day. With students inspired to learn through Artistic Play, our after school numbers will grow, attendance can improve, and progress can skyrocket.
 
 Our New York program saw a 40% increase in students coming to after school programs at our partner schools in just this past calendar year, and students have often said that these classes are ""the reason why we come to school.""
 
 FLY's unique teacher training offers a complete skill set that brings kids into physical, social, and emotional engagement while threading in the lessons of the day. Our Arts framework guides teachers and students toward critical thinking, teamwork, expression and compassionate communication. Additionally, we give tools for classroom management and engagement, as well as breathing exercises and attention- training games that help kids to stay focused and excited about the task at hand. 
 
 FLY is committed to instilling a genuine love for teaching and learning that only can be illuminated by a program that highlights the personal gifts of each and every participant. If we truly encourage our youth to learn to play, and play to learn, we will blaze a trail for the next generation to be healthier, happier and more innovative by 2050!","Our project’s main beneficiary will be the LA’s BEST Staff for whom we provide close training, mentorship, and development. We hope to give much of this young team, drawn directly from lower income neighborhoods and schools, innovative and wellness-centered skills that they have rarely been exposed to. These tools of creativity, on-your- feet learning, and mindfulness will encourage them toward personal happiness and wellness, as well as offer them teaching practices that can carry them into successful relationships, educational endeavors, and careers, with FLY, LA’s BEST and beyond.
 
 Second, as FLY's Teaching Artists land at each school, they will directly affect and nurture the LA’s BEST Supervisors and Staff with extra support needed to increase Arts education in LA schools. FLY will provide essential materials and classroom tools for the organization that will benefit the program as a whole.
 
 Finally, FLY will benefit the LAUSD students. Under well trained staff guidance, they will experience creative play and arts education at its best! Kids will not only learn to express, create and collaborate through their creative playtime, but will gain the health benefits of our movement curriculum’s physical fitness and energetic wellness. They will also be exposed to priceless self-awareness, communication, and life skills that will grow them into curious, compassionate, and innovative citizens.","FLY is collaborating with LA’s BESTt Enrichment Program. Beginning this past April, we have developed a relationship with LA’s BEST FIT as well as LA’s BEST ARTS in order to bring new and innovative Yoga training and Performing & Visual Arts instruction skills to their team. We have also provided lesson outlines, and curriculum breakdowns that easily bring our FLY classes and methodology to their students. 
 
 We have continued our communication and are working to schedule initial trainings and a handful of school partnerships beginning in August. If awarded, we will be able to provide much more in depth training, ongoing classroom time, and give tools to more of the LA’s BEST programs- providing nearly 200 LAUSD Elementary Schools with a more qualified staff, and potentially exposing thousands more after school kids to artistic education!
 
 The critical factors that will make this collaboration successful, will be: 
 
 1. Our ability to meet with and train the LA’s BEST staff at least three times over the year: one initial training, an in classroom follow up, and an end of year follow up workshop.
 
 2. Access and commitment from the LA’s BEST staff to implement our tools and practices, including lesson plans, audio, video and funsheets into their Enrichment programming.
 
 3. LA's BEST's assistance in measuring our goals through surveys, student and staff testimonials, and on site observations throughout the school year.",0,

Late 2015 – Early 2015: Comprehensive Community Engagement. 
 FLTS will host two community workshops to engage community in design to ensure the park will meet their needs. Soapbox: When people contribute to a community asset, they invest themselves and derive a sense of pride that often empowers them to stay active in and care for their community. 
 
 2. Late Winter/Early Spring 2015: Design. 
 SWA will finalize the design based on community drawings and verbal input. Final design presented to community during a “sidewalk engagement” party which will serve as the kick off for their new space!
 
 3. Spring – Summer 2015: Construction. 
 
 4. Summer 2015 - Pocket Park Opens! The vacant lot is no more – we have converted a vacant lot into an urban “spot”.","FLTS has a long standing belief that creating access to greenspaces in park-poor communities doesn’t need to be a process that begins in year 1 and ends with a park opening in year 9. Cypress Park Pocket Park will be a pivotal project in demonstrating that creating access to parks and greenspaces does not need to take years. This model can be easily implemented by agencies, community based organizations and non-profits to create a network of play and greenspaces in their park-poor communities. We are confident this model is a long-term, implementable solution to make LA the best place to play.","For this project, the pocket park will directly benefit the community of Cypress Park in North east Los Angeles. According to the 2010 Census , Cypress Park has an estimated population of approximately 11, 000 people, among the highest densities in Los Angeles County. In addition, the household median income for the ½ mile radius of the proposed park is $39,559, well below the poverty line. 
 
 However, because this is a pilot project , this pocket park will demonstrate how these small, under-utilized vacant spaces can become a network of greenspaces in park-poor areas in all of Los Angeles. We will illustrate how this project can be replicated and implemented over and over in similar spaces across Los Angeles.","We believe that successful community projects need a comprehensive collaborative of stakeholders. To ensure this, this project will be a collaborative between three major partners that will provide resources that will engage a comprehensive public. We will be partnering with local community leader and business in Cypress Park - Antigua Coffee House. Yancey Quinones, owner, is a community leader and advocate of creating community-driven, multi-benefit projects that inspire youth in Cypress Park to improve Cypress Park. Antigua Coffee House - located four blocks - from the vacant lot will serve as the community space hosting design workshops. 
 
 In addition 8th grade students from Nightingale Middle School located less than ¼ from the park will be engaged a grade-level service learning project during the park’s construction. Students will be involved in assisting with community engagement and final stage plantings at the park in 2nd semester of 2015.
 
 FLTS will be partnering with SWA Group (http://www.swagroup.com/) on design of the park. FLTS and SWA have partnered on greenspace projects in the last three years including our successful Dominguez Enhancement and Engagement Projects – which converted a vacant, blighted area of the Dominguez Creek in Gardena into a active bicycle path while restoring the natural habitat that existed along the creek. SWA is a world leader in landscape architecture, planning and urban design with a passion to create exceptional places for people with an emphasis on natural systems and art. SWA will bring their expertise in design to ensure these spaces are designed to specifically meet the community’s needs and assure quality design. 
 Lastly, in order to stay true to a community driven project, labor, materials and resources will be sourced locally. 
 Three factors that are critical to the success of the collaborations are: 
 1. An adopted understanding that final design of the space is community driven
 2. Committed and full participation from all partners
 3. Acknowledging that an engaged community is an empowered community – and every resource partners bring are guided by this principle",1,

Through collaborating with local social service agencies and community groups, HH brings instructors to share industry expertise and creativity with hundreds of at-risk youth each year who might not otherwise receive this unique training.","Our initiative will benefit at-risk youth within the Greater Los Angeles area as well as local artists. The LA has HEART project also seeks to benefit the LA community as a whole by creating arts programs that will deter at-risk youth from engaging in street crime and activities as well as giving LA the chance to educate itself in the importance of arts education and empowerment.
 
 The LA has HEART initiative directly takes advantage of the unique opportunities that only LA can offer—great artistic partners and young artists. In collaborating with them, we can, through each workshop, work towards eradicating street crime and increasing interest of the arts among at-risk youth.","Our target audience is teens and young adults, ages 13-21, who face a number of serious issues such as poverty, unstable family environments, drugs and alcohol, medical illness, and/or absence from school. 
 
 The initiative will also benefit artists who seek to create a network for themselves or find opportunities to share their talents.","LA is fortunate to have many organizations that offer arts instruction to at-risk youth. HH has strong relationships with two of these, CoachArt and The Mobile Film Classroom, with which we have completed over 10 programs and four workshops, respectively. In addition, HH has facilitated two filmmaking workshops with the IBD Support Foundation and partnered with the San Fernando Valley Partnership, Hillsides Education Center, Gabrielino, and Los Angeles High School as well. 
 
 Recently HH established new collaborations with The Salvation Army Algeria and the Laurel Foundation, and is in talks to offer programming with the Boys and Girl Club of the West Valley. 
 Our ability to establish sustainable partnerships is illustrated in our 19-year partnership with One Heartland for our summer arts camp. HH is dedicated to strengthening relationships with all our existing partners and continually seeks to collaborate with other like-minded organizations in for future programs.",1,
4102110,Lets Build a Life Science Incubator in Los Angeles!,LAb Launch plans to establish a Life Science Incubator to launch the next generation of biotech startups in Los Angeles,Create,2015109,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050create/projects/LALabLaunch.html,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,"We will gradually build out our support for LA area biotech startups as we progress along a five-year development plan. 
 Initial work will focus on identifying a site, opening coworking office and laboratory space, and leveraging further support to reach our goals from philanthropy, investments, and professional services. As this project develops, and the number of tenant startups grows, we plan to develop more hands-on support to new Life Tech businesses in the form of business acceleration and investment opportunities through our partners. 
 
 With support from LA2050, our plan to create and grow LA’s first early-stage Life Science incubator is as follows:
 
 Stage 1 (Year 1) – We will identify locations for the incubator facility, and begin working with developers on a development plan. At first, we will concentrate on opening office-style incubation space that can be ready to rent within one year of initial funding. This will allow us to welcome our first batch of startups from Digital Health and other virtual biotech spaces. Following office space, we will prioritize making shared meeting space available for local science education, citizen science groups, biotech investor networking, and other community-building purposes for the Life Science industry. 
 
 Stage 2 (Years 2-3) – Once office and meeting space is operational and generating facility income through tenancy, we will focus on opening “wet lab” research space (8,000-10,000 square feet), allowing the first biological research-intensive tenants to start up in the incubator. In addition to shared equipment and space, the incubator facility will provide services such as group purchasing, warehousing, and storage, to support the tenant companies and allow them to minimize their costs during their early-stage growth. 
 We will work with our partners, local business professionals, and investors to create a business accelerator program that will provide investment and support for new high-growth Life Science businesses in LA.
 
 Stage 3 (Years 3-5) – Once the incubator is fully operational with tenant companies, we will focus on growing the base of tenant companies with a goal of expanding operations to a permanent facility (40,000+ square feet) this is designed specifically to house a growing number of startup businesses, provide quality training and education space, and a hub for investment and business startup activity for Life Sciences in Los Angeles.","Life Science technologies are predicted to be among the leading growth industries of the 21st Century. Innovations in healthcare are leading the way to future generations of drugs and health products that will treat illnesses earlier and more effectively, prolonging and increasing the quality of human health. From healthcare to biofuels, to biosynthetic materials, to providing affordable and nutritious food, to creating sustainable habitats for space colonization, the life sciences are central to the biggest opportunities of the coming decades.
 
 Los Angeles is home to several world-class research universities, and thousands of talented young scientists. The Los Angeles metropolitan area is consistently among the top 5 employers in the Life Sciences nationwide. However, there is no entry-level business incubation space for biotech startups, and the few facilities that exist for more mature, growth-stage companies are consistently at or near full capacity. As a result, many scientists and inventors from Los Angeles are moving to other areas that are perceived as more supportive, such as San Francisco and San Diego, to start their biotech businesses.
 
 Creating an open, affordable space in Los Angeles for Life Science startups, along with business support and access to investors and advisers, is essential to reversing this trend. Our facility will allow research discoveries from Los Angeles’ universities to stay in LA, grow into successful businesses, employ staff from the LA area, and lay down a strong foundation for the economy of the 21st Century. 
 
 By 2050, some of the early startups that were supported by our incubator will have grown into large, successful businesses, employing thousands of people across Los Angeles. The Founders of these successful companies will become the next generation of investors, as they use the profits from their success to invest capital into the next generation of innovation. Through this community of innovators in Life Sciences, we will be able to anchor a self-sustaining cycle of success and innovation in biotechnology here in Los Angeles.","Our focus for this project is on creating business startups in an industry that is currently dramatically underrepresented in Los Angeles. Several groups are therefore likely to benefit from the creation of this incubator facility and its support for startup Life Science businesses:
 
 Students and Faculty from Los Angeles Universities – The most direct and immediate benefit will be to the scientists and trainees of our area’s many institutions of higher learning. Innovators from our local universities and colleges will be able to access facilities and support to develop businesses for their technologies, without leaving the area. Our open meeting space will allow for better networking with other scientists from across LA, as well as investors, business partners, and grantmakers.
 
 Citizen Scientists and Inventors – This project will allow people from across the LA area to access scientific expertise, technical advice, and professional networks to assist them in developing their ideas into practical technologies. With a central location for the life sciences in LA, individuals with limited knowledge of the industry will have access to collaborations and partnership with seasoned professionals and experts under the same roof.
 
 Life Science Industries in Los Angeles – Development of a more vibrant and productive biotech startup environment in Los Angeles would diminish the attraction of rival cities for LA’s startups. As a result, the industry as a whole would benefit in LA, with more jobs being created locally by startup businesses, providing a broader and deeper pool of professional opportunities for biotech professionals in our area.
 
 Communities of Los Angeles – Our goal is to create an incubator that will allow many biotech startups to be successful and develop locally. As these companies grow, they will need staff – a key feature of biotech is that it requires technical precision and adherence to strict safety protocols. In other words, biotech needs skilled labor: investment in the life sciences will create well-paying, professional jobs that will help reinvigorate our middle class.
 
 K-12 Students – By creating an innovation hub for life sciences in LA, we also provide a central repository of expertise for our industry. Meeting space(s) will be available for teaching and other types of educational activities. Our coworking space will enable students to perform research studies that are beyond the capabilities of their own school's facilities.","The following groups/businesses are confirmed as partners in this project, and have committed to provide advice and support for our efforts as follows:
 
 Southern California Biomedical Council (SoCalBio) – The trade association for life sciences in Southern California will provide access to investors and professional services for the startups launched through our incubator. Their regular investors’ events will provide a venue for our tenant companies to pitch their businesses and raise capital, as well as network with other industry professionals. The development of an incubator with coworking and open meeting space will provide groups such as SoCalBio dedicated biotech-themed space to hold meetings and events for industry and investors.
 
 LA Biohackers – This citizen science group maintains a small shared laboratory space in downtown LA for small-scale experiments and group projects. The creation of a permanent biotech startup incubator would provide space for growth of their technologies and discoveries, as well as a venue for them to develop public open-access classes in biotechnology – an activity that they are currently unable to perform due to space constraints in their current location. Our partnership with the LA Biohackers will provide community outreach and independent development of public-centered education programs, while providing independent innovators with a permanent home in Los Angeles to grow their technologies into sustainable businesses.
 
 X-PRIZE Foundation – the Director of Life Science competitions for the X-PRIZE Foundation is a co-founder of this project. This will ensure that LA-based innovators have access to new competitions and opportunities. A new Life Science incubator in LA will form a central role in promoting and supporting LA innovators' responses to new X-Prize challenges in the Life Sciences.
 
 Pasadena Bioscience Collaborative (PBC) – This biotech incubator in Pasadena currently supports 18 companies across three separate locations. The PBC will offer us experienced advice about running a life science incubator, and access to an existing base of investors and supporters of the Life Sciences industry from the San Gabriel Valley. Our collaboration will be mutually beneficial by expanding available space for startups, providing a link between the LA Basin and San Gabriel Valley biotech communities, and enhancing access between innovators and investors across the LA region.",0,
4102132,Meet me in MacArthur Park,"In 2015, we will work to revitalize MacArthur Park into a vibrant hub for community connection.",Connect,2015127,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050connect/projects/MacArthurParkConnect.html,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"The LA Neighborhood Land Trust is working to revitalize MacArthur Park as a thriving community hub that connects Angelenos. This year, we engaged over 1,000 residents, with over 600 community members participating in our park beautification days. We conducted community research through surveys, focus groups, interviews, and mapping exercises, and are documenting resident concerns in a report with recommendations for the improvement of the park. In 2015, we will continue our collaborative efforts to revive the park into a vibrant community space for connection in the center of LA. We’ve heard what community members have to say, and now we’re putting it into action!","Informed by our 2014 research, we will revive MacArthur Park through outreach, leadership development, events and programming, beautification, and social media messaging. 
 
 OUTREACH: Our model of park improvement is based on community outreach and resident engagement. We invite Angelenos to help revive MacArthur Park through door-to-door outreach, presentations at partner schools and organizations, volunteering at community events, and participating in beautification of the park. 
 
 LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT: In 2015, we will equip MacArthur Park residents with skills and knowledge of the public process so they can advocate for park resources, ensuring that elected officials are more responsive to their concerns. We will continue developing leaders by training them to lead clean up squads, facilitate community meetings, and collect surveys. 
 
 EVENTS/PROGRAMS: Park users have asked for more programming and events. In 2015, we will hold 2 community events that celebrate diversity, creativity, and connectivity. These cultural events will highlight the park’s potential to be a hub for community interaction, civic engagement, and healthy living for all Angelenos. 
 
 The success and safety of a park is heavily reliant on community-desired programs. We are asking for community input on activities they would like to see at the park. Based on their requests, we will bring year-round programming to supplement existing programs. 
 
 BEAUTIFICATION: Our research has shown that beautification is a priority. This year, we focused on addressing litter at the park by supporting Councilmember Cedillo’s Keep It Clean campaign. We held clean ups to educate residents about litter and emphasize the importance of caring for the park. We have a solid and enthusiastic group of volunteers, and will continue to engage them around beautification efforts involving landscaping, signage, and maintenance improvements.
 
 SOCIAL MEDIA MESSAGING: Later this year, MacArthur Park will become the first city park equipped with free Wifi! We will capitalize on this opportunity to rebrand the park. 
 
 We find that Angelenos are unaware of the resources and programs available at the park, and instead dwell on negative perceptions. We will develop a social media plan to tell a new story. By broadcasting the positive activities in MacArthur Park and highlighting volunteer opportunities, programs, events, and community involvement, a more positive view of the park will unfold.","Whoever said Angelenos don’t walk has never visited South Alvarado Street. Every day, this thoroughfare is busy with people on foot passing through, or on the way to the nearby metro stop. Today, pedestrians hurry past MacArthur Park without a second glance toward the lake, the soccer field, or the historic recreation center. We envision reviving the park through programming, events, leadership development and social media branding, so that MacArthur Park is no longer an ignored backdrop and instead, becomes a destination for connecting with nature, connecting with one another, and connecting with history. Local residents will be more aware of park programs where they can interact with their neighbors and build support networks. Local youth will no longer seek out programming at other, farther parks, but will instead attend movie-nights at MacArthur Park and connect to the community resources available at the rec center. We also expect the free wifi (to be installed in 2014) to draw people out of their houses and into the park to stay connected with current events, local news, or social media friends. This is all possible, and we can make it happen together. 
 
 Sustainability and longevity of a project are reliant on community involvement. Successful parks have engaged residents. By involving community members and encouraging their leadership in the process to revive this park, we know that it will contribute to a healthier Los Angeles in the year 2050. Perfectly situated in central Los Angeles with easy access to downtown and the west side, “Meet me at MacArthur Park,” will be a trending phrase. In 2050, Angelenos will put the park at the top of their lists for connecting with friends or business partners, catching an outdoor movie, relaxing, getting some exercise, or attending a cultural event. Tourists will make it a must-see destination spot and artists will convene there to display and sell their art. Our project in 2015 will help us get there.","This community-driven project will first and foremost directly benefit the residents of Westlake, an underserved neighborhood in central Los Angeles, who currently suffer from a lack of green space, resources, social capital, support networks, and connection to decision-makers and each other. 
 
 The park is a historical landmark in the city, used by a wide range of Angelenos across the city. Once revitalized and rebranded, the park will serve an even greater number of people through its compelling and interactive programming and be a vibrant city hub for cultural connection and community activity. With its central location and public transit access, in addition to free WiFi, it will also serve as a green reprieve from the urban bustle. People who come from all over the County to attend the Levitt Pavilion summer concerts at MacArthur Park will benefit from this transformative project. Nearby businesses will thrive with increased patrons and a new point of community pride.","MacArthur Park represents a prime opportunity for connecting and engaging Angelenos, and investment in the park and its promise is on the rise. Today, more community-based organizations, elected officials, and activist networks are turning their attention to this neglected historic landmark. In 2014, we forged meaningful relationships with other organizations and agencies and we intend to continue working collectively to enact change in this area of Los Angeles. We work closely with the City Department of Recreation and Parks to ensure our work supports the Park Director and his efforts to bring programs to MacArthur Park. Other key partners include Praise Chapel Los Angeles, Heart of Los Angeles, Camino Nuevo Charter Academy, Esperanza Housing Corporation, Rediscover MacArthur Park Alliance and two neighborhood councils. The collaborative energy and transformative spirit persists, and we need to capitalize on this moment. We believe our project can serve as a catalyst to unite various efforts and turn MacArthur Park into a real resource that spurs local and city-wide opportunities for connection.",

It will also ultimately seek transferability status to programs like UCLA, USC, CalPoly, and others.","Many urban areas in Central and South Los Angeles do not have sufficient access to groceries stores, yet are overrun with fast food eateries and convenience/liquor stores. Their choices of diet are limited and it is difficult, costly, and time consuming to obtain wholesome fruits and vegetables. There is a growing plague of obesity and diabetes in America and other countries that have adopted the habit of relying on the dominance of pre-prepared foods. Overworked mothers often do not have the choice of feeding their families plant, fruit, enzyme and mineral rich, traditional meals. Half the nutrition in vegetables is lost within a day of being picked. Urban agriculture would provide these families with choices, develop a deeper understanding of health, and offer the joy of a living and growing relationship to our source of nutrition, in these concrete landscape environments. Additionally, the potential for personal and public savings on healthcare, a community that encourages better decisions through hands on lessons in cultivating life, and the possibility of entrepreneurial endeavors would only serve to benefit us all. 
 Los Angeles is a 21st century mega-city with over 4 million citizens (10 million in LA County), the food shed of which extends 200 miles. Astonishingly enough, rooftops amount to 20% of the land mass occupying exposed space in Los Angeles. Many of these spaces are functionally dormant, and serve as heat islands in a city burdened with enough environmental challenges as it is. Additionally, there are ten thousand vacant parcels that benefit no one except absentee landlords or developers not from the community. All these spaces are primed for agricultural activation, and upcoming legislative packages are finally beginning to incentivize the involvement of micro-enterprise to do so.","Confirmed Partners/Collaborators-

This type of learning applies Architecture as a social mechanism that stimulates the sensory system, affecting intellect and desire to create by means of spatial languages and computer technologies. The project provides innovative templates to create spaces, objects, and solutions for local needs and motivates the untapped talent of visual thinkers in our communities. It provides a nurturing environment where learning can happen in the context of doing. It provides safe, environmentally sustainable places in which to live, work and play; places to learn, worship, meet, govern, shop and eat. Private or public, indoors or outdoors, rooms, buildings or complexes this project’s built environment will include neighborhoods, towns, suburbs and cities. A key impact is, for the first time, more people will participate in the transformation and creation of the place they live, work, move, create. The Built Environment is the perfect canvas for learning. The study of Architecture has been very narrow and prevented people from learning and participating in the life cycle of our city, buildings, campuses and neighborhoods. Our students will apply the art and the science of creating such spaces and products. Basic and universal needs will inspire innovative designs and transform needs into evolutionary and participatory reality through the life cycle of the building from concept to construction, operation, maintenance and assessment. The project will be a parallel and collaborative effort to current practices in Architecture. The impact will be the inclusion of stronger social concerns and the ability to react to location and space. It will create, augment, and connect residents with a sustainable environment through more people participating in making and creating the built environment.","Higher education, socio-economic leaders and local communities will benefit from synergetic thinking and an integrated approach. Learning will transpire in the context of doing and purpose. Multiple efforts including National Intelligence, local neighborhood first response and Americans with Disabilities will benefit by having local models of how to connect higher education with their communities. Also benefiting will be all students and partners currently participating in our program and the ENCOUNTER Network. This new synergetic learning will catalyze our neighborhoods and our higher education system. With the new lenses of GIS/BIM and 3D modeling and visualizing, the area’s workforce will benefit by facilitation of an unprecedented analytical and comprehensive means of looking at human-made ecosystems. We will benefit by creating a sustainable workforce that will see patterns and relationships never before seen and they will help all sustain on the planet. Currently untapped members of the workforce will be helped via a butterfly effect to present, document, design, and ideate their contribution to the system. to engage, volunteer and participate in decision making. To empower our population, we need to help them contribute in meaningfully civic process with their own passion and purpose. I believe every person has a mission in life and my job is to help them find it and develop it. We need to help them present, document, design, and ideate their contribution to the system. The ENCOUNTER Network, a seminal founding energy, will propel these benefits into the greater population. The ENCOUNTER projects connect multiple existing organizations that will bring the project to the next level financially, technologically and academically.","To be clear with time, budget and scope with all our partners will be a key factor for success. World Peace One Education and Communities: This organization provides UCLA Extension courses to our students to help them go on to higher education with education that matters. We are developing an articulation agreement with them to take our students and our ENCOUNTER project to the next level of implantation with 'World Peace One Peace Projects. Los Angeles Worlds Fair: Theme of the Los Angeles World's Fair is ""The Connected City"" collaborating on supporting their goal of pavilion design, fair planning and urban design layout, with the possibility of engaging the students and our partners. The USC Institute for Genetic Medicine Art Gallery: We will continue to work with the Gallery to organize events and gallery exhibitions promoting integrated thinking and holistic approaches. City Council District 9 is eager to use our student work to prototype a City of Tomorrow. The Los Angeles Open Acres organization has a map with more than 500 open sites that we could transform or virtualize as possible urban interventions. Jobcreate: We are working with this local organization that has the management skills and training guidelines to take our models and graduated interns to implement their goals. Additionally, ENCOUNTER Network such as Efrain Miramontes, Ken Wyrick, and others bring Journalism, Design, Computer Networking, and other services to the project. Power Of Green: This is a program of Five Points in the U.S. consults for countries on Sustainable Technology, Green Architecture, and Renewable Energy. Their services and knowledge will augment our interns' opportunity for growth and collaboration.

 On a programmatic level, MAPS and WIB: 1. Will recruit 120 unemployed adults and out-of-school youth ages ranging from 17-22. Both will be matched by age, initial test level, and ethnicity. All 120 will take 6 computer-based valid and reliable Workkeys assessments to determine career readiness and soft skill levels.
 2. Each pair will be split into two agencies, which are MAPS and WIB with 30 youth and 30 adults each. Both agencies will provide different educational/professional skills training.
 3. All 120 will receive access to activities that are suitable to their employment and/or training needs at WIB.
 4. WIB will pay for 500 hours of job training for all 120 people, where 60 will work at MAPS site and 60 will work through WIB’s contacts.
 5. At MAPS, custom-tailored skill building tasks will be provided for individuals to align with their career goals. Also, they will work on a collaborative goal to showcase a city-wide event addressing an issue they desire to eliminate in the city. For example, MAPS students have hosted county-wide teen summits and college fairs from start to finish.
 6. After training completion, 120 will take post-training assessments. Scores higher than 3 will receive the nationally recognized career readiness certificate--career ready! 
 
 We will be the driving force to bridge agencies and people to not only discuss the problem, but to take action. MAPS will: 
 1. continue to hold events and meetings with leaders and elected officials to establish collaborative partnerships. 
 2. recruit at least six representatives with significant leadership responsibilities in their prospective agencies to form the executive team by December 2014. 
 
 With the executive team, we will:
 1. connect via phone, online, or in person to develop workforce framework and execution plan. Before March 2015, the team will submit the work ready community application for consideration. 
 2. spearhead LA County by reaching out to our contacts to establish a conglomerate group of agencies from various industries, schools, economic development corporations, and colleges to join this unified work ready movement.
 3. agree upon a written and online agreement with the agencies who adhere to help people become work ready and create a bridge for people to receive livable wages.
 4. Sponsor to pay 10 employment agencies as test site centers.","Close the Skills Gap - MAPS will continue to prepare underskilled workers, youth, and adults for college and the workforce using our unique training approach. Since 2009, 100% of our low-income, minority youth and adults who completed our college/career programs secured employment, went to college/graduate school, or achieved their next goal. 
 
 Develop a Replicable Workforce, Skills Training Program - We want to launch our program in a new city to determine whether is it possible to replicate similar results. In doing so, we desire to develop a workforce system model. 
 
 Help Industries Measure Work-Related Skills in Need - We will measure the effectiveness of MAPS and WIB’s skill building, job training programs using valid/reliable skills and pre/post assessments to measure whether people have the academic, social, and emotional skills to succeed in the workplace (career ready). Not only will we get people work ready, but these assessments are actual exams for the National Career Readiness Certificate! 
 
 Match People and Business to Increase Economic Growth - The certificate will give people an edge in the recruitment process to help identify qualified workers. So far, there are more than 5,600 corporations throughout the nation that recognize this certification.
 
 Start a Small School-College-Work Bridge Aligned with New Workforce Act - We will start with one city to establish a bridge using the National Certificate exams to unite LA schools, colleges, businesses and agencies. The groups help create paths for people to be skilled, prevent outsourcing, reduce unemployment rates, and secure jobs to boost LA’s economy. MAPS’ drive is to spearhead this mission to unify multiple agencies to become the first certified work ready community in California. This effort will start near Southeast LA and then spread to other regions. 
 
 In 2050, LA will be aligned with Workforce Innovation and Opportunities Act and developed the workforce system. Businesses, schools, and agencies will adhere to the research-based assessments as an indicator to determine whether people are certifiably ready for the workforce. People will have the necessary foundational skills to be competitive in the market and secure careers they are passionate about while maintaining strong and positive character, leadership, and interpersonal skills to improve the quality of their lives, the workplace environment, and LA. LA will be a fully functioning workforce model for CA.","When multiple agencies work synergistically together to become a certified work ready community, everyone benefits. This community-based approach creates a platform where people, businesses, communities, and the local government can support each other through focused strategic initiatives to help bridge resources. If people are skilled, employers will hire the right people, employment rates and revenue will increase, and people will live quality lives. This unified approach creates an economic powerhouse for LA.
  
 Under skilled, at-risk, unemployed people - When people take the valid/reliable assessments, they will be part of the 2.3 million nationally recognized certificate holders who have the level of skills needed to be work ready. With more than 40 statewide/regions that have adopted the certificate programs and more than 5,600 businesses who use this certification to assess skill level, the people in LA will be part of this nationwide movement.
 
 People whose skills rank above 3 out of 7 for the assessments will receive the National Career Readiness Certificate. The certificate will help them distinguish themselves during the hiring process because they will have evidence demonstrating their skill level. 
 
 Businesses- With many businesses searching for skilled talent through a pile of applicants, this certificate can help recruiters save time. Businesses can function at an optimal level without concerns about the skills of their employees.
  
 City-wide to State-wide- The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity 2014 Act requires states to begin developing a statewide workforce development system. This grant will initiate approaches to develop models and systems for one city and then expand to the state. Through this collaborative effort, LA will be the catalyst for positive change.
 
 MAPS- This grant will elevate us onto a different platform to demonstrate that we, in fact, have the most innovative, result-oriented, school-to-college-to-work bridge.

4102156,Every Kid Deserves a Learning Garden,Open Grove harnesses the institutional power of congregations by repurposing fallow land into orchards.,Live,2015144,2014,,,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,,"The collaboration of Netiya and Seeds of Hope through Open Grove involves engaging the untapped power of our faith-based institutions around food justice. As a combined network of close to 250 institutions, we start with accessing willing partners that can offer acreage, resources, and volunteers from our institutions. We build out a collaborative network wherein Open Grove offers institutions with deeply rooted and, in many cases, shared ethics, an opportunity to become powerfully aligned with one another around food justice in LA. 
 
 The viability of our 2050 vision will be demonstrated within the next year by taking on the following measurables:
 
 1) Develop three pilot orchard projects at three faith-based institutions representing geographic, religious, socioeconomic, and land-use diversity. Complete experiential and educational orchard installs and have the three institutions coordinating their own sustainable garden maintenance plans.
 
 2) Initiate large-scale interfaith food justice collaboration through institutional engagement by convening a one-day, interfaith food awareness summit targeted toward religious and lay leaders across institutions, building upon the Seeds of Hope conference that was held in May 2014. This conference will focus on shmita - the religious commandment of leaving the land fallow every seven years (from September 2014-2015). We’ll hold interfaith discussions about how to improve upon our food growing operations so the recipients of the food relief become more empowered - and focus on food sovereignty rather than furthering hand outs.
 
 3) Convene an “Interfaith Council” that meets twice a year to collaborate and support ongoing food production efforts, building upon Netiya’s successful model Council. Hold meetings sharing best practices on food procurement and food security with interfaith clergy and lay leadership.
 
 4) Develop and distribute a “Your Congregation's Sustainable, Water-Wise Orchard Resource Guide.” Perhaps it will have a shorter title! The guide will give tools to our network institutions to plant and maintain orchards on their properties and contribute the produce to grow community food security.","Converting faith-based institutions’ unused land into productive green space will expand urban green areas and bring about related environmental benefits. These include temperature reduction, energy conservation, fewer smog and red alert days, improved water quality, and sequestering of greenhouse gases. In particular, there is an acute awareness of the need for more green space in low-income urban environments. In this way, Open Grove’s approach can have a particularly powerful impact on the health of these communities, as religious institutions are very strong players and can become a starting point for cultivating new and improved access to green spaces. 
 
 Open Grove’s other benefits result from shifting towards local sustainable food systems, as a response to food safety and food access issues, as well as national epidemics of hunger and obesity. The focus on planting urban orchards is intentional, as we assert that urban orchards can have a much more significant effect on the long-term food system than annual vegetable gardens. Once established and producing, orchards can produce food for decades, and, in the case of nut trees, can produce healthy food with high caloric value. Orchards are also significantly easier to maintain once established, need far less material (compost, mulch, plastic irrigation supplies), water, and labor than annual gardens, and many orchards will produce food even if they are left alone for years. And Open Grove will work with gleaning networks in LA that already work on private and public orchards to provide food to local pantries.","Open Grove recognizes its place in a much larger urban sustainability movement in Los Angeles that provides environmental, economic, and societal benefits to Angelenos. By funding two networks to collaborate on installing Urban Orchards on institutional land, this project will effectively free up more unused land to increase food production. It will also do two vital things: 1) it will enhance the food justice collaboration between secular and religious sectors and 2) it will give voice to the religious and spiritual people / institutions in LA that have not yet been harnessed and serve to literally and figuratively “feed” this growing food movement. Specifically, Open Grove is part of the much larger urban greening, local food production, and food justice movements. By engaging powerful faith-based allies across the city in planting urban orchards, Open Grove will amplify the social and environmental benefits of tree planting for food, creating positive effects that will last for decades.

 Some partners do advocacy, some provide funding, others provide land, and still others find the materials needed to install the orchards.
 
 We have very specific membership and partnership terms for all collaborations. We work towards a model of empowerment and reciprocity. We are happy to forward a PDF with our terms for your perusal. 
 
 Potential partners may come from the public or private sector, including corporations, academia, water agencies, other food and environmental nonprofits, and workforce development agencies. We would specifically expect to continue to engage our network partner institutions, UC Master Gardener, Master Composter, and Master Food Preserver volunteers, Brown Mountain CSA, Social Justice Learning Institute, Food Forward, Tree People, the Million Trees Initiative, the Yale University Urban Resources Initiative, SOVA and the NoHo interfaith food pantry. We will also bring in community organizations and youth groups to help start up and manage the orchards in their local neighborhoods, potentially establishing new community hubs in areas with limited access to fresh food.
 
 The collaboration with Seeds of Hope is confirmed - this is Netiya main partner. The food justice ministry of the Episcopal Diocese of LA established to repurpose church property and facilities for the production and distribution of food in underserved communities across the six-county diocese.

4102174,Creating Opportunities For Physical Activity (COPA) - Peer Coach PE Program,"The Pomona Women’s Center is a residential treatment program, serving as lifeline to women impacted by addiction, mental illness and trauma.",Live,2015161,2014,,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,"Prototypes’ Pomona Women’s Center has been in operation since 1988, providing residential treatment to women and their children. Our LA2050 project will further the capacity of our Pomona Women’s Center to provide fully integrated healthcare to help women and their families create a foundation for a healthy, independent and successful future. Specifically, it will add critical staff that will help families with their health care needs during and after treatment, focuses on building women’s self-sufficiency to make sure homelessness is no longer an inevitable fate and bolsters our mental health services. 
 
 Our project will add a Health Care Navigator to the team providing case management to families and ensuring that all of their health needs are met. This includes enrolling in health insurance, ensuring that mothers and children receive comprehensive assessments, identifying any resources in the community and following up to make sure treatment and care is being received and moving families toward their goal of self-sufficiency. In addition, this project will support a Vocational Counselor to provide women with the opportunities to gain skills to search and apply for employment. Opportunities and resources are provided on-site to build each client’s resume, ensuring gainful employment once they complete treatment. The project will also help to fund a Mental Health Clinician to provide mental health assessments to women and children. This position will also provide individual, group and family therapy. And finally, the project will also include a vehicle lease for a van that will ensure that transportation is not an issue in accessing care such as bringing a client’s family to the facility for therapy and assisting women and children with doctor’s appointments.","Among the 18.9 million adults with a substance use disorder in the past year, almost half had a co-occurring mental illness. However, only 7.4% of individuals receive treatment for both conditions and 55.8% receive no treatment at all. Due to the Affordable Care Act, 640,000 people in Los Angeles County are estimated to be eligible for Medi-Cal and 10% of them will need treatment for substance use disorders. This impacts Los Angeles as untreated addiction and mental illness can lead to unemployment, incarceration, child abuse or neglect, homelessness and a cycle of poverty for many families.
 
 We can change that. Prototypes’ residential treatment is often the last hope for women with such complex issues because they have nowhere else to go. Through partnerships with local medical providers, social services agencies and the justice system, we remove barriers to access with a “whatever it takes” approach to ensure women receive addiction and mental health treatment. 
 
 Research has shown that women with substance use disorders also have high rates posttraumatic stress disorder; not surprising then is that more than 87% of the women in Prototypes’ residential treatment have been victims of sexual and/or physical abuse as well as domestic violence. Trauma is then a key focus as staff help clients understand the underlying causes of their addiction and provides them tools to successfully get through difficult situations without the use of drugs and alcohol. 
 
 Furthermore, over two-thirds of women with co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders are mothers, yet most programs do not support a woman’s role as a mother or will not accommodate pregnant and postpartum women. We encourage women to bring their children with them, so they don’t have to choose between their health and their children. Keeping families together not only improves a mother’s success in her recovery, but also impacts future generations in Los Angeles.
 
 Prototypes’ residential treatment aims to fill the gap in service delivery by taking a holistic viewpoint on health and identifying everything from therapy to housing as necessary treatment for our most vulnerable. Not only to help families get access to healthcare, but we also provided the tools and resources to women become self-sufficient through housing, employment, parenting and education. The program also impacts a second generation who receive care and support to prevent future adverse experiences for children.","Hundreds of women- those with children, those without, those who are expecting and those who have recently given birth- are brought down by addiction and its myriad challenges. Their issues are often so complex; they have nowhere else to go since many traditional programs may only offer one type of treatment. 
 
 Prototypes’ Pomona Women’s Center will benefit low-income women and their children in Los Angeles County who face barriers in accessing vital behavioral treatment. We also include a client’s family in their recovery progress, providing family therapy and support. 
 
 Based on our services over the years, the project is estimated to serve a client population that consists of the following: 43% Latina/o, 28% white, 27% African-American, 1% Asian/Pacific Islander and 1% American Indian. The project will serve women who struggle with the disease of addiction and may also be victims of domestic violence, have mental illness, be homeless and/or involved with the criminal justice system. They often face difficulties such as poverty due to insufficient skills and employment, language barriers, lack of access to public benefits and/or may have lost custody of their children.","Over the years, Prototypes has developed a deep network of government and social services that help us meet the needs of our clients. This includes Los Angeles County agencies such as the Department of Mental Health and Department of Children and Family Services that provide referrals and resources to serve clients. We also collaborate with the criminal justice system including the Public Defender’s Office, California Department of Corrections and County Probation Department to ensure we can serve those who are incarcerated. Partnerships with local entities such as Pomona Unified School District and the Pomona Housing Authority ensure education and housing resources. We also work with East Valley Community Health Centers to provide medical care.
 
 These partnerships are long-standing and contribute to the success of our residential program. Three critical factors that have help ensure our successful collaboration is open communication on project status through reports and meetings, effective partnership agreements and mutual support on projects.",0,
4102186,Streetcraft LA,"Streetcraft empowers low income, at risk, and unemployed youth to improve their economic future through creative economy entrepreneurship.",Create,2015175,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050create/projects/streetcraftla.html,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,"How do we help kids create their own jobs in the creative economy? Streetcraft LA’s approach to launching creative micro-ventures is a three-step model we call engage, partner, and launch. First, we engage youth who are on a path leading to dropout, unemployment, and juvenile justice involvement—or who are already misapplying their creative capacity through graffiti—in a training and youth development program we call The Streetcraft Crew. Crew is a yearlong program taught by well-known street artists that empowers at-risk kids to see themselves as artists, designers, and entrepreneurs, by building the design and production skills needed for creative economy entrepreneurship, and by developing the character traits and peer relationships needed to effectively apply those skills to entrepreneurship and ongoing education. Crew functions not only as a positive intervention in the life of at risk youth, but also serves as the Streetcraft human resources department, sourcing the true talent that is ready for step two, a formal paid apprenticeship in Streetcraft LA's retail platform and design studio. 
 
 Streetcraft LA operates a retail store in the heart of Santa Monica's vibrant Main Street shopping district that showcases collaboratively designed and produced products and original apparel. Youth are formal partners in this social venture, working with Streetcraft's lead designer to design custom furniture and original apparel such as hoodies, lids, and t-shirts. Over a one-year period, Streetcraft partners learn the product design process including market research, sales, marketing and promotion, distribution platforms and retail management through both direct instruction by industry professionals and experiential learning. Streetcraft partners receive a percentage of all sales. Streetcraft partners are also required and supported to complete high school and attend relevant higher education including certificate and degree programs while enrolled.
 
 After this one-year partnership, Streetcraft youth enter a process to launch their own creative micro-enterprise. Youth can choose to enter a business planning process in apparel, product design, or creative services. Youth are paired with industry mentors and attend lectures and one-on-one work sessions on product development, market analysis, financing and organization development. Youth completing this process have the opportunity to pitch their venture to a pool of funders convened by SBCC.","The unemployment rate in Los Angeles County during June 2014 stood at 8.2%--significantly higher than the statewide rate of 7.4%. Given the ratio between overall unemployment rates, and rates for youth ages 16-19 in recent years, this leads us to estimate a youth unemployment rate in LA County of more than 28%. 
 
 According to a study published by Jobs for the Future, only 25% of participants in most job training programs increase their annual wages. Over 85% of Streetcraft youth increase their annual income. Within ten years Streetcraft will spread this impact throughout Los Angeles County, becoming a countywide initiative with retail hubs in 20 locations working with over 20,000 young people a year. Our engagement programming will reduce graffiti and illicit street enterprises; the apprenticeship program will increase youths' annual income and provide concrete technical skills and work experience; and the micro venture program will increase the annual income of students by 50%. Finally, communities where Streetcraft hubs are located will see youth unemployment decrease by 5%.
 
 Streetcraft's vision for success in 2050 is ambitious: reduce youth unemployment by 25% through creative economy entrepreneurship. We believe that by targeting youth unemployment, we can dramatically impact other key indicators in the LA2050 metrics: arts establishments per capita increase when new workforce cohorts see the arts as a key component of their own creative entrepreneurship. Jobs per capita increase more dramatically through a strategy that targets the disproportionately unemployed youth population. And given the demographic profile of the majority of youth with whom we work, such a strategy will lead to an increase in the number of minority-owned firms, and to a more equitable distribution of income and opportunities. With its emphasis on degree and certificate programs for participants, we believe that Streetcraft also represents an effective means of re-engaging youth who have disconnected from higher education, increasing the recruiting and retention rates at local colleges and universities and, by building jobs for the graduates, increasing the number of them who remain in LA County.","Juan was arrested when he was 15 for running a 25-person drug ring. When Streetcraft's co-founder Jonathan met Juan he was 18 years old, out of jail, trying to change his life, but he was hopeless. Juan told Jonathan that he had no skills or talents. Jonathan categorically disagreed. “No skills? 25 person drug ring?” he said. “You're an entrepreneur, but we got to get you another product.” 
 
 Streetcraft works with kids like Juan: low income, marginalized youth who have disconnected from school and the workforce, and who are at risk for misapplying their creativity and getting busted. Increasingly, our outreach program has developed the capacity to target these young people before they become involved with the justice system, reaching them at the point where school failure, unemployment, and lack of positive direction first begin to create barriers and challenges. Our outreach works in tandem with SBCC's countywide community organizing project, which has operated for more than a decade and currently mobilizes more than 100 neighborhood groups throughout the county. These groups are located in neighborhoods that share common characteristics including: pluralities of African American and/or Hispanic/Latino residents, high rates of family poverty and youth unemployment, high rates of high school dropout, and large numbers of youth involved in the juvenile justice system. Our years of relationship-building with these groups of resident leaders give us the capacity to reach youth in this key demographic group throughout L.A. County through direct, neighbor-to-neighbor outreach, rather than relying on expensive and often unreliable mass media approaches, or working through social service agencies. Youth in Streetcraft thus reside in low-income, under-resourced neighborhoods throughout the county, but share common traits in addition to challenges with education and employment: most are African American or Hispanic/Latino; the great majority live in families with incomes at 200% or less of federal poverty level; many speak a language other than English at home; and most have parents who did not attend college, and in many cases did not graduate high school.","Streetcraft has a number of strategic partners. First, we will work with our network of Neighborhood Action Councils (NACs) to refer youth into the program. Future referral partners will include youth development community based organizations seeking career opportunities for marginalized young people such as the Boys & Girls Club, YMCAs, and others. In addition, Streetcraft is currently developing a partnership with LAPD in several key neighborhoods to work with youth being released into the community from juvenile detention facilities. Lastly, Streetcraft's model is contingent upon utilizing workforce investment funds, and has worked since its inception to engage local workforce investment boards interested in entrepreneurship as an ongoing sustainable funding source.
 
 SBCC has also made a commitment to leveraging resources provided by philanthropic and public-sector partners to support the goals of Streetcraft while meeting the needs of these funders. Support from the James Irvine Foundation for youth re-engagement strategies, and from the California Wellness Foundation for youth violence prevention, have both been instrumental in the development and piloting of the Streetcraft strategy, and will continue to form an indispensable source of support for the program. SBCC's Family Support program, funded by the L.A. County Department of Children and Family Resources, allows the program to provide ongoing social support services to Streetcraft participants, including counseling, coaching, and referrals for mental and primary healthcare, housing assistance, transportation assistance, childcare, and other critical needs.
 
 SBCC is currently building collaborations with higher education institutions including UCLA, the Design Center, Cerritos College, Santa Monica College, CSU Dominguez Hills, CSU Long Beach, and others, in order to increase opportunities for internship and directed study, as well as college credit-bearing workshops and classes on-site at Streetcraft.
 
 In all of our partnerships, philosophical alignment is the critical elements. The Streetcraft venture has a set of deeply held core values: every person has strengths and talents that need to be respected and placed at the center of any plan to train, educate, and support that person. All of our partners share this commitment to the intrinsic worth of our participants.",1,
4102188,SCV Adventure Play Pop-ups and Park Projects,SCV Adventure Play plans to expand its pop-up events and permanent adventure playground to offer our unique play approach to all.,Play,2015176,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050play/projects/scvadventureplay.html,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,Santa Clarita Valley,"We are working within three start-up phases. Phase 1 consists of holding pop-up adventure playgrounds in the Santa Clarita Valley for awareness building of self-directed play, connecting with the community, finding partners who support our mission, marketing our initiative, and to purchase property for a future permanent adventure playground and play education site. 
 
 Since March of 2014 we have been holding pop-ups on a regular basis in the Santa Clarita Valley in partnership with the City of Santa Clarita, The Art Tree, and Pop-up Adventure Play’s U.S. tour. The pop-ups usually consist of; 2 to 3 devoted playworkers, a small space, loads of boxes, string, fabric, used or recycled materials and a few hours allowing all who come by to make, create, and invent. 
 
 In February 2014 Jeremiah Dockray and Erica Larsen, founders of SCV Adventure Play, purchased a nearly 2 acre, 30 year abandoned, park in Val Verde, CA as the future site of “Eureka Villa” a permanent adventure play space and hopeful hub of study and education in the movement to offer non-product based activity for children and adults alike. 
 
 We are now entering phase 2 which is devoted to developing the park and expanding the pop-ups within and beyond Santa Clarita Valley. Regarding the park, we are researching and quoting various improvements for it to be made available for the public. This includes arborist assessments on the nearly 30 various types of trees on the property, re-fencing the parameter, brush clearance, and hopefully water setup and power accessibility. Once this cleanup is done, we will hold a soft opening of the Adventure Playground. For the Pop-ups, this includes the purchase of a “Pop-up Truck”, a box truck to be used as storage and transportation (currently all materials are stored in the founder’s garage and is loaded and unloaded into their cars for each pop-up). 
 
 Phase 3 is to formalize the park and launch a playwork program. In this phase, our goal is to develop the space as a community, build bathroom facilities on the property, begin an educational program specializing in playworking, and open fully to the public as an adventure playground and gathering space. We were advised by the Pop-up Adventure Play group and Grant Lambie, a play space developer, to keep our evolution organic and allow the community to develop the space as much as possible which means this phase is largely determined by the community surrounding and engaging with the space.","Both children and adults today suffer from a severe lack of play, access to nature, measured risk, and free space both geographically and mentally. Many studies show how a lack of play can cause obesity, depression, and stunted social skills. Playgrounds and parks today only partially fill these needs, as they are often geared only toward gross motor play(swings, slides, or monkey bars), or structured play (baseball, soccer, etc.) These things are not allowing (young) people to fully explore their environment on their own terms, and at their own speed. Our lives are commonly scheduled from dawn until dusk leaving free time to play absent.
 
 What we can do to make LA the best place to play is provide a space and materials where people can actually engage in play that stretches their abilities, gives them exercise, challenges their problem-solving skills, and encourages socialization. One of the best things about adventure play is that it is ever evolving to the needs of the participants, as projects are created and destroyed, as materials come and go within the landscape, and interests and focus change. Our playwork education program will continually support free play and its benefits by outfitting others with the ability to facilitate more free-play events in numerous communities and homes in L.A. County with the goal of improving the quality of life through play for all. 
 
 In addition, our outreach for play will continue to look for places where we can help facilitate and expand play opportunities in LA County. Our philosophy is that play is a human right, a social issue rather than only a parenting one.
 
 Our Adventure Playground will be aimed at providing to our immediate community (A small working class community) as well as outside groups and schools, and as a place to do play-related research with educators and play advocates across the county, state and nation.
 
 In the future, the upcoming Newhall Ranch housing expansion will be creeping up toward our space (off the 126 freeway toward Ventura), allowing a place for new occupants to grow into, as well as our commitment to cultivating the careers of future playworkers, who would be employed at the Adventure Playground to facilitate play and safety. We hope that this combined with our continued outreach will allow for similar spaces to be developed around LA County.","Overall, this project will benefit not only kids and adults but specifically kids on the spectrum, senior citizens, disabled children, and those who have limited to no access to nature and wild outdoor space. 
 
 Phase 1-3: Neighborhood kids and families around the Santa Clarita Valley- Kids and families will benefit from additional space to meet in the community and play freely without restriction. Our goal is to have the playground open and staffed in any instance it would be needed; after school, weekends, and holidays for any kids in the area. It will also create jobs for those hired as playworkers, play educators, and maintenance crews (if needed). This will be in addition to our pop-up events and outreach, which will continue to travel to where play is needed. Our outreach is looking to expand into schools, apartment complexes, nature events, and parks that can accommodate our free pop-up events. 
 
 Phase 2-3: Northern Los Angeles County with the potential of entire county. We hope that in time there will be others from outside our immediate community that will come by to see what adventure play can be and take back ideas to their own neighborhoods. Our hope is that we can be a destination for field trips, school projects, parties, and educators interested in free play concepts. With that, we want to work on chartering buses to bring individuals to us. We also hope to have events that will include curious adults that want to learn things like woodworking or structure building, and give them a space to learn and share skills that can enhance their well-being, as well as an inter-generational opportunity for both young and old.
 
 Phase 2-3: Los Angeles County and beyond. We also hope to contribute to the growing network of Adventure Playgrounds that are currently resurging in the USA, and bring an advocacy for play to a policy level. A place where people can be guaranteed play possibilities in school and neighborhood, and a network of spaces across the country that can consult, experiment, and share experiences with each other.","Our confirmed collaborators are and have been the Pop-up Adventure Play based in the UK, The ArTree, a local community arts center, The City of Santa Clarita, A Little Patch of Earth Preschool, CalArts Alumni Santa Clarita Chapter, Appliances Unlimited, Newhall Paint, and the Arbor Day Festival. We also have confirmed collaborators from other adventure playgrounds in America and Europe including Rusty Keeler from the Anarchy Zone in Ithaca, NY, Jill Wood, Director of Adventure Playground at The Parish School in Houston, TX, Andy Hinchcliffe from Wyke Community and Childrens Centre in Bradford, United Kingdom and Grant Lambie, founder of Free Play based in London. 
 
 Future possible collaborators include Santa Clarita Valley International (K-12 tuition-free public charter school), Val Verde YAL program, Parks and Recreation, Local Fire Fighters, Boy and Girl Scout troupes, Home school groups, PTAs, CalArts, CalArts Community Arts Partnership, College of the Canyons, Albert Einstein Academy, local K-12 schools, Adult Education Programs, Other Community arts programs, Holistic Mom’s Chapters, Arbor Day Nature Explore Program, Community Gardens of Santa Clarita, The Alliance for Childhood, and IPA International Play Association",1,
4102189,SeePolitical - Making Ballot Propositions Easy to Understand,SeePolitical explains the confusing language for each ballot proposition in less than two minutes with our engaging and unbiased videos.,Connect,2015177,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050connect/projects/SeePolitical.html,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,"SeePolitical.com is an interactive website, widget and mobile app providing objective, easily understood information about ballot propositions for all Angelenos. Trying to understand the complex language found on most ballots is frustrating and often results in uninformed voters approving unintended consequences. In the case for our region, most voters are not even participating. The June 2014 primary turned out an alarmingly record-low number of voters in Los Angeles County. 
 
 SeePolitical breaks the mold by offering unbiased entertaining educational content that informs and empowers voters in English and in Spanish.","SeePolitical is nonprofit organization offering an unprecedented service: Concise, unbiased, entertaining information on ballot measures, which we all crave. 
 
 Los Angeles is the perfect place for SeePolitical to start educating voters. Voters in this city are confronted multiple times a year with major public policy issues with huge social implications and billions of dollars at stake. SeePolitical’s initial goal is to educate and inform Angelenos about the implications of each statewide ballot measure. 
 
 After a successful trial in Los Angeles, SeePolitical will begin to cover ballot props in other cities and states. SeePolitical has the potential to be the go-to source for voter education and will quickly surpass outdated text heavy formats currently used to inform the public.
 
 We have already built an incredible team in Los Angeles and tested the concept, now it’s time to execute:
 1) SeePolitical and the League of Women Voters have teamed up to conduct expert policy research & analysis for each ballot proposition, ensuring a fair and balanced explanation for both the Yes and No side.
 2) Our Emmy-award winning studio, Imaginary Forces, located in LA translates this research into informative, engaging videos explaining each ballot prop less than 2 minutes.
 3) SeePolitical’s videos will be distributed to partner organizations and media outlets across LA County for mass distribution. 
 4) Voters can watch our videos on the web or from any mobile device, and save their voting preferences on SeePolitical’s mobile app which they can use as their personal cheat sheet on Election Day!
 5) SeePolitical will have unprecedented real-time polling data and insights to localized and aggregate voter behavior and trends.
 
 SeePolitical’s characters clarify what a YES vote entails and what a NO vote entails for each proposition during a 60-90 second animated, audio cartoon clip. Each viewer can save his/her choice by clicking on the YES, NO, or MAYBE button at the bottom of the screen. The viewer then has the option to print or save their selections for easy reference that will be emailed and/or texted to them when it is time to vote.","SeePolitical will literally connect LA residents to the issues we are expected to vote on. SeePolitical strives to increase understanding of major public policy issues by reaching target demographics in their environments with engaging, interactive and entertaining content.
 
 Our nonprofit organization has developed a novel method to address a major social problem in our city - voter confusion and voter apathy - which are inherently linked. After proving our concept this year in Los Angeles, SeePolitical will provide a platform for all Angelenos to discuss and organize around political issues.
 
 SeePolitical can provide an innovative approach to explaining ballot measures that surpasses the status quo in impact and cost. 
 
 SeePolitical’s integrity is established with completely unbiased and objective explanations. We utilize the Attorney General and Secretary of State’s public voter guide as our primary source of analysis. The popularity of SeePolitical will lie in our ability to convey this information to Angelenos through dynamic animation. The success of SeePolitical lies in our ability to engage potential voters in their online environments, provide cutting edge easy to use tools for understanding and make them care enough to share. The outcome will be a well-informed voting public in this city with a clear understanding of each proposition we encounter in the voting booth. SeePolitical’s bottom line is to increase overall voter turnout at each election and connect Angelenos to some of the most important issues we face as a city and region. 
 
 SeePolitical will engage users in their social environments through custom built social media and mobile applications giving them the ability to interact with each other and share. For instance, your friend in Silver Lake took a SeePolitical poll on Facebook and another one in Boyle Heights shared their thoughts and video via our iPhone application. Our mobile rich media widgets will inform target audiences by offering value added content on partner websites. 
 
 Long term plans include building a walled garden social network for voters in our city to align and organize around issues dear to them, archiving ballot measures and voter behaviors, becoming a valuable source of educational information for students involved with the formulation of public policy and expanding the scope to a national scale.","SeePolitical will truly benefit everyone in LA. Residents who feel it is their civic duty to vote but don’t want to spend too much time learning about propositions will be able to enjoy SeePolitical’s entertaining and informative content. New U.S. citizens who don’t read English well enough to truly understand the legal jargon on each ballot will have an opportunity to watch and listen to SeePolitical’s explanations in their native tongue. The seasoned voter will also enjoy a new and refreshing take on explaining policy issues, in addition to access to links to outside content that can offer more in-depth explanations. Teachers in our classrooms will finally have a tool to help their students learn about the complex issues that their parents are voting on as well as the very process that they too will be expected to participate in as adult citizens. When it comes down to it, everyone in our great city will benefit from SeePolitical’s content and voter tool.
 
 The organization was started with a goal and a dream four years ago. To date, we have created an ecosystem of partnerships, distribution channels and affiliations to political organizations that led to our beta launch in Summer and Fall 2012 elections. Since 2012 we have secured major partnerships with LA’s own Emmy Award winning animation studio, Imaginary Forces, and the USC's Unruh Institute of Politics (their students assist in our policy analysis research) as well as the Otis College of Art and Design near LAX. 
 
 We intend to impact as much of the population as possible in future elections, but do have some specific segments we are focusing on, such as: African American, Latino and Asian populations; young voters; low-income voters; immigrants; and as part of our dedication to education a subcategory would be students not old enough to vote. 
 
 There are persistent gaps in voter turnout by income and educational attainment. Percentage of eligible youth vote turnout (18-29 years old) is also at a historic low lending to a “political lag” by which the public policies adopted don’t reflect the needs of the citizenry, because most aren’t participating. 
 
 SeePolitical will offer teachers in the classroom a free and easy to use tool to teach their students about the major public policy issues of the day, as well as issues from the past. We can offer a unique and entertaining format to get kids in LAUSD and surrounding school districts interested and involved in the democratic process.","Confirmed Partners include: 
 California League of Women Voters – “The League” has been the gold standard in voter education for nearly 100 years. The League has officially partnered with SeePolitical this year in our policy research and distribution of our video content. 
 
 Imaginary Forces – Our Emmy award winning animation studio located in West LA creates and develops video content for SeePolitical. Since 1996, Imaginary Forces has told many stories, pushed many boundaries and entertained audiences through their work. 
 
 USC's Unruh Institute of Politics - is dedicated to bridging the academic study of politics with practical experience. This includes an internship program with SeePolitical that started January 2014 where students learn about California’s direct democracy system and participate in research and analysis of current and future ballot propositions. 
 
 Otis College of Art and Design - Established in 1918, Otis College of Art and Design is L.A.’s first independent professional school of art. In coordination with the college’s liberal arts and digital media departments, the college is offering a multi-disciplinary SeePolitical work-study course for their seniors.
 
 Guru Media Solutions – Guru is a full service agency empowering movements through compelling digital campaigns and brand experiences. Guru is a nimble, creative, independent minded digital marketing agency serving purpose-driven campaigns, organizations, and brands. 
 
 The California Channel – The California Channel a.k.a. California’s C-SPAN station has agreed to air SeePolitical’s informative ballot prop videos prior to the November election. 
 
 SeePolitical is in serious partnership discussions with: Univision (distribution and Spanish voice overs), 89.3 FM KPCC (distribution), YouTube (distribution), FWD.us (distribution and engagement), and Yelp.com (distribute our videos to over 1.4 million of their Los Angeles County subscribers).
 
 Each day our list of partners and collaborators grow because people understand the need for our service and want to encourage voter participation in LA. 
 
 In order for our partnerships to succeed, SeePolitical must: 1) Deliver high quality videos that engage our audience 2) Provide strictly unbiased interpretations for each ballot proposition 3) Continue to nurture our existing relationships and develop relationships beyond our initial scope by directly engaging each organization’s membership and/or audience.",

Our children of today will be our leaders of tomorrow in 2050. We need future leaders that can see beyond our differences, and who are able to unite their communities by building common ground. To that end, Shane’s Inspiration will unite approximately 1000 children with disabilities with 2,000 typically developing children for a day of play on an inclusive playground over a series of 40 field trips. These children will have an opportunity to dissolve their misconceptions, find their similarities, and discover respect, friendship and understanding. This experiential play opportunity will be combined with pre and post educational presentations that explore the barriers that divide us based on common misconceptions. The uniting principals learned through this process can then be applied across race, ability and cultural divides. This aspect of the initiative will run concurrent with the school year, September through June.
 
 Building Common Ground®: The community events will be held on the last Saturday of the month and will alternate locations throughout Los Angeles. Each event will be held at a Shane’s Inspiration inclusive playground location. These events will draw individuals, families, and children of all abilities and will feature “play artisans” that will create interactive play presentations that promote play in unique and inspiring ways. Each event will have a theme and feature the diverse ways in which Angelenos play such as Art, Magic, Sports, Music, etc. One month, renowned wheelchair artist, Tommy Hollenstein will teach the art of painting with wheels. Community members will bring their bicycles, scooters, roller blades or wheelchairs and discover play through art. Water sports for people of all abilities can be featured at Lake Balboa, next to our inclusive playground. Professional, Olympic and Paralympic athletes will present their triumphant stories and engage community members in their sport of choice. 
 
 The initiative will culminate in Griffith Park at the Shane’s Inspiration flagship playground in conjunction with a Nickelodeon Worldwide Day of Play! This event will feature performances of prominent play artisans, a resource fair of organizations that promote play in L.A., and a Walk n’ Roll 5K event that will secure the funding to support the initiative’s on-going success.","""By playing with my buddy, I learned that I can open myself up to other people who may be different than I am...that I should try harder to get to know people because we are all people and we should give each other a chance."" Jenny, age 13, Education Program Participant
 
 The Together We Play L.A.! initiative will dissolve the barriers that divide us by bringing individuals and communities together through play. Shane's Inspiration has been dedicated to making L.A. the best place to play since 1998 through the creation of the first fully inclusive playground in Griffith Park, to the opening of our 37th Los Angeles playground in Sun Valley. This initiative would build on our prior success in this area in the following ways: 
 
 *Developing 5 new community driven conceptual designs for 5 future inclusive playgrounds and parks. 
 
 *Including access to play for ALL! 
 
 *Bringing 3000 children of all abilities together through play and education to replace damaging misconceptions about one another with friendship and understanding. 
 
 * Showcasing interactive and innovative ways in which communities can come together through play. 
 
 * Promoting park usage through community based play programs that broaden our perspective of one another.
 
 We are only as resilient as we are united. Los Angeles prides itself on our diversity. However, it is often that diversity that keeps us apart. Play is the great equalizer, connecting people through common ground and creating opportunities to discover our similarities, instead of our differences. We bully, fight, and divide because we are afraid, because we feel we are distinctly different. By discovering our commonalities, we are able to weave a more inclusive fabric across our great city. Evan Beachy, former teacher at New Roads Elementary says, ""Working with Shane's Inspiration was just that; an inspirational experience for myself and my students. To see their attitudes change from fear, to understanding, to compassion, to friendship was truly something special."" 
 
 By 2050, we will be facing many challenges that will only be surmountable through a strongly united community. The seeds for that unity will be planted in part through the Together We Play L.A.! initiative that will redefine the way we play together, redefine our perspectives about one another and strengthen our ties that bind. Together we can face the challenges that await us. Together we can build a resilient tomorrow. One play connection at a time.","The Together We Play L.A.! initiative will directly impact 3,000 children, approximately 1,000 of these children will have some form of disability. Most of the children we reach are between the ages of 1 and 13 and come from a variety of socio-economic circumstances. Within our school-based programs, over 80% of the schools we serve are classified as Title I, which is an indicator of poverty among the student population. Each student that participates in the school program will take home a family guide on inclusion, providing the potential to reach an additional 5,000+ family members. This guide will be printed in English and Spanish. 
 
 We estimate an additional 2,500 individuals will be directly impacted by the community based monthly programming. We will utilize our base of 37 inclusive playgrounds throughout the city of Los Angeles in some of the most under served and at risk communities, promoting play and recreational usage at local parks. The goal is to inform the communities that these parks, inclusive playgrounds and programs are available to the families to help promote and engage on-going community usage beyond the one year goal. 
 
 We will also utilize print, radio, television, and social media avenues to promote this initiative, raising a broader understanding of the importance of dissolving the barriers that divide us and the opportunities to connect. 
 
 On a broader impact scale, Los Angeles is currently a shining example for other communities of how to create play environments that unite the whole of the community. Shane's Inspiration and the City of Los Angeles Recreation and Parks Department travel nationally and internationally to promote the replication of these playgrounds and programs to a global audience. The 37 playgrounds developed in Los Angeles have sparked a world wide movement in inclusive play, generating Shane's Inspiration projects in 15 states, as well as in Mexico, Ecuador, Israel and four in conjunction with the 2010 and 2014 Winter Olympics in Canada and Russia. As members of the Clinton Global Initiative, Shane's Inspiration is participating in conversations with the Rockefeller Resilient Cities initiative regarding the importance of inclusive play environments as they pertain to city resiliency. The Together We Play L.A.! initiative will provide another important opportunity for Los Angeles to lead the way in play - today - tomorrow - into 2050 and beyond!","Shane's Inspiration owes the success of our programs in great part to the collaborative partners that we have been fortunate enough to have had through the years. Shane's Inspiration has always approached partnership with a win/win strategy which has yielded strong, loyal and long lasting relationships. We will work collaboratively with many partners on this initiative but will rely heavily on two key partnerships, one of which is the City of Los Angeles Recreation and Parks Department. From the first project which opened in 2000, to the 30th and beyond, this partnership is at the foundation of the organization's success. This department will work very closely with Shane's Inspiration to support the success of our goals as all 50 events will take place at parks throughout the City of Los Angeles. The parks are managed and maintained by City staff so the contribution of this department will be substantial. 
 
 The other key to success of this project will be our partnership with schools. We have over 150 Los Angeles schools from which to draw from for the school aspect of the initiative. The programs we will offer to the schools will be free of charge and have been proven to be of substantial educational value to the students. We have been partnering with local schools for over 10 years and currently have a waiting list of schools who would like to participate in our programming opportunities. 
 
 Outreach and Community Event partners of Shane's Inspiration programs include the Exceptional Children's Foundation; Regional Centers; Disney; Wells Fargo Capital Finance; Seesaw Studios; Kiwanis; Newman Grace Inc. 
 
 Promoting this initiative will be key and our partners at Newman Grace Publishing will be featuring each step of this initiative in the Inspiring Play Magazine - www.inspiringplay.com. They will also use Google Ad Words to get the word out. 
 
 The three factors that are critical to the success of our proposed collaboration are: 
 
 Advanced planning with key partners; 
 Consistent and clear communication between all project partners;
 Delivering on proposed goals and commitments. 
 
 We have a track record of success in these areas with our partners which provides a strong foundation for the roll out and successful implementation of this initiative. As with any new initiative, we anticipate hurdles as we navigate somewhat unfamiliar territory. Our confidence lies in the strength of our partnership history in overcoming obstacles.",1,
4102195,LA Riverworks: A Vision to Engage LA Communities in River Revitalization,LA Riverworks wants to engage local residents to help existing neighborhoods thrive alongside a revitalized LA River.,Connect,2015186,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050connect/projects/LosAngelesRiverworks.html,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"A new project to revitalize the LA River promises to deliver 18,000 jobs, billions in private development, and tremendous environmental benefits. But a fundamental question remains: who will access these benefits?
 
 Today, diverse and dynamic neighborhoods line the LA River’s banks. But with this investment, outside interest is intensifying. Rising rent costs and real estate speculation threaten to displace low-income families in the area. SEACA and Public Counsel want to make LA the best place to connect by engaging local community members to join together in crafting and advocating for policies that will allow them to remain in their neighborhoods and benefit from the job and recreational opportunities a revitalized LA River will bring.","Too often, community voices are left out of major decisions affecting the build out of our neighborhoods. Unless local residents are actively engaged and equipped with the tools to shape investments and large scale development projects, any resulting benefits and opportunities will not automatically reach current low-income residents. 
 
 SEACA and Public Counsel are proposing to engage residents, city officials, and other stakeholders in LA River communities to ensure that the return on our investment is shared by the low-income residents and families that called this area home long before it caught the eye of politicians and real estate developers. Through community engagement, legal research, and advocacy, we aim to maximize the positive impacts of a revitalized River, such as local job opportunities and expanded park space. And we aim to minimize negative impacts like the involuntary displacement of local residents and community-serving small businesses. Specifically, our project will achieve the following:
 
 1. Conduct a community assessment. 
 
 SEACA and Public Counsel will analyze data and speak with local community members, community-based organizations, and economic development experts/researchers to gain a deeper understanding of River-adjacent communities—including mapping community assets and assessing the risk of gentrification and displacement.
 
 2. Launch a community-informed policy and organizing strategy.
 
 We will use information gleaned from the community assessment to develop policy and organizing strategies that address LA River-area residents’ needs and priorities. In collaboration with stakeholder groups, we will educate and mobilize residents at workshops on the River investment and its impacts on the community. Then, in partnership with residents and other stakeholders, we will identify and develop legal and policy tools to help ensure the River build out benefits ALL Angelenos, including local communities. We will then work with city officials to include these policies in River investment plans.
 
 3. Monitor development to ensure community-developed policies are implemented. 
 
 Many residents are not aware of the magnitude of the potential investment, nor the potential opportunity the River brings if the investment is shaped with local communities in mind. As LA River development begins, we will monitor activities and share information with residents to help develop tools for meaningfully shaping River community benefits.","In 2050, a revitalized LA River will serve as a main artery through the city, connecting many diverse and dynamic neighborhoods across the region. A greener and cleaner LA River will also strengthen a collective connection to our environment, providing all Angelenos with access to a precious source of recreation. To achieve this vision, jobs will be created and River-adjacent communities will see new investment. Our project is focused on helping existing residents connect with this process so they too can access the health and economic opportunities that the River promises.
 
 By engaging low-income residents, families, and entrepreneurs in existing River-adjacent communities to voice their concerns and advocate for policies that support local needs as well as regional goals, SEACA and Public Counsel will ensure that the communities that are connected to the River today can remain connected and thrive alongside a revitalized River 2050. Specifically, our project will help make LA the best place to connect today by:
 
 ● Engaging a broad range of stakeholders such as local residents, youth, seniors, and small business owners in multiple languages around the LA River plan;
 
 ● Connecting local government policies to the needs and priorities of River-adjacent communities;
 
 ● Linking local residents and other stakeholders to the political process;
 
 ● Connecting with a network of economic development experts to evaluate and cultivate strategies to address the needs of local neighborhoods;
 
 ● Leveraging the River restoration and related developments to expand access to opportunity for local residents and other stakeholders;
 
 ● Promoting the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by decreasing the median travel time to work through local employment opportunities and increasing the amount of affordable housing in this transit-rich area; and
 
 ● Addressing concerns about gentrification and displacement of residents and small businesses.
 
 A barricaded concrete River bisecting underserved neighborhoods has been an unfortunate image of disconnect and spatial inequity in the geography of our city. With this unprecedented investment, all that can change. But connection is key. Connecting local residents to opportunities starts with a connection to each other and the process.","Our project will benefit a diverse group of youth, families, seniors, small businesses, and other stakeholders who live, work, and play in the neighborhoods along the LA River. Many of these individuals are from predominantly Asian and Latino communities like Chinatown and Lincoln Heights, where low-income and working class families—the vast majority of whom speak a language other than English at home—work and shop at local small businesses; and Elysian Valley and Cypress Park, where long-time residents have cultivated a strong neighborhood identity with thriving commercial and creative spaces. These are neighborhoods that have made much from little; historically disinvested or underserved communities that have persevered while investment and opportunities repeatedly went elsewhere. 
 
 More than 11% of adults in the investment area are unemployed, compared to 8% countywide. Wage theft and overcrowding are common. In many LA River neighborhoods, incomes are much lower than the county average and poverty rates are much higher. And despite the proximity, physical access to the LA River or other recreational opportunities is limited. These are communities that have already waited too long for the opportunities and benefits that a revitalized and healthier River infrastructure can provide. Our project will help residents in these communities connect with the process, and in doing so, connect with the opportunities. 
 
 For small businesses and entrepreneurs, a revitalized LA River carries the potential of reinvigorating the area with new customers and business opportunities; people coming to spend a day at the River will need places to shop, eat, and rent recreation equipment. Large-scale infrastructure construction projects will require smaller contractors and suppliers. SEACA and Public Counsel will work with existing businesses and entrepreneurs in the area to ensure that they are able to continue operating in and benefit from the revitalized space.
 
 More broadly, the LA River revitalization plan will benefit all Angelenos by providing them with a place to explore the outdoors, get active, and play. By working to maintain the area’s diversity, we will ensure that people from all over Los Angeles feel welcome to enjoy the area and its offerings.","SEACA and Public Counsel have agreed to collaborate on this project and have worked together to connect and mobilize diverse communities and create a more sustainable LA for the last five years. Through our partnership, communities have been able to come together to identify solutions to key needs such as jobs and affordable housing. SEACA trains hundreds of youth to become leaders in their communities in order to educate and mobilize seniors, working adults, and youth in five different languages. SEACA’s members include individuals residing in several River-adjacent neighborhoods. Public Counsel provides the land use knowledge to turn community priorities and goals into policy proposals that can be eventually adopted into law.
 
 In 2013, SEACA and Public Counsel successfully worked together to engage residents and develop a groundbreaking new land use plan for the Cornfields Arroyo area north of downtown Los Angeles. The campaign empowered and educated youth leaders to advocate for more affordable housing, environmental justice, and good jobs. As a result of our joint efforts in mobilizing the community and providing policy and legal support, the plan is expected to be an effective tool for producing affordable housing in the area and for preventing displacement of existing residents. The LA Times called the plan “A Model for LA Planning,” and it garnered the support of environmentalists, for-profit developers, labor unions, affordable housing advocates, transportation experts, AND the local community. 
 
 In addition, Public Counsel regularly partners with legal and policy experts like the Community Benefits Law Center and we expect to engage these partners as our platform is developed. 
 
 The three factors that are critical to our success will be our ability to:
 
 1. Actively engage local residents around complex policy issues; 
 
 2. Build a diverse coalition that brings together residents, local businesses, community organizations, and other stakeholders; and
 
 3. Identify and implement the appropriate legal and policy tools to ensure that River revitalization efforts are responsive and accountable to existing residents’ needs.",

 6. Create and execute a plan for implementation of the program in more areas of California, and then nationally and internationally. (by spcaLA and Salesian Boys & Girls Club)","Is the best place to play a place that fosters violence and cruelty, or one wherein compassion and empathy are commonplace? 
 
 For years, both spcaLA and Salesian Boys & Girls Club have been empowering youth in at-risk communities to be compassionate leaders. Now, two of Los Angeles’ finest nonprofit organizations have joined together to offer programming aimed at prevention and early intervention – of violence. 
 
 Our two groups recently collaborated to offer spcaLA’s award-winning violence-prevention program, “Teaching Love & Compassion” (TLC) ™ at the Salesian Boys & Girls Club. Kids in spcaLA TLC programs work to gain empathy, coping skills, and self-esteem through a pro-hero, anti-bullying curriculum involving work with shelter dogs. Students take pre and post surveys to measure empathy, and invariably, empathy increases. In fact, TLC has been so successful spcaLA worked with the Juvenile Division of the Los Angeles Superior Court and the Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office to offer a similar program as part of probation for some juvenile offenders (often convicted of bullying, assault, and animal cruelty offenses). 
 
 But, despite the success of TLC at Salesian Boys & Girls Club, we want more. 
 
 spcaLA and Salesian Boys & Girls Club want to rekindle empathy and break the cycle of violence on a larger scale. We envision a program that would take the successes of spcaLA’s violence-prevention programs to a wider audience – giving educators the tools to teach a humane education and violence prevention course, without the involvement of an animal shelter, its staff or animals. 
 
 With your help, we will work to break the cycle of violence, and empower a generation of kids to be thought leaders in their communities. We will help them to rekindle their empathy and speak up for those who have no voice. We will prevent crime through compassion, and intervene before youthful transgressions become adult patterns of criminal behavior.
 
 If we increase the level of empathy in a generation of children, they will be less likely to perpetrate or be convicted of violent crimes as juveniles and adults, making their communities safe places to play. They will stand up for the weak and victimized - reporting crime. Further, through a childhood of involvement in community groups, like the Salesian Boys & Girls Club, Generation Empathy® kids will be civic leaders, committed to the improvement and revitalization of their neighborhoods.","Partner organizations primarily serve the Boyle Heights community of Los Angeles. Demographically, Boyle Heights is a primarily Latino (approximately 94%), young (median age 30 years) neighborhood. Residents have an increased likelihood not to have completed high school, and more of the community lives below the poverty level, as compared to rest of Los Angeles. Further, the area reports a higher-than-average rate of violent crime. The initial target population for Generation Empathy® will be a few groups of students at Salesian Boys & Girls Club. Then, after pilot testing, the target population will potentially grow to the 1,350 students in Volunteers of America Head Start programs (ages 3-5), 200 students in St. Mary’s and Resurrection schools (K-8), and 3,000 students in “After the Bell” at Roosevelt High School. Generation Empathy® can be further offered to school districts, early education centers, clubs and other institutions locally and nationally.","Partner:
 Salesian Boys & Girls Club of Los Angeles has been inspiring and enabling the young people of East Los Angeles and the surrounding communities to realize their full potential as productive, responsible and caring citizens, and supporting their families in this effort since 1966 (Tax ID 95-2430743). spcaLA has been working with Salesian Boys & Girls Club for some time, to weave violence-prevention lessons into ongoing programs.
 
 Three factors critical to the success of our proposed collaboration.
 1. Common goals - to help rekindle empathy in a generation of youth.
 2. Proven track record - spcaLA and Salesian Boys & Girls Club work well together to offer violence-prevention programs.
 3. Community involvement - the partnership and potential program is supported by the Boyle Heights Neighborhood Coalition, affording Generation Empathy® the support of the Boyle Heights community at large.
 
 Collaborators - Salesian Boys & Girls Club has ongoing relationship with collaborator organizations, who serve the greater Boyle Heights area.

4102206,The Alternative Travel Project - Go car FREE for just ONE day!,"The ATP project will guide Angelenos toward making car-free travel choices through surveys, analyses, education and inspiration.",Connect,2015196,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050connect/projects/ALTravelProject.html,,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,"The Alternative Travel Project encourages people to volunteer days outside the bubble of their cars & find new ways to travel. 
 We believe that the steps an individual takes toward alternative travel, even for a single day, can have local, regional & global impact. While cars are often a necessary part of our modern existence, they don't have to be a part of our every day.
 Our project involves an awareness campaign & surveys of the attitudes and users of ‘alternative’ methods of travel in LA. We will collaborate with CicLAvia during 3 events, and feedback our results through videos and an app developed to track ATPers activity. 
 The future we envision for 2050 is for LA to be a city where car-free travel is the norm, not the exception.","During 3 CicLAvia events we will share information on the Alternative Travel options that are available across Los Angeles. We will survey participants on their awareness of car-free travel to gauge the level of consciousness amongst the city’s residents. 
 
 By taking a baseline survey at the December 2014 CicLAvia event, and repeating the process at the March & May 2015 events, we can measure the impact of our efforts with a group of Angelenos who are likely to have a fairly high perception & positive view towards Alternative Travel. 
 
 We will also undertake two surveys within the Arts District, as part of a neighborhood pilot where transit connections are being improved, and redevelopment in housing and business is growing. This area is a great example of a neighborhood where the walkability is high, access to transit is good and there are plans to improve it even further. 
 
 We will speak with residents and local businesses twice during the course of the year; using results from these surveys as a comparison to the information collected during CicLAvia – where the majority of individuals already somewhat embrace ATP. 
 
 In response to our awareness campaign, we hope to gather stories highlighting the positive impact of an ATP lifestyle, and find out if, over the course of the year, more participants choose to take the Open Streets model into their everyday lives. 
 
 Can we encourage the ‘CicLAvia only’ cyclist/walker/metro user to replicate a multi-modal lifestyle for some everyday journeys? 
 
 Alongside data collection, we will expand the information provided on our website, & produce two new videos to encourage and inspire ATP action within Los Angeles, & around the world. We will also develop a smartphone app for participants to track their ATP mileage – allowing us to build a regional & global view of our impact in terms of CO2 saved, miles traveled and calories burned. This information will feed into a page on our website to be shared worldwide.","Traveling car-free for just ONE day, will bring people into closer contact with all that the city has to offer. It will increase foot and bike traffic to the local community and create an opportunity to discover new people and places. By bringing people face to face with their neighbors and local businesses, they are more likely to frequent the walkable area surrounding their homes and choose to invest more in their own community. Alternative Travel also brings a sense of togetherness and connection with fellow passengers. Where drivers only see those around them as traffic and a source of stress, travel by public transit, walking & cycling humanizes the journey and our fellow citizens. 
 
 Los Angeles is filled with distinctive challenges when it comes to travel, and is known as ‘car-centric’ and for its ‘horrific traffic.’ 
 ATP plans a different future perception of the city. By encouraging a culture shift in how we travel in LA and working with mainstream media and the raconteurs of our city to export this lifestyle, we can create a new, more positive LA story. 
 
 Today’s reality is that huge improvements in infrastructure have been made in recent years, but despite this vast change in the availability of public transportation, so many residents are still unaware of the possibilities on their own doorstep. ATP will make car-free travel in LA ‘hip’, it will help to break down the stigma attached to taking the bus and highlight the benefits of leaving the car at home. 
 
 By shifting people’s attitude to car-free travel, demand will naturally rise, and in turn this will lead to higher frequency services, a safer system, and quicker journeys
 
 Through our website, videos and social media, we will provide information on the news and services of agencies and non-profits working to improve travel infrastructure. ATP will be a one-stop-shop for information on all car-free travel in Los Angeles and inspire our community to get involved in shaping the future of the city and how we move.
 
 Let’s experiment by going car-free for just one day in 2014; let’s empower the citizens of Los Angeles in 2050 to embrace car-free living as a rule, rather than an exception.","Our project will benefit Angelenos who are unaware or nervous about the opportunities for walking, cycling or taking transit in their city. It will also benefit the County of Los Angeles in attracting new talent amongst the millennial generation who place a high value on transit availability.
 
 According to a Transport for America study: 54% of millennials surveyed say they would consider moving to another city if it had more and better options for getting around, and 66% say that access to high quality transportation is one of the top three criteria in considering deciding where to live next. ""This survey reinforces that cities that don't invest in effective transportation options stand to lose out in the long-run,"" says Michael Myers, a managing director at The Rockefeller Foundation. 
 
 We don’t want LA to lose out by 2050!
 
 Our project will also benefit LADOT, Metro and their current users, by providing a positive, vibrant and exciting perspective on commuting by transit. We will work with the agencies to break down the stigma associated with transit in LA & empower their customers to appreciate their contribution to improving air quality, road traffic, social cohesion, and their own health.
 
 By providing a fun, fresh and engaging view of LA’s ATP options, we aim to create new customers for transit, walking and cycling, and a platform to receive feedback on how the service works for those leaving their cars at home for the first time. 
 
 Despite its reputation as a car-centric city, 80% of LA County residents live within walking/biking distance (3 miles) of the frequent transit system, and the LA County MTA carries over 1.46 million passengers per day – the second highest in the country after New York City! This fact is a huge surprise to most locals and we want to help to change that by bringing more people to public transit options.
 
 As we learn more about the motivations to embrace or avoid alternative travel across Los Angeles, we can begin to further understand how the infrastructure can better service its customers and increase its value to the population of LA.","Collaboration with like-minded organizations is integral to ATP. Much of the information we share with our supporters includes best practice examples, opportunities for involvement in community campaigns, and notice of events being held by other organizations. 
 
 In addition, we have been able to meet and share ideas with a variety of partners; including CicLAvia, LA County Bicycle Coalition, the Mayor’s Office, Metro, LADOT, Safe Routes to School & LA Walks. 
 Collaboration with CicLAvia will include a physical presence at their events. CicLAvia will provide tent space at one of the hubs along their route, as well as promotion of our project. During these events we will invite Metro & LA DOT to share information on local transit options. 
 
 We will invite participants to join our community by volunteering car-free days between CicLAvia events & encourage supporters to share their stories, tips & triumphs with us via social media. 
 Collaboration with CicLAvia is confirmed, and we have worked with them at two previous events. CicLAvia benefits our project by bringing a huge audience, already familiar with Alternative Travel. Factors critical to the success of this collaboration are that we ensure enough volunteers to undertake the survey aspect, provide a welcoming booth to encourage people to visit us, and have a robust survey in place. We will ask participants to sign up to a mailing list so that we are able to follow up at a later date with the same group.
 Within our ‘ATP lifestyle’ neighborhood pilot area in the Arts District, we hope to work with local retailers, theHUB community of impact professionals, LA Clean Tech Incubator, GenesisLA & the Little Tokyo Services Center as well as the property developers creating new living spaces in the area. These collaborations are not confirmed, but we are in the process of introducing our project to these organizations. Success in the Arts District relies upon listening to what is important to the local people and understanding how ATP can benefit their neighborhood.
 To carry out these surveys we would like to collaborate with the Luskin School of Public Affairs at UCLA – their Institute for Transportation Studies would be a huge asset in assisting us with survey work & data analysis. This collaboration is not yet confirmed, though our collaborator CicLAvia is already working with the Luskin School & other UCLA researchers on several related projects, making this a natural partnership with the school.",
4102208,Market Match Program : Making Healthy Food Affordable,The Cyber Insecurity Initiative will evaluate risks and recommend solutions to a healthcare system dependent on electronic health records.,Live,2015197,2014,,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,"The Cyber Insecurity Initiative has four main phases: planning, assessment, analysis, and recommendations. The planning phase will consist of securing appropriate permissions from LA County’s 122 licensed hospitals for participation, designing questionnaires and interview guides to conduct the vulnerability assessments, and coordinating the logistics to carry out the plan. There may be reluctance to have participants do an Internet survey, so we will do both a person-to-person as well as a text survey (using text to database technology we developed). All information will be confidential and not attributed to any one hospital. Only combined data will be shown in any report. The assessment phase involves scheduling and conducting interviews with five groups that have input. Special emphasis will be placed on achieving a balance of each hospital’s EHR buyers, users, emergency managers, administrators, and compliance officers. The questionnaires and interviews will provide the foundation of the vulnerability assessment, complemented by subject matter expert evaluations. The analysis phase requires thorough statistical analysis of all data. One key goal is to compare and evaluate vulnerability perceptions (as documented in the questionnaires and interviews) with actual vulnerabilities (as documented by cybersecurity professionals working with us as well as the literature). The recommendations phase begins with preparing reports and presentation materials, culminating with the presentation of findings with recommendations to improve cybersecurity to the entire hospital community. Specific collaborators for the initiative’s findings and recommendations are the Hospital Association of Southern California, the Hospital Corporation of America (pending), the UCLA Center for Public Health and Disasters, the LA County EMS Agency, Red-E Consulting, and the California Hospital Association.","The residents and visitors of LA County deserve and expect a safe, reliable healthcare system that protects their personal health information and provides unimpeded information to the appropriate provider in a timely manner. We are still at the dawn of a rapidly evolving technological age in healthcare. As our use of healthcare technology and cyberspace expands, so do the cybersecurity threats. The Cyber Insecurity Initiative will proactively address these concerns now, guiding our use of new technology in a safe and responsible manner. By 2050, healthcare will be totally dependent on technology and cyberspace, and the decisions we make now will allow LA to take full advantage of benefits offered by reliable, digitized healthcare while proactively minimizing the risks to the private health information of every individual who uses LA County’s hospitals. 
 
 Furthermore, in a world that is shrinking due to technology, the Cyber Insecurity Initiative will keep Los Angeles at the forefront of healthcare in an increasingly globalized world. LA is a truly global city. As of 2013, there were 3.5 million foreign-born residents in LA County, and there are 135 different languages spoken here. An estimated 1 in 10 residents is undocumented, and we have millions of international visitors every year. LAX is the sixth busiest airport in the world. For the health of our residents and visitors, our economic prosperity requires a world class healthcare system that maximizes the safe and responsible use of EHRs 
 
 Additionally, disasters and public health emergencies (such as biological terrorism and pandemic diseases) must be considered. If used to its potential, our healthcare system can use EHRs to mitigate the effects of a disaster and speed the public health emergency response and recovery. In fact, the effective use of EHRs even has the potential to mitigate a pandemic disease in its tracks. This can only be achieved, however, if the system is safe and secure. 
 
 Finally, the routine and safe use of EHRs will drastically improve the daily lives of all LA County residents and visitors. Healthcare can be provided faster, more effectively, more efficiently, and cheaper thanks to the benefits of digitized healthcare. The Cyber Insecurity Initiative will ensure that we do so in a way that minimizes or negates the potential risks to digitized healthcare as we approach 2050. Residents will feel safer knowing that their medical privacy is secure and the system is working well.","The Los Angeles County healthcare system is an essential public service available to all residents and visitors. Whether or not a specific individual is using that system at any given point in time, everyone in LA can benefit from that public good. While our thoughts go first to the ill or injured who currently require hospital care, everyone in LA knows that the emergency medical services, emergency rooms, and world class healthcare in general are available to them and their families, if needed. Whether directly or indirectly, all of us benefit from our healthcare system. A well functioning healthcare system is essential to a vibrant, resilient community that can continue to thrive. In the new century, a comprehensive, long-term approach to healthcare cybersecurity is essential to the reliability and public trust of the healthcare system.
 
 The cyber security concerns include security breaches, data loss, data for ransom, data corruption Internet breakdown, electrical breakdown, and other hazards that will negatively impact our population’s health in an environment where we are rapidly becoming more and more dependent on digitized healthcare records. Whether caused by a terrorist, a hacker, an accident, or a disaster, the residents and visitors of LA can be assured that their healthcare information is safer thanks to the Cyber Insecurity Initiative. 
 
 The following examples illustrate the extent of modern security breaches. As healthcare becomes increasingly dependent on digital records, the impact of these breaches will rise. According to a report by a cyber security firm called Redspin, there was a 97% increase in health record breaches from 2010-2011. Ponemon found that these breaches cost the hacked organization approximately $240 per record. In 2011, TRICARE lost their EHR back-up tapes, affecting almost 5 million patients. In 2010, the North Bronx Healthcare Network had 1.7 million EHRs stolen by a hacker. In 2009, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Tennessee had a hard drive with over one million EHRs stolen. These are among many examples of the mounting risks associated with the transition to EHRs. The costs associated with EHR security breaches are tremendous, and the potential impact on the public’s faith in healthcare providers is even greater.
 
 Additionally, the methodology we use can be adapted to other infrastructure, such as public health, public safety (police and fire), emergency management, transportation, electrical grid, public works, etc.","Hospital Association of Southern California

We give students the supplies they need to build confidence. We reward students with incentives for perfect attendance, encouraging them to come to school every day. We show kids that college is an achievable dream and give them something to reach for. 
 
 Our programs challenge kids to be at school daily and demonstrate the importance of teamwork. This approach involves building strong school and community partnerships, early outreach to families, educating parents about the importance of regular school attendance and targeting students who are chronically absent.","It’s a fact that students who attend school consistently are more successful in school than students who do not. That may seem obvious, but what’s less obvious are that the consequences of low attendance are serious for all children and their community. Did you know that every year, over 1 million students drop out of high school in the United States alone? That’s one student every 26 seconds, or 7,000 students a day. Students who are frequently absent fall behind in academics and miss important socialization concepts that enhance their ability to understand and follow directions and, ultimately, plan for the future. As students fail to graduate from high school, the number of educated and skilled workers in the job market also decreases, leaving holes in the workforce economy. In addition, state financial support for schools is directly linked to student attendance. When students are absent the school loses money.
 
 Since 2011, TaT's “School is Cool” initiative has supported high-need LAUSD schools to provide positive support and increase the percentage of students attending school in Kindergarten and Grade 9. While we believe that ALL grade levels (K-12) are vital to success, these grade levels have the lowest overall attendance rates in the District. Excessive absence in these critical transition grades has a strong correlation with lower academic achievement and graduation rates. Regular school attendance is an integral part of the learning process and the means to graduation with a good education. Children who develop good attendance habits in the early grades will be more likely to continue them throughout their school career and ultimately into their adult working life.
 Through these programs, students have become more proficient in core subjects, have shown successful transitions into middle and high school, and are more college/career ready. The communities in which we operate have also seen remarkable improvements in areas such as school truancy and high school graduation rates among others. Schools that employ a challenging curriculum and reinforce high expectations for academics, behavior, and social responsibility, are schools that give students motivation to attend. Our initiative provides the students with a sense of empowerment and a feeling of success, not only essential for academic achievement, but imperative for the growth and development of their future. That's why we believe that teaching children to value education is so important!","Currently, students living at or below the poverty line lack access to sufficient school supplies, and budget cuts to our school systems leave schools and teachers unable to provide these at risk children with the necessary items. It's estimated that 16 million kids in the US will return to school this year without the supplies they need. The burden is being placed on both the students and the teachers to fulfill these needs, neither of whom have the resources to fill the gap.
 
 In partnership with LAUSD, Thinking about Tomorrow is directly addressing this crisis facing our community. Our “School is Cool” initiative hopes to encourage all students, grades K-12, to continue attending school consistently and to value the importance of education. Working directly with LAUSD's Title 1 schools with the most number of at-risk students will create an environment were students can focus on learning, teachers can focus on teaching, and families can focus on providing the love and support that each child needs to thrive. Our initiative provides positive support to both students and teachers by providing backpacks fully loaded with required supplies to fostered and sheltered students. By supplying these necessities, we directly influence each student’s ability to fully participate in the learning process and give them the tools they need to succeed. In addition, the backpacks also provide support for the teachers who often carry the burden of providing for their students basic educational needs rather than focusing on providing a rich and nurturing learning environment. It is proven that children without proper school supplies have lower attendance rates and are more likely to perform poorly in school, and eventually drop out.
 
 Having access to the school supplies students need to achieve well in school helps keep kids focused and learning at school. Our project's support brings vital opportunities to high risk fostered and sheltered students, providing a way for continuous education and critically needed educational stability. In doing so, we believe we can effect positive change in their own communities.","Over the years, TaT has established many community partners along the way, but none have been as integral to the success of our ""School is Cool"" initiative as the Los Angeles Dodgers, Keystone Press, Build-a-Bear, Wal-Mart, Kroger, Ralph's and Panera Bread. Together, we have built a solid foundation around shared values focused on improving our communities today, for tomorrow.
 
 Our partnership with the LAUSD and the APSAC (Association of Pupil Services and Attendance Counselors) allows us direct contact with every student in their respective school. This gives us an opportunity to work with every student everyday. It also gives us access to over 400 volunteers willing to do what they can to help students achieve in school.
 
 Our partnership with the LA Dodgers creates a huge opportunity for at-risk students as well as their families. Through our program, students with excellent and perfect attendance throughout the year are invited to Dodger Stadium to enjoy a day at the ballpark. Free tickets for the family, $10 vouchers to be used for (food), hats, pennants and tshirts provide the ultimate experience for our students and their families! This past year, we celebrated attendance with over 20,000 at-risk students in 28 of LAUSD's schools.
 
 Keystone Press is another highly significant partnership that provides TaT with our perfect and excellent attendance certificates given to students for consistent attendance. Keystone also provides the certificates of appreciation and all other promotional materials for TaT, including brochures and one-sheet printouts. In total, we've handed out over 50,000 certificates for attendance!
 
 Through our partnerships with Build-a-Bear, Walmart, Kroger, Ralph's and Panera Bread, our program challenges our students weekly, monthly, and annually by providing constant motivation through various in-kind and monetary donations. These businesses provide a wide variety of incentives and rewards for each eligible student. 
 
 Above all, one of the most critical factors to the success of our organization's message is the ability to reach as many members of our community as possible. It is often difficult to offset the costs of promotional advertising and we are grateful to our sponsors who provide opportunities to help cover the costs of such materials.",1,1,
4102240,Securing a Sustainable and Empowered Los Angeles,"Mapping Los Angeles air pollution sources and levels on a mobile application to enhance community awareness, engagement and reduce exposure.",Live,2015216,2014,,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,"We will use publicly available information available from the US EPA about Toxic Releases and Air Quality that has been made available to the public but is currently in a format relatively difficult to access and digest for most people. For example, the TRI was developed by the EPA as a tool of information disclosure to encourage low releases of air toxics by facilities but this information has not been used much by the population yet because of its complexity. Researchers and students at UCLA have recently launched a website, Cal EcoMaps, to communicate this information to the residents of Los Angeles through an interactive map. Our objective is to build on this platform to provide people with a mobile application that will provide real time information about air quality, allow users to upload their own information and access this information in various locations. 
 
 The main feature of MyAir LA mobile application, will be an interactive map displaying all the facilities in the Los Angeles area with major toxic releases and real-time updates of AQ. Associated health risks in terms of numbers of cancers based on toxic releases and sensitive populations susceptible to air pollution will be identified. The application will encompass sources of air pollution and AQ data with associated health effects and provide corresponding advice to mitigate exposure. Through MyAir LA, residents of Los Angeles will have easy access to this information at their fingertips. Once the mobile application is developed, a campaign will be undertaken to advertise it and reach out to as many people in Los Angeles as possible. Users of MyAir LA will be able to view the AQ and toxic releases in their area based on a zip code or their current location. 
 
 MyAir LA will also contain additional features that will allow for community engagement, besides enhancing community awareness of air pollution. Tips for residents to lessen their negative environmental impact, especially on days with poor AQ will be provided. Alerts will be provided through the application for any spikes in worsening AQ. Users of MyAir LA will be able to upload pictures of AQ in their neighborhood and share it with other users. An important aspect of MyAir LA will be enabling users to contact companies that report to the TRI. By using the power of information disclosure residents of LA can encourage companies to adopt better environmental practices and reduce their toxic releases.","Los Angeles continues to have some of the most polluted air in the nation. We need air to survive each moment of each day and when the very thing we need to live is polluted, the quality of our life is greatly diminished. Providing TRI information and AQ information will both work towards improving the air in Los Angeles in different ways. Reducing the negative effects of air pollution will not only require public policy but will also require individual action.
 
 Our project is geared to make LA the healthiest place to live by empowering people, especially sensitive populations, with knowledge that they can act on to improve the air they breathe. Rates of childhood asthma and allergies are rapidly rising. The rates of heart disease, cerebovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cancer are growing, diseases attributed to air pollution, and the exposed population is getting larger. Many populations like young children, the elderly, pregnant women, asthma patients, patients with allergies and sensitivities are especially vulnerable to air pollution. 
 
 Our project is geared to make LA the healthiest place to live by using the power of awareness to incentivize companies to improve their environmental performance. By generating awareness of air toxics and the facilities that release these toxics, companies will be likely to change their management practices to reduce their environment impact through the influence of information disclosure. Users of the mobile application will be able to take direct action by engaging with companies to encourage them to adopt better environmental practices. They will be able to provide feedback to companies and email them. Users can also take pictures in real-time and upload them onto a common map where other users can view the pictures and know the air quality in a specific location. This level of detail is not possible with AQ updates since monitoring stations in one location cover large areas of the city. Over time, the power of community awareness and engagement would lead to making LA a healthier place.","This project is intended to benefit the common resident of Los Angeles by creating awareness of the air pollution in their neighborhoods and communities through MyAir LA. This is an especially useful tool for populations that are vulnerable to air pollution. This project has implications for the health of minorities and sensitive populations, which are adversely impacted by low air quality. Approximately 40% of California’s residents live in high traffic areas. This number is significantly higher in densely populated areas such as Los Angeles. Populations of non-white residents, minorities and low-income households are higher near major roadways almost everywhere in the nation but this disparity is much higher in the Los Angeles Metropolitan area. People of lower socio-economic status disproportionately incur the negative health effects of air pollution more than other segments of the population. It is also these families that are likely to have least access to this kind of information about air quality and have low awareness of mitigation options. By providing them with health tips to reduce their exposure they can make healthier choices. Parents can be more cognizant of what the best times are to take their children outdoors. Residents can determine what times are best for outdoor exercise. 
 
 By bringing to light data of toxic releases in our communities, facilities will be pushed to adopt more environmentally friendly practices and over time this should result in fewer toxic releases in Los Angeles. With MyAir, toxic releases can be viewed in the vicinity of schools and colleges and it is of prime importance that releases be reduced in these areas where children often spend time outdoors. With MyAir, sensitive populations can make healthier lifestyle choices before traveling or moving homes by being aware of sources of air pollution in those areas.",We don't have any outside collaborators but several researchers at UCLA are part of the MyAir LA team.,0,
4102250,All of Us at UCLA: A Revitalization of Mental Health,A student-led conference that is centered around educating and empowering the Los Angeles community about issues related to mental health.,Learn,2015222,2014,,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,"All of Us campaign includes a core team of student leaders who organize around the collective vision to bring mental health to the forefront in the Los Angeles community. The core team consists of the following components: 
 
 (1) PROGRAMMING Committee organizes events and workshops for the campaign.
 (2) MARKETING/MESSAGING Committee advertises and promotes the campaign and its’ events.
 (3) RESEARCH Committee will conduct studies and analyze data to ensure appropriate programs are being conducted for relevant mental health issues.
 (4) ADVOCACY/POLICY Committee will integrate the needs of various communities, including but not limited to: LGBTQ* community, the Los Angeles Unified School District, the homeless community, etc., in conversations and projects for the campaign.
 (5) COMMUNITY RELATIONS AND OUTREACH Committee serves as the liaison between community-based organizations and community leaders in Los Angeles and the campaign to revitalize Los Angeles’s commitment to mental health.
 (6) CAMPUS OUTREACH Committee coordinates with on-campus groups and organizations to engage the undergraduate student body through advocacy and service.
 
 We plan to prioritize mental health by hosting various workshops and events on our campus to engage the student body and the Los Angeles community. We will establish mental health as a priority on the agenda for the University of California system. We will host a large-scale conference later in the year to facilitate workshops and open caucus spaces for the Los Angeles community to learn about the importance of mental health and to voice their perspectives on relevant issues surrounding the topic of mental health. Curriculum will be developed by addressing the issues in a structured way to encourage a safe space and build discussion. In order to ensure the success and the longevity of this campaign, we have collaborated with various organizations on campus and plan to work with off-campus organizations to build a larger coalition and a stronger support base.This campaign will, furthermore, encompass media campaigns, visible demonstrations, and educational opportunities.","In the present, All of Us seeks to empower UCLA students to challenge and redefine the way we think about health; we should not only prioritize our physical health, but our mental health as well. Its purpose to break down barriers and stigma will, in turn, while foster intellectual and personal growth of our students, despite the stressful nature of college. In addition, the campaign will provide a platform to advocate for a healthy campus where students feel safe to pursue acquiring assistance for all mental health needs. 
 
 The vision of All of Us is to create an impact on the LA community; policies and programs implemented at UCLA would change the culture around mental health in Los Angeles. The perception of seeking assistance for mental health and maintaining it is directly related to the overall success of students in their post-graduate lives. Ultimately, students are the agents of change for the future. By creating leaders who will exercise the value of prioritizing mental health, the LA community benefits.
 
 All of Us seeks to create a healthier Los Angeles community. Today, we hope to solidify a foundation for UCLA students and members of the LA community to think critically about our mental health’s relationship to our overall well-being. For tomorrow, we aspire to catalyze the shift in societal perception to ensure our community’s success.","All of Us, a campaign founded by UCLA undergraduate students, will prioritize mental health in LA county by starting with the 28,000 undergraduate students of UCLA. Mental health is not one-size-fits-all. To benefit the largest group we will tailor workshops, events, and educational literature to specific communities: first year students, international students, student athletes, veterans, students who identify as part of the LGBTQIA community, and students who identify as part of specific cultural communities. But mental health does not stop when a student graduates. Our campaign will provide continuing care resources for postgraduate students as they move beyond the UCLA community. 
 
 Through collaboration with on-campus entities, like the Healthy Campus Initiative, we hope to advocate for the well-being or faculty, administrators, and UCLA employees. 
 
 All of Us realizes that the UCLA community is fluid and intertwined with the greater Los Angeles community. Through our Community Outreach committee we hope to extend the benefits of this campaign throughout the county, particularly to the children of the Los Angeles Unified School District.","Our main partners for this campaign are confirmed and include the USAC Office of the President, the Student Wellness Commission and Active Minds at UCLA. We will also be working closely with UCLA CAPS (Counseling And Psychological Services) to ensure that all of our messaging and programming is accurate and sensitive of the parties we hope to reach with our campaign. Furthermore, CAPS will train all campaign members in topics pertaining to mental health through QPR and Mental Health First Aid training.
 
 
 The USAC Office of the President is responsible for presiding over the Student Body Council and provides services and resources for the UCLA student body through advocacy, education and programming. This year, USAC president Devin Murphy has adopted the platform of mental health revitalization and has begun work on this mission with the creation of the All of Us mental health campaign. The Office of the President has already appointed its own committee, consisting of directors and staff members, solely for the All of Us Campaign and has started work on the campaign materials that will reach not only UCLA students, but also individuals throughout the LA community.
 
 The Student Wellness Commission at UCLA serves to address the needs of student health on campus by creating informational and interactive programs, services, and resources to ensure physical and psychological well-being along with academic success. SWC brings many years of health programming, education, and marketing experience to All of Us.
 
 Active Minds is the student voice for mental health advocacy on college campuses throughout the nation, creating a variety of events, workshops and outreach programs to spread awareness and reduce stigma surrounding mental health.
 
 Three factors critical to the success of collaboration are (1) We can efficiently create a structure to delegate tasks and get work done in the most efficient manner possible with our staff of over 100 people. (2) We have access to mental health professionals as a resource throughout the creation and execution of the campaign. (3) Student Wellness Commission has led a successful campaign, 7000 in Solidarity, to raise awareness of sexual assault on our campus. This experience is vital it programming for All of Us.",1,

The custom RV is to be built with local Frogtown business ‘The Happier Camper.’ Beyond being a fantastic neighborhood business, they are at the bleeding edge of creating the most sustainable recreational vehicles anywhere in the world. Ultralight modern materials, crafted in Los Angeles, mean that there is no need for a large truck to transport the trailer, eliminating huge vehicle and fuel costs. Propane tanks are being replaced by solar powered generators. This allows R5Y7: bici destino to operate completely off the power grid without purchasing - or consuming - environmentally damaging fuels. Lights, sound and computers will all work like any other modern space. The usually heavy tasks of hitching the trailer, installation, maintenance and hauling are light and easy enough for usually timid women to handle confidently. We will not need power, water or sewer hook ups making the cost of getting started and operating significantly lower. Our neighbors have offered to be the go-to restroom for any volunteers/staff. For any parties or larger events, port-a-potties would need to be temporarily installed. 
 
 At closed hours a permanent bike repair stand would remain available to anyone along the bike path, further increasing our ability to help act as a vital resource beyond the limits of open hours. 
 
 Getting the trailer customized to be able to display art, educational materials and bike products will be the longest and most complicated part of becoming fully operational in the community. Alongside the trailer rental bikes are lined up next to the repair stand and storage shed. Attention to design and aesthetics go into everything, including placement of all materials reinforce our idea of the installation as a creative urban retreat. R5Y7: bici destination - for cyclists, artists and LA river lovers. By evoking a retro camping aesthetic the cost of creating a beautiful installation is far less and the sense of relaxation and oasis is enhanced. We take our inspiration from classic American summer camps, with outdoor hanging lights to signify a special event, access to untamed nature as a way to recharge and a judgement free space to learn, create, explore and experiment. 
 As we begin work we can actively survey local residents, businesses and people along the bike path. This will influence our priorities and focus in scheduling workshops and other outreach in the coming year.","Bicycles & Art make life better. R5Y7: bici destino provides the on the ground logistical support to get communities living and moving together, while encouraging individual creativity and ambition. Facilitating a ‘car free’ or ‘car lite’ lifestyle means that individuals have more money and time to develop ideas and relationships.
 
 In using an environmentally advanced mobile trailer customized to inspire fun and imagination, we not only facilitate increasing use of the bike path and surrounding area; but pave the way for other creative endeavors to become possible using the same low-cost/highly creative approach to rapid concept development. We will be the first to use this specific combination of an ultralight mobile structure that is fully solar powered and capable of performing all the rugged tasks of mechanical support while also evoking the playful spirit of a vintage travel trailer.
 
 It is possible that such a project might become so successful, that it moves or expands to other neighborhoods; providing the same active transportation support and creative ‘placemaking’ that is rapidly becoming one of the most effective tools in developing healthy, people-first urban development. Regardless of how the trailer, or the concept of R5Y7: bici destino develops, the positive impact of increasing LA River path usage, active transit, education and recreation will resonate with lasting results.
 
 By providing a strong creative vision that empowers other female entrepreneurs and young people interested in bicycles, art or urban development – we cannot yet imagine the ideas and incomes that naturally happen when other people see what is possible!","Major beneficiary group: Residents and businesses located in ‘Frogtown’ neighborhood of central/east LA along the LA River.

 The core of the project will focus on increasing civic engagement among the County’s most disenfranchised, disadvantaged, & discriminated communities to empower them to interact with, and change their civic, business, and cultural systems and improve the policies and programs that most impact their lives.
 Future leaders will go through a series of dynamic, interactive and life changing trainings and receive support and resources they can use to engage their communities and form #WeThePeople teams to build towards our #LA2050.","The #LA2050 Challenge Grant would allow members from our communities to work together to develop an overarching strategy and curriculum that can be used by #WeThePeople teams, made up of neighbors, friends, and other community members, as they tackle local issues and build towards #LA2050. Staff will help to cultivate leaders from these community members that will then recruit others who would form the #WeThePeople teams and go through a separate training program. 
 Through the trainings, teams will learn 4 key skills that will help them develop and carry out their community engagement strategies: 
 1. Create Shared Story
  a. Tell his/her personal story, story of us and now
 2. Create Shared Structure
  a. Create shared commitment and relationship building
  b. Identify teams and roles 
 3. Create Shared Strategy
  a. How to build a clear strategic plan and why it’s important to have one
  b. How to make group decisions around a strategy
  c. How to utilize resources to adopt a strategy
 4. Create Shared Measurable Actions
  a. Systems to facilitate action
  b. How to create shared, motivational action
  c. How to use action to develop and expand resources
 Additionally #WeThePeople teams will work to develop elements around each of the 4 key skills, including:
 1. Story-
  a. An aspirational message, or a common narrative for the team and/or campaign
  b. A message plan for their initial action
 2. Structure- 
  a. Clear team roles, expectations and norms
  b. A clear structure for additional volunteer roles
 3. Strategy-
  a. A strategic outline through September 2015
  b. A detailed strategic plan that includes goals, measurable outcomes, and activities
 4. Action-
  a. Simulated actions to exercise newly learned skills
  b. Develop a clear action plan for their first action
 As #WeThePeople teams return from trainings they will be prepared to implement their first action and motivate their communities to re-engage with their civic environment and demand that their voices be heard. 
 Upon completion of the training sessions, community leaders will meet regularly with their teams and each other to ensure progress and learning is continuous. A system of team reviews and strategy evaluations will be implemented that allows community leaders and teams to constantly address issues that arise and get the assistance and resources they need to successfully accomplish their goals of building a more connected LA2050","The #LA2050 goals are the representation of the beliefs, needs, and desires of the people of Los Angeles. Who then is a better driver of the change we need to get us there? The LA2050 Grant will enable the empowerment of LA's most disadvantaged and most impoverished communities, also communities that are younger and growing at a faster rate than any other. These are the communities that are the least represented, and least engaged in our civic environment.
 
 According to the Public Policy Institute of California’s California Poverty Measure, 26.9% of Los Angeles County residents are living in poverty and studies show that kids that grow up in poverty are more likely to live in poverty as an adult. If we don’t break this cycle of inequality and poverty now, Los Angeles cannot and will not be the best place to play, connect, live, create, and learn in 2050. We must break the cycle of poverty that is gripping our future NOW by empowering and inspiring those who are most disenfranchised and apathetic. 
 
 Our communities face extreme challenges and need victories to continue the momentum for greater systemic changes. The implementation of #WeThePeople will result in a network of new leaders who already understand from personal experience the challenges poverty presents to communities. They will be equipped with skills and will have opportunities to connect with others facing similar struggles. By strengthening their own leadership and a network of these communities, we will cultivate change makers and build greater civic awareness in our communities. 
 
 #WeThePeople volunteers and the people they train will bring change to our city and to our systems that have been slow to respond to the changing face of LA. Our Leaders and the #WeThePeople teams will create a self-replicating system of empowerment that will cut through the enormous apathy and disillusionment and will instead inspire communities to get involved, identify and solve problems that matter to them, and create an engine that will power LA to 2050. 
 
 #WeThePeople will make Los Angeles the best place to connect by bringing people from different paths of life that are all facing similar challenges together and empowering them with the tools and skills they need to make change.","#WeThePeople will benefit everyone in Los Angeles by empowering people who are struggling in the shadows to reengage with our civic and economic systems. Growing poverty and inequality is weakening our city and weakening our sense of pride and optimism to do big things and participate in our system. If we continue to ignore the more than 2.6 million people who are suffering by living in poverty in Los Angeles County and ignore the growing trend of further disenfranchisement, we cannot become the best place to play, connect, live, create, and learn by 2050.
 
 The growing problems of economic and social injustice we are facing reach beyond income levels, geographic boundaries, or racial lines. For many, it is easy to ignore the growing poverty crisis, but it doesn’t make the crisis less real. It doesn’t stop eroding our civic systems and threatening our future. The best way to build the momentum needed to tackle this problem is by building connections across demographics, both social and economic. This will create opportunities for new ideas to flourish and it will force everyone to confront the issues that are putting all of our hopes of a prosperous future at risk. 
 
 We all do better when we all do better. 
 
 Our initial #WeThePeople teams will be based in the Latino LGBT community, the Hunger and Homeless community, immigrants, and in communities of people who are living with a disability. The #WeThePeople teams will utilize the Story of Self, Us, and Now, to build connections between, and inspire our friends, neighbors, and the community of Los Angeles to build a movement for our LA2050.
 
 California Partnership has been empowering people from low-income communities for nearly a decade to engage with their civic environment. Our members are community based organizations representing people from low-income communities who seek progressive change and seek the strategic tools and partners to get it done. Through our collaborative, coalition based structure we have been able to build understanding across a diverse range of people from low-income communities and we are able to connect the diverse range of issues affecting them to a common struggle and create a movement. 
 
 #WeThePeople is about creating power among those who feel powerless. When people have the support, the information and the tools they need to engage they can turn an “I” into “We,” and “Me” into “Us.” This creates a more connected LA.","Currently our confirmed collaborators include The Wall Las Memorias, Hunger Action Los Angeles, Communities Actively Living Independent and Free (CALIF) and Southern California Resource Services for Independent Living (SCRS-IL.) We will also engage our Los Angeles Chapter, which includes nearly 40 members ranging from very small community groups to the ACLU-Southern California, to maximize the effectiveness of the program. 
 The Wall-Las Memorias Project educates community members on the importance of HIV/AIDS, substance abuse prevention and community building in the LGBT community. 
 3 Critical Factors:
 1) The Wall founder Richard Zaldivar and his staff are established leaders in the community of some of the most impoverished and hardest to reach populations in LA
 2) The organization understands that connections between people to increase awareness and understanding are important catalysts for change. 
 3) The organization has experience in breaking down barriers between communities, and holding cultural events that help deepen our sense of community.
 We have worked together on a project to establish a community taskforce that meets with the Department of Health Services in Los Angeles County. The taskforce has trained community leaders to speak to government officials, to plan actions, and to speak and share stories with media and others. 
 
 Hunger Action Los Angeles (HALA) is a long-time member of our LA Chapter. HALA works to end hunger through advocacy and organizing and is confirmed for this project.
 3 Critical Factors:
 1)HALA has dedicated members who struggle with chronic homelessness and hunger. These dedicated core members have become leaders despite the great challenges they face. 
 2)HALA leaders have built trust among their fellow community members and they are highly aware of issues and policies that work and do not work. 
 3)HALA is an established presence at more than a dozen farmer’s markets where they operate a program called Market Match. This is an important access point to an expanded community and a great opportunity for a #WeThePeople team to work with. 
 We have worked together numerous times over the course of years. 
 
 SCRS-IL and CALIF represent people who are living with a disability and are longtime members of California Partnership and they are confirmed for this project.
 3 Critical Factors:
 1)Highly motivated membership
 2)Experienced with advocacy and leadership training
 3)Often ignored and misunderstood community",
4102036,HEAR LA amps up music education and outreach to create opportunity for LA kids,HEAR LA inspires LA children to create their own voice through music by collaborating with students from CWC Mar Vista and around the world.,Learn,2016038,2014,,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,"Citizens of the World Charter School Mar Vista purposely reflects ethnic, racial, linguistic and socioeconomic diversity. CWC believes that children who have had experience of interacting with and learning from students who are different from themselves in some way will be better able to function effectively in 2050 and will view their neighborhood, city and world in a more informed, skillful and community-minded light. HEAR LA is a great example of our program in action and it could serve as a model for learning today and in the future. 
 
 CWC MV is partnering with HearMe, a non-profit organization. HearMe’s mission is to develop a powerful international community connecting young people, giving preference to disadvantaged youth, through music creation, recording and production. 
 
 This musical program transcends traditional classrooms. Students not only learn to play, but to express themselves in new and creative ways as they are inspired through their collaboration with other Los Angeles and global students. 
 
 HEAR LA will share the power of music in four ways: 
 
 1. By 2015, CWC MV 336 students will receive music instruction twice weekly in class instruction.
  
 2. CWC MV will be able to offer after-school enrichment classes such as a concert wind instrument band or songwriting.
 
 3. A key part of HEAR LA is opening Saturday classes to any preschool or elementary age student in Los Angeles who qualifies for free or reduced lunch. CWC MV, in partnership with HEARME, already has promotional materials and an outreach plan to ensure awareness of this program. The students in the weekend program will experience a weekly six-hour session, which includes a healthy, free snack and lunch.
 
 4. CWC MV will offer community ""jam"" sessions in various parts of LA in order to inspire similar programs across the city and increase our collaborative network. 
  
 CWC has already located highly qualified staff for the Hear LA program. HearMe will provide these instructors with technical training needed to set up and operate the network collaboration portion of the music program. We also have a detailed budget identifying all the necessary instruments and equipment for the HearMe Music Program and have made arrangements for preferred pricing for that equipment.","There are numerous, well known benefits of music instruction to education, including higher graduation rates, increased proficiency in reading and mathematics abilities, and better test scores. However, public schools today struggle with dwindling resources. Musical instruction often falls by the wayside. HEAR LA provides its students with a vibrant music program and uses that program as a platform to renew interest in music instruction that will reverberate throughout Los Angeles. 
 
 Implementation of CWC MV's HEAR LA program today would result in immediate direct benefits to hundreds of students participating in the weekday and weekend HEAR LA program annually. These students would benefit from immediate exposure to quality music instruction that, in addition to boosting creativity and self-expression, will also increase the likelihood of successful graduation, reading and math achievement and higher test scores. 
 
 Additionally, we expect that in year one, the HEAR LA program will improve learning throughout Los Angeles by inspiring other schools and youth centers to develop similar programs and to participate in the HEAR ME network of youth-based collaborative music. When HEAR LA opens it will be one of at least six global Hub locations. By 2017, HearMe plans to expand to 125 locations across the world.
 
 By 2050, CWC MV expects that its in-class model will continue as CWC itself grows. We also anticipate using former HEAR LA students as mentors to current students. CWC MV further expects that the available network of musical collaboration partners will have expanded exponentially through the ""ripple effect."" By 2050, we hope for hundreds of participating schools/youth centers and network collaborators throughout Los Angeles and across the globe. 
 
 By 2050, the individuals who benefited from HEAR LA (whether as direct participants or indirectly as students of programs inspired by HEAR LA) will have become our city's taxpayers, voters, and decision-makers. By that time, we would expect these Angelinos will be more likely to have graduated from high school, achieved proficiency in reading and math, and scored higher on standardized tests than students without access to music programs. Additionally, we would expect that the Angelinos who participated in HEAR LA would have a higher degree of social connectedness, which as the LA2050 report recognizes, ""is [itself] tied to educational attainment.""","HEAR LA will directly and immediately benefit several groups in Los Angeles. First, each of CWC MV's 240 students will receive HEAR LA music instruction through its in-school and after-school programs. This number will increase annually, as CWC MV itself grows from a K-3 to a K-5 program. CWC MV plans to extend its charter to include a middle school as well. 
 
 CWC MV, is a member of a nation-wide network of high-achieving, community-based public schools that currently serves the culturally diverse populations of Mar Vista and nearby Westside neighborhoods. These neighborhoods are 51% Caucasian, 26% Latino, 7% Asian, 14% African-American, and 2% other. 
 
 CWC MV will act as a pilot program for the other Los Angeles based CWC schools located in Hollywood and Silver Lake, effectively tripling the initial impact of the program, through expansion of the in-class and after-school instruction. 
 
 CWC MV's HEAR LA program also will benefit an additional 72-144 low-income preschool and elementary school aged children annually through its weekend program in partnership with HearMe. These children are unlikely to benefit from a music instruction program without HEAR LA.
 
 We anticipate that the benefits of its HEAR LA Program also will echo throughout Los Angeles through the traveling demonstration or community ""jam"" session component of the Program. This will, in turn, expand the network of participants in other schools or youth centers throughout the city. Indeed, because HEAR LA is not limited by physical location, the potential reach of its impact is limitless.","A key partner in the HEAR LA Program will be HearMe. http://www.hearmehub.org
 
 HearMe is a critical partner to HEAR LA success. HearMe already has developed a curriculum and software for virtual music collaboration. Through this partnership, HearMe will provide its curriculum and technical training to CWC MV's HEAR LA instructors. Additionally, HearMe will help funding for HEAR LA’s second and third year of weekend instruction for low-income students. Fundraising from both CWC MV and HearMe will supplement future years. We plan to expand it to the other CWC schools and hopefully other public LA schools. CWC MV and HearMe are excited to begin their collaboration and are in process of formalizing their agreement.
  
 CWC MV will also collaborate with various professionals in the music industry, who will lend their music-making and recording expertise to the success of this project. These professionals include composers and professional musicians
 
 HearMe has created an International Music Creation Network. This is a way for the various HearMe Hubs to connect through the web. HEAR LA would be one of the first hubs. As forerunners, our students would be learning cutting edge technology. As of now that connection is via SoundCloud, which enables sites to collaborate in virtual time. Every day there are new developments that HearMe follows and it looks like shortly, students will be able to collaborate in real time.
 
 3 crucial factors to making HEAR LA work are the International Music Creation Network, students from diverse backgrounds and their imaginations.
 
 HEAR LA gives students hands on experience with various software and music applications but also teaches them about teamwork, handling critiques and turning criticism into a positive. Every student will have the chance to be a leader and also to be a follower. By being a part of a global network, students will realize how big and how small the world is. They will get the chance to forge friendships across the global and bring new awareness to what is happening in those areas. HearMe plans to reach out to war torn countries and bring hope to children across the globe. Our LA students could be companions in peace and global unity and understanding.",1,
4102041,LA Bridge: Ensuring Under-represented Students Enroll in and Graduate from Colleges in LA County,Create a seamless transition linking high schools & colleges so LAUSD students can enroll in and graduate from postsecondary institutions,Learn,2016047,2014,,,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,,"Students who place in remediation are less likely to graduate from college. Unfortunately, under-represented students are most likely to place in remedial courses and thus the probability that they will earn a college degree drop off sharply. This has a destructive effect on individuals and their communities by perpetuating the cycle of trans-generational poverty. The remediation dilemma is particularly pervasive across the largest public university system in the nation, the CSU, which spends close to $30 million annually on remediation resulting in lower graduation rates. This project tackles the remediation crisis in 3 new ways: (1) linking the work of HS teachers & college professors, (2) offering concurrent enrollment courses to students who are typically excluded, and (3) creating a sustainable and scalable solution.
 
 First, college professors and HS teachers work together in the HS classroom during the regular school day. Traditionally, professors teach concurrent enrollment courses on college campuses without any involvement from K-12. Even when these courses are on HS campuses, they have consisted of professors teaching a class in isolation. In the LA Bridge Project, the professors and teachers co-teach using the same curriculum, textbook, assignments, assessments, & grading policies as the college courses. Further, the teachers & professors plan the courses together each summer & meet after each exam to score the tests together. This configuration alleviates the traditional blame game and builds sustainable relationships between K-12 and higher education faculties. 
 
 Second, under-represented students are traditionally excluded from concurrent enrollment opportunities. The thinking is that these courses are best suited for advanced students only, even though researchers consistently conclude that gifted students will be successful in college regardless of these opportunities. This project seeks to reverse that trend by offering these courses to students who have college aspirations but lack strong academic or consistent attendance records.
 
 Finally, this project was designed for sustainability & scalability. Our program is sustainable as teachers who co-teach with professors are certified by the university to continue offering college-level courses to their students as adjunct professors. It’s scalable because once teachers are certified, they can co-teach with an additional colleague, certifying them as well.","The Los Angeles Bridge Project will help to make LA the best place to learn by alleviating the college remediation problem early and at the root. The immediate impact of this program is having LAUSD students graduate from high school college-ready. The long-term impact is that low-income Angelenos will be afforded the social mobility that comes with earning a college degree. LA County will also benefit from this project, in the long-term, in that we will have a highly educated and skilled workforce.
 
 Specifically, of the students who place in remediation, “fewer than 1 in 10 graduate from community colleges within three years and little more than a third complete bachelor’s degrees in six years.” This is detrimental as access to a college education is critical for improving people’s quality of life and society as a whole. On average, graduating with a Bachelor’s degree will result in $2.8 million in earned wages over a lifetime as opposed to $1.3 million with only a high school diploma. Society also benefits from a college-educated population with a robust economy, stronger civic engagement, and lower levels of crime, poverty, and healthcare costs. Unfortunately, college graduation rates for under-represented students (minority, first-generation, low-income) are decreasing in comparison to white, non-Hispanic students even though students of color constitute the nation’s fastest growing demographic. If current college graduation trends continue, there will be shortage of 16 million college-educated workers nationally and one million in California by the year 2025. Researchers have concluded that a major factor that hinders students’ ability to graduate from college is the high rate of academic remediation. 
 
 Students who are able to complete their college degree are adversely affected by remediation through the accumulation of greater debt, spending more time in college, and delaying their entrance into the workforce. This has a toxic effect on the nation and the state of California through lower income tax revenues and an unskilled workforce. 
 
 Los Angeles cannot afford to allow our most precious resource, our human capital, to go to waste. The solutions to our most pressing societal problems rest in the hearts and minds of our youth. Only by ensuring that the next generation of Angelenos see themselves as viable agents of change, can we ensure a brighter future for our great city and county.","The LA Bridge Project will benefit under-represented (minority, low-income, first-generation college) students from LAUSD. Specifically, we serve students residing in Downtown, East and South Los Angeles through CSULA, the San Fernando Valley through CSUN, and the South Bay through CSUDH. We target the lowest performing schools in the most economically disadvantaged areas of the school district. The median household income of the families in these communities is $22,650. As a result, 46% of them live below the poverty line and on average 99% of the students in these areas are eligible for free or reduced lunch. On average, only 54% of our students matriculate in post-secondary institutions compared to the school district average of 62% and the national average of 63%. We strategically target students who have college aspirations but not necessarily the strongest academic or attendance records.","The Los Angeles Bridge Project began as a strategic partnership between LAUSD, CSULA, and College Bridge in the 2013-2014 school year. The initial pilot focused only on mathematics. Due to the significant early success of this program, CSULA scaled the project to an additional high school and added English for the 2014-2015 school year. MOUs are in place with CSULA and LAUSD. Additionally, we plan to scale-up through the north and south LAUSD service areas with CSUN and CSUDH. CSUN are confirmed partners with the MOU pending. CSUDH is in the early stages of partnership development.
 
 All three of these CSUs in the Los Angeles metropolitan area bring key benefits to this project. They offer in-kind donations of the professors’ salaries, use of university equipment and space, educational outreach (tutoring, college counseling, and school orientation), and financial aid resources (FAFSA workshops). LAUSD offers in-kind donations by providing the teacher and facilities to offer the courses in the regular school day. The three factors that are critical to the success of these collaborations are buy-in from (1) LAUSD high school teachers, (2) CSU professors, and (3) administrators in both LAUSD and CSUs.
 
 The LA Bridge Project ensures buy-in from all stakeholders by linking the work of the school district and higher education institutions. We bring together high school teachers and college professors to co-teach college-level math and English courses in order to offer students the opportunity to bypass academic remediation. By working shoulder to shoulder, this project eschews the traditional blame game and serves as bidirectional professional development for both instructors and administrators.",0,
4102043,How To Increase The Percentage Of Underserved Youth Graduating From College in Boyle Heights,College Track (CT) will increase the number of adults with college degrees in Boyle Heights.,Learn,2016048,2014,,,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,Boyle Heights,"CT’s successful model is currently being implemented in Boyle Heights. The model is innovative in 3 key ways: 1) it supports students continuously from the summer before 9th grade through college graduation, 2) it provides multi-dimensional support, and 3) it provides intensive, ongoing, individualized support. The program wraps students with long-term, comprehensive relationships and services. CT’s has 5 service areas:
 
 1) Academic Summer Advancement Program (ASAP) provides a positive transition from 8th to 9th grade through strengthening English and math skills, reinforcing effective study habits, and developing personal awareness. Students attend workshops, participate in field trips and community service projects. 
 
 2) Academic Affairs helps ensure that students graduate from high school prepared to succeed in college. CT provides students with tutoring, homework help, study skill workshops, standardized test preparation, and academic coaching 2 - 3 days a week. CT’s uses an integrated academic approach that includes computer-based supports that maximize students learning. Students who are struggling receive “on-track” intervention services and individualized plans to meet mental health, personal, family, as well as academic needs
 
 3) Student Life provides students with the opportunity to explore their passions and constructively engage in their communities. Student Life programs offer workshops that cultivate a students’ creativity and passions. Workshops include performing arts, field trips to cultural institutions, and international study and more. Students fulfill 25 hours of community service each year. 
 
 4) College Affairs gives students the support and guidance in everything related to college admissions including the selection and application process, assistance applying for financial aid, grants and scholarships. Each senior is also matched 1:1 to a college advisor who helps him or her apply to scholarships and complete a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and other forms. 
 
 5) College Success connects with every CT student it sends to college, ensuring that students are able to graduate within 4 to 6 years. CT provides academic guidance, transitional and emotional support, financial planning and awards, teaching self-advocacy, and tips on finding a community on campus. Each CT student has a 1-1 mentor the first two years of college, when low-income students are most at-risk for drop out.","In 2012, CT began programming in Boyle Heights. The Boyle Heights community is predominantly an immigrant community with low education levels. Only one-third of Boyle Heights residents 25-years old or older have a high school diploma, and only 5% of Boyle Heights residents 25 and older have a college degree. Additional data reveals that close to 50% of students from Boyle Heights never complete high school. We intend to change this.
 
 CT's services are linked to a proven model of college preparation and completion. Over the past 17 years, in the Bay area, 100% percent of CT seniors graduate high school, over 90% were admitted to a four-year school compared to15% of students of the same demographic, and 80% of students who completed our high school program have graduated from, or are still attending college.
 
 Over time, CT will increase the number of college bound students of color in Los Angeles. For example, in 2008 when CT opened our center in San Francisco’s Bayview Hunter’s Point neighborhood, only 6 African-American students graduated from the neighborhood high school eligible to attend a 4-year university. CT is poised to increase the San Francisco Unified School District’s college bound African-American students by 30% by 2016. 
 
 Specifically, College Track Boyle Heights (CTBH) will benefit Los Angeles by:
 
 1) Positively impacting academic outcomes for Roosevelt HS, Boyle Heights, and in time, the LAUSD.
 2) Creating a clear and measurable pathway to a 4-year degree for underserved students in Boyle Heights.
 3) Transforming Boyle Heights into a community where it is the expectation, not the exception, for students to pursue and obtain a 4-year degree.
 4) Contributing to the economic vitality of the city, by creating a strong, educated work force in one of the city’s most vulnerable neighborhoods.
 
 By 2050, LAUSD will be using CT’s model and having direct impact on low-income students across Los Angeles. Communities will be transformed and college degrees will be the norm. CTBH will continue to work in collaboration with LAUSD and others to build and grow best practices and develop and grow relationships with colleges and universities to better support underserved students in Los Angeles through college. Our city will see the direct results in a thriving educated workforce. By 2050, all students in Los Angeles will have the tools, role models, support and resources to finish college and pursue their dreams.","CTBH is located in Boyle Heights. 100% of our enrolled students are Latino. 90% are from low-income households. 93% will be the first in their families to graduate from college. 
 
 Our program benefits students from two schools; Roosevelt High School and the Math, Science & Technology Magnet Academy located on Roosevelt HS’s campus. 
 
 Our three classes are comprised of freshmen, sophomore and junior students from these schools. By 2015-16, our Boyle Heights center will be fully enrolled with 240 students. 
 
 Our program changes the cultures in the schools whose students we serve. Randy Romero, former Math, Science & Techology Magnet Academy at Roosevelt HS in Boyle Heights said “CT is raising the bar not only for our students, but also for the teachers at our school. There is now a higher expectation.” Other principals have noted a culture shift in their school due to CT’s presence - that it is now “cool” to get good grades and attributes that to the CT students’ focus on learning and doing what it takes to get into college.","To significantly impact the communities we serve, College Track collaborates with partner organizations to build a network of coordinated and complementary services, share best practices and professional development, and leverage joint resources. 
 
 With the support of former Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, CTBH acquired a space for our center a half-mile from the Roosevelt campus, in the newly renovated Boyle Heights City Hall. The space has been leased to CTBH by the City of Los Angeles for $1 per year for 10 years. Our center is specifically designed to be independent of the school district, while working in alignment with the district.
 
 In an unprecedented move and with the support of Superintendent John Deasy, LAUSD has granted CTBH access to attendance, progress report and final semester grades. CTBH also has a unique collaborative relationship the principals at Roosevelt HS, Math, Science & Technology Magnet Academy, and the Partnership for Los Angeles Schools (PLAS), granting CTBH access to teachers’ online grade books, ensuring the CTBH staff has the most up-to-date academic information about its students, which in turn allows CTBH to proactively support its students. 
 
 Other support comes from Boyle Heights native will.i.am of the Black Eyed Peas who provides opportunities for CTBH students in STEM education, music and arts education, and study abroad opportunities. Other partners include the the Wasserman Foundation, JP Morgan Chase and continued collaborations with Homeboy Industries, 826LA and PUENTA Learning Center, in order to maximize opportunities for students. 
 
 As a grantee of the California Endowment, CTBH is part of the Boyle Heights Learning Collaborative. The Collaborative is made of California Endowment grantees who collaborate to positively impact the Boyle Heights community as a whole. 
 
 The 3 factors that are critical to the success of our collaborations are:
 
 1. The partnership with LAUSD and PLAS gives CTBH access to information that allows CTBH to monitor, intervene and support our students’ academics increasing successful academic outcomes for our students.
 2. Our collaboration with the City of Los Angeles shows that LA is deeply invested in making sure that students in Boyle Heights succeed. 
 3. As part of the Boyle Heights Learning Collaborative, and through our relationships with other CBOs, CTBH coordinates with other non-profits who support our students’ non-academic and social/emotional needs.",0,
4102054,The 4Liter Classroom Challenge,We'll use an online challenge and a teacher-created curriculum to help LA students better understand and protect their water resources.,Learn,2016064,2014,,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,"The 4Liter Challenge has already come a long way, and DIGDEEP is ready to accelerate the project into LA County schools!
 
 In 2013, we worked with local educators to draft the 4Liters Curriculum, which has been given a foreword by Catarina de Albuquerque, the UN Special Rapporteur on the Human Right to Water and Sanitation. Then we piloted the 4Liter Challenge in two LA classrooms. 
 
 In 2014/2015, we'll work with LA County teachers to plan 4Liter Challenges in their classrooms. We'll design and mail program-funded kits to educators, and we'll visit local schools with a custom pop-up exhibit. We'll also reach out to student participants and their teachers through our social media channels and a traditional email campaign. 
 
 Finally, we'll train a dedicated staff at DIGDEEP HQ in downtown LA. They'll maintain and improve our online tool (at 4liters.org/teach), work with educators to streamline implementation, visit local and national conferences, grow partnerships, and develop new resources like lessons, videos, and infographics.
 
 Having developed and piloted the 4Liter Challenge, we're in a unique position to scale quickly!","We believe that by 2050 LA students should lead the nation in understanding the value of our freshwater and how to conserve it. 
 
 LA is the largest city in California and the epicenter of an historic drought. But LA is also a national leader in conservation, technology, media, and entertainment.
 
 By bringing the 4Liter Challenge into LA classrooms, we'll help young Angelinos stop taking water for granted. We'll make water - as a nexus of science, economics, and well-being - a focus of public and private education. We'll prepare LA to deal with future water challenges while building support for populations without reliable water access. 
 
 Together, we'll change the way Americans think about water.","The 4Liter Challenge will primarily benefit students in grades 6-12 in LA county schools - private, public, and charter. By changing the way students think about water, 4Liters will also positively affect water consumption at home.
 
 The 4Liter Challenge will benefit teachers, by providing a flexible, easy-to-use tool that meets new Common-Core standards.
 
 Finally, the 4Liter Challenge will benefit water-poor communities in the US and abroad. Just like a runner uses a marathon to fight breast cancer, 4Liters classrooms can choose to use their Challenge to raise funds for water access projects. Many of these funds will stay right here in the US, where DIGDEEP is the only global water non-profit working in affected communities. 
 
 Not only will 4Liters change the way LA students think about water, it will make a real impact in communities the world over.","Factors critical to all proposed collaborations include: securing funding, maintaining the non-political and non-religious nature of the program, responding effectively to teacher feedback, and sharing a common vision for water education and sustainability. 
 
 Educators for Excellence (confirmed) 
 E4E provides direct access to teacher-activists committed to improving LA education. Though they focus primarily on policy issues, E4E also promotes issue-area learning. We have worked together in the past.
 
 LA Unified School District (unconfirmed) 
 Collaboration with LAUSD would give us direct access to educators in over 1200 schools and a seal of approval to ease adoption. This collaboration is by no means necessary for the success of 4Liters, but we think it's a smart step. LAUSD Associate Superintendent Al Cortes and Health Education Programs Coordinator Lori Vollandt have expressed interest in the program. 
 
 Archdiocese of Los Angeles (pending, unconfirmed)
 The LA Archdiocese operates one of the largest private elementary and middle-school systems in LA County. Collaboration with the Archdiocese would give us direct access to educators and a seal of approval to ease adoption. We are in talks with their Director, Msgr. Pilato.
 
 California Department of Water Resources (unconfirmed)
 The CADWR is the agency responsible for managing and protecting California's water. They have direct links to educators, policy-makers, and funders that could benefit the program. The CADWR also has a direct interest in changing Californian water attitudes.
 
 Office of the Mayor (unconfirmed) 
 Mayor Garcetti has expressed an interest in improving the way Angelinos care for their resources. Collaboration with the Mayor's office would provide public visibility for the project and open the door to funding from LA institutions.
 
 Once a year, DIGDEEP opens the 4Liter Challenge to the public, uniting organizations like Take Part, One.org, Hurley H2O, and teams from major corporations, faith communities, and college campuses. All of these partners are confirmed, and their participation provides national exposure to new teachers.",0,
4102059,Empowering the Future of Los Angeles Creative Economy through Arts Mentorships,"We at DSTL Arts are expanding our current Arts Mentorship Program's capacity, offering art workshops & establishing our own art gallery.",Learn,2016067,2014,,,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,,"DSTL Arts has been in operation for the past year and a half providing mentorship in the arts to a cohort of 8 creative, at-risk youth, and this grant will help us expand our capacity and infrastructure by establishing a central gallery space that will act as a hub for managing student mentorships, the training of new Arts-Mentor volunteers, and the offering of diverse arts-programming and arts workshops to the general community.
 
 Having a centralized location will allow us to add more structured, arts and entrepreneurial-skills workshops to our current Arts Mentorship Program curriculum, including the incorporation of differentiated-learning and multi-modal teaching strategies that will benefit our current program's effectiveness. Plus, by being able to coordinate a universal training program for new volunteers at a central location, we will be able to ensure a high quality experience for all our participants, Arts-Mentor volunteers and students alike, with the potential of being able to deploy Arts-Mentor volunteers into the community to provide our Arts Mentorship Program within other community centers.
 
 By simultaneously growing our partnerships with schools, teachers, and other community-based organizations in and around Central LA, East LA and Watts, we will generate a larger pool of student participants who will learn basic work-readiness skills and have the opportunity to explore the arts-sector as a career. For example, we are currently in early stages of establishing a new partnership with Youth Policy Institute's Pico-Union Community Center where we hope to bring our Arts Mentorship Program to their space, along with Arts-Mentor volunteers, in order to support their current work-readiness program's goals and outcomes of preparing youth for postsecondary education and career exploration. Additionally, with referrals we expect to receive from teachers whom we've worked with in this past year at Youth Opportunities High School in Watts and Media Arts and Entertainment Design High School in East LA, we hope to be ready to grow our student impact and provide a central location for orienting newly referred mentorship students.
 
 Lastly, with a centralized art gallery, we will be able to provide all our students, both future and current, with a venue to display their artwork, perform, and engage with future employers and arts enthusiasts.","Mentorships that are individualized & well structured provide at-risk youth with benefits that impact learning & social experiences dramatically. Add Arts Education to a genuine mentorship, and you have a recipe for incredible growth in young people now & for the rest of their lives.
 
 Mentorships lasting a minimum of 1 year have been proven to drastically reduce the chances of at-risk youth initiating in drug & alcohol abuse by up to 47%, not to mention reducing unhealthy & violent behaviors in at-risk youth by up to 33% (California Research Bureau).
 
 Engaging, meaningful mentorships also empower young people to have higher career & educational aspirations, resulting in better school attendance (53% less likely to skip school), higher scores on standardized tests, and higher matriculation rates into postsecondary education institutions (California Research Bureau).
 
 Arts Education programs have data that corroborate the same findings as in mentorship programs (i.e. 3 times more likely to enroll in college & earn a Bachelor's Degree, more likely to earn a higher salary over lifetime, a stronger sense of belonging & community, etc.), with the added benefits of a 25% higher likelihood of performing community service in the future, and stronger analytical & problem solving skills that relate directly to the workforce (National Endowment for the Arts).
 
 Arts Education programming wholly compliments a solid mentorship program. In providing the combined service of arts education & mentorship to at-risk youth, we are currently building immediate capacity in our students by teaching them leadership skills, problem-solving, conflict resolution, work-readiness, entrepreneurial methodology, and more. These skills will benefit our students greatly when they begin to establish their careers now & in the near future.
 
 Additionally, since our youth will be primarily working with volunteer Arts-Mentors as we expand our services, the establishing of a tighter, connected community will benefit both generations of artists. Volunteer-oriented programs bring with them a great number of benefits to a community as well, many of which echo the benefits that at-risk youth experience from mentorship & arts-education programming, such as a sense of safety and belonging, healthier lives, etc. Overall, our Arts Mentorship Program creates an environment of learning & collaboration, safety & acceptance, goal-setting & attainment, and more for all involved.","In a macro sense, our Arts Mentorship Program benefits the entire community of Los Angeles by increasing the educational and career outcomes of our students, creating connectedness amongst volunteers, young people, and all arts enthusiasts, and by providing a new cultural center where people of diverse backgrounds can come together to collaborate and participate in the arts.
 
 However, to be more specific about our organizational impact, these are the student and volunteer enrollment target groups and goals for our Arts Mentorship Program, proposed Arts Workshops Program, and cultural events:
 
 Arts Mentorship Program Student Enrollment Criteria:
 •Ages 16–21
 •In-School (high school student) or Out-of-School (high school dropout or high school graduate not enrolled in college)
 
 Students must meet at least one of the three following ""at-risk"" indicators
 •Low-Income (based on family size)
 •Individualized Education Plan or 504 Plan (learning or physical disability)
 •Current or Former Foster Youth
 •A combination of other ""at-risk"" indicators taken into consideration
 
 Arts Mentorship Program proposed enrollment: 30 new students per year
 
 Arts Mentorship Program Volunteer (Arts-Mentors) Criteria:
 •Ages 25 and up
 •Able to prove ability to work with underage youth (background check, etc)
 •Actively working as artist or in arts-sector (visual, literary, gallery, etc.)
 
 Volunteer recruitment goal: 15 new volunteers per year
 
 Weekly Arts Workshops Program
 Meeting once weekly, each workshop will be one to three consecutive sessions in duration
 Workshops open to general public, workshop enrollment limited to 10–12 participants per series
 Ages 12 to 21 (depending on topic)
 
 Student enrollment goal: 100 students per year
 Volunteer instructor goal: 5 volunteers per year
 
 Poetry Readings, Art Shows, etc. attendance goals: 1000 attendees","Our current collaborators are individual English teachers at both Youth Opportunity High School in Watts and Alliance Media Arts and Entertainment Design High School in East Los Angeles. They currently provide student referrals and curriculum advisement. Additionally, one of our board members is principal at New Village Charter High School, an alternative high school for young women.
 
 These current collaborators provide important insight and direction in the implementation of our current Arts Mentorship Program along with the referral of new Arts Mentorship Program students. However, we are exploring new partnerships that are currently in early stages of development, with our most current collaboration prospect being Youth Policy Institute's Pico-Union Community Center.
 
 In order for all our collaborations to grow and be successful, we will need funding to build out the following areas of our current program:
 1. Infrastructure for managing more student mentorships and new volunteer recruitment and training
 2. A centralized location for regular student art shows and performances
 3. Ability to hire staff that can fully dedicate time and resources for the management and implementation of all our programs and services",0,
4102067,Bridging the Divide in LA: Language and Digital Literacy Pilot,"We're working with Centro Latino and human-I-T to provide free computers, Internet service and literacy courses for low/non-literate adults.",Learn,2016074,2014,,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,"EveryoneOn will leverage our existing platform of low-cost offers to provide Internet service and computers. The funds received for this grant will provide free routers and low-cost home Internet service (valued at $10/month). We will partner with human-I-T staff and volunteers to provide donated, refurbished computers with customized software that includes digital literacy content and Windows 7 Professional. 
 
 We will work with Centro Latino for Literacy to provide these benefits to the adult graduates of their Leamos(TM) (""Let’s Read"") Basic and Functional Pre-ESL literacy courses. These courses teach adults with zero to three years of primary schooling how to read, write, perform math functions, and overcome their fear of technology; skills that are necessary to be functional in today’s world.
 
 Collectively will leverage all of our partners on the ground in LA to promote awareness of this pilot to nonprofits and prospective volunteers.","The detrimental effects of illiteracy are often compounded because of a lack of resources, geographic isolation, or underdeveloped education programs. Many schools and educational institutions lack the resources and materials for comprehensive literacy programs, and library systems and many teachers are under-trained. As a result, the children of low- to non-literate parents are at risk of growing up illiterate, without ever having the opportunity to develop an appreciation for reading. A report released by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development found that “a mother’s reading skill is the greatest determinant of her children’s future academic success, outweighing other factors such as neighborhood and family income.”
 
 There are over 1.6 million non-literate Spanish-speaking adults in the U.S.; 222,320 are in Los Angeles County. Leamos was designed by Centro Latino for Literacy to help non-literate Spanish-speaking adults become literate in Spanish first, thereby preparing them to learn ESL. Leamos Basic is a mouse-driven, audio-visual, online course that teaches non-literate Spanish speakers to read and write at a basic level. Graduates proceed to the second--a classroom-based functional literacy course that teaches basic grammar, math and financial education. In 2013, 96% of adults enrolled in the Centro Latino's courses were parents and more than 70% had between zero and two years of schooling. 
 
 Our collaborative pilot project will help make LA the best place to learn by encouraging reading comprehension and providing Spanish-speaking parents with the skills and technology needed to help them and their children succeed. This program will be transformative for its participants by leveling the digital divide while simultaneously improving parent reading and digital literacy rates, which will lead to improved educational outcomes for both parents and students.
 
 We are also encouraging volunteerism in LA with technology and providing free technical and vocational skills to participating volunteers in the local community. By providing some of LA’s most marginalized populations access to literacy software and home Internet service, we are seeking to bridge the opportunity gap for parents, students and volunteers. 
 
 Following the successful implementation of this pilot program, we will be able to improve and replicate this program making LA a national model for learning, a national model for learning and connecting by 2050.","This is an opportunity for working age adults; a vast majority of whom are parents, who have never had any formal primary schooling. One third of Centro Latino students are indigenous speakers with Spanish as their second language. The ultimate goal of these students is to learn English. We want to encourage them and their children to value and retain their primary and secondary languages as they learn English. Recent research has shown both the health and economic value of having multilingual skills.
 
 Volunteers without home internet access that participate in this project will also benefit from free equipment and home Internet access. The Volunteer Corps at Centro Latino consists mainly of first generation college students and professionals, and about 60% of human-I-T volunteers/interns are late high school to early college age (17-23); both of which will greatly benefit from vocational skills and free home access to the Internet.","Our partners Centro Latino for Literacy and Human-I-T are confirmed partners for this pilot project. Since 1991, Centro Latino for Literacy has been putting non-to-low literate adults on the pathway to learning English as a second language (ESL) through its unique and innovative courses. Centro Latino’s approach builds the foundational skills and confidence needed for native Spanish speakers to learn English and pursue greater educational and income opportunities.
 
 human-I-T is a nonprofit organization working transform unwanted or inoperative laptops and computers into operational education tools for the millions in need. human-I-T strives to go beyond recycling by taking a progressive approach to e-waste management, vocational training, and the digital divide.

After six months working with us to improve their health, those 10 families recruit 10 more families, and serve as mentors. The cycle continues each season, as stakeholders spread practices of healthy living throughout their networks. So, over time, we organically grow a robust oasis of wellness in food deserts, empowering communities to nurture future generations’ bodies, minds and hearts.","A lot of wonderful projects are trying to change the food system from the top down. We are doing the opposite--from the bottom up, one family at a time. 
 
 Right here in LA, we have kickstarted a growing movement teaching people how to take care of their bodies in the present food system. Groceryships is offering not a technical solution, but an adaptive one, helping people achieve vibrant health despite their current circumstances. We focus on the here and now, spreading a solution that equips people with the knowledge, tools, and support to make permanent lifestyle changes. 
 
 The wealth gap creates the health gap. At Groceryships, we know every person's health is equally important, but the world seems to disagree. So we've structured our program and organization to help close both gaps. We focus on bringing all the resources available to higher income neighborhoods to lower income families. We fund this partially by donations, but also by bringing our innovative curriculum and program structure to corporations, through our for-profit Corporate Wellness program. 
 
 In 2050, Groceryships groups will have spread across Los Angeles. The tech companies in Silicon Beach will be getting healthy through our corporate wellness program, while at the same time financing groups in Compton and Inglewood. The finance companies in Pasadena and the South Bay will be getting healthy while financing Groceryships groups in Boyle Heights. 
 
 By 2050, the seeds we planted in 2014 will have taken root and changed the landscape from a desert to a rainforest, where generations of families have adopted healthy ways of eating, moving, and communicating. The Framingham study made clear the power of social networks. Changing a single families health can have profound influence not just on future generations of that family, but on everyone they come in contact with, and who those people come in contact with. 
 Over the long run, a change in one family can change a community, which can change a city.","Our first two groups are in South Los Angeles and Boyle Heights, where childhood obesity is 30% and the rate of overweight/obesity is above 70%. We will focus primarily on low-income families across Los Angeles who are struggling with food related health issues like obesity, diabetes, heart disease, malnourishment, etc.","Homeboy Industries has mentored us from the early stages of our program, providing advice and support in developing our concept. In October, we are launching our first class together, connecting their twenty-six years of experience, highly motivated members, and proven success with our innovative strategy. This is a mutually beneficial partnership, allowing us to transform the relationship with food for Homeboy employees, explore a different facet of the wellness emphasized by Homeboy, and introduce our curriculum to a new neighborhood.
 
 Vitamix has also worked with us throughout our pilot program. The blenders they donate make it easier for families to increase fruit and vegetable consumption, so much so that kids of our families are holding “smoothie parties.”",1,

The goal of ""Youth Conversations” is to educate youth about the warning signs of domestic violence and give youth an opportunity to discuss how domestic violence can be prevented. “Youth Conversations” events will provide an opportunity to discuss domestic violence without the stigma that is usually associated with this issue. Young people will learn about the cycle of violence, where to get help, and what to do if they or their friends are ever involved in unhealthy relationships.","Given our experience with youth intervention through our shelter programs and community-orientated youth prevention programs, Jenesse’s youth-targeted violence prevention model has the potential to change the life trajectory of at-risk youth in Los Angeles County.
 Funding from MY LA2050 would be used to expand Jenesse’s “Youth Conversations” and Teen Angels programs. “Youth Conversations” provides youth with the opportunity to have frank discussions about relationship violence. 
 
 Jenesse plans to implement our project by:
 
 1. Hold “Youth Conversations” to provide youth the opportunity to have frank discussions about relationship violence.
 2. Increase the awareness and support of Jenesse’s Teen Angeles, who create change within our community by being active role models for the next generation.
 3. Engage men and boys as allies in our prevention strategy and intervention model.
 4. Utilize men and boys to influence other men and boys and encourage them to work as change agents to prevent domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking.
 5. Develop violence prevention workshops and activities designed to address the intersection of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and other youth issues.
 6. Create and implement culturally responsive pathway programs, from crisis to stability for youth who are impacted by violence.
 7. Enhance services and support for youth who are exposed to domestic violence.
 8. Increase the community response for youth exposed to domestic violence, dating violence, stalking etc. and community agencies who work with this population.","The Secret to Why We Connect. We KNOW that We Know…..
 (1) Domestic violence is a family issue 
 (2) Children and teens are equal victims of domestic violence
 (3) Young men have to be part of the conversation
 (4) Domestic violence is sometimes a family cycle that goes generation to generation; this cycle can be broken with proper education, awareness, counseling and preparation.
 Los Angeles is a violent city, but the most insidious violence, the one that does the most damage, is the violence that takes place in the home. What leaves the home enters the world, and statistics show time and time again that men and women raised in a home where family violence is the norm often become abusers and violent offenders who not only hurt those they love, but target those in their community for harm as well. Decreasing the amount of people who are victims and perpetrators of domestic violence will lead to a safer Los Angeles. But to get there, we must challenge people to redefine their ""normal"" when it comes to violence. This includes mental, physical, we must engage them to unlearn what they have learned. 
 Karen Earl, CEO of Jenesse Center says, ""Jenesse and our collaborators believe we will change Los Angeles by talking. We will come together and share all of the painful questions around relationship violence, develop agreed upon language and process, decide who else belongs in the tent, engage in friendly, fabulous discussions and share our findings and implementation strategies in a lovely inclusive manner. It is now 2050 and Los Angeles is changed.”
 Jenesse strongly believes that youth intervention strategy is the key to ending domestic violence. We believe that we can live in LA2050 without domestic violence. If we continue to educate and hold conversations about healthy relationships, dating violence and sexual assault until it is nonexistent. Jenesse's efforts to connect, educate, address and serve the needs of Los Angeles youth by:
 1. Develop and increase existing community programs focused on youth.
 2. Increase availability information and resources for youth exposed to domestic violence and other youth issues.
 3. Develop culturally and linguistically appropriate mental health, anger management and other support services for various age groups.
 4. Provide age, culturally, and linguistically appropriate residential and nonresidential services to youth exposed to domestic violence.
 5. Increase awareness and funding to support programs.","Funds obtained through MY LA 2050 will benefit over 1000 unserved and underserved youth ages (11-18) in Los Angeles County. Thirty-four percent of all domestic violence calls in Los Angeles county are from Jenesse’s Service Area. Jenesse’s qualitative and quantitative in- house data supports the devastating effect of domestic violence among children and youth.
 Jenesse Center knows that to end domestic violence, we must educate our youth early on to recognize the signs of unhealthy relationships, so they never end up in a shelter. We also know that we must challenge young people who have already fallen into unhealthy relationship patterns, to redefine their idea of normal, and to give and demand respect.","Jenesse thrives on partnerships. One of our strengths is bringing the power, influence and resources of partners within our appropriate framework to move our mission forward.
 
 1. ICON MANN- Recently, Jenesse was embraced by ICON MANN, a group of Hollywood actors, high level executives and dignitaries...all men, who shadow, mentor, counsel and recognize the achievement of our boys and youth. The men recently celebrated the youth's achievements at 2014 Youth Conversations event. They provoked thought and reflection on panel discussions about ""what is it to be a man"", ""what does a healthy relationship look like?""
 
 When we asked some of the ICON MANN participants the questions (1) Why was it important for you to be there? (2) Why are these youths vital?, Graylind R. Wheery/Director of Finance for Sony stated, “I think it was important for me to be part of the conversation because of one of the key topics…“Manhood”. For youth “Manhood”, in some cases, is defined by images seen through various media outlets or through personal interactions. Unfortunately, as in the case of many of the victims who seek Jenesse services for support, some of the personal interactions are not positive ones and the youth will get a skewed view of Manhood thus increasing the chances of a cycle of violence and abuse. Being there and a part of the discussion provided a platform to help change that view. Simply put, we provided the youth with another perspective…a positive perspective. Not to suggest that some of the youth did not already have positive male role models, but more re-enforcement can’t hurt. These youth are vital because they have a voice and can be advocates in getting the Jenesse message out. They will also be leaders and influencers of tomorrow. By providing them with a broad set of exposures today, we are equipping them to not only survive, but also to thrive in an ever changing and complex world. I only hope my words resonated with them.”
 2. Coordinated Community Response Network- A network of organizations who together will ensure access to community resources and provide a victim-centered response to domestic
 violence, teen dating violence, sexual assault, stalking and other youth issues. Our Memorandum of Understanding Partners include: Watts Healthcare Corporation, Green Dot Public Schools Animo (Alain) Leroy Locke High School, South Central Training Consortium, and Los Angeles Police Department/Wilshire Area Leadership Academy.",
4102112,Arts LANDed: Connecting Resources Educators Artists Students and You,Arts LANDed is an artist residency program for public schools and online resource mapping/connecting people to local art experiences.,Connect,2016126,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050connect/projects/ArtsLANDed.html,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,"Arts LANDed is a neighborhood-based artist-in-residence program at local schools & an ongoing event resource aggregator/mapping website for teachers & families to find & attend art events near where they teach, work, or live. Using existing resources from LA County’s Arts for All to ForYourArt, Arts LANDed leverages the worthy data produced to become a hands-on program on contemporary art for teachers, artists, & students at LAUSD schools. The goal is to nurture a new generation of artists & thinkers by providing an infrastructure for teachers to connect with local arts organizations, supplement curriculum with field trips or artist visits & access the living classroom of everyday LA.","LAND’s process for the 2-part project will be straightforward, with the pilot artist-residency program mirroring the future possibilities of the website. For the artist-in-residence program, LAND will approach ten arts organizations, artist-run spaces, &/or artists to partner on the project. Working with the arts organizations whom we select & who self select for interest in the project, we will partner with schools walking distance from the arts organization. If a STEAM or VAPA school is in the vicinity, we will approach those schools first. Together with the artists, we will network in the community by attending meetings/gatherings, connecting with parent groups at the school, & building relationships with educators. We will talk with teachers about style, grade level, standards, & curriculum. The educator & artist will design a project that works for the school semester – from a performance art piece or collaborative sculpture, to more traditional printmaking, claywork, or mural, to a final exhibition for the current programming. This process will take 2 to 3 intensive months of relationship building, aiming to launch the residency at the start. LAND will act as a liaison & support for the artist. The program also includes visits to the art space, led by a museum educator who LAND will contract with for the art space & to provide mentorship to the artists-in-residence.
 
 On the website, LAND will work with Matt Murphy Design and Athletics— experienced in creating multi-function platforms—to design a site integrating neighborhood mapping & a complementary event RSS that sorts by current location & date, expanding out from your location to adjacent addresses & then further out. The events will include everything from poetry readings, to art exhibits, to comedy or a small concert, work of art, or whatever is nearby. Other options might include smart phone enabled check-ins. This website will be a resource for all—including educators who might see something that relates to a lesson or upcoming event that serves as a resource to their classrooms—in more deeply connecting with their neighborhood, with a special focus on family arts programs. The pilot projects at schools will be documented that they continue to live on as inspirational examples for educators. A blog for participating teachers & artists will be included as a supplement to the page, with photos. A final page with volunteer contributions and experiences, will be maintained by LAND.","At the root of Arts LANDed is generating/promoting creation and artistic sustainability by educating the next generation. The program will informally and formally link LA’s significant creative production to schools and educators interested in further developing and integrating arts into their curriculum on a neighborhood level as a part of everyday life. 
 
 The project will connect volunteer and paid artists more deeply with their neighborhoods with the artist-in-residence school program; connect students with benefits of art education; connect teachers with practical, supportive resources for integrating the arts into their curriculum both online and in-person; and connect neighbors with informal arts participation, creation, and enjoyment opportunities in their neighborhoods.
 
 Strong neighborhood connections are the building blocks of vast Los Angeles County. A key characteristic of the overall project is its location-specificity, opening doors and creating linkages for neighbors of different generations or cultural/social backgrounds to connect with one another through enjoying the arts in the neighborhood where they live. It challenges artists to take their studio practices out of the studio and into the community in neighborhoods where they are already present.
 
 This type of creative collective social cohesion supports community well-being as well as individual well-being. In some Los Angeles neighborhoods, communities live side by side with one another but do not frequent the same places. The idea behind this project is to model art for the next generation as inclusive and welcoming – a place for them to be. As well, it is in growing connections around a common goal as neighbors.","LAND’s continued vision is to help create and foster a multi-platform connectivity within Los Angeles and beyond, ultimately creating an international web linking institutions, artists, and cities. Arts LANDed will create this in literal form in an online platform, and expand our reach into an educational program connecting students, teachers, artists, and neighborhoods together, benefitting these specific groups and the general public. 
 
 Students will benefit from high-quality arts education in their public schools, integrating this into their standard curriculum and allowing for a creative outlet. Students will be able to interact with a professional artist directly to be exposed to how an artist’s process works, while also being able to contribute to the artist’s ongoing projects as they bring this work into the classroom. Students may not encounter and experience contemporary art in other ways besides this program, and some that may not be able to afford the admission to a museum are able to access contemporary art as it is incorporated into their curriculum. 
 
 Teachers will benefit from having an artist-in-residence as they will have support from a professional artist to provide arts lessons and support in the often overcrowded public school classrooms. Teachers will work directly with the artists to determine appropriate assignments and activities based on the students’ needs and interests. 
 
 Artists living and working in Los Angeles County will benefit from this program and resource as their time will be compensated and this is critical to assist them in being able to provide for themselves as working artists. Expanding their practices to the classroom setting will create new environments for creativity and artistic production. As many artists become teachers to supplements their income, this program will be an excellent tool for those transitioning into the education field. 
 
 All of the aforementioned groups are culturally diverse and range in age, and each will benefit from the Arts LANDed program and website. The general public will benefit from this comprehensive resource of the current art activity throughout Los Angeles County, functioning as an educational tool, connecting link between artists and schools, and a resource for all art happenings.","As LAND does not have a permanent exhibition space, we approach all projects and programs as collaborations. LAND will partner with Los Angeles-based arts organizations to include them in Arts LANDed, by integrating their current exhibitions and programming onto the website, and offering the resources to be involved in the education program, particularly as it relates to upcoming exhibitions or with artists that live/work nearby. In the past we have partnered with institutions including MOCA, The Getty, LACMA, the Hammer Museum, MOLAA, and the MAK Center to engage a large and diverse public audience at multiple sites throughout Los Angeles. We would approach institutions such as these, along with smaller organizations as well, to be involved in the project, offering students access to the highest caliber institutions in Los Angeles. These programming partners are not confirmed at this stage in the project, but given our past relationships, we feel confident that they would be interested in taking part in this program. We would also approach other colleagues and organizations we have not yet had the chance to work with and would be thrilled to do so, such as The Mistake Room, LACE, LA><ART, and 18th Street Art Center. 
 
 LAND’s website designer, Matt Murphy Design and Athletics, designed LAND’s current website, and is a confirmed partner. Athletics has been working on developing the programming for similar aggregate websites, and would design and implement the full website, from design to code to maintenance and updating. Athletics has already begun to set up the wireframe for the website, and is committed to creating a user-friendly, highly functional website and app. 
 
 LAND has not yet collaborated with LAUSD and is very excited about the prospect of doing so. This collaboration is not confirmed, though we feel that the STEAM approach to teaching, where the arts are built in to lessons, shaping connections between concepts and encouraging students to think creatively, would allow for integration of this program seamlessly. STEAM schools would be part of this pilot program, and thereafter, we would expand to other LAUSD schools. 
 
 Three factors that are critical to the success of these collaborations are: 1.Institution’s willingness to participate in the program, in addition to other educational programs in place 2. Athletics’ ability to aggregate all relevant arts listings 3. LAUSD’s openness to integrating this program into existing curricula",

Through our Healthy Neighborhood Market Network, we connect LA’s multi-ethnic, multi-lingual neighborhood market owners to food industry experts, government reps and community advocates who share skills, resources and mentorship. Our cross-discipline trainings combine business development, civic leadership and health and nutrition fields.","Our goal is to train 100 neighborhood markets and entrepreneurs across Los Angeles County within 12 months as good food business leaders. By reaching this number of businesses, we aim to support new leadership in the movement to ensure all communities have access to Good Food!
 
 As we do every year, we will offer three major trainings for neighborhood markets and food entrepreneurs, one conducted in Korean, one in Spanish and a large multi-lingual gathering called “Healthy Foods, Healthy Businesses.” This year, we are excited to unveil our complete multi-discipline curriculum which is specifically designed for neighborhood retailers and entrepreneurs serving low-income communities in Los Angeles. The seminars help businesses achieve “triple-bottom” line impacts, helping them grow their business, sell a healthier product and better serve the community. 
 
 The curriculum is taught by the LA Food Policy Council’s diverse network of industry, government and non-profit professionals who bring decades of experience in food retail, wholesale, distribution, public health and community development. Topics covered include marketing, merchandising, store design, procurement and vendor relationships, profitability of fresh food, financing, store upgrades, health, nutrition and community partnerships. Participants walk out with an action plan for their new healthy business and tons of new contacts to help them along the way. 
 
 Seminars are held in South Los Angeles, Boyle Heights or Mid-City, where there is a high concentration of neighborhood markets and the greatest need for more healthy food options. This year, we are excited to hold our first-ever “train the trainers” event for healthy neighborhood market owners who are ready to share what they have learned with their peers. We believe in the leadership and experiential know-how of small business owners and have seen that peer-to-peer learning makes a huge impact. 
 
 How do we reach neighborhood market owners and food entrepreneurs? To date, we have touched over 400 small food businesses in “food desert” neighborhoods by putting our boots on the ground and reaching out. Every year, our multi-lingual (Korean and Spanish speaking) staff spend countless hours walking the block and visiting store owners across LA to learn about their business needs and connect them to resources. We also circulate newsletters and radio advertisements and partner directly with business associations. We’re ready to grow the Network!","Growing Good Food businesses where they’re needed most! Did you know that almost 90% of grocery retail stores in South LA and Boyle Heights are small neighborhood markets? Did you also know that millions of dollars leave these neighborhoods every year in grocery sales made elsewhere? Imagine if ALL neighborhood markets offered wholesome grocery foods? Our strategy is to invest in existing businesses to help them expand healthy food options and keep money in the neighborhood! Within 1 year, at least half of our storeowner participants (50 stores!) will carry fruits and vegetables. That translates to about 100,000 residents with new and improved access to healthy food right in their neighborhoods.
 
 Creating community at the neighborhood market. Mom n’ pop markets already act as community hubs in many neighborhoods, where locals share tips and friendly chisme while picking up their daily goods. How can we take that kind of neighborhood connectivity to the next level? Our project facilitates partnerships between markets and their local neighborhood institutions like schools, clinics, libraries, churches and neighborhood councils to unite together as “Good Food Neighbors.” That means they’ve pledged to spread the word about the good eats now available at their local corner store. The store becomes the site of healthy cooking demos, smoothie sampling and health consultations. Working together, market owners and their neighbors create a safe, clean, community-serving space. It’s a “win-win!”
 
 Lifting up the leadership of neighborhood markets for Good Food. We believe that in order to create a Good Food system in LA, we need to invest in the leadership of those who have been historically disenfranchised. Neighborhood markets in LA are mostly Korean, Latino or African-American family-run businesses. Many are immigrants or first-generation, with limited formal education. We’ve found that they have a TON of great ideas about improving their communities. Through public speaking, media and peer teaching, the Healthy Neighborhood Market Network is a forum for store owners to participate in civic and policy discussions on what can create economically just, vibrant and healthy communities.
 
 In LA 2050, we see diverse neighborhood market owners CONNECTED to fellow food businesses, neighborhood leaders, government reps and each other in mutually beneficial ways that improve the health of communities through good food, local business and increased civic participation.","• Low-income food entrepreneurs. Healthy Neighborhood Market Network participants leave our trainings with a business plan to integrate new healthy food products successfully. With new Network connections and LAFPC staff by their side, storeowners will have support to implement their dreams. We expect many store owners to see an increase in customers, sales and community support. These neighborhood markets gain access to Good Food resources from marketing and merchandising to leadership skills building and community outreach. Many will pursue new partnerships and capital investments that will benefit their businesses.
 
 • Residents in neighborhoods with limited healthy food choices. Residents benefit from expanded choices for places to buy fresh fruits, vegetables and other wholesome food products. By making the “healthy choice the easy choice,” residents’ prospects for improved diet and health go up. This is especially great for young people, the elderly and transit-dependent, who rely more on nearby-by neighborhood markets for food. Hopefully, over time, this will lead to a decrease in diet-related health challenges like diabetes and obesity, which impact low-income communities of color disproportionately. 
 Also, new connections between store owners and community can generate mutual growth opportunities. In one case, a team of high school students partnered with their local merchant to survey youth on their interest in healthy food, create marketing materials, and plan a block party for the “grand re-opening” of the store as a healthy market. In turn, the store owner acted as a mentor and hosted two students as interns.
 
 • The neighborhoods. When retail businesses invest in their stores, the whole neighborhood benefits. Revitalized food retail improves commercial corridors, creates destinations and strengthens neighborhood identity. As neighborhood markets become active community hubs for sharing health resources, this also means safer, more walkable and connected neighborhoods. It’s a way to invest in low-income neighborhoods while mitigating displacement, since local businesses are more likely to employ and spend their money locally. We target the trainings and services to store owners in historically disinvested neighborhoods with limited healthy food options. Most Healthy Neighborhood Market Network storeowners hail from South Los Angeles, Boyle Heights, East Los Angeles, Mid-City and Koreatown, East Hollywood and Northeast San Fernando Valley.","The heart of the Healthy Neighborhood Market Network is collaboration! The whole idea to bring business and leadership education to neighborhood food businesses came from partners in the LA Food Policy Council Working Group on Healthy Food Retail & Food Equity, which includes friends from non-profits like Community Health Councils, PolicyLink, Community Coalition, Business Resource Group, and API Obesity Prevention Alliance. We have also benefited immensely by collaborating with industry pros who have dedicated their time and skills to support mom n’ pop stores. Here are some of the individuals who have shared their talents for this project as trainers and content experts: Michael Powell (brand strategist, Shook Kelley), David Kaufman (Manager, Unified Grocers), Bryan Libit (architect), Barnaby Montgomery (CEO, Yummy.com Markets), Sharon Evans (CEO, Business Resource Group), Daniel Tellalian (Principal, Emerging Markets inc/CA FreshWorks Fund), Jill Overdorf (Executive Chef, Cooseman Shipping International), Rudy Espinoza (Executive Director, Leadership for urban Renewal Network (LURN)), Jeff Biddle and Ashley Gibbons (Whole Foods Market), Michelle O’Grady (Team Friday), Sirena Pellarollo (Viva la Vida Holistic Health), Helena Jubany and Robert Chavez (Founder and General Manager, Fresco Community Market.) We also always partner with a variety of community development finance organizations and local government agencies who provide direct services for small stores, including Pacific Asian Consortium in Employment (PACE), Vermont Slauson Community Development Corporation, Valley Economic Development Corporation, Kiva Zip and the wonderful staff at the LA County Department of Public Health. We have worked with all of these awesome individuals and organizations over the past 3 years, and they will continue to be valued and essential partners in the success of the Healthy Neighborhood Market Network. 
 
 Three factors that are critical to our collaborations: (1) Passion for food equity: the idea that all communities deserve access to fresh, affordable food (2) A shared belief that we need to reach across silos in order to make long-lasting change. We need diverse talents, expertise and perspectives to get the kind of food system change we all hope for, and (3) The demonstrated success of the “collective impact” model: all our powers combined will ensure equitable opportunities for education and well-being in the future.",
4102134,Los Angeles Review of Books,To continue to build the infrastructure supporting LA's creative economy with a weekly radio program and free print tabloid.,Create,2016139,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050create/projects/LARB.html,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,LA County; California; the US; the world.,"With the help of this LA2050 grant, we hope to distribute our free tabloid magazine to all of Los Angeles & produce a weekly half hour radio show.
 
 LA-based & LA-focused, LARB is the communal product of many hands & minds. We produce a main website (lareviewofbooks.org), updated 3 to 5 times a day with essays, reviews, & interviews, short videos, & streaming & downloadable podcasts. We also produce a quarterly journal of original content; a series of LARB Channels—associated websites sharing our mission; an intensive summer internship/educational experience; a series of live events featuring significant writers, musicians, scientists, scholars, & film & TV makers.
 
 Our tabloid magazine, published on recycled newsprint here in LA, is the size of an alternative weekly. The content ranges from fun, quick interviews with writers, artists, musicians, & filmmakers to longform literary essays to short stories & poetry by the best writers in the city, established & emerging, to features & news. We have published a number of editions for our members & have experimented with dropping at a hundred locations around the city. At small print runs of a few thousand, they were gone in an hour, to great reviews. In order to expand the literary conversation across the city’s many communities, we propose printing 20,000 copies of the tabloid each month & delivering it to 500 drops around the city & the county. We plan to build the advertising base for the tabloid over the year so that we can sustain it & make it grow.
 
 We also have begun to plan & produce a weekly half-hour radio program, with the same aim. The LARB Radio Half Hour is design to be a very new kind of book show, something that has not been done before. We have commitments from Adrian Todd Zuniga (Literary Death Match), Seth Greenland (Big Love), Maria Bustillos (journalist), Steph Cha (noir novelist), Michelle Huneven (novelist), Reza Aslan (writer), Juan Felipe Herrera (poet), & many others. The show is a variety show (rather than purely interview-based, like most books shows), & is designed to be fun as well as serious, entertaining as well as enlightening. The idea is to use this year, with the help of the LA2050 grant, to hone our format & performance, & then to continue to support it by syndicating the show nationally.
 
 The result will be an invigorated civic discourse, as the varied content of the tabloid & the radio show make their way into the daily lives of people in all parts of the city.","LARB helps make LA the best place to create by (1) fostering the community from which that creativity springs, by (2) providing an ongoing conversation about what creativity means, & (3) by publicizing the results of that creativity.
 
 Arts criticism is an integral part of any balanced artistic ecology. Art doesn’t happen in a vacuum, it happens in the context of the conversations engaging viewers, audiences, & participants, conversations that are always part of any successful art world.
 
 Since everyone can now be a desktop publisher, recording artist, or film producer, criticism & conversation become even more important. The late 1970s saw some 50,000 titles published a year; now there are over three million. So more than ever criticism is necessary to help art find its audience. It is true that we have crowd sources—the web has made a torrent of information available, & a torrent of opinion, too. But on amazon or Rotten Tomatoes, many still trust the ‘editorial reviews,’ & for good reason—expertise is a real thing; curated content is a gift an editorial group can give its audience. 
 
 It is also a gift that is given to writers & artists, because the art & writing that we discuss is what our hundreds of thousands of readers learn about, pay attention to, & are more likely to purchase. This isn’t just shopping advice, though—intelligent, engaged conversation about culture is something people crave, as our worldwide success on the web has proven. In an information- & opinion-saturated world, the kind of considered, well-argued, fact-checked, vetted, & proofread work the LARB community produces is of greater value than ever.
 
 And that conversation then becomes the context in which new creative work happens. Major television producers have given our articles to their writing staffs to read—we sometimes have that direct an impact. But usually it is indirect: art happens within a conversation, & the better the conversation, often, the better the art, & the better the art is known.
 
 In 2050, LARB will have evolved in myriad ways, but LARB will still be a platform for the smartest, best conversation around, with an ongoing impact on the full range of the arts, across an even wider set of audiences. We will have continued to embrace new technologies, & our global impact will help ensure that LA can nurture and sustain its creative community.","We work hard to bring the worlds of books, academia, film & television, the arts, & the common reader together, with a series of interlocking goals: to expand the breadth & depth of cultural discussion, give a wider part of the community access to arts criticism & literary production, increase cultural engagement, increase employment in creative industries, keep creative talent remain in the city, & increase the national and global ""soft power"" of the full breadth of LA's creative class.
 
 But we especially benefit writers and readers. The world has come to recognize LA’s preeminence in music, film, television, fine art, and opera. But New York continues to exercise hegemony over publishing and the literary conversation, something that has irked Western writers for a century. LARB is an important corrective, and by making LA a recognized center of literary excellence, helps all writers who call it home.
 
 It also benefits writers in material ways—for writers (& artists of other kinds) who are discussed, it provides exposure not just in Los Angeles, but around the world; LARB has millions of different readers each year, readers in all 50 states & in 150 countries around the world, more than all but two or three similar outlets in the world.
 
 The project benefits readers, of course, as a forum for lifelong learning, & in the way mentioned above. Unlike the stuffier culture reviews, we aren’t afraid to have a little fun, we aren’t averse to disagreement, we love pop culture as well as high culture, we’re interested in primetime TV as much as neuroscience, in graphic & classic & experimental novels, in YA & SF & noir & the other outré genres. We represent Los Angeles, or perhaps it is more true that we help LA represent itself. This, as discussed above, in turn helps foster creative work in many ways, & encourages its consumption.
 
 It benefits students and teachers at our local institutions of higher education by giving them access to a global forum for their work, and in fostering conversations across disciplines and across town.
 
 So far, we have spread through academic circles, & through the wealthier neighborhoods in LA. These new projects bring LARB to a wider, broader, more diverse set of communities, where we will also recruit new writers and contributors, & have these new communities bring their LA to LARB, & thereby to the rest of the city and the world.","LARB has brought the best known & most established figures on the LA cultural scene together with emerging writers, thinkers, & practitioners in the fields of literature, art, music, politics, & cultural studies in pursuing an active conversation with readers all over the city, the county, the state, & beyond.
 
 For the radio show we are partnering with KPFK, which has confirmed our day and time slot, and their help as engineers. Our editor in chief has worked with KPFK several times in the past. For us, KPFK brings expertise and broadcast capacity and some audience. For KPFK, LARB brings additional audience and superb content.
 
 The three factors critical to our success are the (1) the efficient use of KPFK's resources on LARB's part, (2) the marketing efforts of both entities, and (3) making the show available for podcasting, the audience for which may end up being larger than the broadcast audience.
 
 We have partnered in the past (and in most cases are still partnered with) many organizations. The following websites are now LARB Channels: Boom, Avidly, Marginalia, Swink, The Philosopher's Plant, and The Levatine Review. We have also partnered with KCRW, KPCC, the Library Foundation, UC Riverside, USC, PEN USA, CalArts, SoHo House, Skylight Books, Tia Chucho Centro Cultural, and the Los Angeles Institute for the Humanities, as well as with a number of other literary and arts magazines, including LA Magazine, The American Reader, n+1, Flaunt, The New Inquiry, Slake, Black Clock, Triple Canopy, and others.",1,
4102146,Milk + Bookies: Bringing Service Learning and Books to LA Youth,M+B will implement its service learning program in Los Angeles classrooms while increasing access to books for underprivileged children.,Learn,2016148,2014,,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,"In conjunction with the Mayor's office, we will select 1,000 Los Angeles classrooms to implement our pilot program for the 2014-2015 school year. M+B will provide these Los Angeles classrooms with a comprehensive instructional outline of our service learning project. Each aspect of our project is designed to make it easy for the teachers and fun for the students. Before the teachers present this service learning project to their classrooms, M+B will lead an assembly at the schools explaining the program in detail. We will supply each teacher with all of the products and tools needed to implement the project and help distribute the books collected from the students to local in-need recipients. M+B will provide a small reserve of books in each classroom for children who are unable to donate a book on their own. It is just as important to experience giving so we want to make sure that all children have this opportunity.
 After the program takes place, M+B will stay involved with organizing transport of the books from the schools to the local children in need.","The sustainability of a literate society largely depends on the accessibility of books (Education Insider).""Getting books into the homes of children is what's important,""(Celia Yusem, LAUSD teacher of 40 years). There are books in the school libraries but students who read at home are better, more efficient readers and have higher math scores according to the National Education Association. Having books in the home is important for children to master literacy skills. Additionally, according to the National Service Learning Clearinghouse, exposing children to service learning increases acceptance of diversity, development of ethics, development of caring, and other social emotional learning. Bringing the Milk+Bookies service learning project to Los Angeles schools will give all students important skills in life that will foster Los Angeles children to feel empowered, equip them with the basic skills needed for academic challenges and encourage them to be socially-minded citizens.","Our project will benefit children, teachers, schools and ultimately Los Angeles.
  
 By exposing children to how great giving feels, they will want to do it again and again. With a purposeful format to impact each child, we aim to make a real imprint on their lives and watch as they set out to recreate that “do good” feeling.
 
 With this grant, 1,000 classrooms - approximately 30,000 children - will be impacted by our program. More than 30,000 books will be distributed to at-risk, in-need children. The byproduct of our organization's mission is getting underprivileged children age appropriate books to help them with literacy, help them dream bigger and help them feel inspired.
 
 Los Angeles teachers and schools will also benefit because we have the resources and materials ready for them. Their service learning project comes ready-made and will be distributed without any extra time and energy on their end. With all of the budget shortfalls, there is no extra time or money for classrooms to supply the children with all of these materials let alone carry out steps for finding recipients and helping organize distribution.","It has been M+B's dream to share our service learning project with LAUSD's third grade classrooms. We have had the OPPORTUNITY to work with many other classrooms both in LA and nationwide and see the successful outcomes. We will focus all of our efforts on Los Angeles and double the amount of children being able to give and get.
 
 We have had the opportunity to explain our project to the Mayor's office and discuss our program. We have spoken with LAUSD teachers and know that there is a NEED FOR SERVICE LEARNING PROJECTS that are not time consuming for them. Everything will be in place for the classrooms including supplies, teacher outlines and lesson plans, and volunteers and recipients.
 
 Having the opportunity for EVALUATION within the schools and classrooms is another key factor to determine the success of the collaboration. We will collect as many surveys and information as possible from the children and the teachers after their ""book raisers.""",0,

 We want to take the next steps to launch La Paletera on a manageable scale to be in full operation by summer 2015 as we have venue commitments to sell our paletas. We will be unfolding the project by dividing up the process in 4 quarters of a calendar year:
 
 First Quarter: Administrative and planning 
 
 • Research, order and purchase needed equipment for commissary 
  and paleta production and storage (paleta machine we have 
  identified makes 8,000 paletas an hour)
 
 • Identify a space to set up the paleta-making
  operation/commissary between 2500-3500 sq ft in economically 
  depressed area
 
 • Engage County Department of Public Health and Environmental 
  Health 
 
 • Outreach to community to identify first candidates for La 
  Paletera-10 total
 
 • Develop needed manuals, policies and procedures
 
 • Purchase & design 4 tricycle vending carts
 
 • Create design for vending carts
 
 • Acquire mandatory licenses & certifications
 
 • Negotiate, prepare and finalize agreement with partners
 
 • Secure insurance
 
 Second Quarter: Setting up the commissary and settling-in
 
 • Rent space and prepare for move-in
 
 • Select Paleteras
 
 • Develop training and training materials
 
 Third Quarter: 
 
 • Training Paleteras and making paletas
 
 Fourth Quarter: 
 
 • Sell paletas in designated venues","MDLT is poised to launch LA Paletera de Los Angeles in the summer of 2015, a social micro-enterprise spinning off the rich food diversity found all over neighborhoods in Los Angeles. LA Paletera aims to reclaim a Mexican tradition of healthy and nutritious food offerings in the form of frozen fruit bars and natural fruit flavored waters. The model provides a creative entrepreneurial platform for women to develop healthy paleta and agua fresca recipes by drawing from their culinary repertoires brought from their hometowns in Latin America and incorporate knowledge of the best health food trends in Los Angeles. The idea is to encourage women to innovate by intersecting the traditional with the new and create recipes that contain high nutritional values that pack a solid dose of vitamins and minerals in one serving. 
 
 This is a win-win situation for residents in LA now and by 2050. LA Paletera hopes to have added the word paleta and agua fresca to the English lexicon just like taco and guacamole has become part of every day speak in the city! Angelenos from all walks of life will have an opportunity to experience the exotic flavors of fruit and vegetables found in Latin American. Angelenos will roll words off their tongues like tamarindo, horchata, mamey, flor de calabaza, nopal, guanabana, nance. More importantly by 2050 Angelenos will understand the nutritional value and cultural significance of all these fruits and vegetables and have an appreciation for the delicacies that make up the paletas and aguas frescas they are consuming. And as it is with any type of food, the crosspollination of ingredients from across the continent will be symbol of how all our cultures cross paths in all over LA County. 
 
 Another exciting community involvement feature that La Paletera will promote is to seek the participation of LA residents to help create flavor combinations that are unique to the surrounding communities, flavors that are associated to the particular neighborhood they live/work/play in. For example, a paleta de elote –corn paleta- will reference the Cornfield, which is the historical name of the Los Angeles Historic Park. Local sports teams and other community groups will be invited to partake in the fun by offering sponsorship opportunities for organizations to name a paleta after their favorite team or a community organization they support. The possibilities for engaging the participation and creativity across town are endless!","LA Paletera de Los Angeles will benefit Angelenos across LA County as our vision is to expand LA Paletera throughout the city, because after all, who doesn’t like frozen treats in LA year round?! By 2050, our solar powered bicycle-propelled carts will offer an array of healthy treats around city streets in Central, East and South LA as well as the San Gabriel and San Fernando Valley’s, the South Bay and last but not least the Westside. 
 
 The goal of LA Paletera is to promote fun and creative ways to help Angelenos visualize and practice the circular connection between healthy eating habits and environmentally friendly practices and show how the synergy of these actions catapults a harmonious environment for the communities we live in. Our paleta and aguas frescas marketing campaigns will be all about taking care of our health, of one another, the communities we live in, and La Madre Tierra! 
 
 By 2050, Angelenos young and old will have a very clear understanding of the importance of being loyal customers to LA Paletera’s healthy product offerings. Residents of the county, by then, will know that their money supports a social micro-enterprise venture owned by women who have made their aspirations and dreams a reality by owning and successfully operating their own micro-enterprise. Women and their families from low-income neighborhoods in Los Angeles will be the primary beneficiaries of the LA Paletera project as they will reap the financial benefits accrued through the business. Angelenos in general will benefit as they can always count on LA Paletera cruising the streets of LA offering paletas and aguas frescas that are good for the health and the soul!","We have learned that our work is enhanced and strengthened when we engage and involve other non-profits, community organizations, neighborhood groups, community stakeholders and leaders. This effort will be no different. We have been talking about La Paletera for over 2 years and have worked and will continue to partner with:

 • Los Angeles River Corporation
 • East Los Angeles Community Corporation
 • Exposition Center
 • Supervisor Mark Ridley Thomas’ Office
 • California State Parks
 • Local Neighborhood Councils
 • National Park Service
 • Mountains and Recreation Conservation Authority
 • Los Angeles Trade Technical College
 • County Department of Public Health
 • Baldwin Hills Conservancy and
 • City of Culver City
 • Mexican Consulate

First we will re-engage the Friends of the Nature Parkway made up of community groups, organizations, businesses, students and residents who were instrumental in establishing the Nature Parkway and still are involved in maintaining the urban trail. The first phase of community dialogue events will inform the local community about how to get involved with revitalizing their sidewalk spaces into safe urban trails. Surveys will be collected to inform us the extent of current sidewalk space utilization. 
 Through a community involved assessment, the pre-selected sidewalks connecting to the existing Nature Parkway, will identify the type of beautification resources needed for each block. Whether it is planning more native plants, covering areas with decomposed granite or cleaning the current landscape, a log of needs will inform the beautification plan. The main project leaders will be responsible for acquiring all necessary permits. A partial allocation of awarded funds will be used to offer light food and refreshments to community members who are involved the process. Informational signage for the type of plants used will be designed and installed. The signs will look similar to what is seen in local city and state parks. The result will be a detailed list of the number of tools and other resources to revitalize sidewalks into complete urban trails. 
 Our ongoing contributors and LA 2050 funding will make gathering all of the resources required possible to complete the beautification phases. We will outreach to local surrounding businesses to attain the right tools to complete the Nature Parkway project. Community events that provide connections to community resources, free delicious healthy food, hydration stations and fun will create a public space for community members to unite for a common cause. These events will be open to all community residents and businesses that have a stake in this community investment. We will outreach to nearby schools, community organizations and other members using social media outlets. Groups will be made up of folks who either want to plant, remove debris, or install signage along the Nature Parkway. These volunteers will be made up of original and new Friends of the Nature Parkway. Our relationship and increased engagement will be made possible by facilitating continuous communication in a public sphere.","Historically the East San Fernando Valley experienced racial segregation and continuous resource disparities which negatively affected the built environment and health of its residents. In one of the target neighborhoods, Pacoima, residents experience some of the highest rates of obesity (17%) and asthma (20%.) Our neighborhoods are park poor (54 acres) and decades of unregulated business activity attributed to increased levels of toxicity. Specifically, this project’s safe urban trails will bring together Pacoima, Arleta and Mission Hills through safe walkable sidewalks. Stakeholders will have an aesthetic drought resistant landscaped path that is long term self-sustaining, uses minimal water, while restoring the user’s health and balancing the eco-system. Urban trail maps will help all visitors and locals to recognize and use the revitalized environment which helps to make them feel safer, healthier and better connected to the services and goods they require. Together we will put more eyes on the street and leave the car in the garage. 
 Community stewardship will form a sense of ownership for the project because the sidewalk will be restored by every one of us. Those who partake in the planting will be able to adopt the plant and secure its longevity. Children and adults alike will be establishing roots in our community. A powerful method to bring along change in our community is to offer opportunities for education and hands on experience. The main group of organizers will produce a revitalization plan that has minimal maintenance while mimicking natural systems to create beautiful living spaces that nourish people and celebrate nature. 
 The project will also be a place to learn how to maintain a clean and healthy environment as well as establishing a more active lifestyle. Informational signage will be installed, similar to what is seen in local city and state parks. Mile markers along the path will help the user track their distance in the hopes that they reach their fitness goals. The user will be informed on how the habitat enhances not only their well-being but also that of the native animals. Local schools will now have an accessible native plant path enabling hands on learning. Children will become health champions. Minimizing our carbon footprint by being on foot or bicycle can increase mobility, put more eyes on the street, increase community stewardship and stimulate local business activity.","The project will benefit the densely populated communities living in close proximity to four connected streets (Devonshire St., Canterbury Ave., Van Nuys Blvd., and San Fernando Rd.) , approximately a 7 mile distance. All stakeholders ranging from households, to educators, to business owners will benefit. When residents feel safe to walk in their neighborhoods instead of jumping into their car, residents will re-familiarize themselves with the type of pedestrian friendly culture they or their older relatives’ experience before coming to this country. 
 From an early age small children will grow up knowing walking up and down urban trails is the thing to do. This opportunity will secure them with the safety they need to grow stronger. Playing outside and discovering the animals that use the urban trail as their habitat can be a game of show and tell for parent and child. The expanded tree canopy coverage would be ideal for parents to push strollers and for seniors to increase mobility. Parents can feel secure to let their children off the stroller since the extra green foliage will act as a buffer between them and the street.
 For school children to be part of a LA2050 initiative that makes their own LA neighborhood a better place to live will make them long term community stewards for a better well-being. Walking to and from school can be their new norm. Along the trail exists three schools with approximately 3300 students cumulatively and one highly used park. The urban trails will better connect them to their school and park of choice.
 Canterbury Avenue has a very special grove, lined with nurseries and community gardens. The urban trail will create a safe path to Arleta High School, Beachy Ave. Elementary School, Canterbury Elementary and Branford Park. An opportunity exists to bring the first farmer’s market to this area. The uptick in foot traffic and increase promotion through the urban trail map will stimulate the local economy. 
 San Fernando Road stretches over 1.5 miles for residents to walk, ride, or run. The busy street is well lit and plants are starting to grow and blossom bright floral colors. It is already highly utilized because of the number of commuter bus stops. On Van Nuys Blvd. a color explosion occurred when youth driven art mural projects started to replace graffiti. Along the pathway users have accessibility to city resources through the neighborhood City Hall offices, postal office, library, health services and restaurants.","Confirmed:

 Each of these partners share the value of revitalizing our sidewalks to increase the number of safe streets, enhance our resident’s health and improve the environment. In some form or another they all contributed resources whether they be tools, labor, expertise, promotion, labor, monetary contribution or volunteer hours to turn a blighted sidewalk into a nature parkway. Five years later they are still waiting for us to stretch the parkway into more urban trails. For this project we will have to re-ignite the conversation with all of our past partners and form new partnerships.
 The three main factors which are critical to our success are leadership, communication and teamwork. The Nature Parkway’s project manager will help make it possible to extend urban trails because of her leadership ability to pay attention to detail without undermining the biggest asset which are the partners and residents. She will help us get the right team members to the decision making table. Communication will be key, since no formal group already exists to carry on the work. Continuous communication will help keep all informed in the project’s process. Lastly teamwork is necessary to understand what is going well and what needs to be ameliorated. Volunteers including experts who donate services will be engaged by the opportunity to self-identify their role and execute the right action leading towards the main goal.",1,

4102203,Happy kids Healthy Families for a Better LA: bringing mental health into families homes.,Impact the health culture of children in license-exempt child care environments by engaging caregivers with an authentic learning experience,Live,2016204,2014,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,LA County,"This authentic learning experience for license-exempt caregivers will address health and wellness topics such as Breastfeeding, Food and Drink, Physical Activity, Screen time and Valuable Community Resources. 
 
 The learning experience will:
 • not use a powerpoint to teach the curriculum • utilize a format similar to a “mommy and me” class enabling the caregiver to bring the children to the class • perceived as a fun activity instead of a professional development course or training • have hands on elements making it easier for the caregiver to implement with the children at home • designed for the median education obtained by the caregiver • designed to address multi-cultural barriers to a healthy culture • be in a time-frame that is feasible for this demographic • address the varying ages of children that will attend the class with caregiver, and • be in a setting that is easy to access. 
 
 According to the First 5 LA report “Families, Friends and Neighbors” there are approximately “590,000 children under age 12 [that] receive care in license exempt settings throughout L.A. County.” After speaking with representatives from the Choose Health LA Child Care project, we learned this is a key demographic the project is trying to engage and has found that license-exempt participation is a challenge. 
 
 The challenge is not because these providers “can’t be found.” The challenge is messaging and offering an opportunity to learn about nutrition and physical activity in a format that appeals to the license-exempt child care provider. 
 
 Project Phases:
 
 Phases: 1) establishing working partnerships with LA County Child Care Resource and Referral agencies and local businesses to assist with outreach, 2) Recruiting - RFP for curriculum, seek coaching volunteers and RFP for Train theTrainer, and secure meeting spaces 3) begin creation and distribution of materials via email/sms, snail mail and local businesses, 4) establish class schedule and open registration, 5) securing supplemental materials for classes, 6) creating pre/post evaluations, 7) give 2 ""test"" classes to invited community members and license-exempt caregivers and assess the feedback - change things if necessary, 8) start classes, 9) ongoing evaluation process.","Addressing the childhood obesity epidemic, a disease which fuels other chronic conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease, is an essential element to a healthy LA. By addressing the health culture of children, we effectively address the health culture of our future, in 2050, as the children positively impacted by the education of the caregivers in 2014, take with them the healthy habits established for their lifetime.
 
 Our project addresses the LA2050 obesity metric by educating license-exempt caregivers who, if they take home, one element of the training and use it, will be creating a healthier present and future for themselves, their families and the children of LA’s future.
 Another metric addressed is lack of access to parkland for Los Angles County children which then compounds the problem of access to physical activity. Our project will provide physical activity ideas and alternatives to parkland so as another LA2050 grantee works on furnishing LA County with more parks for outside recreation and physical activity, children can get moving now. Children understanding how to get physical in all types of spaces will be better off in their future as LA2050 residents as well.
 
 Our project will effectively reduce childhood obesity through education of child caregivers who don’t typically get information and training materials or adhere to regulations, even the minimal ones that licensing requires.","This project will benefit:
 
 License-exempt caregivers by providing them with an educational environment that works for them. They will not only learn about providing a healthy culture for the children in their care but will understand why and how to do it, motivating them to carry out at least one new thing learned in one category at home.
 
 Children by educating their caregivers about breastfeeding, food and drinks, physical activity and screen time who are not typically exposed to informational material or in educational experiences tailored to their needs. Children who are cared for by the providers who attend this authentic training will have a better chance of establishing healthy habits to reduce childhood obesity than those who are in the care of license exempt caregivers who have not had the opportunity to participate in the educational experience.
 
 Also, as caregivers bring their children to the “mommy and me” formatted class, the older children will have an opportunity to learn and ask questions which then gives them an opportunity to be an active participant in the health culture of their caregivers environment as well as take it home with them to share with parents.
 
 Parents, as caregivers extend the education opportunity to them. Providers will be encouraged to engage parents in what they learned as they distribute ready-made information from the class as well as simple discussion with the parents about good nutrition, physical activity and the importance of limited screen time.","We do not have confirmation but these are the organizations with which we hope to engage as collaborators.
 
 Child Care Resource and Referral Agencies
 
 We hope to collaborate with the partners of Choose Health LA Child Care. Choose Health LA Child Care is a program funded by First 5 LA and administered through the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. The Child Care Alliance is coordinating the Choose Health LA Child Care Project due to their long standing relationship with child care providers across the County and expertise in the child care field. We have had conversations about collaboration but could not determine a scope of work that could be committed to prior to submission of the proposal.
 
 In addition to Child Care Alliance of Los Angeles, we would hope to collaborate all LA County Child Care Resource and Referral Agencies as they, too, have relationships with the child care field. The agencies are: Child Care Resource and Referral, Children’s Home Society of California, Connections for Children, Crystal Stairs, Mexican American Opportunity Foundation, Options, Pathways and Pomona Unified School District.
 
 Potentially partnering with these R&R organizations would bring with them:
 • The connections to the license-exempt providers receiving child care subsidies.
 • Expertise regarding the license-exempt child care provider culture
 • Network of potential volunteers to execute elements of the project
 • Access to bilingual materials 
 • Knowledge of what does or does not work with the license-exempt child care providers after implementation of current curriculum
 
 3 factors critical to success of potential collaboration
 • Outreach to license-exempt child care providers
 • Assistance in establishing a network of volunteers
 • Consulting regarding the creation of new curriculum
 
 We also intend to reach out to Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) Sponsors for reaching out to license-exempt providers on their programs or seeking out volunteer coaches.",1,

We have already begun the process by engaging Kevin James in the Sanitation Department of LA City to explore locations in that region. We are reaching out to each school district, we currently work in many Title one schools to offer recycling education to students and faculty as well as offer professional development to a variety of regions for Common Core, project based learning and Next Generation Science Standards. 
 We have built three STEAM Labs to date, one in an expensive private school and two in public schools with room and very little budget. We engage the students in the design of the labs, labeling, shelving decisions and overall management of the lab is developed with the input of the students and teaching staff. Doing this in public areas would offer a broader reach to build community partners and engage the manufacturers and educators in a joint project to offer cost effective options to the creative and scientific minds in under-served populations.","We already offer this experience to those we are able to find or who find us. We don't advertise. We are busy with events and educating teachers through word of mouth. Our programs work for the students, the teachers and they have a lasting impact according to the research collected over the last year with participants.
 We have an open house on Sunday afternoons from Sept. to June where we invite the local community in Gardena to come to the warehouse and create what they are inspired to create and then take it home. There is a donation box out but there is no pressure to put anything in that box. Those who can do and those who can't take home their creation with our blessings. We would like to offer that experience to more communities.","We currently benefit the students who are on the free or reduced lunch program in schools all over this county and others. We travel to school we are invited to. Our demographic research from last year tells us:
 African-American 10%
 American Indian/Alaskan Native 1%
 Asian/Pacific Islander 6% 
 Caucasian 9%   
 Latino/Hispanic 74%
 One of our goals is the inspire more young girls to study science and engineering. The effect to date has been impressive and inspires us to continue to look for more schools to work with in more communities. We encourage family time in the warehouse. This isn't a drop off facility. Parents work with their children and families begin to work cooperatively. Friendships form around discovery and accomplishment. Failure is welcome and everyone is encouraged to fail and fail and learn from each failure the way scientists and researchers learn from their failures to inform their success. We encourage second chances for material and for people.","The three factors that are key to our success are information, letting the public know it is there for them, access, having facilities and partners who can help fill them and volunteers who will help guide the explorations without directing them.
 We currently work with Republic Services in the LAUSD Schools to offer recycling training in a fun relay program for students. We are planning to engage them further in this project to support the facilities and to advertise the program on their trucks driving all over LA County. 
 We are in talks with Kevin James at the LA Sanitation office to find locations and support in the effort to let manufacturers know about option for their waste materials and to inform the public of the opportunities. We will invite LAUSD to be part of the program also to inform the students of the opportunity to explore in the space and to volunteer in the space.
 The only group we have not yet worked with is the Sanitation Dept. and our first meeting was scheduled for the day the water pipe broke in west LA. We are rescheduled for Aug. 6th in Kevin James office.",1,
4102204,Teach For America - Los Angeles: Transforming the Young Students of Today into the Leaders of 2050,"We will recruit, train, and develop an expanding cohort of exceptional preschool teachers for under-served communities in Los Angeles.",Learn,2016209,2014,,,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,,"We are working to cultivate leaders at all levels of the education system by recruiting more teachers with demonstrated leadership abilities, maximizing their impact through better training and development, and extending their impact by supporting them as alumni. In order to achieve our mission, Teach For America – Los Angeles will:
 
 1. Recruit Outstanding and Diverse Leaders: Our nationwide recruitment model dramatically expands the talent pool of future teachers and leaders that local schools can access. We are committed to diversifying Los Angeles’ teaching force, and have dedicated efforts to increase the representation of corps members who share the racial and socioeconomic background of our students, and who come from a variety of professional backgrounds. We are diversifying the ECE landscape, with over 75% of our incoming corps members identifying as people of color. Students from low-income communities will benefit from this broadened base of exceptional talent for potential ECE corps members.
 
 2. Maximize Our Impact on Student Achievement: Our success is ultimately predicated upon our corps members’ ability to provide a solid, life-changing education to their students. We ensure success in the classroom through extensive training, ongoing support, and consistent progress measurement. Our corps members receive individualized feedback from teacher coaches, who provide one-on-one support throughout their two-year commitment. Teacher coaches use data collected during classroom observations and real-time student achievement tracking to identify areas for improvement and ensure adequate progress toward individualized goals. With Teach For America’s support, our ECE corps members are expanding opportunities for their students in the classroom and beyond. 
 
 3. Foster and Accelerate the Leadership of our Alumni: We continue to expand our alumni base in Los Angeles, and foster their ongoing leadership as a force for long-term change. After gaining firsthand knowledge and insight into the educational opportunity gap – and its solvability – our corps members become lifelong leaders in the fight for educational equity from a variety of sectors. If we are serious about building quality in ECE, then we need to have a growing pipeline of young leaders who are willing to commit to the work.","Today, our corps members pursue ambitious growth goals, aiming for their students to achieve at least 1.5 levels of growth on the Desired Results Development Profile, far above the state-recommended growth target of 1 level. In many classrooms, like May Webster’s, we see even more dramatic growth. May, a 2010 Los Angeles corps member, taught preschool in Lennox, and was selected as Preschool Teacher of the Year by Los Angeles Universal Preschool. May was able to achieve 1.66 levels of growth in her classroom and overcome the statistics predicting that students from low-income backgrounds will enter kindergarten already 12 – 14 months behind their wealthier peers. With May’s leadership and passion, her students started kindergarten already reading at a first-grade level. 
 
 Our corps members not only focus on student growth, but also invest families in their efforts. Victoria Hong, a 2011 Los Angeles corps member, instructed two classrooms of 17 dual language learners aged 3-5 as a Head Start Teacher at Pacific Asian Consortium in Employment. Victoria’s vision was to inspire in her students a love for learning, and to encourage their parents to become lifelong advocates for their child’s education. In addition to teaching her students a rigorous curriculum, Victoria also facilitated parent sessions to increase their awareness of the educational opportunity gap and provided resources to help them support their child’s learning. Her students achieved more than 1.5 years of growth, and their parents felt empowered to fight for high-quality educational opportunities.
 
 Imagine a world in which all children across Los Angeles have access to such caring, qualified teachers who can help level the playing field by actively pursuing ambitious growth goals, and engaging with and educating their students’ families. If all of our students entered kindergarten on similar academic levels and had families who felt empowered to advocate for their education, our entire country would benefit! We would see the long-term benefits with more students graduating high school and attending college, and more adults holding stable jobs with higher earnings (Source: HighScope Perry Preschool Project). High-quality early education is the best investment we can make and Teach For America is prepared to expand our ECE efforts to ensure that all students in Los Angeles are on the path to a brighter future!","By bringing in and supporting highly committed and effective ECE teachers, Teach For America – Los Angeles is playing a pivotal role in the trajectory of Los Angeles’ young students’ education, shaping their initial understanding of what it means to be a successful student and an active member of a learning community. Teaching in some of the highest-need communities in Los Angeles, our ECE corps members will serve over 300 students and their families each day in the 2014-15 school year. The beneficiaries of our work are verified through their qualification for the federal free- and reduced-price lunch program. Children from families with incomes at or below 185% of the poverty level (which equates to $43,568 for a family of four in 2014) are eligible for reduced-price or free meals. Over 95% of the students we serve on a daily basis are eligible for this program. We currently estimate that 60 to 80% of the students we serve are Latino, and 20 to 40% are African American. 
 
 The work we do is about people. It is about our students, who have the potential to achieve at the highest levels. It is about their parents, who want the best for their children and their community. It is about our corps members, who work relentlessly to lead their students on more promising academic trajectories. It is about our alumni, who work in education and across a variety of fields to accelerate the pace of change. It is about our staff members, supporters, and partners, who make all of these efforts possible. Together, this movement of individuals reflects a rich diversity of experiences and is united by a shared vision that one day, all children in this nation will have the opportunity to attain an excellent education.","At Teach For America, we believe that transformation happens through partnership. We consistently engage with other partners in this work, such as First 5 LA, as collaboration is essential to our efforts to further our ECE initiative. Our confirmed partnerships with the following organizations are vital to the success of our program:
 
 1. Loyola Marymount University (LMU), our university partner for over a decade, where our corps members enroll in credentialing courses during the school year and pursue their Master’s degrees during their second year. In the 2013-14 school year, all of our ECE corps members completed their Master’s degrees at LMU. 
 
 2. Westside Children’s Center, one of our ECE partner schools, provides high-quality early education programs to serve 400 at-risk children (ages 0 – 5) from very low-income families in southwest Los Angeles County. Since 2012, our ECE corps members have attended summer institute training at Westside Children’s Center, during which they receive training in pedagogy and teaching strategies in model classrooms. The teachers at Westside Children’s Center mentor our corps members and gain exposure to the Teach For America instructional program. The current CEO of Westside Children’s Center, Heather Carrigan, joined Teach For America – Los Angeles’ inaugural class after graduating from Princeton University in 1990. While teaching at Warren Lane Elementary School in Inglewood, Heather learned first-hand about teachers’ daily struggles combating educational disparities and has since committed her career to fighting poverty through education reform.
 
 3. St. Anne’s, one of our ECE partner schools, serves some of the most abused, abandoned, neglected, and otherwise challenged young women and children in Los Angeles County. St. Anne’s offers an array of comprehensive programs including but not limited to, transitional housing, child care, family literacy, and educational and vocational preparation. All of their programs strive to empower and educate by providing the highest level of care and resources so as to help young women and children recognize their own value and potential, giving them the hope and the tools needed for a better future.",0,

We want to enlighten our students to the fact that computer science is THE industry of the future- and that THEY- regardless of 
 socio-economic background, can help make LA into the next Silicone Valley!
 The CLF will also hire additional STEM-focused tutors, in order to further aid with the increasing interest and application in all levels of their math and science subjects, and to further inspire them to get excited about learning more about Math, Technology, Science, and make certain their GPA stays at not only an acceptable place- but at a highly competitive one.We are also calling this an “Initiative” because we also want to help remove the stigma of both intimidation and exclusion from learning about computer science- (It is NOT as hard as one thinks in today’s plugged-in world!) and that learning about it and how to do it IS cool, not geeky or difficult. Don’t bully something you know nothing about, and this is something we want to get across- just give this a chance, and see what happens!","Today, our Coding is Cool initiative will help make LA into the best place to learn because our Care through College students will be studying for the career of the future- the field of Computer Science. This initiative will not only make them MORE competitive and viable in the job market when they graduate college, but will help make LA the place where tech companies will want to expand and grow and find the best, most innovative programmers in the country. (Because here in LA, they start learning to code and to program as children and young teens!)
 
 By 2050, the CLF sees LA as the second Silicone Valley, and having students coming from lower-income backgrounds being able to attain AMAZING jobs, right out of school (and earn up to three times the average salary!) This would be a highly tremendous boost to the community on ALL levels- and we are EXCITED to see it become a reality!
 
 Coding is Cool Goals are Three-Fold: 
 1. To allow the students on our Care through College Program (who are middle school to high school age, at-risk and primarily Latino youth in LA) access to actual Coding and Computer Programming Workshops- so that they may learn the fundamentals of computer science, coding and programming and building apps-culminating in creating their very own app at the end of the first year’s CIC workshop.
 
 2. The CLF will hire a staff of awesome STEM tutors to instruct our students specifically in Science and Math- to demonstrate just how fascinating these subjects truly are, to insure graduation rates and good college entry prospects, and- to further inspire and augment their interest in our new CIC workshops.
 
 3. The CLF will endeavor to inspire our students to think of a career completely outside of what they may ever have imagined- one in the fields of computer science and technology-and provide these future LA residents and taxpayers with the very means to have an impactful, meaningful, fulfilling and prosperous career.
 
 We will also be connecting and hiring the best instructors to connect with our students, and give a fresh group of instructors the opportunity to impact an entire generation of young Angelenos!","Our Coding is Cool Initiative will greatly benefit the primarily Latino, “at-risk,” and very, very low-income youth we serve in the Mar Vista, Palms, Venice and Culver City areas of Los Angeles. They all reside in LA county. The Census Bureau identifies them as very, very low-income. These students are enrolled in LAUSD schools, and are a part of our larger Care through College Educational Program. A majority of these students are also a part of the CLF’s Vita Network, which allow their families to achieve more, and to experience a far better quality of life in Los Angeles through our three Program Platforms. 
 
 This population is so in need of Coding is Cool for some very specific reasons:
 
 -In 2012, according to CollegeBoard.com. LESS THAN 3,000 Hispanic and African-American Students took the high school AP Computer Science Exam. This is a STAGGERING, and staggeringly SAD, fact. 
 
 According to Forbes, Computer Science is the high-paid college degree. And according to NSF.gov. less than 2.4% of college students graduate with a degree in it! 9 out of 10 K-12 schools don’t even offer computer-programming classes, according to Code.org. 
 
 And then there’s this, from Time.com’s own Keith Wagstaff: “If technology is the future, however, we are doing a woeful job of preparing our kids for it. Computer science is the only one of the STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) fields that has actually seen a decrease in student participation over the last 20 years, from 25% of high school students to only 19%, according to a study by the National Center for Education Statistics. Take a look at the curriculum of many classes labeled “computer science” today, and you’ll find not much has changed from the days of dial-up modems. Most cover the basics: Learning how to type and use Microsoft Word and PowerPoint. “ (itals ours) Not encouraging!
 
 But Coding is Cool can help change all of this, and change the entire trajectory of an at-risk child's young life and future career.","Our students will be primarily enrolled in LAUSD schools. This is a collaboration by means of our offering LAUSD students these workshops absolutely free-of-charge, and to supplement the few computer science classes they have (if any).",0,
4102216,Reading Makes a Difference,Students at 20 low-income elementary schools will join assemblies & read-a-thons to give uplifting books & dolls to kids in hospitals.,Learn,2016223,2014,,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,"We open with motivational Introductory Assemblies geared to each grade level, kicking off a 3-week Read-A-Thon. Student reading results in 35 “Jester” books and 35 Jester & Pharley Dolls given to local pediatric patients, with bookplates acknowledging the school and sponsor. The school receives 30 copies of the bilingual English/Spanish ""The Jester Has Lost His Jingle/El Bufón ha perdido su gracia” and 30 sets of Jester educator-developed enrichment manuals -- Curriculum Guide to ‘The Jester Has Lost His Jingle,’” “Educator’s Guide to ‘The Jester Has Lost His Jingle,’” “The Jester & Pharley PhunBook.” The library receives a Jester & Pharley Doll and “Jester’s Journey” DVD with background material. Creative projects, including care cards & illustrations, also fire up student imaginations. Many student cards and drawings are featured at ""Jester & Pharley Place"" on our www.thejester.org website. We cap the program 6 weeks later with a Recognition Assembly celebrating top readers & classrooms with special awards. We invite sponsors and hospital representatives to participate.","Literacy will always be the cornerstone of learning – today and in 2050. When children can read, doors open. Illiteracy deprives students of a more lucrative, bright future. We are dedicated to providing children struggling with challenges in disadvantaged neighborhoods with the motivation they need to read. We envision all children – especially minority and low-income children – improving their and others’ lives because of our literacy program. If inspired at an early age to enjoy reading and understand the importance of being a contributing member of society, children will lead more productive and responsible adult lives and make L.A. the best place to learn. 
 A key objective in teaching low-income children charity is to empower them. Schools praise our program for providing disadvantaged students with a concrete way to GIVE. When students see they can help others simply by reading, they realize they can give of themselves without having to donate money. As we motivate students to give, a love for reading develops. They become empowered learners. Principals report seeing stronger readers and lasting, positive character development that begins with The Jester program. Our project helps children learn as they find joy, meaning and new ideas in books. 
 Our focus consistently draws raves from educators, like this librarian who shepherded our first program: “The most profound impact was in the read-a-thon by which students could give ‘Jester’ books & dolls to children in our local hospital. The level of participation and enthusiasm has been phenomenal. Most of our students are too poor to purchase ‘The Jester’ for themselves, but they care deeply about others. We work very hard to reinforce the importance of caring to our students, so that as they grow older they are tempted less by drugs and violence and more by empathy toward their fellow human beings. Character education requires a way for children to show their character. By offering students the opportunity to actually give something to other children through their own efforts, you enriched their lives immeasurably.”
 This year, an East L.A. teacher noted that, “Students were more conscious of their choice of words, attitudes and beliefs, of friendship, respect, bullying, negative attitudes and they tried more honestly to be more positive.” Teachers tell us their students want to be “just like The Jester” and live up to The Jester’s motto: “It’s up to us to make a difference. It’s up to us to care.""","The Jester & Pharley Phund’s Reading Makes A Difference project, which costs $5,000 per school, provides direct benefits to all students, teachers, staff and administrators at each school. Using an average of 700 students per school, with 30 classrooms per school, 5 administrators and staff per school, the total number of direct beneficiaries at 20 schools can be estimated to be:
 ● 14,000 students
 ● 28,000 siblings (an average of 2 per student)
 ● 21,000 parents (an average of 1.5 per student)
 ● 600 teachers
 ● 100 administrators/staff
 Additionally, student participation in The Jester & Pharley Phund Read-A-Thon will result in 35 copies of “The Jester Has Lost His Jingle/El Bufón ha perdido su gracia” and 35 Jester & Pharley Dolls per school donated to an L.A. County hospital.
 Benefiting would be:
 ● 600 young patients receiving “The Jester Has Lost His Jingle/El Bufón ha perdido su gracia”
 ● 600 young patients receiving The Jester & Pharley Doll
 Also benefiting would be the siblings and parents of each child receiving the gift. Since many recipients will be from Spanish-speaking households, the parents would be able to share the powerful uplifting messages of the book with their children in their native language.
 ● 1,200 siblings sharing “The Jester Has Lost His Jingle/El Bufón ha perdido su gracia”
 ● 1,200 siblings sharing The Jester & Pharley Doll with detachable Pharley 
 Low-income families make up the predominant population of the elementary schools with which we partner (elementary population compiled from California Department of Education data). For many, Spanish is their first language. Students at these schools can encounter serious difficulties in acquiring English-language skills quickly. Literacy is the key to becoming an independent learner in all disciplines and our project facilitates literacy development in a fun and efficacious way.
 Similarly, disadvantaged children similarly seldom have the opportunity to act as benefactors. The Jester not only encourages students to consider the needs of others but also provides, through the chance to give Jester books and dolls, a means to channel growing compassion into concrete action.
 And the impact on ill children who receive Jester books and dolls from student participation in our Read-A-Thons is profound. These children often have few, if any, books of their own and urgently need the emotional, educational and therapeutic support The Jester & Pharley book and doll provide.","During the 13 years that we have been providing this program, we have built strong relationships among numerous educators in many L.A. school districts and among numerous medical professionals in L.A. County hospitals and clinics. Each partner brings a knowledge and understanding of children affected by their profession, enhancing the program. Our educator enrichment manuals were created with these and other collaborators. 
 The many low-income schools that would like their students to participate in this program come from throughout the county. Christopher J. Steinhauser, Superintendent of the Long Beach Unified School District, is a key collaborator. He has seen positive results in the 15 district elementary schools in which our project has already been implemented and would like to see it boost literacy in the 39 others. In 2013, Phund Executive Director Barbara Saltzman was presented with the Superintendent’s Distinguished Community Service Award for inspiring Long Beach students to read and care about others through this program.
 We will continue to work in the Compton Unified School District with Jefferson Elementary Principal Mario Marcos and Afterschool Program Coordinator Rea Young as well as Dr. Abimmbola Ajala, Assistant Superintendent of Educational Services. Having successfully brought the program to Jefferson and Carver schools, we have been asked to bring it to more of the district’s 28 elementary schools.
 Hospital partners include; Dr. Divya-Devi Joshi, Chief Medical Officer, Miller Children’s Hospital Long Beach; Dr. Ernest Katz, Director of Behavioral Sciences, Children’s Hospital L.A.; Dr. Julie E. Noble, Coordinator of Community Advocacy, Pediatrics Dept. of Harbor-UCLA Medical Center; Cesar Armendariz, Vice President of Business Development, White Memorial Medical Center; Tanya Ybarra, Director of Child Life at California Hospital, and many others. 
 Three factors critical to the success of our proposed collaboration are:
 ● Timely administrative support of and encouragement of the program at the school and district level 
 ● Teamwork with a school liaison who will routinely remain in touch with The Phund throughout the program. Regular communication is vital to maintaining the quality and consistency of the program and working through any slight bumps that might occur along the way. 
 ● Hospital desire for Jester books and dolls to benefit patients.

4102229,Undevelopment One,Our goal is to empower people across Los Angeles to achieve rooftop solar and to secure a climate friendly future.,Live,2016232,2014,,,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,,"Our coalition brings together a unique set of skills, including communication experts, business leaders, and community organizers. Our campaign focuses on one outcome with four primary components. When we win, 20% of Angelenos’ power will come from rooftop solar by 2020, and we will be on track to achieve our vision of 100% clean energy in LA by 2050. To get there, we propose four campaign components: (1) grassroots community education/empowerment to democratize solar; (2) demonstration solar projects; (3) media campaign; and (4) summer solstice solar event.
  
 1. Grassroots community education and empowerment
 a. Host three community solar fairs throughout Los Angeles to educate local communities about existing programs.
 b. Run five rooftop trainings for community organizations across the city to teach people about the benefits of solar and solar programs.
 c. Gather support from 100 additional community leaders or organizations.
 d. Collect 20,000 petitions.
 e. Educate public officials, including Los Angeles Department of Water and Power commissioners, about the benefits of implementing solar programs
 
 2. Demonstration Projects
 a. Complete at least one demonstration project on low-income, multifamily buildings, which will result in approximately 0.5 MW of installed solar while educating communities about the benefits of rooftop solar, generating clean power that would reduce utility bills for the owner and residents, and providing job training when possible.
 
 3. Media Campaign
 a. Use social media, infographics, and videos to engage Angelenos about the potential for rooftop solar, existing programs in LA, and the potential for new programs. 
 b. Generate six articles in local press highlighting the benefits of rooftop solar and four op-eds.
 
 4. Summer Solstice Solar Event
 a. Organize and host a free, public Summer Solstice event with music, food, games, and speakers to celebrate LA’s solar potential and engage Angelenos on the issue. Goal is to engage 3,000 Angelenos in one day.","Los Angeles has the dirtiest air in the country and reliance on fossil fuels, including for our power plants, creates smog and soot that leads to premature deaths and asthma attacks. In particular, the residents of mostly low-income communities and communities of color, where the worst polluters are located, experience disproportionate rates of youth and adult asthma hospitalizations, cancer, and premature deaths due to multiple stressors, including environmental factors. Health impacts from stationary pollution sources, such as oil refineries and power plants, are exacerbated by a lack of access to healthcare, limited access to healthy food, and other cumulative impacts.
 
 Equity is an essential part of our program. The growth of the green economy must come with equitable benefits that reach across every LA community. While this project has the potential to transform the city and help clean up our air more generally, we will focus on ensuring strong health and economic benefits in low-income communities that have been left behind during other periods of economic growth.
  
 This project will emphasize two communities that bear the brunt of fossil fuel pollution impacts: Pacoima and Wilmington.
 
 Pacoima is overburdened by multiple sources of pollution; a dearth of environmental benefits, such as access to open space; and a lack of access to high quality jobs, education, transportation, healthcare, and retail opportunities. Toxic facilities, such as metal fabricators, auto dismantlers, and dozens of waste processors, are concentrated in this area along with high levels of diesel truck traffic and an airport. These pollution sources are frequently within unsafe proximities to homes, schools, parks, and houses of worship. 
 
 Wilmington is a largely working class, Latino community and has some of the highest concentrations of pollution in the state. As a result, Wilmington residents experience some of the highest cancer risks. Wilmington is a vulnerable community with a population of 55,000 people with 87 percent of Latino heritage. 
  
 We know that rooftop solar alone won’t alone solve the overwhelming levels of pollution faced daily by Pacoima and Wilmington, but spurring rooftop solar installations in these communities is an important first step to ensuring that front-line communities lead the transition beyond fossil fuels, while driving economic investments that will improve access to jobs, healthcare, healthy foods, and more.","Los Angeles will benefit greatly from a robust market for rooftop solar on homes, office buildings, schools, warehouses, parking lots, and other facilities. Solar can benefit our environment, our health and our economy by providing cleaner air, reducing global warming, conserving water, and creating jobs. Our project generates a broad array of benefits for residents of LA and surrounding areas, with an emphasis on equity. In completing this project, there are a set of benefits that Angelenos will share broadly, as well as specific benefits to subsets of the city and county’s population.
 
 Economic Development: Expanding local solar power would create jobs and save Angelenos money. Increasing our city’s share of local solar to 20 percent by 2020 would create approximately 32,000 job-years of employment. To put this number in context, the University of California, Los Angeles—which ranks among the city’s leading employers—has a workforce of just under 32,000 people. Incentives have made it possible for the Los Angeles Unified School District to invest in a solar energy system that, when complete, will save up to $800,000 each month in electricity costs. These benefits should be available first in low income communities hit hardest by the recessions. 
  
 Water conservation: California is mired in a historic drought. Increasing our reliance on local rooftop solar would conserve valuable water by reducing the need for water guzzling power plants. Solar panels generate electricity without using any water beyond that needed for occasional washing. If 20 percent of our electricity generated from natural gas power plants was replaced with rooftop solar in LA, an estimated 435 million gallons of water per year would be saved.","This project will be managed collaboratively by the Los Angeles Clean Energy Coalition (the coalition). Specifically, participants in the coalition include Communities for a Better Environment, Environment California Research and Policy Center, Global Green USA, Los Angeles Business Council, Natural Resource Defense Council, Pacoima Beautiful, and the Sierra Club. The coalition has worked together for nearly three years, building support for clean energy across Los Angeles. Our coalition represents various interests in Los Angeles that may not share all of the same goals but are united around a future in which Los Angeles relies on energy efficiency and renewable energy instead of coal and natural gas, producing an environmentally friendly economy that does not leave any of our communities behind. 
 
 Some of our groups represent low-income communities and communities of color that have long been underserved and are disproportionately affected by dirty fossil fuels the consequences of climate change. Others speak on behalf of some of the largest businesses in the city. Several coalition members are known for their technical and scientific expertise, and for their project-based work in Los Angeles. Our coalition also includes groups that focus on educating and organizing Angelenos to take action on issues they care about, often times through engaging and innovative social media campaigns. Together, we represent a range of interests and communities that are geographically and culturally diverse.
 
 In recent years the coalition has led the effort to transform LA’s relationship with energy by contributing to the following accomplishments:
 
 ● Supporting the implementation of the largest urban rooftop solar program in the nation;
 ● Doubling Los Angeles Department of Water and Power’s (LADWP) energy efficiency budget in 2012 (LA has now doubled energy savings in the last two years); and
 ● Securing a commitment from LADWP to end the use of coal no later than 2025.",0,

Once we have the funds we can do the following:
 Obtain a lease or purchase property
 Purchase equipment
 Design the space for the needs of the families
 Marketing and awareness","Currently, children in South LA experience many injustices related to play. There are only a handful of indoor play facilities in the area. The play facilities that do exist promote play but also promote unhealthful eating, such as Chuck-E-Cheese and the play gyms at McDonalds. Lack of green space, play space and healthy food choice options all contribute to the growing rate of obesity among children in LA County. Tickleberry Place will combat the trifold issues of lack of play space, lack of green space, and lack of healthy food by providing a space where children and families can eat, play, and learn about healthy living. 
 Our children our exposed to a large number of harsh chemicals and toxic materials. Tickleberry Place will be a play space made from environmentally friendly materials. In addition, Tickleberry Place will use products and methods to keep the play space toxic free. This is particularly important as about 1 in 11 children have asthma in Los Angeles. 
 
 Children can play in the play gym or participate in community building games facilitated by the Tickleberry team. When children are done playing,they can eat healthy organic produce grown in Tickleberry’s garden. Food will be healthful but also culturally relevant to the majority black and Latino residents in the neighborhood near Tickleberry.
 
 What will distinguish Tickleberry from other indoor play gyms is its focus on education for families. Through a partnership with educational organizations, Tickleberry will offer classes, workshops, and events for parents on topics such as gardening, healthy eating, sustainable living, and healthy child development. 
 
 Our goal is for Tickleberry Place to be a community hub for health and wellness. With a local space that caters toward fun and well being, Tickleberry Place will help make LA the best place to learn in 2050.","This will benefit families in South and Central Los Angeles, but it is not limited to other neighborhoods and communities.
 
 Tickleberry Place was designed to meet the unique needs of South LA. Historically, South LA has experienced violence, lack of access to safe play spaces to children, limited access to healthy foods. This limits opportunities for children to play and for parents to connect in a public space about values such as healthy living for families. Tickleberry caters to this demographic of Black and Latino families with children ages 6 months to 10 years old. Tickleberry begins in South LA as it is the highest need region for issues of food access and play space. However, the location of Tickleberry makes it accessible to the greater Los Angeles’ Community. Tickleberry welcomes participation from families across the city. Eventually, it is the goal of the founders to expand Tickleberry into other regions of the city, so that families will not have to travel far for safe, environmentally friendly, healthful play spaces for children.","As of right now, we don’t have any partners or collaborators on the project. Having a partner would be a great opportunity for collaborating on this cause of creating healthy and sustainable play spaces in Los Angeles. We are open to having partners and are looking for them.",1,
4102244,College Readiness Program - Helping Foster Youth Prepare to Succeed in College and in Life,UFC's College Readiness Program supports foster children from grades 7-12 so they graduate from high school and move on to college careers.,Learn,2016244,2014,,,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,,"Central to UFC’s approach is providing the foster youth in our programs with long-term relationships with UFC staff members, who serve as the source of consistent support that many foster youth lack in their lives. Counselors act as mentors and advisors to each student, and also encourage the youth to advocate for themselves. This support extends to caregivers as well, who benefit from workshops and activities focused on creating a college-bound atmosphere in their home. 
  Counselors follow participants through whatever home and school placement changes they may experience. As the average California foster youth experiences at least three placement changes during their time in foster care, this component is key to their success. Program activities include:
 Academic Preparation
 Students attend monthly weekend workshops that provide the essential information to create a clear path to college. Counselors work with students to help them set academic and personal goals and create an academic plan to meet those goals. Students are provided with supplemental services that may include tutoring, SAT preparation, and referrals to other services. 
 Educational Advocacy
 Counselors work with youth to provide educational advocacy in areas surrounding IEPs, TILPs and TDMs in addition to coordinating access to support services with CSWs.
 Workshops & College Tours
 Through workshops and tours of local college campuses, students explore college and career options, develop cultural awareness and enhance their academic skills. In addition, monthly workshops support eligible seniors in the program as they apply to colleges, and to assist them in making application for financial aid. 
 Enrichment Activities
 A host of summer programs and unique activities are offered to the youth to support their personal development and expose them to career opportunities.
 For the coming year, CRP has begun creating and implementing two new initiatives: an Alternate Track for to prepare non-four-year college bound students for success through a year-long workshop series, college visits and specialized services; and a six-month extension of services for all CRP graduates - including access to the usual services e.g. tutoring, as well as one-on-one support in the preparation of personal transition plans.","Almost one seventh of the 400,000 children in foster care in the US reside in the state of California, and one third of those are in Los Angeles County (AFCARS and CCWIP, 2012). Over 8,000 of the 18,700 children in care in Los Angeles County are between the ages of 11 and 21 (CCWIP, 2012), and it is these children and youth whose futures UFC seeks to improve through its programs. Compared with their peers in the general population, foster youth experience poor outcomes in a number of areas of their life. When foster youth leave care, they are on their own with little to no support system to help them navigate the difficult path to adulthood. The informal safety net built by familial bonds that so many of us take for granted does not exist for many former foster youth. There is no grace period and no safe place to return when things do not go as planned. As a result, foster youth are perhaps one of the most vulnerable populations in our communities. The statistics, especially those related to educational attainment, show that the majority of Los Angeles County foster youth exiting care will not become successfully independent as adults:
 • Only about one half of students in foster care pass California’s high school exit exam in grade 10, compared to 76% of all 10th graders 
 • High school students in foster care in California have the highest dropout rate at 8%, compared to 3 to 5% for other at-risk student subgroups
 • The high school graduation rate for students in foster care in California is lower, at 58%, than other at-risk student subgroups, whose rates range from 60 to 79%
 • In Los Angeles, less than half of foster youth enroll in community college, and in one study, only 2% of these received Associate’s degrees and 2% met criteria for transfer to a four-year program in the University of California or California State University systems 
 The perpetuation of these poor educational outcomes for foster youth results in (1) the personal potential of thousands of individuals going unrealized; (2) great stores of energy, experience, and talent that could benefit our communities, going untapped; and (3) many of these individuals using disproportionate amounts of public services, either through welfare assistance or incarceration. UFC’s model interventions have proven that a relatively small, well-timed investment in foster youth can unlock the potential of this vulnerable population to become an invaluable asset to our communities.","UFC's programs serve foster youth throughout Los Angeles County. We currently serve approximately 1,300 foster children and youth annually, including 500 individuals in the Readiness program. The CRP is open to any student in Los Angeles County foster care interested in taking advantage of the services UFC has to offer and is not enrolled in a Special Day Class. New students are recruited in grades seven through nine to ensure the possibility of at least four years of participation. Students are referred by DCFS social workers, advocates, partner schools, or siblings of CRP students.
 
 Of CRP program participants:
 
 • 58% are female and 42% are male;
 • 44% are African American, 42% Hispanic, 2% Caucasian, 1% Asian, 2% Bi Racial, and 9% Other/NA; and
 • 61% are in high school and 39% are in middle school.","One of UFC’s greatest strengths is our partnerships and service linkage with other organizations. Due to the frequency and intimacy of our contact with youth we serve and when applicable, their caregivers, UFC is in a unique position to assess the particular gaps in services and/or needs of individual foster youth. The College Readiness program works with many partners, including the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS), UCLA Connecting Communities, Coalition for Engaged Education’s Forward Program, CASA, iFoster, LACOE Foster Youth Services, Public Counsel, Green Dot, SoCalCAN, Education Coordinating Council, Court Scholars, L.A. Compact, Children’s Law Center, Success in Degrees, Camp Felix, First Star UCLA Bruin Guardian Academy, Alliance for Children’s Rights, and numerous Foster Family Agencies and Group Homes.",0,
4102025,Big Citizen HUB – A new organization for new leaders,This project is launching the first cohort of new leaders - our Big Citizens - beginning with 75 middle school students in January 2015.,Connect,2018008,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050connect/projects/BigCitizenHUB.html,,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,"The mission of Big Citizen HUB is to build a community of Big Citizens, expanding the social capital of youth through curiosity, gratitude, team, and adventure. Big Citizen HUB, a project of Community Partners, will bring together young people, ages 8-24, outside of school, from all over Los Angeles to learn a common civic language, engage in dialogue, and build community to investigate local and global challenges ranging from poverty to environmental issues. We will convene on Saturdays between January and August. Big Citizens (ages 8-18) will form diverse teams, serve a minimum of 100 hours, and complete team-based projects while learning from Youth Workers (near-peer mentors and team leaders, ages 19-24), trained by Big Citizen HUB.","Big Citizens will work through issues in monthly modules that incorporate interactive learning, active service, and individual and team reflection. 
 
 What does that look like? Here’s a ""month in the life"" of a Big Citizen, exploring the issue of homelessness:
 
 - Saturday #1: Curiosity (Interactive Learning)
 Big Citizens come together to learn about homelessness, sharing their own understanding of the issue and personal experiences, and hearing the perspectives of others. Teams travel to different locations across the city (Skid Row, South LA, Santa Monica) to learn from organizations addressing homelessness.
 
 - Saturday #2: Adventure (Service)
 The day begins with a community dialogue, sharing thoughts about the issue they explored the prior Saturday, including any new experiences or perspectives that were gained during the week. Teams travel to various service sites (possibly the Downtown Women’s Shelter or the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank) and spend the day engaging in active service to address homelessness.
 
 - Saturday #3: Gratitude (Reflection)
 The day begins with a group dialogue, reflecting on last week’s service projects and the organizations they learned about earlier in the month. Youth Workers lead Big Citizens in public speaking workshop. Teams prepare presentations documenting details of the service and organizations they learned from. Homelessness month concludes with a Community Meeting of Big Citizens, parents, and community partners, where Big Citizens present to the larger group.
 
 During the final months of the program, teams work together to explore a topic of their choosing, developing service projects to address their issue. Upon completion of the program, Big Citizens graduate earning the President’s Volunteer Service Award and Youth Workers earn Big Citizen HUB’s Youth Development Professional Certification. 
 
 In January 2015 Big Citizen HUB will launch with 75 middle school participants (Big Citizens) and 14 team leaders (Youth Workers). Big Citizen HUB will grow to almost 450 participants annually within five years, increasing the amount of middle schoolers and adding teams of high school aged and elementary participants. In fiscal year 2020, a total of 1,300 Big Citizens will have experienced the program.","Today, Big Citizen HUB brings together youth from different neighborhoods, providing a common culture with which to relate, common experience with which to connect, opportunity for dialogue that explores differences in experience and perspective – all while learning important life skills and leadership skills that are necessary for success in school and the workforce. This type of opportunity currently does not exist in our city, where young people can come together from all over and meet new people through positive experiences.
 
 In addition, the success of our program is based on partnerships with organizations that serve and address our most pressing community issues. We aim to meaningfully engage with at least 30 external partners in 2015. Aside from learning from, serving with, and connecting on the issues these organizations address, there is one very important outcome that we expect from this type of engagement: Adults begin to see youth as thoughtful, engaged, and valued participants in our communities. In turn, this change in perception allows youth to gain motivation to succeed in school, participate in their community, and feel optimistic about the future. 
 
 In 2020, 1300 youth will have participated in Big Citizen HUB, so imagine how many youth, community leaders, and parents will be involved by 2050. Imagine what the middle school students who were Big Citizens in 2015 will be doing by 2050. They’ll be voters, business leaders, social entrepreneurs, public officials, teachers, and possibly parents of the 36th cohort of Big Citizens. They’ll support public transportation, utilize social media in new and powerful ways, and will regularly connect with others outside of their neighborhood. Big Citizen HUB will be the best place for youth in Los Angeles to learn about issues that affect our local and global communities, to practice the skills needed to solve problems, and to connect with and feel comfortable with people of different backgrounds.","In 2015, Big Citizen HUB will engage 75 middle school students as Big Citizens, 14 near peer mentors as Youth Workers (19-24 year olds), and 30 community organizations. In this first year we anticipate about 80% of Big Citizens coming from low income families, with a racial breakdown as follows: 70% Latino, 15% Asian, 5% African American, 5% Caucasian, and 5% multiracial. We will utilize existing partnerships to recruit Big Citizens from the following areas: Boyle Heights, West LA, South LA, Watts, and Pico Union. We will work to create new partnerships in additional areas of L.A. to ensure diversity of our youth. Diversity is a key component of our program and a large factor in how beneficial the program will be. 
 
 Our Youth Workers benefit from a rigorous training that we provide, focused on positive youth development practices, curriculum design, workshop facilitation, team building, conflict resolution, and asset mapping. Our Youth Development Professional Certification will be valuable as our Youth Workers move on, looking for full-time positions with other youth development organizations.
 
 The community organizations we partner with benefit in a couple ways. First, many will have the opportunity to receive 75 young and enthusiastic volunteers for a full day of Saturday service. Second, they get the opportunity to share what they do with a number of new faces – Big Citizens, Youth Workers, parents, and other community members being engaged. They can share the problem they address, how they address it, what kind of impact they have on the community, and how others can get involved. It’s an amazing opportunity to connect with people who may not have come across their organization outside of Big Citizen HUB.","While we are a “solo actor” on this application, we would not be here without the insight from our supporters and partnerships with local organizations. Here we’d like to highlight two partnerships that are helping to ensure our success:
 - The City Year Inc. Western Region is supporting our work to recruit qualified Youth Workers. Our program is dependent upon bringing in committed near peer mentors to lead teams of Big Citizens. Our partnership with City Year allows us access to a large pool of 19-24 year olds who have interest in youth development and service, who have been vetted by a team of people with the expertise of recruiting people with the skill set we need.
 - The Red Shield Youth and Community Center is providing us with the facilities with which to run our office. In return, we provide the Red Shield’s staff with youth development training and coaching. In addition, all Big Citizens will become members of the center.",

In order to help more of these children, CASA of Los Angeles needs to recruit 200 more volunteers to be Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASAs) from all communities of Los Angeles over the next year. We are looking to expand the number of African-American, Spanish-speaking, LGBTQ, and male volunteers working with CASA to better represent our children and their needs. But we can’t do that without a multi-pronged, collaborative outreach across multiple communities. Only LA2050 can help us to connect these diverse populations and prospective volunteers!","Strategy 1: Collaborate: Partner with 5 new organizations in the Monterey Park and Antelope Valley areas. Through LA2050, CASA/LA can forge new partnerships with other organizations across a broader spectrum whose communities best reflect our children’s profile – First African Methodist Episcopal Church (FAME), Los Angeles Latino Chamber of Congress (LALCC), Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center, Hispanic Organization Promoting Education (HOPE), Brotherhood Crusade, 100 Black Men of Los Angeles, and more. 
 
 Strategy 2: Diversify: Work closely with volunteer committees—the African-American CASAs of Los Angeles, Latino Committee, Quarterback Club (committee for men)—to expand recruitment and retention of diverse volunteers. 38% of the children CASA/LA serves are African-American and 12% of CASAs are African-American; 35% of youth and 10% of CASAs are Latino; and 52% of youth and 15% of CASAs are male. Amongst foster care youth in general, 8-10% are reported to identify as gay, lesbian, bi-sexual, transgender, or queer. 
 
 Strategy 3: Inform: Participate in an average of 20 off-site recruitment events and produce 4 information sessions monthly. The Community Outreach Department will participate either via speaking engagements, formal presentations, and/or hosting a CASA/LA information booth at a series of off-site community events held at colleges, neighborhood associations, churches, partner agencies, and courthouses throughout Los Angeles County. 
 
 Strategy 4: Network: Activate and engage the current CASA network to encourage outreach to their networks. Because word-of-mouth outreach generated by CASAs has been one of the most effective recruitment tools, the Community Outreach Department is formalizing this approach by performing outreach to CASAs directly via letters and follow-up calls. 
 
 Strategy 5: Communicate: Launch a comprehensive community-based marketing campaign in diverse neighborhoods throughout Los Angeles County. CASA/LA will embark on a marketing campaign through community newsletters and newspapers; community-based events; flyers that speak to targeted communities and flyer neighborhoods; and social media posts and advertising in specific neighborhoods throughout LA. 
 
 Strategy 6: Advertise: Implement strategies to maximize use of paid, earned, and donated media. The Community Outreach and Development and Communications teams will implement a full-scale print, broadcast, online, social, and direct media and advertising campaign.","CASA of Los Angeles (CASA/LA) identifies, trains, and supports volunteers, whose unique role is to be an unpaid advocate for abused and neglected foster children. A Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) is a specially trained and supervised volunteer, appointed by a judge to advocate for a foster child who is under the court’s protection because of abuse or neglect. CASA/LA is the quintessential “volunteer centered organization” in that all direct services are provided by volunteers who have one thing in common: their commitment to speaking for a child who has no voice. CASA’s ensure that the child receives the services and support he needs: from the basics – clothes, school supplies – to most importantly, the attention and care that he needs to thrive.
 
 The largest obstacle toward serving our 1,000 child target for FY2015 is the lack of volunteers. For the first time ever, we currently have almost 500 active volunteers, and our child/volunteer ratio is 1.7. We’ve already increased the number of children we serve annually from 570 to 830 in the past three years. To reach our goal in the next year, we will need to recruit, train, and deploy at least 200 new volunteers, 50 more than fiscal year 2014. CASA/LA will need to go to an entirely different level of volunteer recruitment in order to meet our ambitious goals. 
 
 But what CASA/LA brings to Los Angeles is the opportunity for a diverse set of volunteers to help LA’s most vulnerable youth have a voice. Not only will our diversity campaign connect these varied populations to the youth but we will be connecting them to each other, creating a family of CASAs who come different backgrounds, ethnicities, communities, social strata, and belief systems to engage in a common goal: creating a healthy and productive future for LA’s most vulnerable children.
 
 By 2050, CASA/LA hopes to be serving all children in the foster care system, but we can’t do that without starting to increase our number of volunteers today. Volunteers who will be trained in the legal, social, emotional, and educational needs of the child, and for whom this introduction to the foster care system might just be the first step towards becoming foster care parents themselves. CASA/LA will not only recruit this incredible group of Angeleno volunteers, they will also provide the training they need to become the best advocates possible for foster care youth.","According to a special health report by Harvard Health Publication, “When researchers at the London School of Economics examined the relationship between volunteering and measures of happiness in a large group of American adults, they found the more people volunteered, the happier they were, according to a study in Social Science and Medicine. Compared with people who never volunteered, the odds of being “very happy” rose 7% among those who volunteer monthly and 12% for people who volunteer every two to four weeks. Among weekly volunteers, 16% felt very happy—a hike in happiness comparable to having an income of $75,000–$100,000 versus $20,000, say the researchers.”
 
 Other benefits of volunteering include making new friends and connections, increasing confidence, decreasing depression, and aiding in physical health. But those are just the benefits for our volunteers. For children in the foster care system, CASA volunteers help perform miracles for those who need them the most--children who have no safe and committed adults in their lives--and help them become self-sufficient and responsible young men and women. In FY2014, 492 volunteers provided over 160,000 hours of service to 830 children in LA County. Through LA2050, CASA intends to increase that number to 700 volunteers and 1,000 children, and then 2,800 children, 10% of those in the dependency system, within the next several years. 
 
 CASA volunteers advocate for children by INVESTIGATING the child's home life, and identifying educational, physical and mental health challenges; REPORTING all that they have learned about the child's home and school life and RECOMMENDING to the judge how they may help the child live his best life; and ADVOCATING for the child until he is placed in a stable and permanent home with loving parents or guardians.
 
 While we are proud of what we have accomplished as an organization, we believe our most significant accomplishments happen every day in the work of our volunteers—when an overlooked opportunity is found, a service is secured, a child learns that she is valued, or an adult connection is made that helps to keep a child safe and offers him an opportunity to succeed in life.","CASA/LA’s current partnerships include numerous organizations advocating for the wellbeing of underserved youth throughout Los Angeles County and beyond, such as The Right Way Foundation, Zero to Three, Project ABC, L.A. Child Guidance Center, Child Development Institute, Vista Del Mar Child and Family Services, Secure Transitions Foster Family Agency, the Alliance for Children’s Rights, among others. In addition, of Los Angeles regularly partners with like-minded organizations and governmental agencies to serve—and save—more children in the dependency courts, including:
 
 • Los Angeles Dependency Court
 • The Los Angeles Department of Children and Family Services
 • Children's Law Center
 • The Alliance for Children's Rights
 • Child Development Institute
 • Los Angeles Department of Mental Health
 • Los Angeles Department of Public Health
 
 However, through LA2050, CASA/LA hopes to expand its partnerships to include groups which work with specific diverse populations, like First African Methodist Episcopal Church (FAME), the Los Angeles Latino Chamber of Congress (LALCC), the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center, Hispanic Organization Promoting Education (HOPE), Brotherhood Crusade, and 100 Black Men of Los Angeles. Through this project, CASA hopes to begin outreach to these specific communities and their respective organizations to find new and creative ways to collaborate and to connect community members as CASA volunteers. 
 
 In terms of training, CASA/LA has worked with many partners to create stronger training programs for our volunteers, collaborating with Alliance for Children's Rights (a year-long continuing education series likely to be repeated), Public Counsel, Children of the Night, Child Development Institute, DCFS, Children's Law Center, Family Focus Resource Center, KidSave International, USA TIES for Families, and the Human Rights Commission (on an LGBTQ training) to create appropriate, productive training sessions for our CASAs. We would like to continue to expand those training initiatives to include more partners of diversity to help better prepare and support CASAs and the children and youth they serve.
 
 The three factors that are critical to our success with the proposed partnerships are legitimate outreach to the partner’s community, instructive and authentic collaboration between CASA and the partner organization, and informed engagement with our training programs.",
4102035,A Pro-Kid LA: Building The Children’s Movement in Los Angeles,We are connecting the incredible constituency power that exists for kids in LA to influence state & local policymaking in their favor.,Connect,2018019,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050connect/projects/ProKidLA.html,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,"Too many of LA’s 2.3 million children lack access to the necessary supports—such as high-quality early learning programs, rigorous K-12 academics, and access to critical health care services -- that they need to be able to reach their full potential. For example, a third of LA’s kids lack access to preschool opportunities, less than 50 percent of 3rd graders score proficiently on English language arts standardized tests, and nearly 1 in 6 dropout of high school.
 
 If all of the LA based education, business, parent, civil rights, community, and faith- and ethnic-based groups that care about children were connected, not only would LA’s children’s outcomes dramatically improve, but LA would be the national model for children’s advocacy.","Changing government policies is the fastest and most efficient way to scale effective programs and ensure the resources needed to provide all children with the necessary supports. What stands in the way of these necessary policy actions is the lack of connection. While there are countless organizations, businesses, and individuals in LA that care deeply about improving outcomes for youth, most of them tend to operate in siloes, by issue and/or sector. If a significant number of these entities were connected, the power of a unified voice would have an exponential effect and secure powerful policy change for kids. 
 
 The Children’s Movement resulted from years of strategic planning, prompted by the question, “Almost everyone cares about kids, so why do kids fare so poorly in the policy making process?” The answer is that the broad-based diverse public support for children’s well-being has been too diffuse to have the impact it should on policymaking priorities. Consequently, better organized interest groups with much less public will behind them have been able to divert policymakers’ attention away from fixing the issues undermining children’s successful development. 
 
 As the state’s only umbrella research, policy development, and advocacy children’s organization focused on the full range of issues affecting children’s health, education and safety, Children Now is uniquely positioned to connect the many diverse organizations and people that are Pro-Kid to one another and enable their collective action. 
 
 The Children’s Movement is a game-changing approach. Traditional and non-traditional allies will, for the first time, be coordinated in their actions and unified in their message so children are the top priority. Currently, the Movement represents a grassroots network of nearly 1,000 (and counting) business, education, parent, civil rights, faith-, community-, ethnic-based and other organizations, as well as thousands of individuals that can be effectively mobilized to represent children’s interests across a variety of important policy issues. Upon joining the Movement, members are provided timely research information, policy updates, easy-to-use tools, and advocacy opportunities they need to learn about key kids’ issues and participate in collective action campaigns to influence change on the local and state level.","LA is the vital center of the Movement. Children Now opened an office in downtown LA last year and brought on full-time staff to start scaling our model throughout LA. We are also building this innovative model in other communities throughout the State, but given LA’s size and diversity, it is imperative that the Movement is scaled here. LA is the ideal place to be the most connected for children’s advocacy, because if the Movement is scaled here, there is no excuse for not scaling it throughout California, and, then, given California’s size and diversity, throughout the country.
 
 And employing the Movement to make LA the best place to connect around kids is not rhetoric and not just a sound plan. We have successfully implemented it – now we need to scale it. We already have more than 200 L.A.-based Movement members, and they already played a major role in historic school equity reform and investments in early education. By scaling the Movement in L.A., with support from LA 2050 – bringing the number of LA movement members to over a thousand and connecting all of them- we will have the strong base of diverse, concentrated support that will surpass the power of any other interest group and produce the significant policy changes needed to ensure every child has the opportunity to reach their full potential.","The Children’s Movement targets the wide array of health, education, and child welfare policy issues that affect children. As such, this project will benefit all children in Los Angeles, and especially the high percentages of children who are low-income (over 50%), English learners, and of color, as these children often face a disproportionate number of barriers to attaining the necessary quality education and health supports. Without these supports, these children are at risk for not being prepared for work, college and life.
 
 Policy change allows for scaling so every child has access to the necessary supports. As noted, the Children’s Movement has already helped secure policy change that is improving the lives of LA’s children. The Local Control Funding Formula, an early success story of the Movement, provides additional resources for the nearly 400,000 English language learners, over one million students living in poverty, and over 9,000 foster youth in LA. The Movement also played a critical role in ensuring this year’s state budget agreement provides over $65 million to LA children for quality early learning opportunities.
 
 At scale, The Movement will help ensure that all children have access to quality early and K-12 education, but will also help ensure major policy change in other critical areas, such as home visiting, developmental screenings, oral health and summer and after school.
 
 While improving outcomes for kids is the primary goal of scaling the Movement, this project will also benefit the countless LA organizations, businesses, and individuals that care deeply about kids but are often frustrated by the slow rate – if any – change to improve their quality of life. These stakeholders often lack the capacity and resources to effectively participate in the policymaking process. And even when they do, they are disconnected from others, so their voice is often marginalized. The Movement will benefit all of these Pro-Kid supporters by providing them with easy, opt-in opportunities, tools, and resources to meaningfully engage in civic processes, and by bringing them together to amplify their voice. 
 
 And -- as the future of children impacts the future of the community as a whole --we see all of L.A. benefiting from this project.","Collaboration and connecting partners is the core of the Movement. What differentiates the Movement other models is that we are not just building coalitions among the advocacy groups that are already active on individual children’s issues, but we are (1) breaking down the siloes among those existing coalitions to generate broad support for each issue, and (2) expanding children’s advocacy to be inclusive of populations and groups that are rarely invited to be part of this conversation – such as individual businesses, community groups and faith-based congregations.
 
 Our 200+ cohort of current LA Movement members demonstrate this diversity, and also show how powerful the Movement can be at scale. Current members range from major organizations such as 211 LA, YMCA Metro LA, KIPP LA, the LA Chamber of Commerce, LAUP and Paros Los Ninos to organizations such as Vision to Learn, Junior League of Los Angeles, Los Angeles United Methodist Urban Foundation, LA Best Babies Network, Girls Club of Los Angeles, Coalition for Human Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, Los Angeles African American Women Political Action Committee, Acacia Blue Asset Management, National Council of Jewish Women of Los Angeles, Un Mundo de Amigos Preschool, Women’s Lawyers Association of Los Angeles, Foster Care Counts, Los Angeles Public Library, Gift of Life Resource Center, InnerCity Struggle, Trinity Baptist Children’s Center, Venice Family Clinic, Westwood Neighborhood Council, Pacific Asian Consortium in Employment, Compton Youth Activities League, League, BOOST Collaborative, Westside Kinship Support Services, Oak Grove Center, Hacienda La Puente USD, United Friends of the Children, CASA of LA, LA School Report, Asian Youth Center, and many others (please see www.childrennow.org/join for complete list of 900+ current members). 
 
 Each of these members brings added benefit to the project. This project is all about connecting the diverse support that already exists for kids in LA. Every new member that joins helps further the goal of making LA the most connected place for kids in the country.",
4102038,City Year Los Angeles Expansion into two PLAS High Schools: Jordan and Roosevelt,City Year LA and Partnership for LA Schools will build on our successful partnership by expanding to Roosevelt HS and Jordan HS.,Learn,2018027,2014,,,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,Jordan High School in Watts and Roosevelt High School in Boyle Heights,"As stated above, City Year and Partnership for LA Schools have worked closely together for a number of years. Both organizations serve schools and neighborhoods where students are at the greatest risk for dropping out. Our models complement one another, and expansion to Jordan and Roosevelt is the continuation of a successful partnership at elementary, middle, and other high schools in LA. 
 
 The Partnership has been turning around some of the lowest-performing schools in LA since 2008, by partnering with groups like City Year LA and implementing a comprehensive school transformation model. The model includes hiring the best leaders to run schools (Great Leaders), improving quality classroom instruction (Highly Effective Teaching), leveraging technology to provide individualized student support focused on accelerating proficiency in core subjects (College-Ready Students), increasing parent engagement by training families how to advocate for their children’s education (Engaged and Empowered Families), and building a movement among stakeholders toward a common vision for high student achievement and college readiness (Collective Action).
 
 City Year’s work is based on ground breaking research from Johns Hopkins University that identified three early warning indicators of students’ likelihood to drop out—poor attendance, negative behavior, and course failure in English and math. Their research found that a sixth grade student with any of these risk factors only has a 20% chance of graduating, absent intervention. The research also found that if students get to 10th grade on track (without risk factors) and on time, they are four times more likely to graduate.
 
 As such, corps members, in teams of 8-10 at each school, will be deployed to the 9th grades at Jordan and Roosevelt to work with the students who are failing or at-risk of failing math and English. Partnering with teachers, corps members will provide targeted tutoring, both one-on-one and in small groups, to ensure students are making progress in those subjects. Along with in-class support, corps members will also support whole school initiatives and lead out-of-class activities to expand and optimize learning time before and after school. 
 
 In one of the strongest areas of collaboration, City Year teams will integrate with Partnership staff and school leadership to develop or enhance programs and events that engage families, such as literacy and math nights.","The recent “Building a Grad Nation” report published by Civic Enterprises, the Everyone Graduates Center, America’s Promise Alliance, and the Alliance for Excellent Education, shows that for the first time in our nation’s history, the high school graduation rate is over 80%--and we are on pace to reach the goal of a 90% graduation rate by 2020. But the report also states that the 90% graduation rate is not possible without more progress in California—home to 20% of the nation’s dropouts. 
 
 With a graduation rate of 67%, and 11% of all of California’s students enrolled in its schools, the Los Angeles Unified School District’s progress will be a lynchpin for our national success. City Year LA and Partnership for LA Schools are turning around some of our city’s historically most-challenging campuses, where students struggle with academic achievement and the ongoing ramifications of generational poverty and violence. Both organizations are dedicated to making schools safe havens where students can learn and thrive. Combining our enhanced services – parent centers and community health facilities, etc., with additional adults serving as tutors, mentors, and role models – students will have a safety net to help them succeed. 
 
 Our collective efforts promote school-wide cultural norms and standards related to student responsibility, efficacy and interactions between peers, students and adults. When we can change school climates—encouraging trust, respect and support—the impact is profound. Students are interacting positively with adults, and feel a sense of pride and ownership in their school. School pride makes students more likely to work hard in the classroom, reach out to adults for extra support, and become more engaged in activities before, during, and after school, treating their school like the valuable community resource it should be. 
 
 This transformation will not just positively impact today’s students, but can ripple out to future generations. If students feel more connected to school and have greater success, they are more likely to graduate. If they graduate from high school, they will earn more than $1MM more in their lifetime than if they drop out. If they drop out, they are three times more likely to be unemployed and eight times more likely to go to jail. This will not only impact their lives, but their children and grandchildren. By breaking the cycle now, we can set up future generations for continued and further success.","In LA, approximately 23,000 students dropped out in 2013, one of the highest totals of any city in the country. For a single young adult such a fate can be tragic, but when the near majority of students from entire neighborhoods fail to graduate, the social and economic costs are profound and far reaching. At Jordan High School only 51% of students graduated in 2013, and the 2013 graduation rate at Roosevelt High School was 60%.
 
 Students who get back on track to graduate, however, bring widespread benefit to themselves and to their community. For example, every 1,000 new graduates in Los Angeles would collectively earn $15MM in additional earnings and increase the gross regional product by $21MM, in an average year. 
 
 In addition to the school-wide supports offered by Partnership for LA Schools, City Year LA will directly serve nearly 400 at-risk students in the 2014-2015 school year at Jordan and Roosevelt—providing them with targeted daily intervention to get them back on track to graduate. 
 
 Jordan High School is located in Watts, an area that has been historically plagued by high crime, gangs and violence. Jordan serves 640 students, who are an ethnic makeup of 83% Latino and 16% African American, with 26% of students classified as English language learners, 13% special education and 78% economically disadvantaged. Jordan has great improved academically since the Partnership’s involvement in 2011, demonstrated by a 93-point Academic Performance Index (API) jump in 2011-12, showing the highest gains among all LAUSD high school that year. Even with this improvement, the 2012-13 California Standards Test (CST) indicates that only 14% of Jordan students are proficient in English, and 8% proficient in math.
 
 Roosevelt High School, located in Boyle Heights, is a community hub of this high-poverty neighborhood. Roosevelt serves 2,470 students, who are an ethnic makeup of 99% Latino and 1% African American, with 22% of students classified as English language learners, 14% special education, and 87% economically disadvantaged. While Roosevelt has demonstrated substantial improvements since joining the Partnership in 2008, with English proficiency doubled and math proficiency tripled since the Partnership’s involvement, only 34% of Roosevelt students are proficient in English, and 10% proficient in math.","Over the last six years, City Year LA and Partnership for LA Schools have worked together to bring additional supports to our city’s most at-risk students. 
 
 By expanding City Year LA services to Roosevelt and Jordan, corps members will be at 10 out of 16 Partnership schools. When City Year partners with a new school, we look for a strong, positive school culture open to collaboration, committed to putting students first, and a fundamental belief in students’ potential to succeed. Partnership for LA Schools embodies this philosophy by providing students better instruction, safer campuses, enrichment programs & activities, and a rigorous curriculum that offers a platform to realize their full potential. Partnership for LA Schools greatly values City Year corps members’ added-value by bringing additional individual attention to students that teachers often cannot extend in the course of a school day. 
 
 In 2013, Partnership for LA Schools recognized City Year as their Community Partner of the Year at its annual Family and Community Engagement Awards. We both deeply believe that our students are more likely to succeed if they attend a Partnership school with City Year corps members in the classroom. Our collaboration runs so deep that we have opted to apply for this grant together, rather than compete against one another. 
 
 In our past collaboration, we have found these three factors to be critical: 1) strong leadership from both organizations – on the ground level at the schools as well as at the senior level of our organizations; 2) shared values and a deep belief in our students and their potential; and 3) a willingness to leverage partnerships and outside resources to support our students and our work.",0,

Allow citizens, institutions, and small biz to build our own networks and connections together!","A lot of the open standards hardware and open source software required for these private network deployments already exist. We just need to package it all together, in a way that makes it easy for anyone without network expertise to install it in their own homes or offices. 
 
 We will also provide legal templates for communities to incorporate their own 501c12 cooperatives or 501c4 community welfare networks, so that local experts can be paid for their professional services in connecting and maintaining these neighborhood networks. We have a pilot 501c4 project starting in the Northeast Los Angeles region, NELA-ISC.Net, where we will test our templates and open source tools in real world deployments. We welcome all other LA region communities to start their own neighborhood networks as well, and connect directly with each other. The downtown LA community in particular has great access to multiple global carrier transit providers, at carrier neutral facilities like One Wilshire, where connecting through neighbors directly will be much cheaper than AT&T or Time Warner.","Global competitive market access today requires fast broadband Internet connections. South Koreans visit major American cities and feel like they're in a remote rural area, where Internet speeds slow down to a crawl. If the US and its largest global cities (like LA) want to catch up, or at least attract digerati tourism, then they need to explore every option to connect all their citizens to gigabit or faster speeds. Renting this core infrastructure from cable and telco monopolists will simply not suffice. Silicon Beach will not wait.
 
 If LA wants to become a global startup hub by 2050, a Silicon Beach to truly rival the Valley farther north, then it needs to start getting connected now. We can't wait on stodgy old monopolist business models to support new markets or civic innovations. If we're lucky, we wont have any need for the old cable and telco monopolists at all before 2050. Their anti-neutrality extortionist tricks will no longer extract anything from our local economy.","LA area residents will benefit from faster Internet services at lower costs. Some families who couldn't afford any Internet access at all under cable and telco duopoly pricing will gain cost effective network access at home for the first time. 
 
 The poorest neighborhood families will receive network hardware and cooperative membership donations and subsidies, so that their home communications infrastructure can be built for them by local experts at little to no cost. 
 
 Local telecommunications experts will have a wider range of employment opportunities, in community-run networks closer to home.
 
 Civic and nonprofit institutions will benefit from more direct local constituent access online. 
 
 Local businesses will benefit from more direct access to their customer base, with less costly and annoying dependencies on remote third party service providers.
 
 New innovative startups will thrive in any area of LA where open Internet access is fast, cheap, and ubiquitous. Civic and social startups may see the most benefits from direct connections to potential customers nearby.
 
 LA tourism, especially by the well funded global digerati, will benefit from fast ubiquitous access in all the local vacation spots. Our great weather and global branding status will bring them in for vacation, but free WiFi and gigabit broadband will help keep them here while they work remotely.","Any local nonprofit or government institution can transform their own offices, buildings, and campuses into institutional hubs for local community network mesh peer connections and online services. Modern low cost and power-sipping hardware designed for laptops and tablets can easily be transformed into core router and data services infrastructure, all at lower gross long-term costs than any remote Internet cloud services. These online services can be situated directly within the places where they are most used. This both lowers online request latency and increases service reliability. During disasters of any form, in situ renewable power generation and backup batteries can keep this community infrastructure operational while the metropolitan infrastructure is being restored. These institutions and services should always reside at the core of our community networks, not at remote data centers far north or east of Los Angeles County.
 
 Open standards hardware and open source software vendors can each contribute to designs for low cost reliable community network infrastructure. Data Roads Foundation constituents in each community can serve as a ""standards group"", to determine the open standards most appropriate for implementation in their local area.
 
 Data Roads Foundation is already partnering with several open source and mesh hardware projects like Internet-In-A-Box.org, Commotion Wireless, Freedom Stack, Freedom Box, Open Telco, Guardian Project, Calyx Institute, and several open source mesh routing software projects. We are currently negotiating collaborations with several California based network hardware and maintenance service vendors. Anything that proprietary vendors refuse to provide can be created by and for ourselves, by using open technologies in our own communities.",1,
4102085,Imagination Workshop,Frogtown Ribbon Gardens increase access to affordable and healthy food in Los Angeles Food Deserts by installing planters in public parkways,Live,2018046,2014,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Northeast LA,"The implementation strategy for the Ribbon Gardens proposal primarily revolves around two concurrent elements: 1) fostering community support and engagement and 2) design, installation and planting of the various Ribbon Garden elements. Element one is achievable through Global Green’s extensive expertise at capacity building and community planning combined with the neighborhood’s demonstrated interest in food access through the creation of its community garden. Element two is achievable as the planters have already been designed and a planting palette has been developed. Further, we have previously tested this concept at the block level in April 2014 in Oakland, California, and from this event, we are prepared for neighborhood-scale integration. The implementation of the Frogtown Ribbon Gardens proposal will include the following steps: refine designs and communication materials; begin community outreach; acquire construction and planting materials; build planter kits; host community installation event; evaluate progress and build capacity for expanding Ribbon Gardens network to other food deserts in Los Angeles. 
 
 Following an outreach effort to build a neighborhood coalition and leverage the strength of an existing community garden and the existing network of fruit trees distributed throughout Elysian Valley, the implementation strategy follows two paths. First, kits will be created for each planter that include lumber in pre-cut dimensions, fasteners, assembly and planting instructions so that all that is needed for assembly is a power drill. Global Green will host an installation event for community members and volunteers to assemble, install and plant these planters. The second strategy is the distribution of assembly and planting instructions in a booklet for residents to make their own planters. Each planter has been designed with ease of fabrication in mind, and as a result, all lumber cuts are either 90o or 45o, and can be performed free of charge at most hardware stores. The average parkway strip in Elysian Valley is 180 square feet, and with an average of 24 strips per block, there is nearly a basketball court’s worth of planting space each. Using a conservative .3 yield, roughly 1,300 pounds of fresh food per block per year can be produced; a significant contribution towards a healthier diet in a neighborhood lacking access to healthy foods, and assuming an average produce price of $2 per pound, a significant cost savings as well.","The USDA has estimated that 23.5 million US residents live in food deserts- low-income areas where a significant share of residents is more than half a mile from the nearest market- and Los Angeles is home to many such pockets of limited food access. Elysian Valley is one of the most prominent of these food deserts, particularly due to its geography with the LA river to it’s east and south and 5 and 2 freeways to the north and west. As a result of this hemmed-in nature, ease of access to produce is particularly critical, and the Frogtown Ribbon Gardens proposal will help alleviate some of the pressures associated with living in a food desert while simultaneously advancing public discourse and engagement in a proactive, hands-on approach. Access to fresh and healthy food has been identified as one of the key indicators in many health issues in the American populace, and by empowering residents of Elysian Valley with the capacity to grow their own, the Frogtown Ribbon Gardens proposal continues already established community momentum in this vein.
 
 In addition to mitigating long-standing community food access issues in Elysian Valley, the Frogtown Ribbon Gardens serve as a neighborhood-scale pilot project for a readily implementable strategy to combat conditions found throughout Los Angeles' food deserts. The consciously designed and branded Ribbon Garden planter elements combined with the inherently community-driven nature of this effort will raise attention and advance conversation around this issue to foster complementary zoning and policy priorities by the City to further reduce the occurrence and effects of food deserts in LA. By the Fall of 2015, Los Angeles will have a neighborhood-scale pilot project demonstrating the viability of this approach. By 2050, the lessons learned from the project and the momentum gained through iterative adaptations in food deserts across the city will yield a robust network of community-driven food production and significant inroads made into the reduction of childhood obesity and other key indicators inherently tied to conditions found in food deserts.","The primary beneficiaries of this proposal are low-income households with limited access to fresh or healthy food in Northeast Los Angeles, specifically those in Elysian Valley. There is a real and demonstrated need for increased food access in many neighborhoods throughout Los Angeles County, and the Frogtown Ribbon Gardens provide a readily implementable, hands-on approach to mitigating the adverse health impacts associated with limited food options. This lack of access is underscored by the fact that Elysian Valley meets the USDA's criteria for a food desert - it is a low-income neighborhood where most of its residents live more than half a mile from the nearest market, a significant concern in this automobile dependent neighborhood. In addition to this USDA designation, as Los Angeles prepares its new Health and Wellness Element for the General Plan, the Planning Department has released data revealing that residents of Elysian Valley are in the lowest bracket for neighborhood food sources (9) and exhibits a childhood obesity rate of 28%. Elysian Valley’s childhood obesity rate is the key demographic indicator targeted for change by the Frogtown Ribbon Gardens. While this grant application seeks funds to support the research, production and installation of a Ribbon Garden network in Elysian Valley, the lessons learned as part of this pilot project will be applied to other communities in food deserts throughout Los Angeles. As a result, this means that while the initial impact of this proposal is primarily at the neighborhood scale, its long-term influence will be felt throughout Los Angeles. Secondary beneficiaries of the Ribbon Gardens proposal include visitors and residents of the neighborhood as the network of lush planters will help activate the streetscape and provide a more welcoming and lively public realm.","Three potential collaborators for this project- The Northeast LA Riverfront Collaborative, The Elysian Valley Community Garden and the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy. The initial concept for the Frogtown Ribbon Gardens was developed as a competition entry for the Northeast LA Riverfront Collaborative. Our proposal won an Honorable Mention from competition judges and signals the viability of this proposal. Moving forward, we intend to connect with the Collaborative to gain their regional expertise and assistance with implementing the Ribbon Gardens approach in other food deserts in Northeast LA.
 
 The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy operates the Marsh Street Nature Park, Elysian Valley Gateway Park, Steelhead Park and Oso Park- three of which are situated against the western edge of the LA River in Elysian Valley. Connecting the Ribbon Gardens to these community assets and, in turn, to the river, will help solidify their presence as important fixtures in the community which both beautify the neighborhood and provide fresh, affordable and healthy food.
 Perhaps the most productive potential partners to collaborate with in Elysian Valley are the residents that in 2010 rallied together to promote access to healthy food, and established a .25-acre community garden at the intersection of Blake Avenue and Rich Street. This community driven effort simultaneously signals a desire for access to healthy produce and a demonstrated ability to self-organize to achieve this vision - two elements critical for the successful implementation of the Frogtown Ribbon Gardens proposal. The need and demand for fresh fruit and vegetables in Elysian Valley, however, far outstrips the production capacity of its community garden.We hope that by working in conjunction with this group, Global Green can leverage their community expertise and local gardening experience to see our mutual vision for increased food access in Elysian Valley to fruition. 
 
 While we have not worked directly with any of these groups in the past, we are confident that we can reach mutually beneficial partnerships with all three to combat the effects of food scarcity in Elysian Valley. Three factors critical to the success of these proposed collaborations are 1) ensuring collaboration, not competition, 2) identifying and pooling our mutual assets to develop the best implementation approach and 3) developing strategies to continue the Ribbon Gardens network beyond the LA2050 grant.",1,
4102106,Unlock the Block: Bringing Play Streets to Los Angeles,Our idea is to bring play - designed and managed by residents - to the streets of LA through an initiative called Unlock the Block.,Play,2018058,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050play/projects/UnlocktheBlock.html,,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,,"‘Children must play, and children, if they live in the cities, must play in the streets.’ -1914 New York Times. For generations, residential streets served as informal play spaces for children. In recent decades, streets have become increasingly dominated by automobiles with little accommodation for other needs, even though many neighborhoods continue to lack safe, accessible spaces to play. More recently, research has revealed the key role of play in physical health and intellectual and social development. Cities like San Francisco and New York have responded to these issues by launching “play streets” programs: temporary, car-free street spaces where residents can play.
 
 In Los Angeles city our largest available public space is the 6,500 mile street network that connects our communities. Over the last year the City has recognized the value of re-purposing streets into multimodal space through efforts like the Great Streets Initiative, People St, and Ciclavia.
 
 We propose to build on the foundation of those programs to create a uniquely LA version of play streets called “Unlock the Block;” to do this we will enlist the help of our play “experts,” the children and families of LA. Over the next 12 months we will lay the foundation for a full-scale Unlock the Block (UtB) program by:
 1. Conducting outreach and workshops in up to 5 park-poor LA communities to understand how, where, and when residents want to play and help them envision up to 5 unique Unlock the Block demonstration events.
 2. Creating a Resource Guide for implementing a UtB event. Contents will include information on permit processes, logistics, programming and publicity, and a “Kit-of-Parts”- a box to be lent-out for any UtB event containing simple objects and activities that activate play and learning.
 3. Implementing up to 5 UtB demonstration events in partnership with communities. Each event will reflect the unique wishes of the host community but examples of programming include art, dance, gaming, martial arts/yoga. Events will be limited to residential streets selected for minimal impact on vehicular traffic congestion.
 4. Developing a proposal of policy and program recommendations to implement a citywide UtB program. This proposal will detail the need and feasibility of a play street program like UtB in LA and recommend a publicly-accessible, streamlined program housed by an appropriate city agency, to create sustainable access to temporary open space for all LA residents.","The beauty of Unlock the Block is its simplicity and agility. Within months of starting, we can bring safe and dynamic play to the people and places in LA with the highest need and demand. Within years, we can transform our streets—and the perception of our streets—into safe and sustainable spaces for community play. By 2050, it is feasible that everyone who wants to play can play regularly, regardless of the availability of traditional park resources in their neighborhood. 
 
 UtB increases access to play for all LA residents. While UtB starts in the City of LA, our ultimate goal is to replicate our model across LA County. Communities who currently lack adequate recreational spaces and programming will be able to creatively unlock new ways to play. UtB can be implemented by anyone, is low-cost, and can immediately increase access to safe and sustainable recreational opportunities across LA. UtB is not designed as a substitute for permanent parks; rather Unlock the Block builds on other efforts to increase park access by bringing open space to the front door of LA residents.
 
 UtB repurposes our streets to enable play. In the dense, urban environment of LA, a neighborhood street may be the only public space within walking distance for children and families. While streets are typically designed and used for vehicles only, there is great potential in reclaiming and sharing this space for other needs. UtB addresses one of these needs: play.
 
 UtB redefines play by letting residents determine what it means to play. Through direct community engagement we will simply ask residents of all ages how, when, and why they want to play and from their answers create new and innovative techniques for intergenerational play for all Angelenos. UtB will remind people of the infinite ways to engage with our community without the use of video games or social media and without traversing the city.
 
 UtB builds safer neighborhoods by putting more “eyes on the street” and increases social cohesion through promoting shared use of public space. Beyond the event itself, there is educational value in community members re-envisioning how their streets can be used. Play streets have the potential to increase awareness of the health and safety benefits of active transportation, like walking and bicycling. Furthering support for multimodal and safer streets through UtB, may also lead to other versions of play such as walking/jogging groups or bicycle clubs.","Unlock the Block (UTB) will benefit all communities in LA. But we will begin by addressing the needs of LA’s underserved neighborhoods. We will prioritize parts of the city where there is a shortage of open space, or parks, and areas that fall outside the boundaries of other community investment programs (like Promise Neighborhoods, Building Healthy Communities, or gang intervention programs), so that communities who have been left out of the discussion on where and how play takes place, will have the opportunity to contribute their ideas and make play happen in their streets, on their terms, with or without the presence of a park. We anticipate that, in the pilot phase Unlock the Block events will target neighborhoods in each of LA’s main geographic regions. In success, the city program is easily adopted or scaled to cover all of LA County.
 
 UtB will benefit all residents of LA. Play is important no matter what stage you are in in life and UtB aims to create safe and sustainable spaces for all ages and abilities. Play stimulates intellectual and physical development in youth, but today’s youth often do not have sufficient opportunities for play (for example, LAUSD is being sued for providing insufficient physical education classes and many parents do not let their kids play outside because it is not safe). For adults, play promotes better health through physical activity and reduced stress. All residents will also benefit from the increased social connectivity and cooperation that results from playing together.
 
 UtB will not only benefit a community’s residents; other stakeholders, including business owners, school staff, church members, and community organizations, will be empowered and better-connected through UtB efforts. All groups will work together to create regular, on-going, age- and culturally- appropriate programs that benefit their neighborhood socially, physically, and economically. While we expect each demonstration event to be unique to its neighborhood, the lessons learned during the process will be used to guide other neighborhoods in creating their own UtB event and to determine the changes needed to help pilot neighborhoods sustain or adapt their UtB programs.
 
 Our project will also benefit the City’s governing forces by building positive, working relationships with residents that can spill-over into other Government-led change initiatives.","Unlock the Block brings together a number of Los Angeles-based organizations currently working to improve play, health, environment, and economy for our under-resourced communities. Kounkuey Design Initiative’s (KDI) confirmed partners for this project include Community Health Councils (CHC) and Jubilee Consortium. Together our organizations bring experience and expertise in three areas critical to the success of our project:
 
 1. Knowledge in street design and experience activating non-traditional spaces for public use through a participatory design practice;
 2. Experience in advocating and creating policy change, and possession of relationships with policy makers;
 3. Experience in creating intergenerational programming and play throughout Los Angeles.
 
 KDI has been a member of the Coalition for an Active South Los Angeles (CASLA), led by CHC, for 2 years. Since late 2013, KDI and CHC have been working together (with 4 other organizations) on Free Lots Angeles, an initiative in South Los Angeles to transform vacant lots into active and productive community spaces. Over the past 2 years Jubilee Consortium and CHC, have worked together on a number of projects in Los Angeles, including a federally-funded chronic disease prevention effort.
 
 CHC brings to the project a strong expertise in policy work and community engagement. They have a wide presence and reputation among residents in the communities where we would like to pilot UtB, and also have relationships with City Council offices that can provide political support for making play accessible in park-poor communities. For more than two decades, CHC has been at the forefront of advocacy to eliminate health disparities by expanding healthcare coverage, increasing access to quality healthcare, and improving the built environment for under-resourced communities.
 
 Jubilee Consortium brings an expertise in designing active programming for all ages in non-traditional venues throughout Los Angeles. Jubilee Consortium has offered low-cost physical fitness and nutrition programs in underserved neighborhoods since its founding in 2001. For the past two years, Jubilee Consortium has trained community members to become Health Advocates for their communities as part of the United for Health collaborative led by CHC. The Jubilee Consortium creates healthy and just neighborhoods through enrichment opportunities and leadership programs centered on healthy lifestyles.",1,

CFS provides LA’s BEST field staff with comprehensive training and tools to help upper grade elementary school students make healthy life decisions, especially when they are dealing with stress or other mental and emotional challenges, and to reduce tolerance for violence within their own neighborhoods, all while promoting global and civic consciousness. The original curriculum uses the devastating problem of landmines and their impact on children in countries where they exist—particularly in Colombia—as an entry point and catalyst to encourage students to think and talk about similarities and differences between their lives in urban Los Angeles communities and the lives of their counterparts in Colombia. For example, local gangs use guns, violence and intimidation to establish their territory in Los Angeles, while drug cartels in Colombia use landmines to secure their cocaine fields. Both scenarios create climates of fear, and harm the innocent. As a result, children and families are not able to function freely within their own community. The latest version of CFS curriculum also incorporates the global issues of food security and justice in Haiti and the environment in China, which further facilitate the expansion of participants’ perspective and empathy. 
 
 
 As an LA2050 grantee, LA’s BEST will train field staff and high school students to implement CFS in benefit of children at three Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) elementary schools. Moreover, LA’s BEST will upgrade a learning environment at an LAUSD high school to make it more conducive to instruction. Finally, this project connects Los Angeles-area elementary school students, a Los Angeles high school, LA’s BEST field staff, LA’s BEST senior staff, as well as two other educational institutions through an online learning portal. The portal is a platform to train program workers to implement the Connecting for Success curriculum, which teaches children empathy, social awareness, global awareness, community connection, cross-generation connection, and demonstrates a clear path to a career in community service.","Through the proposed project, children will have access to after school enrichment programming and LA’s BEST will help people of all ages residing in Los Angeles feel safe while in their homes, neighborhoods, and places to play. As a result, residents will be more likely to access public spaces and develop an overall sense of community and love for their neighborhoods. 
 
 Connecting for Success teaches “the village” surrounding our children how to process complex emotions associated with violence, which is persistent in the neighborhoods we serve. Rather than seeing their community as a threat, children will see their community as a source of relief and empathy. By scaling this training, CFS increases the levels of empathy, safety and reassurance in children – replacing the fear that keeps them from accessing public play spaces in the first place. These children need to heal before we can expect them to want to play.
 
 Internal surveys reveal that each LA’s BEST site that has implemented Connecting for Success has experienced significant positive outcomes for staff and students. CFS has given once-shy youth a chance to speak up and take leadership roles, increased a sense of community and improved quality of relationships among participants and staff, as well as broadened participants’ worldview. Students have acquired life and leadership skills, particularly in making healthy, constructive decisions. Field staff report better competencies in responding to student needs, developing programs and leading activities, as well as improved abilities in active listening, patience, and connecting with children so that they feel comfortable seeking guidance through difficult situations. 
 
 LA’s BEST anticipates these outcomes at the partner High School and the three elementary schools that will launch CFS as a direct result of the proposed project. Moreover, once CFS is available to a broader audience via the proposed training webinars, LA’s BEST expects other youth service providers, their constituents, and the communities surrounding them to experience the above-described benefits of Connecting for Success. 
 
 By capturing the training and distributing material via a digital portal, the potential to scale impact of the curriculum is immeasurable. Not only will the portal allow training to reach the entire 2,300 field staff of LA’s BEST, benefiting more than 28,000 children the organization serves daily, it also could easily be shared externally.","Direct project beneficiaries include 20 local High School students, 60 children who attend three LAUSD elementary schools located in under-resourced communities, five LA’s BEST field staff, and one local high school counselor. Indirect project beneficiaries include the overall student body, staff, and faculty at local high school, as well as their families and the surrounding community, and the student bodies, staffs, and faculties at the three LAUSD elementary schools located in neighborhoods plagued by crime and poverty, as well as their families and residents of the surrounding neighborhoods. With the Connecting for Success training webinars, the proposed project has potential for exponential impact with infinite beneficiaries in Los Angeles and beyond.
 
 LA’s BEST is in the process of implementing Connecting for Success at all 194 after school program sites. Since 1988, LA’s BEST has grown from operating at 10 elementary school sites to 194, and now serves 28,000 children each day during the after school hours. Since the organization’s inception, LA’s BEST has provided more than 362,000 elementary students with out-of-school time learning experiences within safe, stable and stimulating environments to ensure short-term and long-term academic and social success. Further, since 1988, LA’s BEST has brought more than $300 million in public and private dollars to the City of Los Angeles, with a significant percentage used for salaries of youth development community staff hired from neighborhoods in which the children served by the organization reside. 
 
 All LA’s BEST sites—Los Angeles Unified School District elementary schools—are located in high-crime, low-income communities throughout Central, East and South Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley. Eighty percent (80%) of children served by LA’s BEST are Latino, 12% are African American, and about 4% are Asian. On average, 90% of students qualify for free or reduced-price lunch. While children from more affluent neighborhoods often spend out-of-school time partaking in activities that interest them, as well as help them to wholly learn and grow, like organized team sports, visual and performing arts, and digital learning experiences, children served by LA’s BEST generally lack these types of extracurricular opportunities within their homes, schools and communities.","Connecting for Success was developed specifically for children served by LA’s BEST by Development Without Limits (DWL), an organization led by the former Director of Staff Development at LA’s BEST, in collaboration with LA’s BEST stakeholders, and in consultation with renowned psychiatrist Dr. Mark Goulston. For the proposed project, LA’s BEST will again collaborate with Development Without Limits.
 
 LA’s BEST has a confirmed collaboration with SunnyEd on the proposed project. SunnyEdwill help LA’s BEST design the CFS portal and bring Connecting for Success to scale. In addition, support from the LA2050 grant will permit LA’s BEST to partner with SunnyEdto test the implementation of Connecting for Success by extending the training in several ways:
 Ø We propose training an additional cadre of LA’s BEST staff members in the implementation of the CFS curriculum for 3 sites. Staff training will include an orientation session of 12 hours for 6 staff members and follow-on training of 3 sessions. Each follow-on session prepares staff to introduce and implement a specific journey with students. 
 Ø Implementation of CFS would be carried out in moderninzed learning space e.g. the Incubator Hub on the campus of Locke High School in South Los Angeles. Through this project, LA’s BEST would partner with a local high school to update and use this space for instruction and for community needs. The updates would benefit the high school long after the conclusion of this project.
 Ø Through this grant, LA’s BEST in partnership with SunnyEd will extend the training to high school students at the high school in Los Angeles. These high school students will then form a mentoring group for the LA’s BEST elementary school students and would work alongside our staff in the implementation of CFS. Journeys would focus on those elements in the curriculum that foster positive connections and those that develop skills for facilitating conversations. The effort is aimed as much to connect younger and older youth as to extend the social action model to a new target (high school students). We propose to train 20 high school students in the CFS curriculum. Their work would support implementation of the program at each of three sites. High School youth would work with small groups of 4 to 5 LA’s BEST students and support the work of LA’s BEST staff debriefing experiences in small groups (checking for understanding, debriefing the journey).",1,

In LIFT-LA’s Care. Connect. Change. Project, low-income Angelenos map to jobs, a safe home, and a better future for their families by partnering with volunteer Advocates-- trained problem-solvers who work with Members to set and achieve goals. Using our innovative feedback tool, Constituent Voice, we can show that by strengthening all three aspects of members’ multi-dimensional well-being (personal, social, and financial foundations), people are more likely to achieve greater sustained economic mobility and stability. Results will influence other LA social service organizations to adopt a more human-centered approach to addressing poverty.","Care: Our approach is driven by a network of volunteer advocates who work to help people who often lack the resources and networks of support they need to overcome crises and get ahead.
 • Recruit and train a diverse body of 50 advocates serving at least 8 hours/wk on advocacy skills, important and relevant social issues and knowledge of community resources
 • Train volunteer advisors-- professionals who possess valuable financial, legal, and therapeutic expertise, to act as on-call coaches and experts for our advocates 
 • Train former members who have reached their goals to become LIFT advocates –powerful beacons of hope and resiliency 
 • Recognize our volunteer commitment and impact with Appreciation Days 
 • Engage advocate alumni, the best “evangeLIFTs,” to remain involved after their time of service 
 
 Connect: Members build stronger personal, social, and financial foundations that help to lift them out of poverty 
 • Members and advocates build a relationship that is member-led, goal-oriented, strengths-based, and rooted in dignity and respect 
 • Together, members and advocates partner to make progress on goals in housing, education, and/or employment and work to strengthen community connections, supportive relationships, and positive role models 
 • Our online database, Link, helps advocates connect to community resources that meet members’ needs and track progress against goals.The 2nd annual Imaginate! Member Appreciation Day will honor and celebrate community (Imaginate! attracts another 100 volunteer advocates)
 
 Change: We show that designing solutions around what members tell us they need is a powerful way to achieve results
 • Evaluate member feedback through Constituent Voice (CV), using tested customer relationship techniques used in the corporate world, adapted to the context of economic development (where people’s choice is often limited by the predominance of aid agencies and traditional service providers).
 • Members to fill out short online surveys to give feedback on the emotional and social aspects of our model; LIFT collects and analyzes the responses, triangulating economic progress against goals
 • Change the way we design and implement our program to improve performance and more effectively drive better results for our members
 • Share results and program adjustments with other LIFT stakeholders and communicate impact to influence other nonprofits in the area to become more accountable to the people they serve","Because it’s hard for anyone to find the right tools when navigating a complex system on their own, each of our members is paired with an advocate who sticks with them as they build the skills and access the resources needed to achieve economic stability. Advocates become the social network for disenfranchised Angelenos, providing one-on-one support and helping them connect to their community. The advocate engages the member in a goal-setting process to chart their own path to stability, based on immediate needs (e.g. shelter, food) and long-term aspirations (e.g. employment, affordable housing). During the process, they help build members’ confidence, connect to resources and support networks, and navigate to self-determined success.
 
 LIFT-LA is also training the next generation of leaders and citizen innovators—sending our alumni advocates into civic life with a changed perception of those living in poverty, and a lifelong commitment to social justice. No matter what field a volunteer advocate decides to move on to, their time with LIFT will forever affect their understanding of poverty and the power of community service.
 
 A sense of belonging extends beyond knowledge of community resources. It’s about knowing your voice is valued. In addition to civic engagement in meaningful service, we will also use CV to solicit member feedback and establish the correlation between personal and social foundations and economic stability. CV quantifies the importance of emotional and social supports by asking members to rate factors like: the member-advocate partnership, the tools and support advocates provide, having a role model in the community, and connections to community resources in helping members achieve their goals. 
 
 We believe that if we left prejudgement at the door and reached out to help our neighbor more often, LA would be a very different place. Poor people deserve the same supports that we all need to thrive—people in our corner, self-efficacy, and access to resources. However, systems designed to aid the most vulnerable populations are fragmented, wrought in bureaucracy, and based on false perceptions of the poor. This dichotomy is a contributing factor to LA being one of the poorest yet richest counties in the county. LIFT’s deployment of CV will serve as a cutting-edge model for other human service agencies in LA, helping them reach a new standard of service informed by member feedback that helps Angelenos better connect with their community.","LIFT Members:
 One in four Angelenos lives in poverty. In the area surrounding LIFT-LA’s office, the poverty rate is even higher – with 35% of people living below the poverty line. The south LA neighborhood where LIFT-LA is located is also characterized by a 17% unemployment rate (higher than unemployment in LA, California, and the US), substandard housing, and low educational attainment. While the majority of LIFT’s member base comes from this area, LIFT-LA receives members from around the county, reflecting the following demographics: 72% unemployed, 31% homeless or in unstable housing, 46% do not have health insurance, and 41% make less than $500 per month. Many come to LIFT after they have experienced a ""shaky ground"" moment -- a layoff, illness, eviction. Some were employed for 10 years and lost a job, others fell behind on paying rent. Poverty is a multi-faceted problem and all of its associated issues—unemployment, homelessness, hunger, illiteracy, health problems—are interlinked. 
 
 LIFT welcomes over 1,000 members each year wherever they are on the path to stability, and fills the gap in the social service system by offering individualized support and serving those who do not meet eligibility requirements of other agencies. LIFT members set goals (often within employment, housing, income stabilization, childcare, education) and work with an advocate to take the steps needed to achieve them.
 
 LIFT Volunteer Advocates:
 The majority of our volunteers are college students (from USC, CSUN, Azusa Pacific, College of Mt. St. Mary’s, CalState LA and others) while other volunteers are LA residents with the passion and time to offer. Advocates commit to serving at least 8 hours/week during their engagement, but many serve as many as 20 hours/week. Most LIFT of these advocates are bilingual able to provide services in Spanish to our majority monolingual population. LIFT also engages specialists and community leaders, such as former LIFT members who have achieved their goals, retirees, corporate professionals, veterans, to serve as advisors to advocates at LIFT’s site. 
 
 LIFT-LA stakeholders (advisors) who want to serve but are unable to make the 8-hour minimum commitment, facilitate one-hour specialized group workshops for LIFT members. For instance, in Beyond the Bank, LIFT-LA’s financial literacy workshop series, professionals serve as volunteer instructors alongside Economics students in USC’s Joint Education Program (USC service learning initiative).","As one of LIFT’s seminal values is collaboration, an essential part of our model is creating reciprocal partnerships with strong social service organizations to provide comprehensive member service. We are embedded in the LA social service community and often referred to as the “safety net for the safety net” by grateful community partners who cannot serve families (due to eligibility restrictions) or provide the individualized support LIFT offers. LIFT connects members to its base of trusted community partners throughout LA. Confirmed collaborators include:
 
 • The Magnolia Place Community Initiative (MCI) unites 75+ organizations in an effort to create scalable community improvement. As many of the organizations in the MCI are focused on supporting children, LIFT fills the gap with a dual-generation approach to poverty alleviation helping parents work towards achieving financial stability to support their family unit. LIFT-LA is truly the partner that MCI has been waiting for— the connective tissue mobilizing the effectiveness and efficiency of the network, and making sure that community members understand, access, and utilize the resources available to them. LIFT-LA will be working with MCI to track these warm hand offs made to other partner agencies.
 
 • Alliance for Children Rights, SAJE, Connect LA, EARN, REDF, 211, Communities in Schools, Pathways for Children, the Rightway Foundation, and HeadStart are additional confirmed partners. All are doing meaningful specialized work within limited service areas. With its nimble approach, LIFT-LA is able to increase the capacity of the social service sector to provide more customized and comprehensive support.
 
 • Colleges and Universities throughout LA. USC awarded LIFT-LA for our partnership in community engagement. 
 
 • Capital Group Companies employees volunteer as Advisors and financial experts with LIFT-LA’s Beyond the Bank workshop series.
 
 • Keystone Accountability works with LIFT to develop and test a system to collect continuous client and volunteer feedback. Keystone is an expert in gathering, analyzing, and amplifying client voices in order to foster a culture of accountability. Keystone’s founder and CEO, David Bonbright, worked with LIFT over the last year to design CV, and will continue working closely with LIFT’s Executive and Program Team to effectively implement CV in LA. We are excited about this partnership and its potential to ensure our responsiveness to the needs of our members in LA.",
4102123,Open Grove,"Develop plans to expand composting in LA creating economic opportunities, reducing pollution, supporting local farms and alternative energy.",Live,2018072,2014,,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,"LA is poised to be a national environmental leader after adopting the country's most far-reaching waste and recycling overhaul —the Zero Waste LA Franchise. LAANE and the Don’t Waste LA Coalition led the campaign to adopt this system, approved in April 2014. The new system calls for LA to divert 90% of waste from landfills and requires recycling for all customers. As part of meeting this ambitious diversion goal, waste haulers are required to submit an organic waste collection plan for all multifamily and commercial customers, as food scraps and yard trimmings make up a third of what is sent to landfills. However, the region currently lacks the capacity to process all of our organic waste, creating an opportunity for innovation and investment. Given the benefits of converting organic waste to compost, our project will lay the groundwork for LA to take advantage of this opportunity.
 
 We will create a development plan to spur organics processing at various scales—through the City with the potential construction of public organics facilities, in partnership with responsible waste haulers committed to expanding this sector, and community-based entrepreneurs. With the City, this would entail developing a market analysis for the financing and construction of an anaerobic digester, a sustainable technology that processes food waste into compost and biogas. We will conduct research on types of anaerobic digestion including case studies from the U.S. and Europe, financing models, and public/private partnerships. Based on our research, we will support implementation of a range of infrastructure and entrepreneurial opportunities and will advocate for enabling policies at the City level.
 
 We will identify funding and potential sites for composting operations, including working with CalRecycle on grants for smaller-scale operations. To facilitate private sector opportunities, we will study the regulatory framework and identify necessary policy interventions.
 
 Partnering with the LA Food Policy Council, we will explore local entrepreneurial opportunities. This includes pilot projects like neighborhood-based composting for community gardens; programs to ensure the cleanest and safest compost streams; partnerships with large food waste generators such as LAUSD and restaurants, and the potential for worker cooperatives.","LA businesses and residents send about 1.2 million tons of food scraps and yard waste to landfills each year. Such compostable “organic” material forms over 1/3 of the City’s landfill waste. 
 
 When food decomposes in landfills, it emits methane, one of the most significant contributors to climate change. The biogas created from anaerobic digestion of food scraps will help LA move towards renewable energy and off carbon-intensive energy sources. 
 
 While local farming is strong, the three-year drought, soil erosion and poor soil quality have big impacts on agriculture and the environment which compost can help address. 
 
 Over 45% of LA families are unemployed or make below the threshold for self-sufficiency, and 26% of LA households are without health coverage. Composting creates twice the jobs t of landfilling and an estimated 2,500 jobs could be created in this field. By ensuring they are quality jobs with benefits, this new industry will help lift hardworking families to self-sufficiency. 
 
 We have an opportunity to transform our food scraps into a valuable resource for communities, the economy, and the environment. Developing the necessary infrastructure for processing organics and converting it to clean, renewable energy and fertilizer benefits LA. Given the quantity of organic waste generated by LA’s restaurants, markets, businesses and homes, this is potentially a huge scale enterprise with multiple benefits for LA. LA has over 8,000 restaurants, 70% of whose waste is food scraps which could be turned into valuable commodities. 
 
 LA will be a healthier place without organic waste in landfills, emitting harmful emissions and using scarce land resources. Food is healthier and safer when grown using soil enriched by compost and farms need less water, fertilizers, and pesticides. The biogas produced from anaerobic digestion of food waste will be a stable form of renewable energy from reliable technologies. Our plans will ensure that workers at the new facilities have quality jobs including family health benefits. The city’s economy will be healthier with this growing industry contributing to economic activity and creating entrepreneurial opportunities.
 
 By 2050, if the plan is fully implemented, all organic waste will be treated at anaerobic digester facilities or other composting operations, and landfills will be a historic phenomenon. Thousands of LA families will have better jobs, and the air and water will be cleaner.","This project has the potential to benefit everyone in the region by tackling a critical environmental and infrastructure problem. By reducing air and water pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, this project will benefit the health of the region’s inhabitants. By creating opportunities for new jobs and new businesses, the project will benefit LA’s working families and local economy. By providing valuable healthy compost to urban farmers, the project will help them improve local food production, reducing their need for water and fertilizers that cause water pollution. 
 
 The project will create opportunities for small-scale entrepreneurs and responsible waste haulers who can be part of the comprehensive plan required for processing organics. Private investors who are willing to forgo quick returns will have opportunities for innovative public/private partnerships with the City to finance the construction of an anaerobic digester. 
 
 The project will benefit communities throughout Los Angeles, especially those disproportionately affected by unemployment, concentrated poverty and lack of healthy food access, based on data from the American Community Survey and CA Employment Development Department (EDD). Composting efforts including anaerobic digestion create more than double the number of jobs as disposal. That means creating thousands of jobs—careers that will sustain families. The range of employment opportunities will extend from entry-level positions to highly specialized science, engineering, and technical careers. A complementary City policy for the new facilities in the waste industry can incentivize job quality and priority for hiring local residents, providing training, and including individuals with barriers to employment.
 
 The project will benefit everyone who lives or works in LA by providing cheaper energy that is less polluting and renewable. Biofuels generated through a city-owned facility can provide a renewable source of energy to power homes and businesses and fuel the city’s fleet. The entire region will benefit from cleaner air due to the reduction in methane emissions from diverting food waste away from landfills.
 
 Based on our work over the last several years on the Don’t Waste LA campaign, communities affected by the concentration of waste and recycling facilities such as the Northeast San Fernando Valley and East LA, will be areas where our outreach will be very targeted and deliberate.","To build support for expanding composting, developing anaerobic digestion, and to contribute to our research and planning, we are building a broad and diverse working group of organizations and individuals concerned with food waste disposal, healthy locally grown food, and creating new industries for local workers. 
 
 Our lead confirmed partner is the LA Food Policy Council (LAFPC), which has a network of over 600 food organizations. Their 100 urban agriculture organizations include experts, practitioners, and composting entrepreneurs. It brings its policy and expertise to the DWLA Coalition and took the lead in drafting language that was adopted promoting an ambitious organics program for the City’s requirements of waste haulers in the Zero Waste LA System. LAFPC advocates for healthy food access policies and coordinates projects such as market makeovers, legalizing street vending, and parkway gardens.
 
 We have had conversations with the Mayor’s Office and the Bureau of Sanitation on anaerobic digestion and will be collaborating with other City officials and departments as the project moves forward. We are working with Councilmember Koretz’ office to identify policies that could support the expansion of composting. We hope to involve In the Public Interest for advice and assistance regarding financing that assures accountability and good jobs as the city explores forms of public-private partnerships to finance and build an anaerobic digester.
 
 We are working with architect Professor Curt Gambetta, who focuses on waste and recycling infrastructure issues and has collaborated with students to design a neighborhood-scale compost network. We worked with him co-writing a broadsheet on waste and recycling facilities’ impacts and design, and plan to continue collaborating in future.
 
 We are working with Antioch Professor Gilda Haas to explore opportunities for co-operative enterprises in the waste and recycling industry, focusing on possibilities in the organics waste stream. Through this collaboration, we will be able to identify and develop the necessary training for compost-related jobs. 
 
 The Sierra Club, Angeles Chapter, was a founding member of the Don’t Waste LA Coalition and is a long-time advocate for increasing composting through its Organics Project. In addition to expertise, the chapter has over 40,000 members who can help inform and support new infrastructure and spread the word.",1,
4102135,The Los Angeles Service Academy,1,Learn,2018077,2014,,,1,1,1,0,1,0,,LASA teaches high school students how things work in Southern California.,"LASA begins with questions. How does a city run? How does a vast metropolitan region like Los Angeles work? Which institutions are responsible for moving water, people, food, and power from points A to points Z? How are such institutions and agencies funded and run? Who runs them? How can neighborhoods be made more livable? What does an elected official do all day? What role do cultural institutions play in the life of greater Los Angeles? What about businesses and non-profits? What are the potential educational and career paths for young people interested in civic, civil, and public service in the Los Angeles Basin? We encourage high school students to ask these -- and so many more -- questions, and then we work together to answer them.","The 2050 metric is really important to us at LASA. We embrace the long-term. We work with a fairly small group of participants at a time. We are about to welcome our third LASA class (in early August). It has thirty high school juniors. We have three collegiate interns and about a half dozen teachers. That's a small footprint in terms of making a difference. But: we will soon have close to a hundred LASA students, past and present, with which to build foundational change in greater Los Angeles. Then 130, 160, 190, and so on. Even thinking of thirty-per year (we expect to expand that number) gets us to well over 1000 LASA-ites by 2050. If, in the long-term, we can establish networks of knowledge, civil and civic service and awareness, and public obligation among our graduates, we will have accomplished our highest goals. In other words, there's a scenario in our head about problem solving in LA in 2050. And the principals involved in wrestling with said problem are LASA graduates -- they've built knowledge over the years, they've established efficient networks of collegiality and collaboration, and they get down to solve infrastructural problems and puzzles with greater skill and vision because of all this.
 
 Of course there are short-term goals. Teach a broad cross section of kids about LA; draw a diverse group of young people who may come from very different circumstances or parts of LA together, allow them to discover commonalities of experience and curiosity. Put them into the landscape, teach them about going to college, show them how transit works, empower them to use libraries well help them learn to express themselves in public settings; have a lot of fun on a Saturday LASA day. 
 
 We think LASA is spot on with experiential learning objectives. We think greater Los Angeles is an astonishing learning laboratory for history, policy, landscape, culture, and urbanism, and we think no one is too young to begin to grapple with his or her place in the metropolis. We think LASA helps make LA navigable, and we think that we empower and built the confidence of the young people who join us each year.","At the very center of the experience, we know LASA benefit four specific groups. First and foremost are the high school participants themselves. Those benefits accrue, we think, in post-LASA years, in that we make efforts to keep in touch, to track our graduates into next phases of their lives and budding careers. Second, we think the program benefits our collegiate interns. Since inception several years ago, these have been Occidental College students solely, a reflection of that college's commitment to public/civic service through the Urban and Environmental Policy Institute (UEPI). Neither of LASA's directors are affiliated with Oxy (one of us is at USC, the other at Colburn School of Music). These interns see their undergraduate training enhanced by their interaction with the city and our high schoolers. Third, we believe the teacher participants, some of whom have been with us since we started, benefit from taking their curricular interests into the city and its landscapes. They also benefit from collegial exchange with their colleagues from other institutions. Fourth, co-directors Bill Deverell and Doug Smith benefit from the opportunity to work with younger, non-collegiate students on this regular basis and get to enhance networks of collaboration throughout greater LA. 
 
 Those are focused beneficiaries. There are more, we think. Our LASA students take their experience back to their families. These families often repeat our fieldtrip experiences; we go to point A on a given Saturday and the student brings her family back there on the next Saturday. The friends of our LASA students benefit similarly, and we recruit new LASA students from these ranks.
 
 Most widely, we believe LA benefits. Not yet, perhaps. But we think the lines of friendship, knowledge, and commitment to public service and awareness cannot help but make LA both work better and become a better place to live and work. That's LASA's promise, we think, and it makes it all very exciting to us.","LASA thrives on and can only work through partnerships. It is in fostering these partnerships -- and in showcasing them to the students -- that we further and strengthen our foundation of collaboration across the great city. Our key institutional partners are two institutions: the Huntington Library and the Los Angeles Public Library. These are our base camps; we meet here, we use materials from here, we explore relevant issues on top of their materials and outward from them into the region. But other partnerships with individuals and their institutions are every bit as critical. Our experts drive LASA. We are proud of the relationships we have built with, for example, the Los Angeles Times (esp. architecture critic Christopher Hawthorne and transit reporter Laura Nelson); Raphael Sonenshein of Cal State LA; Rob Salzman of the Los Angeles Police Commission; Maria Cabildo of the East LA Community Corporation; Robert DeGroot of the Southern California Earthquake Center; Laurence Frank of LA Trade Tech and former mayor Villaraigosa's office; Rich Llewellyan of Mayor Garcetti's office; Ken Brecher of the Library Foundation of Los Angeles; Bernadette Glenn of the WHH Foundation; Jeff Kightlinger and Marjorie Wheeler of the Metropolitan Water District; the Port of Los Angeles and the Los Angele Harbor Commission, esp. David Arian; Deputy LAPD Chief Sandy Jo MacArthur; Steven Koblik of the Huntington Library; and others. Our network of colleagues and collaborators is expanding, and we are proud of the fact that the LASA participants get to meet high-profile decision-makers and leaders across a broad swath of institutions, agencies, and educational centers in the region.",0,1,

Transportation is the spine around which cities get built and investments in transit, walking and biking can reinvent neighborhoods, making our county a more sustainable, healthy and prosperous place. Move LA is like the Johnny Appleseed of transit — we are seeding a countywide public conversation about what to build next and to find out which ideas take root. This conversation couldn’t be more fundamental to LA’s future. We ask you to help us fund a digital media campaign that allows us to engage more Angelenos and prompt them to contribute meaningfully to this civic process. LA is a big place. We need to work together to make it great.","As the coalition of business, labor and environmental groups instrumental in getting the Measure R half-cent sales tax on the ballot in 2008 — the game-changing investment in transit referred to above — Move LA has street cred in building coalitions and consensus. Every year since Measure R won (with 67% of the vote!) our coalition has gathered at an annual “transportation conversation” that draws elected officials, agency leaders and other influencers as well as ordinary citizens. The 500-plus people who come together are champions of more sustainable and affordable transportation and housing choices in walkable, bikeable neighborhoods.
 
 We’re implementing an ambitious campaign to keep this conversation going and take it deep into the grassroots with a canvass that’s helping us meet people in neighborhoods. At the grasstops, we’re co-convening cities in partnership with LA County’s five most active councils of government. We’re also taking this conversation on the road to meet with coalition partners and to cultivate new ones. We’ve got a good game at the grasstops, but we need resources for the technology, tools and talent that will allow us to implement a digital platform for even broader grassroots engagement. Social media and the analytics that make these communications tools effective will help us to connect with people who can carry on the conversation with their neighbors. We need these tools to identify people who really care about these issues, and to cultivate local champions who will like us and share our messages on Twitter and Facebook, and spread the word in other ways. 
 
 We are working with NationBuilder — a company we met at an LA 2050 discussion about social connectedness — to integrate our database with our donor base, and with our website, email, social media and supporters recruited by our canvass. We want to hire a digital media strategist who can help us design an integrated social communications plan that works in sync with our grasstops game and helps us orchestrate a campaign that inspires action and motivates engagement. We want to hire a half-time social media manager to help the whole staff implement the plan.","With transformational transit investments: Southern California has long been infamous as a place without a center, growing ever outward into a disorganized, disaggregated, diverse region that sprawls over 191 cities and 38,000 square miles of heavily trafficked roads and single-family neighborhoods. The distance between jobs and housing — especially affordable housing — has exacerbated not only traffic and air pollution but also a lack of social cohesion. We spend so much time driving we barely have time for family and friends, and until fairly recently it was unlikely very many Angelenos would connect on public transit, in public spaces, or while walking or biking down the street. Investment in transit, bike lanes and wider sidewalks, however, is changing the tenor of life in our neighborhoods, providing a landscape where we can watch the parade of life go by and literally bump into each other, providing a sense of shared space and civic culture. 
 
 By getting our ""mojo"" back: The success of Measure R in creating game-changing resources to help solve seemingly intractable problems has inspired elected officials to work together to make Los Angeles a better place. This belief that we can work together and make a real difference is what we call ""mojo,"" and LA’s got its mojo back! We want many more Angelenos to hear and be inspired by this story. Elected officials have begun talking about the possibility of another sales tax on the 2016 ballot and we want many more Angelenos to be involved in these discussions: What should be funded? More light rail? BRT? Grand Boulevards? Shared-use mobility hubs? Places to walk and bike? Complete streets? Green streets? All of the above? 
 
 Making the dream a reality is a decades-long process that involves a multitude of decisions, many of which are very, very local. We are constructing 100 rail stations and a dozen new transit lines through many neighborhoods. We need to talk about how to do this. How should we connect neighborhoods with stations? What about the gentrification that can occur in neighborhoods once transit provides fast and easy access to jobs, shops, culture and entertainment? Will people who use transit the most still be able to live near it? How big and dense should new development be? How can we preserve single-family neighborhoods? 
 
 By working together on these issues we can ensure that LA becomes a much better place to connect.","Connecting the people of Los Angeles County around a sustainable transportation and neighborhood agenda will benefit everyone — because we all sit in the same traffic, breathe the same air, and feel the impact of global warming. Sustainable transportation and development can reduce all this negative fallout even as the population grows — meantime increasing access to opportunity in terms of jobs, education, fresh food, health care, entertainment, culture, parks and recreation, our friends and neighbors. Moreover, the zero- and near-zero emission technologies we are promoting will allow us to move freight to and from the ports without having to sentence those who live along our heavily trafficked goods movement corridors to intolerably high rates of asthma and other chronic illness.
 
 Not everyone needs to live in a walkable transit-oriented neighborhood — cars (privately owned or shared) will likely be a part of the LA landscape for decades to come. But providing more transportation and housing choices is essential for an increasingly diverse population that includes aging baby boomers, a millennial generation saddled with student debt and that can’t afford to own cars, and the rapidly increasing cohort of single-person households. Moreover, making it possible for more people of all ages and incomes to live in places where they don’t need to drive as much or own as many cars can will also help increase disposable income. People who can get by with one less car save about $10,000/year, according to the American Automobile Association, enabling them to save up for college or a down payment on a home. And for people who can’t afford a car, a robust transit system and the ability to get to stops and stations on foot or on bike offers both more affordable mobility and better access to opportunity. 
 
 The construction and operation of an expanded transportation system also creates good union jobs with good wages. LA Metro’s project labor agreements and construction careers program ensures that a share of all construction jobs will go to people who are struggling to make a living in LA’s low-income communities. Moreover, in addition to careers in construction and operation, additional jobs are created in the professional, scientific and technical services sector, and in retail — providing a boost to the regional and local economies and to local businesses countywide.","NationBuilder and a digital media strategist are the partners we believe are essential to making this larger outreach and engagement effort as robust as possible -- we have signed a contract with NationBuilder and are interviewing strategists now. Our goal is to use a digital media platform to leverage all our partnerships in order to collaborate with as many people as possible. Move LA began as a coalition of business, labor and environmental interests working in collaboration with government agencies and elected officials, and the coalition has continued to expand to include: faith-based organizations, public health advocates, bike and pedestrian activists, tenants rights activists, academics, affordable housers, design professionals, architects, developers, student organizations, community-based groups, neighborhood organizations, and funders.
 
 Our outreach plan (discussed above) includes organizing and staging convenings in partnership with the five biggest councils of government (which represent most of the cities in the county), and we are organizing events with Latino leaders, the Urban League, Community Health Councils, environmental health and environmental justice groups, and all of the business organizations and community groups interested in clean goods movement. We’re scheduling presentations to the LA Business Council, the building trades and LA County Federation of Labor, to seniors and the disabled, engineering groups, and to the LA chapters of the Urban Land Institute, American Institute of Architects, the American Planning Association, and the American Society of Landscape Architects. We will meet with the movie studios, the LA County Museum of Arts, the Dodgers, area hospitals, and other large employers who have sponsored our work in the past. We are planning a student transportation summit. We are a founding member of a regional equity collaborative -- of national nonprofits, community-based organizations and funders -- that will be involved. And all the while our on-the-ground canvass operation will continue to knock on doors throughout the county. 
 
 Most of these partners have been with us in the trenches since Measure R. We add new partners often but not all in this list are confirmed and we hope to keep discovering more. The three factors critical to the success of this collaboration are: 1) sufficient resources; 2) a smart strategy that effectively engages our partners; 3) our ability to sustain the organizing effort over time.",

Tying employment, housing, place, business, and lifestyle is critical to building sustainability, and the Center will serve as a catalyst for achieving broader community and personal empowerment goals that will help low income families in South LA most adversely impacted by economic divestment.
  
 As landowner, NHS will serve as lead partner with the City of Compton, METRO CDC, and the Pacific Coast Regional Small Business Development Corporation. NHS acquired the 28,283 sq ft building and surrounding parcel in early March 2014 and we have entered the site planning and renovation phase of the project. One of our main priorities is to repurpose the facility and provide highly needed economic development, healthy living, and job training services for the Compton community. NHS plans to house 5-8 initial non-profit groups by fall 2014 with full tenancy by the end of 2014 if possible. As a part of that plan, our one year goals and implementation timelines include:
 • Upgrade the existing facility to accommodate 5-8 tenants (August - Dec 2014);
 • Subcontract to create Computer Training and Technology Center (August - Oct 2014);
 • Partner with Metro CDC to create office for youth job training/entrepreneurship programs (August - Sept 2014);
 • Partner with Pacific Coast Regional Small Business Development Corporation (PCR) to establish on-site Business Incubator Program (Sept – Nov 2014);
 • Phase in green technology upgrades (solar electric panels, low-water fixtures, solar hot water) and community garden plots as a part of the structural retrofits and property rehab (Sept 2014 – March 2015).
 
 Short term (1-2 years) goals and the implementation timeline for the CSC include:
 • Finalize a local land use plan with community partners and adjacent land owners (Fall 2014);
 • Establish Health & Fitness rooms, a Healthy Living Café, free library, child play area, and permanent organic gardens (Summer 2015).
 • Create a Community Green Education & Conservation Center (Summer 2015);
 • Create a farmer’s market enterprise to support the Center (Fall 2015);
 • Serve approximately 250 families (Sept – Dec 2014);
 • Serve approximately 5,000 families (Jan – Dec 2015).","As low income communities in South LA continue to struggle with ongoing blight and work towards long-term neighborhood revitalization, the focus becomes how to help reverse the significant environmental, social, health, and economic impacts of long term divestment on residents and families. Of primary concern is how to deal with the growing challenges among these neighborhoods regarding chronic unemployment/underemployment, reduced capital access for small business development, the ongoing threat of food insecurity, substandard transit options, skyrocketing housing costs, educational disparities, and youth disengagement. Decades of studies confirm that these problems disproportionately affect underserved and impoverished communities. For example, the current surge in home purchase and rental costs means housing now consumes over 65% of average median income on average in LMI communities. Add to that consistently high unemployment (15%), a nearly 3 to 1 ratio in loan denial rates, and limited access to mass transit and healthy food - which has been proven to impact employment and educational performance – and the need for greater resources to meet basic economic demands and achieve a moderate living standard becomes evident.
 
 In response, the Center for Sustainable Communities will provide the people of Compton in South LA a facility that will serve as a hub to build a solid foundation for creating neighborhood sustainability over the next decades. Specific impacts include 1) Improving the job readiness and overall skills base of local workforce; 2) Providing healthy living services and resources to residents; 3) Reaching and training residents in IT and tech skills; 4) Increasing lending access and originating loans for small business owners; 5) Engaging youth (ages 5-24) in on-site green education and mentoring programs; 6) Assisting families through our CSC Homeownership Center; 7) Establishing community garden projects in surrounding neighborhoods; 8) Establishing home garden projects with youth workers. 
 
 In addition to meeting crucial resource access needs for families, the Center will allow its partners to share sustainability concepts that drive planning approaches in other impacted communities throughout South Los Angeles and LA County.","The Center will serve hundreds of low income families in a region that has endured many of the worst impacts of the economic downturn and decades of blight. NHS has a long and very successful history of serving low-to-moderate income neighborhoods. For 30 years, 90% of our client base has been low income families residing in the poorest and most neglected neighborhoods of LA County. In 2013, 95% of the people we help were considered low income and 84% were ethnic minorities. 
 
 As the facility grows, the Center will expand to help hundreds of small business owners, neighborhood non-profit groups, and homeowners through on-site services and regional partnerships with community service groups, community development agencies, green organizations, health providers, technology professionals, schools, and municipalities. At least 50% of our tenants will be service-driven. By 2015 we expect to partner with the adjacent Los Angeles Conservation Corps Campus to magnify our regional impact, collaborate to attract a wide range of volunteers for our municipal water and green projects, and reach out to the educational community as the Compton Creek Project evolves.
 
 With respect to our community outreach efforts, engaging surrounding neighborhoods in the early stages of the planning process has already yielded an overwhelmingly positive response by critical stakeholders and the community toward the development of the Center. As a part of our initial outreach plan, NHS is hosting a series of summer BBQs with its new neighbors to meet, assess community needs, and clarify the focus for the project from the community perspective. The project and landscape architects are deeply involved with this process so that they can adapt community strategies into the program and facility design more effectively. The more this vision evolves, the more we see that establishing the Center will serve and help the people and the City of Compton while also creating sustainable jobs for residents.","NHS has entered into agreements with the City of Compton, METRO CDC, and the Pacific Coast Regional Small Business Development Corporation as primary partners and is formalizing arrangements with the Los Angeles Conservation Corps, the LA County Department of Health, the LA Food Policy Council, Community Services Unlimited, and the Los Angeles Department of Neighborhood Empowerment to provide expertise, customized services, training opportunities, and cross-collaborative projects through the Center. 
 
 Critical factors include: 1) a commitment to build sustainability in Compton/South LA, 2) eliminating “silo organizing” on common regional issues, and 3) applying skills gained from managing eight years of neighborhood revitalization consortia during the economic crisis to assist in better serving low income communities. 
 
 Each partner brings unique experience and value:
 • City of Compton – Compton contributed bond funds to acquire the property and will facilitate project approvals, general public outreach, and program advocacy. 
 • METRO CDC – Providing neighborhood outreach, employment training, community engagement, and referral services for youth and young adults. 
 • Pacific Coast Regional Small Business Development Corporation – As a tenant, PCR offers financial, educational and consulting services to small business owners and start-ups. 
 • Los Angeles Conservation Corps – LACC will partner on environmental and urban reclamation projects in the Compton Creek watershed and surrounding area and will provide training, education, and mentoring for youth.
 • Community Services Unlimited – As one of the largest urban Community Supported Agriculture food distributors in South LA, CSU will offer urban gardening, green business resources, and cross training expertise. 
 • Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors – Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas’ office provides project level funding opportunities and overall support for the Center. 
 • LA Food Policy Council – Has agreed to help NHS coordinate events, outreach, and advocacy through the Center in addition to serving as a partner in creating community gardens. 
 • Los Angeles Department of Neighborhood Empowerment – As the oversight agency of neighborhood councils, LADNE will provide extensive outreach, special project coordination, and a grassroots connection to regional community groups. 
 • LA County Department of Health – Committed to helping us create living projects and support our clinic plan.",1,
4102160,Support LA’s celebrated food truck culture by helping food truck entrepreneurs grow and create jobs,1,Create,2018093,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050create/projects/OpportunityFund.html,,1,1,1,1,1,0,,"#Microfinance creating #jobs in LA by funding #foodtrucks! Each loan creates new jobs. So cool, @OpportunityFund!","Opportunity Fund's Food Truck Financing initiative will provide microloans to mobile food vendors throughout LA County, supporting economic and social vitality by creating jobs and bringing healthy food options to underserved communities across the region. Our goal is to provide $2M in microloans to local food truck entrepreneurs to upgrade or purchase food trucks (as part of our overall goal to invest $9M in 600 underserved small business owners in the region). By enabling low-income food truck entrepreneurs to access the capital and support they need to grow and create jobs, our microlending program drives economic mobility for these small business owners, while also generating demand to support local food truck manufacturers.","Opportunity Fund seeks to scale our microlending program in LA’s underserved communities to support more than 600 small business owners, including 80 food truck entrepreneurs, each year. In the coming year, we will: 
 à Invest $9M in small businesses in undercapitalized neighborhoods in LA, including $2M in food truck loans.
 à Create or retain more than 1,600 jobs, primarily in minority-owned and women-owned businesses, including 250+ jobs in the mobile food industry.
 à Generate $15 million in new annual economic activity in LA through new spending, wages, and tax revenues.
 
 Opportunity Fund’s borrowers have an impressive 90% business survival rate. Our financing and support help them increase business revenues by an average of more than 20%, while creating and sustaining 2.7 jobs per loan. This includes clients like Noel, who came to the U.S. several years ago with a dream to build a better future for his family. He started out working several low-wage jobs, but knew it would take more to reach his goals. Like many low-wage workers facing few options for good employment, Noel decided to start his own business. He began with a produce cart, and was quickly ready to expand. When Noel came to Opportunity Fund’s partner, Kareem’s Carts, to buy a food truck, he didn’t know how he would finance the purchase. Kareem referred Noel to Opportunity Fund, and we provided a $50,000 loan to fund the purchase. Today, with a second Opportunity Fund loan, Noel has grown his business—The Little Machin—to two food trucks and six employees. Noel’s family helps run the business, which serves authentic Mexican food using his mother’s recipes and high quality ingredients. “Building and growing a business is very difficult, but Opportunity Fund believed in me. They really care about the success of my business,” says Noel. ""I want to teach my children how to run a family business. We are all part of the success."" 
 
 Opportunity Fund has a vision that by 2050 every food truck entrepreneur—and every other small business owner in LA—can access the financing and support needed to realize his or her full potential to build a vibrant enterprise, increase household income, create jobs, and support a family and a future. By scaling microlending in LA, Opportunity Fund will help many thousands of entrepreneurs access hundreds of millions of dollars in microloans by 2050—supporting job creation at significant scale while driving economic growth in the communities that need it most.","Working families in Los Angeles face the challenges of managing insufficient money, finding affordable housing, raising healthy families, and preparing for the future. Nearly half of LA’s households do not earn enough to meet basic expenses. The region lacks adequate well-paying jobs in growth sectors. For many households, entrepreneurship is a primary route to financial stability. Small business ownership creates opportunities for low-income families to pursue stability and economic mobility, while creating jobs in their communities. Research has shown that if one in three microenterprises hired an additional person, the U.S. would return to full employment; if every microbusiness generated $5,000 more annually, this would add $20B to the economy. Mobile food trucks provide a unique opportunity for all types of individuals to create gainful and lasting employment for themselves, their family members, and their communities. Yet only 50% of small businesses survive, often due to an inability to access the capital they need to grow because of language and cultural barriers, limited assets, low capital needs, and poor/insufficient credit.
 
 The mainstream financial industry offers little to help small businesses access the capital they need to grow and thrive, especially in places like East LA, Boyle Heights, and Downtown. As a nonprofit, mission driven, financial institution, Opportunity Fund targets entrepreneurs who operate their businesses (and, in many cases, live their lives) outside the financial mainstream. Our strategy reaches out across neighborhoods, languages, and cultures; as a result, our client base reflects the region’s racial and ethnic diversity. Our borrowers in LA are 98% minority, and 40% are women. Our microloan clients have a median income of $24,000 and an average credit score of less than 600.","LA’s food truck culture supports thousands of jobs through a symbiotic relationship between manufacturers, vendors, and residents who love street food. By providing financing to help food truck entrepreneurs start and grow mobile food businesses in LA, Opportunity Fund serves as an engine to drive growth in the industry. We have established strong collaborations with Los Angeles’ largest mobile food truck manufacturers—including Kareem Carts, West Coast Catering Trucks, and Polo’s Mobile Catering Trucks—who refer aspiring and current food truck owners to Opportunity Fund when they need financing for new or upgraded equipment. Together with these partners, we provide the equipment and financing necessary for these small business owners to grow their enterprises and realize their dreams. 
 
 When we provide a microloan to fill the financing gap for a food truck entrepreneur, Opportunity Fund also creates demand for a new food truck—supporting scores of local manufacturing jobs for people like Rocio, who is one of 23 people employed at Kareem Carts. Through our food truck financing, we foster entrepreneurship within LA’s underserved populations, support local manufacturing jobs, and create new employment opportunities for the region’s diverse and talented workforce. Opportunity Fund and our manufacturing partners are committed to expanding our impact through increased loan volume in the coming year.
 
 In addition to our unique collaboration with local food truck manufacturers, Opportunity Fund also partners with local bank branches, business services providers, and community organizations to identify small business owners who need access to financing.",0,0,
4102165,Frogtown Ribbon Gardens,PHE trains college student volunteers to teach a skills-based health curriculum in public high schools lacking health education.,Live,2018094,2014,,,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,,"1. PHE partners with high schools that lack skills-based health education and in which the majority of the students come from low-income households. These students experience a disproportionate number of serious health risks including unplanned pregnancy, substance abuse, and untreated mental illness. Volunteers teach the PHE curriculum in a required, non-academic class period so that PHE does not interfere with the students’ academic requirements.
 
 2. PHE recruits, selects, and rigorously trains college student volunteers to teach thirteen skills-based workshops on topics including Reflection, Accessing Resources, Decision-Making, and Communication & Advocacy. Our workshops build the skills of the teens we serve while engaging teens on issues related to sexual health, mental health, interpersonal violence, and substance use. PHE maintains a high level of selectivity through our rigorous volunteer recruitment process, securing a minimum of 150% applications to volunteer positions available. This standard allows us to ensure a high level of teaching quality across our cohort.
 
 3. PHE empowers teenagers to make healthy decisions. In the classroom, PHE high school students reflect on and contextualize influences that shape their health-related attitudes and actions; articulate their values and goals; learn basic, accurate health information; practice making and communicating healthy decisions through interactive role-plays; discuss barriers to healthy behaviors and strategies to overcome them; and identify and learn how to use the health resources in their communities.
 
 4. PHE fosters a commitment to public service in college students, many of whom go on to become leaders dedicated to addressing the needs of low-income, urban communities.","PHE LA was founded to address a growing crisis: our teens are navigating difficult decisions and exhibiting risky behaviors on a daily basis, many of which threaten their bodies, well-being, and futures. According to data from the 2013 CDC Youth Risk Behavior Survey: 
 
 • 19% of LA teenagers are currently sexually active, and 37% of these teens did not use a condom the last time they had sex
 • 28% of LA teenagers currently drink alcohol 
 • 13% of LA teenagers have seriously considered attempting suicide
 
 These issues directly impact high school students' progress to graduation. 30% of young women who drop out of school cite pregnancy or parenthood as a key reason. Heavy alcohol use by age 16 is also strongly associated with high school dropout, particularly for young men. Finally, untreated mental illnesses affect teens’ ability to stay and excel in school. Studies of the associations between psychiatric disorders and high school dropout found a positive correlation between all disorders investigated and high school dropouts. A recent study of LAUSD middle and high school students
 found 40% of adolescents within the district display symptoms of trauma at a level requiring mental health services.
 
 In recent years, public schools’ increased focus on academic testing, budget cuts and staffing shortages have exacerbated this crisis by eliminating health courses, leaving teens unprepared to protect themselves against these serious health risks. 
 
 Peer Health Exchange directly addresses this crisis by using relatable and knowledgeable college students to give teens medically accurate, critical facts about their mental, physical and sexual health. Moreover, our volunteers engage teens in real-life role play scenarios and equip them with the skills to make decisions, communicate those choices and access health resources with confidence. 
 
 Investing in teen health today can impact the overall health of LA County by 2050 by directly decreasing teen pregnancy, STI rates, substance abuse rates, and rates of untreated mental illness, while indirectly increasing high school graduation rates. PHE teens can pass their health knowledge on to their families and friends, today and in the future. And by engaging LA college students in some of the most high-need and underserved schools and communities, we encourage volunteerism and civic participation for years to come. Many PHE teens also report they are inspired by PHE volunteers to engage in community service themselves.","During the 2011-2012 program year, 92% of the PHE Los Angeles high school students qualified as low-income and received free or reduced lunch and 90% were Latino or Black. 
 
 Through our program, PHE high school students will gain:
 1. The knowledge and skills they need to make healthy decisions. Teenagers who make healthy decisions now and in the future will be more likely to stay and excel in school, join and remain part of the workforce, improving opportunities for a future life of quality.
 
 2. The knowledge and tools to access the health resources in their communities. In the Accessing Resources workshops, students identify valid services available from home, school, and in the community, learn how to locate these services, and prepare to access resources and services that are customized to their needs.
 
 3. Role Models. Over the course of thirteen workshops, undergraduate volunteers act as slightly older peers who can respectfully address students’ questions and concerns in a language and context that is relevant to their everyday lives while modeling healthy behavior and the successful transition from high school to college.
 
 We have 250 LA volunteers, 68 from CSUN, 90 from Occidental and 90 from USC.
 They will gain:
 1. Health knowledge and skills. Several studies demonstrate that peer health educators benefit from their training and teaching roles, particularly by gaining increased knowledge about the health topics they teach. In addition to increased knowledge, several studies show that peer health educators demonstrate an increased ability to communicate with friends, partners, and parents, and make positive changes in their own health behavior, attitudes and goal-setting. This growth in skills and knowledge enables PHE college students to make healthy decisions that will help them complete college, find and retain jobs, and become healthy, happy, and productive adults capable of having healthy families.
 
 2. Public speaking, teaching, and leadership skills. In PHE training sessions, PHE Health Educators learn how to manage a classroom of high school students and communicate effectively with them, learning skills that are useful in the job market. PHE student leaders also learn to manage a group of their peers. 
 
 3. A commitment to public service. Many PHE volunteers are inspired by their experience and go on to become teachers, doctors, public interest lawyers, and policymakers, who will continue to serve their communities throughout their lives.","All of the following partnerships are confirmed for the 2014-15 school year:
 University of Southern CA
 Cal State Northridge
 Occidental College
 LA Alliance College-Ready Schools
 Partnerships to Uplift Communities (PUC) Schools
 Green Dot Schools
 New Village Girls Academy
 Environmental Charter HS
 
 We have worked with each of the above partners in past years, with great success. 
 
 On the college side, each campus has demonstrated a commitment to serving our communities and a student culture invested in volunteerism. Occidental students are especially committed to social justice, as per the mission of their school. CSUN students are especially relatable to our teens, as most come from the communities we serve in the San Fernando Valley (some are even alumni of our high school partners). USC students live in South LA, one of the communities with the greatest need for our program. 
 
 We must meet a recruitment goal of 150% more applications than we have space for in our cohort to maintain a high degree of volunteer selectivity. College volunteers must also commit to attending weekly trainings led by our staff, and must teach at least 7 times each by the end of the academic year.
 
 On the high school side, each of these schools and networks has demonstrated the willingness to provide time and space for our program during the school day, supported by host teachers who are invested in the program's success. PUC Schools and LA Alliance Schools, for the first time, are now sharing the costs of our program.
 
 Our program must have a 40-60 minute time slot during the school day, be able to reach the entire 9th grade in the school, and have a committed and supportive host teacher in the classroom at all times in order to achieve success.",0,
4102173,Promesa Boyle Heights: Transforming our Community Together.,"We are creating a resident-led model for change, by engaging more residents and supporting a campaign for a school-based wellness center.",Connect,2018098,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050connect/projects/BoyleHeights.html,,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"We’re Promesa Boyle Heights, a passionate collaborative of over 60 residents, 12 organizations, 2 schools, and dozens of businesses, non-profits, and institutional partners working together to strengthen educational and wellness opportunities- starting with our corner of Los Angeles. 
 We believe that residents- those most impacted by community conditions- must be at the forefront of shaping LA’s future. 
 Promesa launched in 2010, with a federal Promise Neighborhood planning grant. We are committed to BREAKING DOWN SILOS to create lasting change. The roadmap for our work is the Promesa BH implementation plan, which we developed after surveying 4,000+ residents and convening diverse stakeholders to develop a shared vision and the plan.","Boyle Heights residents sit on Promesa’s General Assembly, Steering Committees, and Solution Teams, CONNECTING with others in the collaborative to create a model inner-city community where pre-k education, K-college academic success, healthy environments, stable housing, safe public spaces, and economic development flourish. 
 Our first success was the community-school model at Mendez High School. By 1) creating formal partnerships between school staff, families and partner organizations; 2) launching targeted interventions for the most at-risk students, and 3) hiring an Achievement Counselor to coordinate college readiness supports, we raised the graduation rate by nearly 20% from 2010 and 2013. Last year, Mendez became the most improved traditional high school in California with a 76-point API gain and the highest cohort of students accepted to college since the school opened. Next, we will build momentum through:
 1. Development of Existing Resident Leaders. We will sustain resident leadership participation in Promesa, and also build a shared understanding of issues identified in Promesa’s implementation plan through 2-day “Leadership Academy” retreats that give the history and political context of public education, as well skills trainings in collaborative leadership, policy & legislative process, public speaking & personal storytelling for outreach & media. The goal? Equipping leaders to optimally spearhead Promesa’s work, including the wellness center campaign now underway. Building a Wellness Center at Mendez that provides students with physical & mental health services, connects them to resources, and also serves as a hub for community action is a key Promesa goal. In phase 1, resident leaders visited four existing school-based wellness centers, surveyed nearly 1,000 residents, and successfully pushed LAUSD to earmark $50 million for school wellness centers throughout the district. 
 2. Education and Engagement of 300+ New Residents. We will support existing resident leaders in disseminating academic and wellness information, linking families to Promesa health & wellness workshops and resources, and galvanizing community participation in phase 2 of the wellness center campaign, which will include coordination of education events at Hollenbeck Middle School and Mendez High School, more wellness center site visits, and meeting with district leaders and government officials to press for a Mendez Wellness Center by the 2015-2016 school year.","We believe that the challenges facing Los Angeles are big, complex and dynamic. As a result, communities across the city require a wide-range of coordinated strategies and approaches. The Promesa Boyle Heights collective impact model challenges all Angelenos to build on the strengths of individuals and organizations and to work together to more effectively impact youth, families, and community change. 
 
 Over the course of more than 60 meetings, Promesa’s General Assembly of residents, youth, educators, and other community stakeholders developed comprehensive strategies aimed at turning around two target schools (Hollenbeck Middle School and Mendez Learning Center), as well as addressing social determinants of education such as housing, safety, emotional wellness, and economic development. Promesa Boyle Heights operates under the Collective Impact framework with 12 nonprofit partners and two target schools that are committed to our grassroots governance model, which emphasizes that students, residents, and teachers—those most impacted by systems and policies—must lead community change efforts at every stage.
 
 We are building a model in which we catalyze “everyday” peoples’ passions, lived-experiences, and creativity to support comprehensive solutions that build on one another’s assets. Moreover, it is a model that can be replicated by other low-income communities within Los Angeles that, though each facing their own unique issues, share a common need to raise the voices of local residents in the face of such forces as gentrification. Promesa Boyle Heights’ mission and reason for being is not simply to transform Boyle Heights. Rather, it is to “scale up” our successes so that by 2050, Los Angeles is a city in which ALL residents are empowered to work with schools, elected officials, and business leaders in order to collectively shape the future of the city.","Boyle Heights lies on the eastern edge of LA and is one of its oldest communities. It covers 6.5 square miles and is isolated from downtown and the greater LA area by the LA River and several converging freeways. Boyle Heights is one of LA’s most densely populated neighborhoods (95,000+) and has one of the highest percentages of Latino residents (94%). Two-thirds of adult residents do not have a high school degree, and 1 in 4 families live below the federal poverty line - double the County rate.
 
 But these statistics can only begin to represent our community and whom this project will benefit. Boyle Heights is also vibrant and tight-knit. Once defined by our struggling schools, gang violence, and dilapidated infrastructure, Boyle Heights is becoming a model for how residents and organizations can come together to address critical issues in their community. Over the past ten years, our community has pressed for and won important battles, including the opening of new schools, improvements to infrastructure, a place at the table with the Housing Authority of Los Angeles amidst a move to privatize local housing developments, and modest gains in graduation rates. 
 
 Yet, our community continues to face major challenges – too many students continue to fall through the cracks; job and economic growth opportunities are sparse; access to health and wellness resources is still splintered; and mounting gentrification pressures on our community means decreasing access to affordable and safe housing for the lowest income residents.
 
 Now more than ever, it is vital that the work of Promesa Boyle Heights – particularly our work to strengthen existing resident leaders and cultivate new ones – continues to grow.","Our collaborative is based on the core believe that no one person or individual can do it alone. We have been operating as a collaborative since 2010. Our initial collaboration focused on the development of a strategic plan for our community, including developing a shared vision, outcome goals, and agreed upon strategies.
 
 We are now working together to impact four agreed-upon outcomes: 
 
 1) improving graduation rates at Mendez High School, 2) building a college going culture in our community, 3) increasing access to health and wellness services, and 4) fostering leadership and civic engagement opportunities for adult residents and youth. 
 
 Our collective impact model elevates partners to continuum leadership roles. In addition to partnering with the target schools and their education reform manager Partnership for Los Angeles Schools (PLAS), 12 agencies are collaborating as Continuum Lead Partners. We also work closely with two schools: Hollenbeck Middle School and Mendez High School. All partners signed an MOU at the end of our planning period in 2011 and 125 residents signed a commitment form. The coordination of resident engagement and leadership moving forward, particularly as it relates to the Wellness Center campaign, will be led by East Los Angeles Community Corporation (ELACC), InnerCity Struggle, & Proyecto Pastoral.",

Phase 1 begins in Fall 2014, with an emphasis on cool season crops and their nutritional and healing benefits. We will use our signature GoodFood Changemaker curriculum, and adaptation of curriculum developed by UC Santa Cruz Center for Agroecology & Sustainable Food Systems, supplemented by consultation with local immigrant farmers who posses deep wisdom and extensive experience in traditional sustainable agriculture. PJ's GoodFood Changemaker curriculum consists of three learning modules: (1) Agro-ecology, (2) Food Systems Literacy, and (3) Community organizing, followed by a 40 hour practicum in community organizing. Together, these learning units synergistically guide participants to attain core competencies in organic food production, understanding root causes of food system issues, and organizing effectively for policy/systems change. Upon completion of Phase 1, Agri-Corp Interns will continue to Phase 2 in Spring 2015, to apply learned farming skills while expanding knowledge about growing warm season crops and their nutritional/health benefits. 
 2) Community Organizing for Outreach & Base-building: In spring 2015, AgriCorps interns will begin recruiting new garden volunteers and presenting workshops, cooking demos, and garden tours at The Wellness Center. Each AgriCorps member will be responsible for building a base of 10 supporters/volunteers who understand community food justice issues in context of larger food system challenges. This cadre of food system leaders, will be recognized as Youth Health Education & Action Leaders (HEALers), and will strengthen organizational capacity to reach and retain youth participants in garden activities and enhance community efforts to transform Boyle Heights’ food environment through policy and systems change.
 3) Community Organizing for Education/Awareness: Our 10 AgriCorps Interns and 100 Youth HEALers will be based at the newly designed Community Wellness Center located at the Historic LA County Hospital, splitting their time between our on-site demonstration urban farm and Proyecto Jardin's original training garden at White Memorial Medical Center. They will be trained to use our G.L.A.M. community engagement tools: Greet, Listen, Assess, Motivate, to inspire & mobilize support.","LA Agri-Corps helps make LA the healthiest place to live today because it:

4102180,20000 KIDS PROJECT LA: Connecting LA’s foster children with loving homes in our diverse communities,RAC will expand its outreach and programs to a broader constituency including the heterosexual and Spanish language speaking communities.,Connect,2018100,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050connect/projects/RaiseAChild.html,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,"Today, 20,000 children languish in LA’s foster care system. RAC will apply its successful model of recruiting prospective parents and helping match them with children awaiting loving homes by broadening its outreach to a more inclusive constituency. In addition to its LGBT audience, RAC will broaden its focus to include LA’s Latino and welcoming faith-based communities. RAC will further develop/expand its existing outreach model to a year-round initiative which will include an emphasis on a strong social media campaign supported by radio, television, outdoor advertising, and events to recruit and educate prospective parents. RAC also provides direct services to assist LA County DCFS to facilitate and expedite parent-child matches.","Founded in 2011, RAC enjoyed immediate recruitment success as we launched a creative multi-media campaign to encourage the LGBT community of LA to build families through fostering and adoption. By 2012, our extended national reach and improved campaign strategies resulted in recruiting more than 600 prospective foster/adoptive parents. In 2013, RAC and Huffington Post Gay Voices launched a weekly series entitled “Let Love Define Family™.” Several of our stories have gone viral including http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/28/wendy-gay-family_n_5042297.html. 
 
 Today, more than 2,200 individuals have signed up at the www.RaiseAChild.US website to take the “Next Step to Parenthood.” Through our 3 year history of events and ad campaigns, RAC has engaged with tens of thousands more. 
 
 RAC,is unique as we coordinate with our fost/adopt agency partners to provide our prospective parents with formalized assistance through our Parent Advocate Program, which combines personalized attention with the technological support of a cloud-based case management system. Locally, our outcomes are extremely impressive: partnering with Los Angeles County agencies, our Parent Advocate has been able to move prospective parents through the training and certification process at a success rate of 26%, significantly greater than the national average of only 5%. 
 RAC is now well positioned to open its programs/services to a broader, more inclusive constituency and plans to begin this journey by branching out to the Spanish speaking (which represents approximately 48% of the LA population) and heterosexual communities of LA County. Currently, more than 11% of our database is comprised of single heterosexuals. Funding from the My LA 2050 grant will allow us to add: 1) a bilingual FTE Parent Advocate to make inroads into the Hispanic community and expand our ability to place more children in loving homes throughout LA; 2) increase by 25% our single heterosexual cohort by modifying and targeting our marketing efforts.
 As part of this initiative, all of RAC’s online and printed outreach materials will be translated to Spanish and its key recruitment message, “Let Love Define Family™” will be developed for special events. The Parent Advocate will follow up, providing personalized one-to-one guidance to each prospective parent. We also plan to begin a dialogue with several inclusive and welcoming faith-based organizations to further promote our enhanced mission.","Every parent sees endless possibilities and great hope in the eyes of a child. As Angelenos, when we look at today’s children. But for our children to thrive and Los Angeles to stay a city in which people stay connected, we must support their development, their parents, their families and the public policies that work for all. Studies show that the earliest of experiences in supportive environments are essential to how children succeed in their lifetimes. In order for communities to come together cohesively to create a prosperous Los Angeles by 2050, we must invest in children now.
 RAC is proud of our own success stories. Long Beach, California residents Bianca and her wife, Tonie, initially found the road to building a family through foster/adoption to be lonely and complicated. It was the couple’s social worker at LA County Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) who suggested RaiseAChild.US for support and direction.
 “We attended a RaiseAChild.US event in West Hollywood, last December,” said Bianca. “Soon after, 18month-old Jacob was placed in our home. Throughout the process, we continued to access RaiseAChild.US support for referrals and advice on adoption finalization.”
 “Jacob has not only changed our lives but the lives of our family and friends,” says Tonie. “His grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, and friends have all embraced Jacob as part of the family. Jacob has adopted all of us.”
 
 This project meets two critically important metrics in the Connect application. First, RAC’s Parent Advocate Program directly addresses ‘Adults getting sufficient social & emotional support’ with its personalized service to all prospective parents navigating the foster/adoption process. Next, our close work with the LA County Department of Children and Family Services has been a key factor in the agency’s improved communication with waiting parents and increasing its child placement rate. This addresses the second (dream) metric of ‘Government responsiveness to residents’ needs.’
  
 Our goal is to improve the foster care system in LA County by 2050 and hold it high as a shining example of how diverse communities can come together to the benefit of children in the foster care system. Our vision is to create a community of good fost/adopt families in LA County that will multiple and proudly support one another well in to the future. In addition, RAC will be primed to export our business model to foster agencies for replication in other US cities.","This project will reduce the number of children who continue to languish in LA’s foster care system by many as 2,000 within a two-year time frame. By connecting these children to loving adoptive homes, they are more likely to receive the support and medical and emotional attention that they need to thrive. 
 Fostering and adoption are slow processes, but our goal is to recruit and begin to process 1,000 new prospective homes during the grant period; this would represent an increase of 192% beyond RAC’s current annual matching rate.
 Already lauded for its capacity to move prospective parents through the adoption system at a rate that is five times the national average, RAC’s Parent Advocate Program will dramatically expand its reach through the addition of a full-time bilingual social worker. Backed by newly-developed Spanish language materials, the new advocate will help meet the culturally specific needs of Latinos who seek to foster or adopt as well as the need to find culturally sensitive placements for Latino youth in foster care. This addition to our staff will ensure our continued responsiveness. 
 Expanding our unique programs and services will also help to reduce the ‘drop out’ rate of prospective foster/adopt parents who so often give up since the process has been so cumbersome, significantly ease caseloads of DCFS social workers and of particular importance, RAC’s innovative methods of working with the system, will continue to cut and curb government spending. For every child adopted in LA County, there is an estimate national savings to the taxpayer of over $15,000.","To accomplish this expansion to a more inclusive audience, RAC plans to work in tandem with its seven vetted foster/adopt partners in LA, with whom we have formal sponsorship agreements: LA County Department of Children & Family Services; Penny Lane Centers; Southern California Foster Family & Adoption Agency; The Village Family Services; Five Acres; Vista Del Mar; and Westside Children's Center. Each of these organizations will continue to work closely with RAC to help match available children with prospective parents and provide a seamless transition as the new initiative gets off the ground. RAC will seek out key leaders in the Hispanic community, an audience that has been researched for its feasibility and pilot tested with Penny Lane Centers, one of our partner agencies. Together, we placed several targeted spots on KLVE and KTNQ, popular Southern California Spanish language radio stations and the immediate response was that nearly 70 prospective foster/adopt parents signed up at our website or called the RAC office. We will also identify and reach out to welcoming clergy who might be willing to test pilot a small scale collaboration within their respective congregations. While RAC will benefit in the identification of children and parents to be matched as part of its core services by partnering with these entities, the value to them in finding homes for children, many of whom come from the populations they serve, will provide them a substantive role in addressing a critical community need in keeping with their respective missions.
 
 Factors critical to the success of this effort are 1) recruiting appropriate staff who understands the cultural sensitivities to carry out the myriad of details/programs/services; 2) identifying clergy who are committed to helping RAC find loving homes for children in foster care and who endorse our message to its parishioners; and 3) funding necessary to conduct a year-long outreach campaign, thereby laying the foundation for sustaining these recruitment efforts for years to come.",

Additionally, funds will increase the organizational capacity to immediately begin to plan annual Carnivals in Los Angeles, serving different neighborhoods each year. This creates an incredible opportunity to serve the needs of each neighborhood, highlight the unique cultural, commercial and community-based offerings in each area of Los Angeles and give a boost to these local economies.
 
 Support will also help underwrite STEAM Carnival Student Preview Day. During Student Preview Day, visiting students and educators will participate in the STEAM Lab, a 15,000 square foot space dedicated to hands-on workshops exploring wearable electronics, musical robots, and additional engaging activities, and the STEAM Arcade, a high-tech midway encouraging purposeful play. In the STEAM Arcade, trained instructors will provide crucial links between Carnival games and STEAM disciplines.","It was in early 2013 that Two Bit Circus became impassioned to design an event that fused STEM principles with our own dynamic inventions, gadgets and amusements. In researching the state of education in regards to STEM and STEAM education, we were made aware of several distressing statistics: The National Math and Science Initiative has called it a ‘STEM crisis.’
 
 The need is so great that through his Educate to Innovate initiative President Obama has committed $43.1 billion dollars to STEM Education. In January 2013, the White House issued a call to tech innovators to work together to ensure that all youth—particularly those from underserved and historically underrepresented communities—have the opportunity to study STEM subjects and participate in the technology sector (http://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/education/K-12/educate-innovate).
 
 While this is a tremendous resource it is a national one and the regional need is what STEAM Carnival will address first in Los Angeles. While California used to be a national leader in K–12 and higher education, it now ranks 43rd or lower among all states in math and science proficiency in grades 4 through 8 (http://www.stemadvantage.org/stem-stats/). 
 
 Fewer than 50% of students who enter college intending to major in a STEM field complete a STEM degree (Ibid). 
 
 Two Bit Circus has accepted that call with the belief that if we want our students to be successful in the 21st century, they must be armed with creative problem-solving skills that allow them to thrive in complex and changing environments. 
 
 The 'A' (Arts) added to STEM instruction is crucial to our vision. Creative exploration in STEM disciplines activates students’ curiosity, in turn often leading to deeper understanding across seemingly disparate areas of learning. As STEM initiatives are slowly but surely integrating the arts into scientifically driven subjects, opportunities for STEAM expansion abound. Two Bit Circus seeks to bring unique and dynamic learning to STEAM Carnival attendees to utilize and harness the potentials of scientific inquiry through creativity and innovation.","STEAM Carnival will bring together diverse facets of the community and offer a unique platform to address inequalities found in education and workforce development. To this end, Two Bit Circus will continue to partner with LAUSD schools to provide access to interactive learning tools during the Carnival as well as through its on-going related programs with Two Bit Circus and several nonprofit partners. 
 
 The primary population STEAM Carnival Student Preview seeks to serve is students ages 12 to 18 from underserved students in Los Angeles. 
 
 In the case of San Pedro specifically, STEAM Carnival is working with Dana STEAM Middle School.
 
 After Student Preview Day, STEAM Carnival is open to the public on October 25th-26th. Then we will welcome families, teachers, mentors and learners of all ages to join the fun!","Community engagement and collaboration is a founding principal of STEAM Carnival. 
 
 Education Technical Assistance - The Los Angeles Education partnership (LAEP) - serves as our primary education outreach partner which we are already working with. Two Bit Circus is working in collaboration with LAEP as it is a fit to their mission to provide all students access to interactive learning tools at our STEAM Carnival. Their expertise in working in high poverty communities to foster schools that support the academic success of children and youth brings that expertise to our efforts. We also have other working relationships through our on-site studio and in the community with LAUSD, Beyond the Bell, A Place Called Home, and the Girl Scouts. We are also exploring a relationship with After School All-Stars, a nationwide after school program operator. 
 
 A Host partner - The Port of LA - host of the inaugural STEAM Carnival and a key partner in bringing together diverse facets of the Los Angeles and Harbor communities. 
 
 Corporate and Government Engagement - The STEAM Committee - is a highly engaged group of community influencers who are passionate about STEAM education and are working on its behalf on several fronts. Chairing the Committee is Nolan Bushnell, Founder of Atari and Chuck E. Cheese along with John Ward, Sr VP Content Operations at Direct TV; other committee members include Eric Garcetti, Los Angeles Mayor; Don Knabe, Los Angeles County Supervisor and Chairman; Elizabeth Espinosa, CNN Host; Gilbert Cedillo, Los Angeles Council member; Joe Buscaino, Los Angeles Council member; Mark Francis, New Venture Lead at Intel; and Caine Monray, Caine’s Arcade. Committee members are currently all LA based and members are tasked with engaging new partners and supporters to make the first Carnival an unforgettable experience. 
 National and regional support has been secured for the STEAM Carnival and include sponsorships and grants from several sources including: Time Warner Cable, Hitachi, City of Los Angeles, and Popular Mechanics. We also have a two-year recurring commitment from American Honda Foundation for the development of our STEAM curriculum and professional learning costs.

4102245,The Trust for Public Land’s Avalon Green Alley Demonstration Project,"BLOCK is a video game, which allows users to design and study the health of the city and ecological interdependencies of urban actors.",Live,2018133,2014,,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"The game BLOCK could be adapted to any environment, it would constitute a framework for the study of urban health.","We have already developed an initial prototype, as can be seen in the accompanying video. The prototype allows us to already start working with players and communities as we develop and add real data and features to the game. Local communities within LA have already approached us to use the game in the teaching of architecture and urban development. 
 
 To implement this project, we need to build a team that will support the current development team, primarily by going into the community, and connecting with people in education, design, and urban planning, and also to source real data to create accurate simulations. 
 
 The game prototype that we have already developed works as a proof of concept; Players can easily simulate urban environments and come to understand the interdependencies of different elements. The game encourages the player to improve the quality of urban space and learn the needs of other actors in the city.
 
 Games such as Simcity and Minecraft allow players to engage with city simulations or digital design, but we currently do not have an accessible game that can connect players with the real implications of products, of architecture and the city. BLOCK will breach the digital with the physical and allow anyone to become an active participant in the LA of 2050. The current Gamescapes research led by Jose Sanchez at USC School of Architecture, has been developed over the past 2 years, to create the tools and the framework to make this game possible.","LA is a city that has been built by its inhabitants. Is in in their power to make a significant new change. The LA of 2050 will be shaped by a generation that is currently very young. It requires a ‘massive design medium’ to expand the imagination of the current generation. Video games have the reach to affect a larger community. They also offer the possibility to simulate systems; Systems thinking is one of the fundamental challenges of the 21st century. If we have engaging video games that can simulate the quality of the air, the health of the city and the interdependences of businesses, we can allow individuals and organizations to see how their own ideas are intertwined.
 
 BLOCK aims to be a medium for 21st century city participation where we could crowd-source the models for the LA of 2050. 
 
 However, BLOCK can also have a direct impact very quickly. One of the stages of the project is to model a series of case studies of cities and neighbourhoods that work with ideas of ecology, generating patterns of sustainability. These patterns will be included in the game as examples, and would enable anyone to learn how to implement already working solutions. Think of it as an interactive recipe book for a healthy Los Angeles.","Change takes time, and the beneficiaries of this project will truly be near future generations. In it’s initial phase, the game’s primary educational purpose, will be to support educational institutions to find and model urban problems, and build simulations that could provide alternative patterns for the urban conditions of today.
 
 In it’s second phase, the game will build a catalogue of case studies of established urban problems and possible solutions. The game will show that it can model existing and envisioned city configurations, and also demonstrate how they could operate. This will connect a gamer community with architects and city planners.
 
 Whilst the internet can provide a forum to enable hundreds of people to play and suggest great ideas to a particular problem, is can be difficult to know if the ideas are feasible or if they are missing other information that render them irrelevant. By developing BLOCK, citizens will be armed with the tools to create city simulations themselves, and ideas will be in a format that any authority could implement. The challenge of the project is to go ‘from Gaming to Making’.
 
 In a similar way in which the game FOLD-IT (http://fold.it/) works with a community of players to advance the science of protein folding and cure diseases, BLOCK will bring the problem of urban health and ecological urbanism to a massive community of players that can collectively be smarter than a state of the art algorithm.","USC School of Architecture has already secured two partners:
 USC Game Innovation Lab

 5D Institute
 http://5dinstitute.org/
 
 The project is also trying to collaborate with:
 Unity3D (TBC)
 http://unity3d.com/
 The Plant Chicago (TBC)

 The experience in developing video games at the USC Game Innovation Lab led by Tracy Fullerton, will be a critical assessment to the work developed. They posses a fundamental expertise in all areas of game development and will certainly push the game to be meaningful and accomplish its goals.
 
 The 5D Institute, led by Alex McDowell, is recognised for innovation in narrative structures. They will be a key collaborator to define the rhetoric of the project to generate player engagement. The ecological narrative of the game needs to be strong and accessible and the 5D Institute will support us to achieve this goal.
 
 The two other collaborations currently being pursued will add a deeper expertise to the game: 
 
 Unity3D is the company that develops Unity, the game engine used so far for the development of BLOCK. We are in conversation with them for technical support for this project.
 
 The Plant Chicago is an Urban Farming initiative that has pioneered an ecological urban farm concept that eliminates the idea of waste by establishing the interdependence of productive units. They posses a unique expertise and have been a great inspiration to the project. In collaborating with The Plant Chicago, we hope to use them as a case study and implement several other concepts similar to theirs within the game.",1,
4102265,LA Schools to Parks,LA Schools to Parks will open up schools as parks on weekends and in summer so children are in walking distance of a place to play!,Play,2018140,2014,http://maker.good.is/myLA2050play/projects/YPI.html,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Los Angeles Promise Zone,"LA Schools to Parks will increase community parks in the LA Promise Zone by working with schools to open their outdoor recreation space to the community on weekends and in summer. Currently only 30% of Zone residents live within 1/4 mile walk to a park. The goal of LA Schools to Parks is to double this within one year, so that 60% of residents live within 1/4 mile walk to a park and can enjoy recreation, exercise and play. 
 
 Our project will open schools on weekends and in the summer for residents, while offering recreation programs in the parks through partnerships with community groups, the City of LA Recreation and Parks, and LAUSD. Our analysis of existing parks in the Promise Zone shows that transforming just 12 schools into parks would double the percentage of residents within 1/4 mile of a park to 60% of residents. To accomplish this, we partner with residents and school leaders in neighborhood visioning sessions in the first six months of the grant to finalize school locations and identify recreation and play activities that should be offered at each park. Then we will solidify agreements with the District and schools, recruit partners to offer activities and open the parks for public use.
 
 LA Schools to Parks is part of both the Promise Zone and the Promise Neighborhood, which is exciting because these programs will bring existing fitness/recreation activities and coordination with broader neighborhood revitalization efforts in this community. 
 
 In January 2014 President Obama announced that Los Angeles had received one of only five Promise Zone designations, with the goal of revitalizing high-poverty communities through potential tax incentives and receiving extra points on federal grant applications for funding. The LA Promise Zone has over 80 public and private partners, with YPI as the Lead Implementation Partner. YPI is also Lead Agency for the LA Promise Neighborhood (LAPN) in the Hollywood area of the Zone. LAPN in Hollywood is working with seven schools to provide a continuum of cradle to college and career services to help students graduate high school college and career ready. Four of these campuses are strong candidates for transforming into weekend/summer parks, as YPI's existing funding will provide recreation activities at these times. All of these resources will help us achieve our goal of opening up 12 more parks and helping LA residents to be healthy and play in safe spaces.","Our project will increase open space and parks. The LA Promise Zone in Central Los Angeles is one of the densest communities in the City, but has little green space and few options for play. Over 70% of Zone residents do not live within 1/4 mile of a park. Los Angeles is the most “park poor” of major cities in the United States. While Los Angeles has 9.1 acres of park per 1,000 residents (compared to 4.6 acres per 1,000 for New York), parks are less equitably distributed in LA. The vast majority of children in New York (91%) and Boston (97%) live within walking distance of a park, compared to only 33% in LA (The Trust for Public Land, No Place to Play, 2004). The LA Promise Zone has even fewer park spaces, with only 30% of residents living within walking distance of a park, demonstrating a great need for additional parks and recreation spaces that will help make LA the best place to play today.
 
 LA Schools to Parks will address this by opening up more recreational spaces within walking distance of residents for play, recreation, and community involvement. LA Mayor Eric Garcetti has a goal that every resident should be able to walk to a park. Given the lack of affordable properties in central LA, YPI offers a feasible way to accomplish this goal - opening school playgrounds on the weekends and during the summer, rather than trying to develop and open expensive new parks. LA Schools to Parks will work to double the number of residents within walking distance of a recreational space and park by 2015. In addition, LA Schools to Parks will fundraise and work with schools long term to convert any concrete recreational spaces into increased green space.
 
 By 2050, the City of Los Angeles will be able to leverage the success of LA Schools to Parks to meet Mayor Garcetti’s goal. The Promise Zone, with its partnerships, defined collaborative structure, and ongoing initiatives, offers the ideal laboratory to implement LA Schools to Parks. The success here will provide the springboard needed to extend this model of cooperation and grassroots change to the entire City, so that by 2050, over 90% of residents will be within walking distance to a park, and Los Angeles will be known among large cities for its extensive -- and equitable -- reach of open space and parks.","The project will most directly benefit over 32,000 families currently living in the Promise Zone, the majority of whom lack access to parks and open space within walking distance. 70% of Promise Zone residents (113,082) do not live within 1/4 mile of a park, which reflects the inequitable distribution of parks and open space in the City of Los Angeles. These residents are expected to use the new parks and will most directly benefit from the project.
 
 The Promise Zone in Central Los Angeles is home to 161,516 residents. These residents are the direct beneficiaries of the LA Schools to Parks project. Promise Zone residents experience high levels of need and are very diverse, as demonstrated by the following characteristics. 
 
 19.5% are youth under the age of 18, and 6.2% are under the age of 5. 
 
 71% are between 18-64 years of age, and 9.6% are senior citizens age 65 and older. 
 
 57.7% are Hispanic, with the remainder classified as White, Asian, and African American. 
 
 A significant percentage of residents who will benefit from the new parks are low income. 34.9% are below the poverty line, a much higher percentage than for Los Angeles as a whole (20.2%). 72.8% of households in the Promise Zone make less than $50,000 per year (compared to 42% of households in California). (American Community Survey (ACS) 2007-11 and 2008-12).
 
 Critically, only 7.6% of housing in the Promise Zone are single family homes, while 90.3% are apartment complexes that typically lack a backyard for play or recreation (compared to 28.3% of all California housing being apartments) (ACS 2008-12). The need for parks and open space is particularly critical for families in the Promise Zone, which, as discussed earlier, live in one of the densest communities in Los Angeles. Moreover, this part of LA is located at a significant distance from most of the larger park systems that Los Angeles has to offer, such as the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area or Angeles National Forest.","YPI (the Promise Zone Lead Implementation Partner and Lead Agency for the LA Promise Neighborhood) works with the City of Los Angeles, the Lead Agency for the Promise Zone and a confirmed partner. The City of LA and the Mayor’s Office will leverage services for newly created parks, including arts and sports offered at Recreation Centers, Summer Night Lights (a program that provides after-dark recreational and jobs for youth in City parks during summer), and intergenerational programs.
 
 The LA Unified School District is a partner and working with the City and YPI to transform Promise Zone schools into full-fledged community schools to support academic achievement and family stability. They have worked with People for Parks to establish a Memorandum of Understanding to streamline creation of new parks at schools, while the LAUSD School Police will partner to support safety in the parks.
 
 People for Parks LA is a partner and works to create Community-School Parks that offer open space and grass with recreational activities in LAUSD schools. They offer a grassroots incubator training program and a Fast Track Permit Process with the school district.
 
 The Trust for Public Land is committed to support YPI and the City while building on similar programs like the NYC Schoolyards to Playgrounds Initiative, which has designed and built over 180 green playgrounds since 1996. The Trust for Public Land is a founding partner in the Promise Zone and works to lead park and open space development in the Zone. 
 
 Three major factors critical to success include involvement and buy-in of residents. Without this, this project cannot and will not happen. They will participate through neighborhood visioning, incubator training, and volunteering to ensure that parks are great locations for fun and play. Secondly, involvement of partners is vital. Without effective buy-in of the City of LA and the Recreation and Parks Department, and the support of LAUSD and schools, the project will not succeed. Finally, best practices offered by YPI and partners in opening schools as public parks and in providing collaborative services for residents are critical- this includes experience YPI has in building community involvement, experience People for Parks has in opening schools and parks, and components already in place to make this happen- Fast Track permitting, approval procedures, and services provided by the City in the Recreation and Parks Department.",0,
