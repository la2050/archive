8102001,2018,Normalize Periods by Giving Back!,An art installation of the words PERIODS and #HAPPYPERIOD in numerous locations within L.A county made for the public to donate menstrual products for a homeless passer-by to freely take.,,,,,"[""Healthcare access"",""Rates of homelessness"",""Rates of mental illness""]","In a 2011 Feeding America survey, people of all income listed menstrual hygiene products as a basic essential or an item “that cannot be forgone or easily substituted.” Yet homeless women have to find substitutions every month such as plastic bags, old rags, newspaper, socks, and tissue. In Los Angeles County, 57,794 people experienced homelessness on a given night in 2017. Of this number, over 17,000 are women and nearly 500 are transgender. The average homeless female in Los Angeles County is a woman of color and is of reproductive age. Most of these women and girls will menstruate each month, which is a natural part of the reproductive system, yet it remains taboo. As a result, the challenges of menstrual hygiene are heightened due to the socioeconomic status of these women. A 3 foot high, 25-foot art installation of the words PERIODS and #HAPPYPERIOD set in five locations within Los Angeles county. The letters will be made of recycled materials with bins built in the back of each letter. The front of the letters will to be filled with packages of period products. The back bins will be made to also be filled with donations. The public will be encouraged to take photos with the installation and donate their unwanted disposable or reusable products for a homeless passer-by to take for themselves or someone else in need. #HappyPeriod will be able to refurbish and collect donations for shelters. With this activation, an individual in need would have a new resource from which to obtain period products at any time. This activation will ideally be installed in five locations across Los Angeles in communities with a high walk score, for example Hollywood, Downtown, Mid-city, Venice, and Santa Monica. The goal is to present an interactive way of giving and encourage digital activism.",Live,2018001,https://activation.la2050.org/live/happyperiod/happyperiod.jpg,https://youtu.be/goBUjr5-dRA

What makes #HashtagLunchbag so unique, successful and incredibly popular is our belief that in person connections will yield greater results and greater overall impact. When nearly 200 volunteers come out each month to prepare, decorate, inspire, and serve meals to those in need, we not only feed the recipients of our lunch bags but also feed our souls by making a difference through our actions, through our volunteerism, and through our belief that we can solve large and complex problems when we work together.
 
 We work with our local business communities and leaders in a myriad of fields to bring awareness of the important work we perform. We provide businesses with a number of opportunities to engage in #HashtagLunchbag activations and encourage them to promote our efforts in alignment with their corporate social responsibilities. Such efforts are typically tied into two major elements:
 
 Increase volunteerism within their business and local offices
 
 Increase financial contributions in order to broaden and enhance our impact
 
 Through our activations we provide deeply meaningful and moving opportunities for volunteers to tackle large scale challenges like food insecurity. 
 
 One of the newest programs #HashtagLunchbag is poised to launch is a voter registration component to increase voter turnout and participation within our volunteer groups. We believe that civic engagement is directly tied to an informed citizenry that is crucial in bringing about change to large scale and complex programs within our city and communities.",Live,2018002,https://activation.la2050.org/live/hashtaglunchbag-powered-by-living-through-giving-foundation-501c3-nonprofit/hashtaglunchbag-powered-by-living-through-giving-foundation-501c3-nonprofit.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WjUJh2z0WE
8102003,2018,"Write the Future of LA: 100,000 Stories to Connect Volunteers","By sharing student writing with 100,000 Angelenos, Los Angeles will connect as 826LA volunteers or supporters to amplify and honor the voices of young people from underserved communities.",,,,,"[""Adults getting sufficient social & emotional support"",""Attendance at cultural events"",""Rates of volunteerism""]","826LA is part of an ecosystem of services that help young people break out of poverty, by helping students improve their grades, apply to college, and develop the skills and confidence to express themselves fully. 826LA was founded in 2005 to address the need for academic and literacy support for Los Angeles students. Since that time, 826LA has served more than 74,000 students. More than 240 public school teachers each year benefit from 826LA’s support, and, in fiscal year 2017, over 1,230 trained, individual volunteers contributed over 21,000 hours of their time at 826LA. 
 
 
 
 Since its founding, 826LA has enlisted evidence-based practices to give students the tools they need for academic success and positive self-regard. In the 2018 fiscal year, 826LA anticipates serving 9,365 students. By offering its services for free, 826LA presents a sustainable way to provide educational programs to students from underserved communities. We believe that creativity is key for young people to develop critical thinking skills. At 826LA, students are transported to a world where writing is a form of magic, their voices are celebrated, and anything is possible. 
 
 
 
 826LA’s work is only possible with the help of volunteers. 826LA focuses on providing consistent, individualized attention from community volunteers, and in many programs, offers multiple sessions per week. This kind of educational support, from caring adults outside young people’s own families, has been shown to play a significant role in providing a number of developmental assets for students. A study by the Afterschool Alliance found that programs like 826LA’s, which are “staffed by community members, may be viewed by parents as more approachable than schools.” This accessibility “makes [these programs] an ideal partner to help schools break down barriers between parents and schools and increase parental engagement.” Not only does this engagement help parents feel more connected to their community, but it can also embolden them to seek out sufficient social and emotional support in other aspects of their lives. 
 
 
 
 To expand the reach of our programs and recruit more volunteers in our mission to reduce educational inequities, 826LA must connect with a wider and more diverse group of Angelenos. By connecting 100,000 people with the stories, essays, poems, and dreams of young Angelenos, along with a call to volunteer, 826LA’s volunteer base will grow and diversify and the rate of volunteerism in the city will increase. Support from LA2050 will enable us to focus on access and increased distribution of the over 300 student-written books and newspapers 826LA publishes each year. 
 
 
 
 The more often Angelenos hear our students speak—in their own words—about their hopes and challenges, the more often those same Angelenos will volunteer their time, donate funds, share stories with others, and advocate on behalf of LA students at the ballot box and beyond.",Connect,2018003,https://activation.la2050.org/connect/826la/826la.jpg,https://youtu.be/4nRuPAZABus

HCSY is a public health education and career pipeline program exposing youth to a culture of upstream preventative thinking. The program model provides an opportunity for students to receive mentorship and experience within the public health field as they build and conduct community health programming with professionals. Students and professionals will be collaborating on three programs focused on improving skills around nutrition, fitness and mindfulness. 
 
 Participants of these youth led programs are patients that have been identified by their primary care physician as having barriers to nutrition and fitness. These patients receive a written prescription from their physicians that we call park prescriptions. A patient participating in the park prescription program will partake in a 10-week program that provides personalized fitness instruction, nutrition education via grocery store tours and a gardening and mindfulness workshop. 
 
 Undergraduate students leading the workshops will receive mentorship and public health career exposure from graduate students as well as professionals in the field. Undergraduate students will in-turn mentor high school students and expose them to the paths of higher education.

We will give Angelenos an easy way to encourage, motivate and facilitate youth activism in Los Angeles county, inspiring them to take action in their communities, participate in local government, and vote on local issues, making LA the best place to connect.
 
  
 
 By training Los Angeles teachers and students to translate their passion into action, highlighting the civic action of youth, and connecting youth to local government, we will show Angelenos how to be active in their communities. Youth Voice 2020 will increase the percentage of young people who are registered to vote; regularly volunteer; and involved in local government. Our focus on action will also increase government responsiveness to local issues. Our ability to amplify youth voices through public events and websites will increase adult participation in local issues, voting rates, volunteerism.
 
  
 
 Youth Voice 2020 has 3 components:
 
 1.Youth training
 
 Teachers work with Action Civics LA to engage their students to identify the most pressing issues in their communities and take action to address these issues. Students learn how to SPEAK OUT, ADVOCATE for change, COLLABORATE with peers and community organizations, RESEARCH issues, DEVELOP action plans to affect change, and SHOWCASE their year-long activism efforts.
 
  
 
 Past projects include:
 
 * South Central HS students advocated for the rights of undocumented immigrants and DREAMers in their school and community bringing in the assistance of immigration lawyers and representatives from Congresswoman Karen Bass’ office; Hancock Park Elementary students researched homelessness rates in their neighborhood and presented their findings to Councilmember Ryu in City Hall; Boyle Heights 9th graders started a school-wide “Unplug Monday” during free periods where students detach from all electronics and focus on interpersonal connections and mental health care. 
 
 2. Public events:
 
 * 2 showcase events where students will present their Action Civics projects and receive feedback from community leaders.
 
 * 6-8 large open community events hosted by Pro/Con where local issues are debated (proposed locations include the Santa Monica Pier, USC, and others). Student projects will be featured and event participants will be asked to take action to support them. 
 
 3. Digital amplification and action:
 
 We will highlight select student speeches and projects on the ProCon.org website for the 500,000 annual users from Los Angeles. We will focus on the following four areas: Water and the environment; Community and School safety; Civic Participation; and Education.
 
  
 
 The projects will be linked to pro and con research on these issues on ProCon.org, a website use by 25 million people per year, including more than 500,000 Angelenos.

We plan to do that and more with this activation! There are currently 63,000 youth in Los Angeles that can be classified as homeless. During the summer months there are very few programs that offer support, even fewer that are free. Summer engagement is directly related to high school reading levels, school year attendance, and school year academic success.

Program (Preparation, Access, Completion) provides underserved youth with mentoring support to finish high school, graduate college, and start careers.",,,,,"[""College and community college completion rates"",""College matriculation rates"",""Youth unemployment and underemployment""]","We live in an increasingly segregated Los Angeles where youth of color are not benefitting from the advantages of our growing economy. Measure of America’s “Portrait of Los Angeles” estimated that life expectancy would increase by 1.5 years, murder rates would fall by 9%, and the voting rate would increase by 10% if every Angeleno graduated from high school. LA is now a majority Latino community- yet more than three in ten young Latino immigrants aren’t enrolled in school of any kind.



 Our College PAC program launched as a pilot in the Fall of 2016 with a focus on 150 Juniors and Seniors in high school and 55 first year college students. Our pilot was particularly directed at first generation college bound youth of color, including many undocumented students. The core of the pilot program provides professionally supported mentorships to assist students with graduating high school, applying for college, and in persisting through the first year of postsecondary education. By facilitating a positive relationship that provides social, emotional, and academic support for youth, we can help them overcome the significant barriers holding them back from a college success.



 For high school students preparing to attend college, the College PAC program team also provides supplementary workshops and materials to address common gaps in knowledge and skills of underserved youth, their families, and mentors. The College PAC program produced extremely promising results: 100% of the Littles receiving support from the program graduated high school and matriculated to a 2 or 4 year college and 100% of the mentees enrolled in college persisted through their first year of school. College PAC students in high school also improved their SAT scores by 119 points on average. In partnership with the LA Mayor’s Office, starting in 2018 all college youth in the program will also be eligible for paid internships at major entertainment corporations in fields such as tech, business development, and production as part of Mayor Eric Garcetti’s efforts to diversify the industry.



 With a LA2050 partnership, we will have the staff resources to support college and career preparation and training for one-to-one mentoring of youth as early as 2nd grade that continues through college completion. This will directly impact 6000+ youth/mentors/families in our programs. Our current College PAC Coordinator will focus on developing the curriculum to support all mentors, mentees, and families. She will also focus on building upon our partnerships with the Mayor’s Office and the California Community Foundation’s Young Men of Color (YMOC) Initiative to share our resources and promote mentorship as a crucial component of college and career prep across the region.",Learn,2018007,https://activation.la2050.org/learn/big-brothers-big-sisters-of-greater-los-angeles/big-brothers-big-sisters-of-greater-los-angeles.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J0TBcxjUQY
8102008,2018,Invest in Youth Coalition: Advocating for a Los Angeles that prioritizes young people,"We demand an equitable strategy and coordinated approach to comprehensive youth development, led by a city department focused on creating prosperity for all of LA’s young people.",,,,,"[""Number of households below the self-sufficiency standard"",""Prevalence of adverse childhood experiences"",""Resilient communities""]","Over 800,000 youth between 10 to 24 years of age live in the City of Los Angeles. A majority of this population, 81% are youth of color, and creating opportunities for this population will help them reach their full potential and make the City more prepared for the future. 
 
 
 
 Opportunities for youth to engage as decision-makers and community leaders becomes a driving force in their likelihood of being publicly engaged and creates a life-long dedication to the wellbeing of their neighborhoods. Youth who have limited opportunities are at higher risk of developing personal, social, and behavioral problems. Youth who have access to civic engagement, educational opportunities, vocational programs, and health services have higher rates of psychological and emotional stability, positive self-esteem, and greater risk management capacities. Access to these programs and services makes it less likely for young people to engage in unhealthy behaviors such as smoking, alcohol and substance abuse, crime and violence, and unsafe sex. Positive youth development has also been found to have a positive relationship to life satisfaction.
 
 
 
 An emphasis on preventing risky behaviors, preparation for the workforce, after school services, and raising academic achievement are all increasing the demand for youth programs. Los Angeles faces significant challenges in this area since policymakers have not adequately funded and successfully coordinated effective services. In fact, LA is only spending $75 per youth, while San Francisco and New York are spending $1,909 and $541 apiece on their young people. The City’s current youth development effort is a piecemeal approach with multiple agencies managing various programs. We believe is it critical that one coordinating body be responsible for identifying strategies that increase positive outcomes and opportunities for young people.
 
 
 
 Our activation will make LA the best place to live by demanding a greater investment in our city’s youth. This investment supports the healthy development of young people across various sectors, such as leadership development and workforce training, recognizes youth of color as one of our greatest assets in an increasingly globalized economy, and is a critical component of citywide efforts to combat poverty, reduce violence, and decrease homelessness.
 
 
 
 The City of Los Angeles should recognize how critical young people are to its economy, culture, and civic discourse — both today and in the future. Nonetheless, the City minimally invests in programs that benefit youth. The future of our City depends on the next generation of young Angelenos becoming ready for the transition into the workforce and/or higher education. It is time to ensure that all youth have access to high-quality programs—no matter where they live—with public investment to support a Youth Development Department.

The physical geography of California plays a large role in the rising smog levels. Increasing temperatures and higher quantities of pollutants combined with wind patterns and physical barriers such as mountains result in areas with high quantities of trapped air pollutants. One clear example of this is the city of Los Angeles which is surrounded by the San Gabriel and San Bernardino mountains. Los Angeles is home to some of the worst air quality in the country (number one for ozone and fifth for year-round particle pollution).
 
  
 
 Changing regional weather patterns are causing heat waves or extreme heat events to become more common, which is increasing the risk of heat-related mortality. Specifically, in urban areas, large quantities of asphalt, tall buildings, and limited trees cause an effect known as an urban heat island. This is a phenomenon when cities are substantially warmer than the surrounding areas. Climate change is intensifying urban heat islands and increasing the risk of mortality in certain communities from circulatory and respiratory diseases. Risk factors for heat-related illnesses and deaths include age, gender, health status, location, and income status. Communities of color experience a large proportion of these risk factors, and they are the most common victims of heat waves. Climate change is predicted to increase heat deaths in Black communities.
 
  
 
 Through blending media, popular education, and policy, our goal is to engage communities of color as well as key stakeholders and elected officials in the climate justice fight with the intention of advancing meaningful institutional change at the state and local level. Using an intersectional lens, we will raise awareness about how climate change can impact Los Angelenos of color both globally and locally, as well as promote solutions that center on the most vulnerable populations. This includes linking how affordable and safe quality housing, transportation, oil drilling, fossil fuel reduction, water and food policies can help prevent further global warming in addition to creating healthier and more sustainable communities for all. Furthermore, by engaging communities of color directly, we can apply more pressure to local and state elected officials to support and champion true climate justice legislation.",Live,2018009,https://activation.la2050.org/live/black-women-for-wellness/black-women-for-wellness.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5Q0W1tCJVg

 We know that we are on the precipice of incredible change in this country. LA is leading the nation’s demographic shift as people of color become the majority of our nation. Yet as our community becomes increasingly diverse, leadership in the social entrepreneurship and nonprofit sectors have struggled to reflect that diversity. 
 
 
 
 Creative innovators drive transformative change in our communities.

Our primary program is CalEITC4Me, a public-private partnership with the Governor’s office and State to conduct outreach and education about the California Earned Income Tax Credit (CalEITC). 
 
 
 
 As inequality grows in California, work is simply not paying enough to keep up with rising cost of living and a changing economy. The CalEITC is a cash back tax refund that makes work pay better, and provides much needed assistance in an economy that grows more and more imbalanced every year. In the program’s first two years, it has helped put nearly $2 billion directly into the pockets of almost 800,000 low-income working California families between the state and federal EITC.
 
 
 
 The EITC advances social and economic equity throughout low-income communities by providing financial security and helping reduce short and long term poverty. CalEITC4Me’s aggressive outreach efforts ensure available CalEITC and federal EITC money reach under-resourced communities, bringing economic security in the near term and increased opportunity over time to those in poverty, especially women and children. Research shows children whose families receive an EITC income boost perform better in school, are healthier, and earn more as adults.
 
 
 
 As a result of our advocacy efforts in 2017 to expand access to the CalEITC, where workers making up to $22,300 a year and ALL self-employed people (not just W2) are now covered, over 1.6 million Californians will now be eligible for the CalEITC in 2018. This is triple the eligible population of the last two years, and CalEITC4Me is now responsible for ensuring this population benefits from the economic opportunity created by the CalEITC. We hope to take the success of last year and expand our best practices and organizing model to more of Southern California. 
 
 
 
 Our ultimate goal is to help low-income Californians not only collect thousands of dollars in EITC refunds now, but ultimately achieve life-long sustainable financial security and economic equality. We hope to turn our EITC outreach efforts into a year-round organizing model to further improve EITC uptake, connect EITC filers to other economic benefits, and help provide a platform for the working poor to be heard on issues important to their lives.",Live,2018012,https://activation.la2050.org/live/caleitc4me/caleitc4me.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55FW0fd5Mh4
8102013,2018,Pop-Up Sites for Overnight Temporary Shelter: Serving our homeless neighbors with dignity first,"We will deploy architecturally designed, low-impact shelters made of treated cardboard at managed sites around LA nightly to transform conceptions of what emergency homeless shelter can be.",,,,,"[""Rates of homelessness""]","We need to rethink what an emergency homeless shelter can look like, where it can be located, and how it can better serve and maintain dignity for those experiencing homelessness. LA has the highest numbers in the country of homeless who are without access to shelter, and we also top the percentage of unsheltered homeless (78%) amongst US urban areas. That means over 45,000 people do not have a sanctioned place to sleep as of the Jan 2017 count; the number will likely be higher once the 2018 count is reported in May, given the 26% rise in homelessness between 2016 to 2017.
 
 Emergency shelters are typically conceived of as physical buildings within which people are aggregated into open sleeping arrangements. Two main problems of this approach are: traditional brick-and-mortar facilities cannot be built or converted fast enough to meet the urgent need, and grouping strangers into such an environment can elevate anxieties. Instead of limiting the format of such shelter to permanent structures, our activation reimagines what we can do with existing outdoor lots that can serve multiple purposes, including for very temporary and quickly deployable shelter. The Cardborigamis will also give clients a sense of private space that will reinforce their well-being while a part of the collective site.
 
 Our homeless neighbors belong to all geographies of LA, and they find places to sleep wherever they can, often in areas that are familiar to them. It’s crucial for us to recognize that the need for emergency shelter is dispersed, and concentrating services or resources in a few spots that are hard to reach or require transportation to is not the answer. As reliable access to shelter is top priority for someone to transition off the streets, locating shelter pop-ups closer to where the homeless already are, rather than moving them to far, unfamiliar places, ensures a higher likelihood of them progressing with services. With our no-lasting-trace footprint, Cardborigami will empower neighborhoods with our shelters and joint planning to show that creating a shelter site does not need to be a long-term capital commitment for a what should be a temporary state. This approach also allows for siting that is much more responsive and flexible to changes in demand.
 
 The lack of emergency shelter is an acute bottleneck preventing more homeless from being connected with needed services. Further, what legal shelter is available often has preset limits for who they can accept and how many, based on gender, life stage and official funding allocations of beds for various sub-populations. This type of planning is heavily weighted in infrastructure and cannot adjust to the dynamic conditions or demographics of homelessness. Our activation will increase the efficient use of outreach workers by creating new locations where they can do intakes & assessments for the countywide Coordinated Entry System, while reducing disruptions that unsheltered folks experience with street sweeps.",Live,2018013,https://activation.la2050.org/live/cardborigami-inc/cardborigami-inc.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w47i_b8U5-0&feature=youtu.be
8102014,2018,Youth to Youth: Helping Young Adults Exit Foster Care,CASA of Los Angeles is recruiting graduate-level college students to help young adults in foster care exit the system and build thriving and independent lives.,,,,,"[""Rates of volunteerism""]","Exiting out of foster care can be a terrifying experience. For many young adults who have elected to stay in extended foster care, it will be their first time living on their own. Most of these young people have no support network, and no one to help them adjust to an ever complicated world. But they can have a CASA. It's our job to recruit more Court Appointed Special Advocates to support these youth, and it's our community's opportunity to show up for them and say, ""You are not alone.""
 
 
 
 There are over 2,500 youth in Extended Foster Care in Los Angeles. In the next year or two, they will exit the system, and without help, their futures are challenging. According to a 2011 study, of the youth who age out of foster care in Los Angeles County, one third experienced extreme poverty, 20% received outpatient mental health services, 25% spent time in jail, only 25% were consistently employed, and nearly 40% become homeless. Only 4% will graduate from college. Additionally, young men and women of color are particularly over-represented in this system, and frequently struggle to access and maintain services available to them to help them successfully gain independence. 
 
 
 
 CASA volunteers are critical in helping these young adults negotiate the gauntlet of paperwork, meetings, and phone calls needed in order to access critical social and victim services. CASA of Los Angeles currently serves 100 of these young adults with intensive advocacy, and is launching programming to serve significantly more. This is an opportunity to support young adults in taking charge of their lives and futures — working with them on relationships, problem solving, personal responsibility and skill building to ensure they will thrive. As the students in the Cal State systems reflect the diversity of LA, this program will not only help to better support young men and women of color in the dependency care system, but will target recruitment of more culturally diverse volunteers. Through this project, CASA will recruit youth to serve youth. By training graduate level college students to help young adults exit out of foster care, we will be activating more young Los Angelenos in life-changing volunteer work. But most importantly, we will be helping to change the lives of young people who just need one person to help them succeed.",Connect,2018014,https://activation.la2050.org/connect/casa-of-los-angeles/casa-of-los-angeles.jpg,https://youtu.be/nUykHHtLIHo
8102015,2018,Connection through Council,"To amplify the impact of the LA2050 Activation Challenge and foster deeper compassion amongst Angelenos, Center for Council will train ten of the finalist organizations in the practice of Council.",,,,,"[""Adults getting sufficient social & emotional support"",""Participation in neighborhood councils"",""Rates of volunteerism""]","Council is a tradition of bringing people together in a circle to listen non-judgmentally to one another’s stories and to speak authentically. Combining elements of storytelling and mindfulness, the practice provides a tool for diffusing bias and misunderstanding, fostering more respectful relationships, and supporting the emergence of compassionate and resilient communities.



 Center for Council has worked with over 50 social justice organizations through its Social Justice Council Project. The Social Justice Council Project provides LA nonprofits with training in Council to more effectively listen to and engage with their constituents, and to create more cooperative and supportive internal work environments, mitigating staff stress and burnout. Program evaluation has shown that implementing Council helps participants improve their communication skills, empathy, connectedness, and mindfulness both within and outside the workplace, as well as reduces social anxiety when having to speak in group settings.



 If selected as an LA2050 Activation Challenge winner, Center for Council will employ the Social Justice Council Project model to help strengthen the internal work cultures and programmatic impact of the other five winning organizations and six semi-finalists.



 In order for organizations to positively impact the community at-large, there is a critical need to be able to listen deeply to the populations they serve. Organizational staff must develop a capacity to understand both the context of underlying issues embedded within these populations and the history that lives in the stories of community members and their families. By learning to incorporate Council into their work, participants will experience a deeper connection and enhanced engagement in the in-person interactions they have with the community members they serve, as well as with one another, creating a cultural shift both within the workplace and in Los Angeles at-large. The practice of Council is carried from the workplace to the home, from the home back out into the world, and has the potential to impact every interaction an individual has.



 By integrating deeper listening and compassion-based communication into the LA community, the project will mobilize Angelinos and impact the following LA2050 CONNECT metrics: adults getting sufficient social & emotional support; participation in neighborhood councils; rates of volunteerism; trainings and in-person engagements; encouraging (nonprofit) businesses to change practices; and influencing individual behavior. Participating organizations will both experience and deliver significant positive shifts in personal health (lower stress, less stress-related disease), group health (better communication, more cooperation) and community health (more pro-social, compassion-centered engagement).",Connect,2018015,https://activation.la2050.org/connect/center-for-council-a-project-of-community-partners/center-for-council-a-project-of-community-partners.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAAc3xB3YTk

Those standards were developed by 26 lead states in collaboration with key stakeholders in science, science education, higher education, and industry, based upon the new Framework for K-12 Science Education developed by the National Academy of Sciences. NGSS emphasizes “three-dimensional learning”: disciplinary core ideas, crosscutting concepts, and science and engineering practices. NGSS aligns with Common Core State Standards to prepare students for college and careers. 
 
 
 
 NGSS adoption in California was critical. It had been 15 years since standards were revised, despite numerous advances in the field of science and the innovation driven economy. However, implementation has been uneven with limited teacher training. LA simply cannot be the best place to learn if our science teachers are not given the skills to prepare our students for the future of STEM. Students will not be prepared for college, careers and citizenship unless teachers set the right expectations and goals. Improved science standards will inspire students to pursue STEM in higher education and prepare them for the rigors of college, lifting our higher education completion rates and time to completion. In turn, employers can hire workers with strong science-based skills—including specific content areas but also skills such as critical thinking and inquiry-based problem solving.
 
 
 
 To address the urgent need for training, our activation is an NGSS training that includes a dynamic combination of classroom training, real-time feedback, and group collaboration. It will be rolled out to teachers in LAUSD-Local District South (includes San Pedro, Lomita, Gardena, South LA, South Central LA) and Compton USD. We will train two cohorts of 50 teachers (100 total) in two years. The program will be rolled out according to the following timeline each year:
 
 _Months 1-2:_ Teacher Selection - CISE will collaborate with superintendents and STEM coordinators to identify which schools will most benefit from training. Principals at selected schools will recommend 2-3 K-9 teachers.
 
 _Months 3-4:_ 3 Days of NGSS Classroom Training - Teachers will be trained on the conceptual and instructional shifts from the current standards. They will learn the 3 dimensions of NGSS, analyze lesson plans, and break down the new performance expectations. 
 
 _Months 5-6:_ Classroom Observations - 1) An NGSS expert and teacher will meet in advance to agree on the observation focus and review the lesson plan; 2) The NGSS expert will observe and document evidence of good teaching practices; 3) Formal feedback will be provided.
 
 _Months 7-10:_ Lesson Study Cycles - Teams of teacher trainees will engage in collaborative planning-teaching-observation of learning, followed by lesson evaluation and refinement.
 
 _Months 1-12:_ Training Evaluation and Revision - Will occur on an ongoing basis (details in #12).",Learn,2018016,https://activation.la2050.org/learn/center-for-innovation-in-stem-education-cise/center-for-innovation-in-stem-education-cise.jpg,0

These phases are Human Physiology and Anatomy, Physical Science and Engineering, Marine Biology and Plant Life. A 4-week summer mathematics program is offered to students to encourage reinforcement and retention of academic knowledge gained throughout the academic year. Students are provided with two hours of tutoring each Saturday to increase Proficiency in English and Language Arts and Math. 
 
 
 
 SSA II incorporates Next Generation Science Standards as its base educational framework and is open to students in pre-kindergarten through 12th grade. Similar programs for students typically engage students at the high school level. In preparation for leadership and representation in STEM and health care careers, SSA II enrolls students early in their academic career to encourage early interest and involvement in STEM, increase college matriculation rates, connect youth with volunteer, mentorship, research opportunities, and increase proficiency, at or above grade level, in English and Language Arts, Math, and science.
 
 
 
 The program strategy also includes a College Readiness component where high school students are offered SAT preparation, test tasking skills, a critical thinking course, college application completion assistance and monitoring, inclusive of college readiness activities designed to improve students' academic profile and increase college matriculation rates. The academic agenda evolves from the Charles Drew University Mission Statement, ""To conduct education, research, and clinical services in the context of community engagement to train health professionals who promote wellness, provide care with excellence and compassion, and transform the health of underserved communities."" Students are engaged in their school communities through community service collaborative partnerships with local school districts/schools, teachers and parents/caregivers.
 
 
 
 SSA II follows best practice program models and incorporates three unique features: Parent Involvement, community engagement, and pre-kindergarten through 12th grade student participation. Research demonstrates parent involvement as a critical component of student academic success. Parents are actively engaged through coordinated program support activities as a way to increase program retention and support of student activities. Teachers for this program are local college students who volunteer their time to give back to the community. Students in the program connect with college students, learn about their experiences, and are motivated as they engage with demographically representative teachers on a weekly basis.",Learn,2018017,https://activation.la2050.org/learn/charles-r-drew-university-of-medicine-and-science/charles-r-drew-university-of-medicine-and-science.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xHS8SSMejQ

 Child360’s Community Engagement team will facilitate community meetings to ensure collaboration between local agencies and their stakeholders that include families, residents, business-owners, neighborhood councils, and volunteers. Child360 will collaborate with partner groups to assess the capacities and gaps of the community partnerships and to develop plans to build capacity in areas where assistance is needed. Types of assistance could include:
 
 
 
 * Trainings for local trainers on the Center for the Study of Social Policy’s Strengthening Families™ Protective Factors (SFPF) Framework, which focuses on five factors of parental resilience, social connections, concrete support in times of need, knowledge of parenting and child development, and socioemotional competence of children
 
 * Trainings on advocacy strategies and tactics and provision of tools to increase constituents’ capacity to improve government responsiveness (past examples include a Community Ambassador Toolkit and an online Voter Voice platform that helps local constituents understand and flex their power in local, state, and national politics)
 
 * Trainings to help community partnerships develop skills to identify and apply for funding at the local level

The creation of healthy brain architecture is dependent on good health, positive and nurturing relationships with adults, exposure to enriching learning opportunities, and safe neighborhoods. Yet, many of LA’s babies don’t receive the supports they need for a health start. 
 
 
 
 Children Now is committed to supporting and connecting the incredible constituency power that exists in LA to influence state and local policymaking in favor of our youngest kids. Policymakers are paying too little attention and allocating too few resources to those formative early years. We will execute a multi-faceted communications plan to raise awareness, build public support, and activate Angelenos behind a social media campaign in support of quality care, education and experiences for all of LA’s babies. 
 
 
 
 Children Now will leverage its reach to hundreds of organizations and businesses in LA County through The Children’s Movement, a network of more than 470 direct service, business, parent, civil rights, faith-based and community-based organizations dedicated to improving the lives of kids, as well as use social media analytics to identify key organizations and businesses to promote messaging on early brain and social emotional development. Among this group, we will select key organizations and businesses that have a strong social media presence in LA to partner on social media content distribution. By coordinating the social media reach of hundreds of organizations behind one campaign, we will increase social media connections among Angelenos.
 
 
 
 Once our influencer network is established, Children Now will develop and disseminate weekly content and toolkits for social media influencers to share online and to educate reporters on infant and toddler issues. This content will include:

 * Video blog posts on early brain development and social emotional development for young children;
 
 * Shareable memes and photos with data points highlighting the need for better supports for infants and toddlers; 
 
 * Links to partners’ and researchers’ reports and materials that highlight infant and toddler issues; and
 
 * Social media posts targeted at key state and LA County candidates of the 2018 election.

With this in mind, our team of communications experts conducted research and focus groups to develop a winning, digital campaign to recruit foster parents and mentors, while at the same time reintroducing viewers to the potential of foster youth.
 
 In a new approach for the field, FosterMore uses21st century techniques to engage people in the lives of youth in care. This kind of specific targeting works at two levels—at best we have recruited a new person to actively support foster youth, while at the same time we have promoted the larger mission of FosterMore, to change hearts and minds, reducing stigmas for foster youth. 
 
 In 2016, we ran a pilot campaign which produced 133 leads for local agencies at a cost of roughly $68 per lead. To build upon that success, the online media buy began employing predictive analytics and big data to provide accuracy and effectiveness. In 2017, armed with the latest in digital targeting and additional creative content, we produced over 1,800 leads and referred 260 prospective foster parents for just $26,000 (or $14/lead). 
 
 The campaign messaging features uplifting stories of individuals and families whose lives were positively impacted by foster care. Set to the One Direction hit song “The Story of My Life” with voiceover provided by Emmy winning actor Ty Burrell, the moving ads received a prestigious Cynopsis Social Good Award for best ad over 30 seconds and earned FosterMore a commendation from the County Board of Supervisors.
 
 The funds from the LA2050 grant will enable us to continue this campaign for two additional years, reaching and connecting with 500,000 Angelenos, who will view the content during the run of the campaign.

The tens of thousands of people gathered along miles of streets connecting our communities come from all parts of the city and region, and represent the diversity of our population. They voluntarily travel, sometimes as far away as San Diego or Ventura counties, to explore, rediscover, and interact with both the neighborhoods and each other. While CicLAvia has become a tradition in LA with 24 events since 2010, CicLAvia continues to resonate as a place to connect, where about one-third of the attendees are first-time participants who are drawn to the experience of connection, and where more than 60% of the participants arrive in groups of 3 or more — which represent a high family-oriented experience.
 
 
 
 The activation, called “When LA Listens” will serve as the vehicle to document and curate, for the first-time, the real-time stories, perspectives, and experiences of attendees at CicLAvia open streets events. The stories will be captured through:
 
 1. Key locations along the route will be transformed into video listening stations where people will have an opportunity to share experiences. 
 
 2. Roaming video interviewers along the route who will directly capture people’s experiences.
 
 
 
 CicLAvia will develop and promote a dedicated and curated website to serve as the online space to showcase the stories. A video library will be established to insure that all stories will have a permanent home.
 
 
 
 The 2019-2020 CicLAvia season will see no less than 8 CicLAvia open streets events throughout the city and region. We anticipate creating new routes and experiences in South LA, Central LA Downtown LA East LA, Northeast LA, San Fernando Valley, Westside, San Gabriel Valley, Glendale, and Culver City.
 
 
 
 Since the first CicLAvia in 2010, LA has transformed in many ways. Former LA Times writer Christopher Hawthorne stated that: “CicLAvia hasn't only allowed Angelenos to see the city and its architecture with fresh eyes. It has allowed us to see ourselves with fresh eyes.”
 
 
 
 When more than 100,000 people continue to come to a single CicLAvia event after 24 events, it tells us that Angelenos have a strong desire to belong to a larger community. CicLAvia helps create a space and place for the larger community to come together. There are no windshields to block out the ambient noise of the car’s engine. Instead, it is replaced by the ambient noise of conversations and story-telling along the route.

 Year 1: CALL: Conversation, outreach, and engagement. 
 
 Citizens of Culture will host 10-100person events bringing together Angelenos for intentional conversation. This means that 1,000 people in total will gather to discuss Racial Justice, Net Neutrality, Gender Equity, Technological Unemployment, Housing& Homelessness, Immigration, Religion/Spirituality, Economic Inequality, Climate Change, and Fake News/ Political Polarization.
 
 
 
 Each event will feature small groups of 10 to share stories, humanize each discussion , center individual impact on the larger topic, which is often missing from political debate. The stories and experiences shared here will be highlighted to the groups of 100 to speak on how these human stories may have hit home or shifted perspective. Recap videos of the events will model how face to face conversation can be used to build shared values and bring the discussions to larger audiences. Each clip will end with local organizations working on solutions that are accepting donations and volunteers.
 
 
 
 Year 2: RESPONSE: Collaboration, research and, practice.

The intention will be to assist affordable housing developers — seeking to leverage the expansion of resources and legislation, to expand the availability of affordable housing. This will be done while educating and empowering residents to be participate and guide these developments to serve these new residents, as well as those already living in these communities.
 
 
 
 Working with students and faculty of California State University Long Beach’s Geography Department, City Fabrick along with affordable housing providers and community partners will map and define optimum areas within South Los Angeles County to consider developing new affordable housing. This will be based on a variety of factors including access to transportation, community amenities and services, funding sources, and availability of developable opportunities. Within these opportunity areas, focus areas will be identified for City Fabrick and community partners to engage.
 
 
 
 City Fabrick and community partners will initiate contact with core constituents to determine the landscape of needs and opportunities for affordable housing and community development within these focus areas, determining the most well suited development partner for each area. This can include target populations for housing — like senior living, families, or those with special needs, as well as amenities, services, and assets that can be leveraged to best serve these communities. Residents and community partners will begin to learn about the development process, so they are empowered to constructively participate in defining these and future developments.
 
 
 
 City Fabrick will collaborate with these affordable housing developers and community partners in each of these focus area, reaching out to the broader community to further define and refine those needs while collectively identifying opportunities for affordable housing in those communities. This will balance optimum development opportunities with the ability to maximize the future public-private investment for community development. This will also consider the capacity to leverage existing assets and proposed future investments to maximize their collective impact.
 
 
 
 A series engaging workshops with residents and community partners will facilitate collaboration for each proposal through conceptual design. This process will continue through until initial submittal to the approving jurisdiction, where the local government will likely lead the design’s refinement for their approval.

From the Helms bakery trucks and their baked goods-announcing whistle to the iconic twang jingle of an ice cream truck drew families from their homes on summer nights and weekends to join together for a cool treat, trucks called people from their homes to meet on the street. In the 21st century, Angelenos continue to expect mobile delivery of what they want from the Kogi-launched gourmet food truck industry to Amazon’s on-demand packages. Yes, people are more connected than ever to the world but less so to their neighbors. Learning from the past, The BlockMobile models home-delivery of treats and goods and applies that to civic engagement and neighborhood leadership.
 
 
 
 The BlockMobile is an innovative design to make civic and community engagement a good that can too be brought to the front doors of Angelenos. Connecting in LA must be achieved at the most local level: on the streets. Too often, civic engagement is pushed from the top down, and The BlockMobile seeks to engage traditionally tough-to-engage Angelenos living in apartments where they live: on their block. And by doing so, we will create a fun space for neighbors to connect, micro issues to be identified, and for local leaders to emerge. 
 
 
 
 The BlockMobile concept is simple: pack a food truck-style vehicle with community engagement tools and resources, promote the trucks visit in advance to a block, park the truck on a block for 2 hours, and draw neighbors to connect with each other with food, games, and conversations about living on their block. Partnering with local agencies like LAPD, LAFD, local non-profits and larger community groups, this localized engagement will also provide resources to participants and offer them the opportunity to talk specifically about their local concerns. The BlockMobile and partners will be trained to support individuals in understanding they can address their local issues, and offer those interested the opportunity to be supported in their effort to continue the dialogue and create a small neighborhood action plan (SNAP) for the issue of concern. These hyperlocal leaders will be offered monthly support and connected to a network of other local leaders as well as given support to continue conversation with their own neighbors on their block.
 
 
 
 This local activation will see at least five events per week in the evenings and weekends (when people are home) on as many blocks, with the intention of identifying at least one new, hyperlocal leader to volunteer to tackle a local concern, whether its hosting more block gatherings or as simple as learning how to request a sidewalk repair or pothole to be filled.

The project will provide education about the importance of engaging online and how to do so safely.,,,,,"[""Enrollment in early care and education programs"",""Students’ immersion in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math content"",""Youth unemployment and underemployment""]","Technology has changed the way we live and interact with each other and how we access services that aid our daily living. Not having online access to services or understanding how to participate in an online/always connected world can leave a community behind and drastically expand the digital divide. To address the needs of Angelenos who may be experiencing this gap in technology adoption, the City of Los Angeles’ Information Technology Agency (ITA) plans to provide Digital Literacy programming to under-connected residents to ensure all Angelenos have access to opportunities and services. This builds upon the current ITA OurCycleLA Digital Inclusion programming and the Digital Literacy education provided by LA Public Library System (LAPL). 
 
 
 
 As the City of Los Angeles is working to be a premier Smart City of the future there is continuous innovation to improve City services from traffic congestion to clean streets to air quality monitoring. Thus City is embarking on how to work smarter using technology and data. With this comes the challenge of ensuring that all Angelenos are digitally connected to their communities and to the City at large. Digital connectivity, or internet connectivity, is not only important for accessing City services, it is also a major component for educational advancement, job opportunity identification, healthcare services and remaining connected to friends and family. 
 
 As the City looks to a future where everyone has equitable broadband access in their homes or places of school or work, this GoDigital! LA’s Digital Literacy Program proposal will provide an interactive learning program for currently ‘under-connected’ families in South LA to understand the benefits on going online as well as how to do so in a safe manner. For those who are not currently active in the Digital economy, there may be a fear of going online, a lack of trust as well as a lack of understanding as to how it applies to their everyday lives. This population may not be connected for a variety of reasons - lack of interest, lack of access to affordable services, lack of access to technology. However through the City of LA’s Libraries and Community Based Organizations, there’s an opportunity for this population to gain the skills and grow the confidence needed to use online services to improve livability.
 
 
 
 This project will engage parents, grandparents, students, etc. as a way of erasing the Digital Divide. The program will specifically teach safe tasks such as creating a secure login, as well as provide education on how to use computers, mobile phones and tablets to engage in activities from paying bills, helping children with homework, to engaging in activities as streaming faith-based programming or one’s favorite music.
 
 
 
 The pace of technological changes is fast, this project will make sure no Angeleno is left behind and that they are prepared to actively participate in a mobile, digital economy.",Learn,2018025,https://activation.la2050.org/learn/city-of-los-angeles-information-technology-agency/city-of-los-angeles-information-technology-agency.jpg,https://youtu.be/5eE1kF4xL2U

The trend over the last 25 years has shown significant improvements in smog and pollutants until recently. In the last couple of years this trend has shown an increase in the pollutants. Air quality information from the California Environmental Protection Agency’s Air Resources Board has been invaluable to identify the most highly-impacted communities statewide — many of which are found in Los Angeles — and thus provide a warning for those that are particularly sensitive to the health hazards of air pollution such as asthmatics, young children, the elderly, pregnant women and people with compromised immune systems but does not provide this information at a community level. 
 
  
 
 This proposal will provide local air quality information directly to the City policy makers, as we are currently reliant on information provided to us by the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD). SCAQMD inspectors are spread far and wide, and required to cover the entire Southland. It would be a tremendous advantage to have access to our own air quality data within the 500 square miles that constitutes the City of Los Angeles. This could lead to development of our own air quality polices, and ultimately programs designed to mitigate the harmful effects of our residents.
 
  
 
 Additionally, this will give residents a sense of ownership and responsibility for their communities and their destiny. Air quality is impacted by large issues such as car emissions, but can also be impacted at a local level due to traffic patterns, zoning, industrial uses, and the number of vegetation and trees that are present. This information will allow the City and those communities that partner with this proposal to observe the disparities in communities and attempt to link them to specific contributing factors. 
 
 
 
 The data gathered will become available on the City’s open data portal so the public is informed. In addition, this project has the potential to develop and place air quality sensors “beacons” that will provide an instantaneous visual indication of the current air quality in the local area.",Live,2018026,https://activation.la2050.org/live/city-of-los-angeles-bureau-of-street-lighting/city-of-los-angeles-bureau-of-street-lighting.jpg,https://youtu.be/tVCxc_xD6Xo
8102027,2018,Imagine. Recruit. Transform. Inspire.,"City Year Los Angeles connects Angelenos across the city to beautify school campuses, making them more welcoming, vibrant places for students to learn.",,,,,"[""Rates of volunteerism""]","Los Angeles is a city filled to bursting with diverse, vibrant communities. But for many in our city it can be easy to grow isolated within our own neighborhoods, and we don’t always take the opportunity to experience all that is happening across Los Angeles. City Year Los Angeles seeks to connect Angelenos across community lines, bringing them together in the name of service. We will engage volunteers from all over the city to beautify school campuses in some of the highest need neighborhoods in Los Angeles. Together we will paint murals, tend gardens and build the necessary infrastructure to make every child’s school an exciting place to learn. 
 
 
 
 We believe that volunteerism and civic engagement are at the heart of building a strong democracy, and at the center of our organization is the conviction that no matter where someone lives, they should play an essential role in making sure their larger community is healthy and thriving. In fact, our service is founded in Martin Luther King, Jr.’s idea that “everyone can be great, because everyone can serve.” It is our dream to engage every single Angeleno in one of our volunteer projects, giving each person an opportunity to give back to their community. When we volunteer in our schools, we show students that adults who aren’t even from their communities care about them. Every child deserves to know that even if we don’t always look like each other, we are there to look out for each other.
 
 
 
 In addition to connecting Angelenos from all over the city, beautifying schools helps students feel safe, comfortable and at-home in their school environment. When we paint a school’s walls we help ensure that every school is a space where a child is excited to learn. It is our hope that creating these spaces helps keep kids in school and invested in their education. We work closely on every project with a school’s administration to make sure we are doing projects that align with a school's goals. Many of our elementary school partners are trying to promote a college-going culture on their campuses, so we paint college logos and examples of pathways to success to help manifest this culture of excellence. At our high schools we often paint murals that help generate school pride and bring together the student body as one unified community. We also paint school blacktops and handball courts with games and activities to help provide students with spaces to play as they learn. 
 
 
 
 One example of our incredible impact is our annual Martin Luther King, Jr. Day of Service. On this day we connect over 800 people in volunteerism, including students, teachers, corporate partners, political leaders, community members and City Year AmeriCorps members and their families. Every year on this day we build bridges across town in order to transform a high school in need. At other projects throughout the year we engage students from independent schools and their families, as well as individuals from every sector and walk of life.",Connect,2018027,https://activation.la2050.org/connect/city-year-los-angeles/city-year-los-angeles.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUBvw2A2YMI

Already home to the nation’s third largest technology community behind Silicon Valley and New York City, Los Angeles has demonstrated the talent, resources, and empathy that are the foundation of a successful entrepreneurship community.
 
  
 
 However, like any innovation community, its success or failure will hinge in part on its infrastructure for taking new ideas to market. This infrastructure is especially important for civic technologists and entrepreneurs who are on the front lines of breaking down barriers to new frontiers of public and social sector innovation.
 
  
 
 Over the last decade, we have seen cities become overburdened with increasing demands and limited resources, all the while a cadre of local citizens and organizations have been raising their hands to utilize technology to help make their cities work better. The rise of the hackathon model is evidence of the pent up demand from the tech community to work on issues that matter. While hackathons can jumpstart the process that leads to lasting solutions, we are fundamentally missing the civic infrastructure that bridges the digital divide and brings expert citizens, the tech community, and local government together in a process to yield measurable civic and social impact.
 
 
 
 Launched in 2014, Civic Innovation Lab (CIL) serves as a platform to facilitate cross-sector collaboration and the creation of civic and social solutions through a mix of design challenges, structured programming, and networking with public and private sector experts.
 
  
 
 We believe all citizens, not only developers and programmers, need to be engaged in how technology improves our public lives and makes government more effective. We recognize that experts in policy, urban planning, social justice, and citizens at large may be the best suited to develop solutions that lead to measurable impact in the public sphere. To this end, our programs aim to engage anyone with a project or idea and connect them to volunteers with the necessary design and tech skills and subject matter expertise in order to partner and prototype solutions.
 
  
 
 We also know that to get real traction and develop civic tech that works, it needs to happen through a facilitated process that involves engagement and testing over time. We aim to create civic infrastructure that brings expert citizens, the tech community, and government together in a process to yield measurable civic and social impact.",Create,2018028,https://activation.la2050.org/create/civic-innovation-lab/civic-innovation-lab.jpg,0

Over the last year, Common Sense began efforts to broaden our reach to low-income Latino families in Los Angeles. We launched a new destination for Spanish-speaking families, Common Sense Latino, which features all of our Spanish-language resources including blog posts, reviews, and advice content. This content development is led by specialists in Latino-focused communications and parent advice experts. We’ve also formed a Latino Advisory Council to help forge new partnerships with grassroots LA organizations serving Latino families. To date, we’ve established partnerships with key organizations such as Abriendo Puertas and EveryoneOn/ConnectHome, as well as with several school districts, such as Compton Unified, that are interested in educating Latino families about media and technology. 
 
 
 
 With support from LA 2050, we will strengthen our partnerships with these organizations as well as build relationships with additional nonprofits working with Latino families. These partnerships allow us to bring the content we are creating at the national level directly to parents locally. Specifically, we will engage in the following activities: 
 
 
 
 Facilitate parent workshops to help families understand the impact of media and how to best guide their kids - a unique opportunity for families who are not tech savvy to understand better the digital world, identify tools to support their kids goals, feel safe so they can learn. 
 
 
 
 Create new and culturally-relevant content (English and Spanish) for families, including tip sheets, recommended lists, and other parent-facing resources covering a wide range of topics including:
 
 *Helping families discover and use quality and age-appropriate media with their kids
 
 *Establishing a healthy media diet, using technology to bond with kids, and media that brings family together
 
 *Using media to support academic goals
 
 *Supporting kids in being good digital citizens and discovering new ways that technology can empower kids’ learning at home and in school
 
 
 
 Establish more partnerships with community organizations ( i.e. Para Los Ninos, First 5 LA) to disseminate our content with the families they serve.
 
 
 
 Provide in-person training to community-based educators, who will then provide workshops to families on media and technology issues
 
 
 
 Through these efforts, we will help kids build the skills they need to harness technology for learning and life - from using the internet safely and responsibly to using media and technology to optimize learning. Our award-winning Digital Citizenship program covers media balance and well being, digital footprint and identity, privacy and safety, relationships and communication, digital drama, cyberbullying and hate speech, and news and media literacy.

Yet in the country that invented the Internet, nearly one in five Americans (64 million), disproportionately from low-income and minority communities, are not connected to the Internet at home, forcing them to use inconvenient public sources to access basic services. The global impact of the digital divide lies in how it compounds and deepens other social inequalities. For example, 80% of K-12 students need Internet to do homework, 90% of college applications are filled out online, and 90% of job applications are hosted online. An unemployed person who has Internet at home will be employed over seven weeks faster, due to availability of online job search platforms and advice, which translates into over $5,000 in additional income over a year. Across the realms of education, employment, and beyond, the means of advancement are digital in this day and age. 
 
 
 
 EveryoneOn is committed to eliminating the digital divide by making high-speed, low-cost internet, computers/tablets, and free digital literacy training accessible to all unconnected people in the U.S. By employing a dynamic strategy through the Digital Equity Champion Initiative, we plan to connect low-income households throughout the county, a population that is dramatically underserved and the least likely to be connected. If we can eliminate the digital divide within low-income communities with this initiative, we can use connectivity to create social mobility for all. 
 
 
 
 Connecting people to the internet creates opportunities for an abundance of connections. Internet connectivity is imperative in providing all Los Angeles students with access to early education programs, the capability to graduate from high school and be college and career ready, and acts as a key tool in parents ability to be engaged and empowered to direct their children’s learning.

Today, Coro’s multiple leadership development programs continue to strengthen the region’s leadership pipeline by cultivating a community of alumni who are shaping the future of Los Angeles.
 
 
 
 NLP will bring Coro’s proven training methodology to South LA community leaders and equip them with the skills they need to understand complex policy issues and effectively enact impactful change in their communities. Program participants will also gain an in-depth understanding of city and county government, political campaigns, and large-scale community organizing efforts.
 
 
 
 Through the program components outlined below, participants will gain the knowledge, skills and network to directly impact three metrics outlined under LA2050’s CONNECT goal: (1) government responsiveness to residents’ needs; (2) increased participation in neighborhood councils; (3) and increased rates of volunteerism.
 
 
 
 1) Interviews: Through inquiry-based exploration, NLP participants will interview leaders across the public, private, and nonprofit sectors in South LA, helping participants to build key relationships and expand their social capital, learn important subject matter from experts, and build strategies to advocate for their communities.
 
 2) Issue Days: Each cohort will travel the region to explore policy issues and complex community challenges. Participants will come away with in-depth knowledge of the issues persistent in their neighborhoods, and the resolve to enact change.
 
 3) Group Projects: NLP cohorts will engage in group projects, immediately applying the program tools and knowledge gained to navigating complex challenges with high levels of ambiguity. This includes a Neighborhood Logic Study, where the cohort will collectively study and present on the “logic” of their community.
 
 4) Seminar Training: Participants will engage in leadership development, reflective practice, and hard skills training through a variety of analytical tools and frameworks used to train civic leaders for over 60 years.
 
 5) Community Change Projects: NLP participants will apply their program learnings and newly expanded networks to launch community change projects addressing the salient challenges they’ve identified and explored throughout their experience.
 
 
 
 NLP’s core goal is to connect community leaders in South LA to each other and to the civic network in the region.

Approximately 80% are women of color who contribute to the rich, diverse street food landscape through the informal economy. They bring healthy, affordable, culturally diverse food to Angelenos, and when allowed to do their work legally and safely, contribute to the economic vitality of their neighborhoods and our city as a whole.
 
 
 
 The LA Street Vendor Campaign organizes and advocates for rights for street vendors as an important part of an inclusive and equitable LA economy. Through this activation we seek to mobilize a broad base of Angelenos to learn about and get involved in this important economic justice issue. We will also engage street vendors, businesses and manufacturers to work together to safeguard street vending as a viable and valuable asset to neighborhood-based economies in LA. 
 
 
 
 Our activation has multiple pathways to engagement for Angelenos and includes: 1) Information: a dynamic public outreach campaign on social media that will activate over 100,000 Angelenos by tapping into the extensive membership base of our 65 coalition member organizations; 2) Participation: concrete opportunities for a diverse cross-sector of Angelenos to make their voices heard in the new policy formation by participating in public hearings and engaging their representatives; 3) Action: a #isupportLAstreetvendors “buycott” will be part of a digital activism strategy to activate Angelenos around the campaign. 
 
 
 
 Our activation will also include vital capacity building for street vendors to succeed and thrive, with training on how to navigate permitting, business development, and relationship building with manufacturers for supplies and equipment. And, through outreach and organizing we will work to get small business owners, manufacturers, policy makers, and street vendors working together to make the LA economy equitable and inclusive for micro-entrepreneurs, recognizing the economic benefits they bring to their communities. 
 
 
 
 This activation will impact the CREATE metrics by: fostering entrepreneurship and increasing secure employment in the culinary arts, among the most vibrant creative industries in our city; making the local economy more inclusive and diverse, increasing both jobs for and businesses owned by women and people of color; impacting the GINI coefficient by allowing low-income entrepreneurs to generate more wealth; and engaging the manufacturing industry to supply critical equipment and supplies to street vendors at prices scaled to their small enterprise.

Whether it’s a field trip, community service project, workshop, weekend camp, or social event, what we create is an uninhibited space. It’s within this environment of wonder we begin the work of building belief in self and the road to empowerment. The next layer is utilizing the powerful diversity within our city, the richness of the human experience, and bringing participants from all walks of life together.
 
 Our current community of youth and adults is far-reaching. Eayikes programs serve teens of Hollywood movie producers to Skid Row residents. It’s through the power of this diversity that we begin to plant seeds of compassion and a care for the “other” through the recognition of shared humanity. Ultimately we believe for someone to take action, to actually take time out of their day-to-day lives to engage with the world around them (and the issues affecting their neighbor), he/she must either feel an emotional connection to that affected person(s) or to the people engaging in the activity together. This is how we build community and, at the very core, relationships between people becoming empowered.
 
 For the young people we work with, role-modeling is the most powerful tool in creating a safe space to connect and explore. Our programming always starts with play, such as improv games and partner introduction activities, which teach the practice of stepping into one’s authentic self. We break down the fear of judgement and this process is transformational. From this place of empowerment we then create opportunities for youth to reflect and share about their life experiences - celebrating differences and embracing commonalities. Whether it’s young people from low-income and high-income communities camping together or young people realizing their personal greatness and belief in themselves, it’s the micro breakdowns of barriers that, over time, lead to macro breakthroughs. And as much as youth are in-need, over the course of 5 years of experimentation and programming, we’ve found adults to be equally in-need of this barrier breaking work. 
 
 We’ve learned how as we grow older adults lose touch of their childlike-wonder; becoming hardened and jaded by the ways of the world. As guides, we reconnect adults back to themselves by providing respites from the hustle of life and opportunities to engage in fulfilling enrichment. We are seeing our adult participants growing in their capacity to see themselves as agents of change, and finding immense emotional support in our uninhibited spaces of self-reflection and sharing. We utilize the power of paying-it-forward and the fun within our community-building programming to draw more adults into this social and emotional support system.",Connect,2018036,https://activation.la2050.org/connect/eayikes/eayikes.jpg,https://youtu.be/PtA8wOP6XuM

But they also likely think of the traffic and the smog, and their effects on our environment and our kids. It’s true that in our state, emissions from our transportation system accounts for a majority of the emissions that lead to climate change, and dirty air days are on the rise for the last three years running. These impacts are magnified on our city’s kids, leading to an astounding million days of missed school for kids suffering from respiratory problems, who travel to and from school on polluting school buses powered by dirty energy we don’t need. It shouldn’t be this way.

But what if these school buses were powered by electricity, generated from the sun and the wind? The LA County Electric Bus Coalition is working to convince the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) to take a critical step towards making our city the best place to live, cleaning up our air and creating a safer, healthier climate for the kids of today and tomorrow by transitioning its old polluting school buses to new, clean and safe electric buses by 2030 or sooner, that are manufactured right here in Southern California. 
 
 
 
 Our coalition has already had two major successes that are laying the groundwork for an all-electric school bus fleet. First, we convinced LA Metro to make a historic commitment to transition its fleet of more than 2,400 buses to electric buses by 2030. Second, we won a commitment from the LA City Council to transition the Department of Transportation’s 350 buses to electric by 2030 or sooner. Together, both commitments represent more than a quarter of all transit buses in the state.
 
 
 
 We know how to win this fight, and it will take Angelenos of all stripes to make it happen. We will activate 100,000 students, teachers, parents and community members in our campaign, engaging them in activations as simple as signing a petition to training a teacher to turn out her students to an event in support of electric buses to engaging young people to monitor air quality on their daily bus commutes. The members of the LA County Electric Bus Coalition are committed to empowering kids to become leaders in their communities and build the movement fighting for a better city for decades to come, cleaning up our air, and creating good jobs for the region.",Live,2018037,https://activation.la2050.org/live/environment-california-research-policy-center/environment-california-research-policy-center.jpg,0

 Family Adventures is a weekly opportunity for families to connect with the outdoors in a supportive environment at local nature destinations. Community partners will provide space for EverWild and highlight events and activities offered at the local destination. Every adventure, following a similar framework, offers child and family-led decision making, open play, and connection to nature. Family members will choose from activities and will have free time to explore and play on their own. Experts in various fields or from the destination will be a resource and meet with families to provide information and/or an interactive activity. Family Adventure allows both the child and parent/guardian to explore and learn, grow in confidence and knowledge, and build community-growth values with other families. Each adventure is followed by a survey to provide feedback, suggestions for locations and activities, and opportunities for families to take the lead in upcoming events. 
 
 
 
 The Environmental Conservancy Program (ECP) is an after school program that works with youth ages 11-17. ECP combines environmental stewardship, positive youth development practices such as involving and engaging youth as equal partners (youth.gov), implementing evidence-based standards to conduct meaningful service learning (National Youth Leadership Council), and open play. Led by qualified staff, youth work together to develop a long-term project to create a positive impact and meaningful change. EverWild will offer cohorts throughout the year at community gardens and the Santa Monica Mountain Range. Based on youth interest, the group will design their own project. ECP offers a high staff to youth ratio to allow seamless integration if youth want to participate after the initial start date. Projects include composting, engaging businesses in green practices, and sustainable trail maintenance techniques.

8102039,2018,TINY CITIES FOR L.A.’S HOMELESS,"Individualized cargo containers, stacked on empty lots, will provide chronic and temporarily homeless people with a place to live, as well as space for the resources they need to survive and succeed.",,,,,"[""Housing affordability"",""Number of households below the self-sufficiency standard"",""Rates of homelessness""]","Tiny Cities LA:

 A holistic solution to solving the homeless crisis today

 Tiny Cities LA, in conjunction with its partners — ModPod Solutions; Dept of Architecture & Design, Los Angeles Trade Technical College; and Nick Rasmussen, Executive Director of Family Promise of the South Bay — intends to build Tiny Cities (“TC’s”) throughout Los Angeles County.

 The team will utilize volunteers to identify vacant land in all sizes throughout the County, and to determine ownership. Small parcels that are geographically close to other vacant land would allow resources to be spread among the TC’s within close proximity of each other. Public transportation corridors, particularly LA Metro, are ideal building areas, and legislation pending in Sacramento relative to building along public transportation corridors may facilitate this project.

 Our homeless agency partner will be instrumental in helping to determine the homeless needs in each community: chronic? drug, alcohol, other mental illness? temporarily homeless families? need education or employment skills? skilled but without employment?

 LATTC design students have drawn the ideal TC space, with the number of residents on approximately ½ block equaling 96. Resources will fit the population, with nutritional food being primary in every community.

 For the chronically homeless, access to mental health and basic medical services are likely important. Families may need educational and vocational counseling, access to computers, and creative “maker-spaces.” All of these would be undertaken with experts in the field and with engaged community volunteers.

 The cargo containers themselves will have a basic living space layout; these can be modified easily for the number of people to be housed in a unit. Architectural students have developed vertical trellises, kinetic canopies for roof gardens, 3D printing recycled fences and tensegrity towers to create, identify and help the energy network in some of their designs. All TC’s will utilize renewable energy and sustainable solutions to the maximum extent possible.

 Units have air conditioning and heating, can be designed back-to-back or multi-layered to provide for more living space, and only have to be hooked up to water to be functional. Pumping the black water is the only on-going maintenance. Units on the ground floor will meet ADA accessibility standards.

 The LATTC design team has worked for over 10 years developing this idea, with partnerships in architecture, engineering and construction, as well as product manufacture.

 Building in costs for stairs, painting, landscaping and other creative aspects, it is estimated that 2 people could be housed for $100,000.



 The LA2050 grant would allow our team to build a prototype in the County that would clearly show the integrity of this concept. ModPod Solutions, the cargo container provider, will adapt its costs to assure that one resource unit and one housing unit can be built on the designated TC#1.",Live,2018039,https://activation.la2050.org/live/family-promise-of-the-south-bay/family-promise-of-the-south-bay.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5y2nTF_hrSE

It is also home to the film industry — a place that falls dramatically short of reflecting the diversity of Los Angeles. To quote Mayor Garcetti, “When ‘Oscars So White’ and ‘Time’s Up’ put a spotlight on inequality in Hollywood, they captured the frustrations of people shut out of the opportunity in what the world knows as LA’s signature industry.” With Made in LA, we aim to open the door for those opportunities, giving a voice to everyone in LA and creating a more connected sense of community by including these important stories in the conversation. We will empower 50 filmmakers (or 50 filmmaker teams) to show us their LA through a series of shorts to be featured as part of an online interactive map and with select films premiering at the LA Film Festival.



 Film Independent will host an open call for community members to submit short films inspired by a three-part prompt: 1) show us your LA, 2) tell us who you are and 3) speak to your future hopes for your neighborhood or the county. There will be no cost to submit, eliminating barriers for filmmakers. Submissions will be solicited via outreach to film schools, LA-based cultural organizations, Film Independent online presence (one million subscribers) and more. All submissions will be reviewed by our Digital Content and LA Film Festival programming team. 50 short works will be selected to represent every corner of the county—from Malibu to East LA and from Long Beach to the Valley. Creators will be diverse, representing an inclusive spectrum of race, gender, ability, sexuality, immigration status and socio-economic status. Likewise, creators are encouraged to explore the prompt across a variety of genres.



 The call for entries will be announced at the LA Film Festival in September 2018. Allowing time to finalize selections, the shorts will begin to premiere online in February 2019. The films will roll out over approximately six months and will be added to a custom playlist on YouTube. The primary digital activation will be on an interactive microsite at filmindependent.org featuring a map of LA, with tiles for the short films placed over their neighborhood that play and expand when clicked. Each short film will include bios, headshots and social media info for the filmmakers. As each film is released, our marketing team will promote the film through social channels, inviting Angelenos to have open discussions about the future of LA and connect on social media. A selection of shorts will play on the big screen as part of a free community event at the LA Film Festival including a conversation with filmmakers discussing how to get more involved in your community followed by a networking event, serving as a way for people to engage and connect in-person. We intend to open up a dialogue about LA and its future by inviting all Angelenos to participate in the conversation and have their stories told.",Connect,2018040,https://activation.la2050.org/connect/film-independent/film-independent.jpg,https://youtu.be/-PSOJBGkQ-Y
8102041,2018,Make LA the first city where everyone can live free from abuse,"FreeFrom is working to revolutionize LA’s response to the epidemic of gender-based violence by making sure every survivor has the financial resources to heal, rebuild and live free from abuse.",,,,,"[""Number of households below the self-sufficiency standard"",""Rates of homelessness"",""Resilient communities""]","Here in LA, 460,000 women will experience severe domestic violence in their lifetimes. The current domestic violence movement focuses on emergency services, but not on the long-term financial security needed to ensure permanent safety of survivors and their families. FreeFrom is changing this paradigm. Through our compensation, credit repair and small business entrepreneurship programs, we work with survivors to create the financial security needed to rebuild their lives free from abuse. 
 
 
 
 Financial insecurity is the number one reason survivors stay in and/or return to abusive relationships. Survivors who leave often do so without the financial means to rebuild their lives (e.g., securing housing, childcare, transportation, etc.), making domestic violence the leading cause of homelessness among women and children nationwide. The 2017 Point in Time Homeless Count found that 50% of homeless women in LA have experienced domestic violence, and the number of homeless individuals with histories of domestic abuse has more than doubled since 2016. If we are to end domestic violence in LA, we must help survivors rebuild financially. Only then can we achieve long-term change.
 
 
 
 In 2017, FreeFrom piloted our Small Business and Financial Repair program through partnerships with more than a dozen domestic violence organizations in Los Angeles as well as the Mayor’s Fund for Los Angeles and the Housing and Community Investment Department of Los Angeles. 
 
 
 
 Through this pilot, we worked with 24 survivors to launch their own small businesses. Of those businesses, 100% yielded a profit within their first month of sales. Ten months later, not one of our clients has returned to the abuse. Instead, they are securing safe housing, building their credit, investing in healing services for themselves and their children and saving for their futures. Ventures started by our clients include seamstress services, catering, jewelry design, cleaning services, hair styling, and handcrafted bath and body products, among others. 
 
 
 
 Tailored to the unique needs of survivors, our services cover the following topics: protecting, repairing and building credit; entrepreneurship as a source of income; business planning; finance and accounting; sales and marketing training; logo design and branding; mentorship; counseling; childcare and self-care; confidence-building and access to seed funding. 
 
 
 
 With the support of LA2050, FreeFrom wants to expand our program to serve survivors in every domestic violence shelter in LA County and build a city in which shelters are not the only solution but rather a stepping stone to safe lives centered around abundance, community and healing. This the Los Angeles we could be. This is a Los Angeles that everyone can live in.",Live,2018041,https://activation.la2050.org/live/freefrom/freefrom.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tCDaZikwNQ

Rewarding Impact and Driving Engagement on LA’s Metro via a Blockchain based Mobile App.,The RideLA app will incentivize use of public transportation by offering a Blockchain based game system through which riders earn credits to exchange for goods and services across LA.,,,,,"[""Attendance at cultural events"",""Travel time to work"",""Number of public transit riders""]","Our app will make LA the best place to CONNECT because it will be fun and it will have clearly measurable impacts on four mobilization paths.
 
  
 
 The app will influence individual behavior by incentivizing use of public transportation. Angelinos know that public transportation is better for the environment, but they aren’t rewarded for using it. Our app will give riders points in three ways: for ‘checking in’ to a bus (or train), for submitting ridership density data and for distance travelled. Those points will be stored in the Blockchain and through partnerships with local businesses riders will be able to exchange their points for goods and services (ex. meals, event tickets, etc…). This will be measured by rider check-ins and density reporting.
 
  
 
 Our app will encourage businesses to change practices through a Blockchain exchange. Businesses that join the exchange will gain positive PR for being supporters of public transportation and for being part of LA’s innovation economy. This will be measured by the number of business that join the exchange and by the number of rider points exchanged.
 
  
 
 Our app will also create a new tool for greater civic engagement. Public transportation projects are expensive and take a long time to complete. Incentivized, rewarded riders are more likely to support transportation projects, be patient with timelines and with possible tax increases for funding. This will be measured by suggesting pro-public transportation social media postings and user response rate.
 
  
 
 Our app will use digital tools, specifically games and Blockchain, to engage and activate Angelinos to care more about our city’s transportation infrastructure. Our generation is media-savvy, digitally literate and politically active. We know what can be accomplished through social networks. #MarchForOurLives is a recent, important example of what we can accomplish. While public transportation is not as urgent an issue as gun control, it is one that we need to tackle now so that we can have a beautiful, healthy city to live in when we are adults in 2050. Change needs to be faster and start now! This will be measured by the number of rider check-ins and the number of pro-public transportation social media postings using RideLA specific hashtags.
 
  
 
 The CONNECT metrics we target are: number of public transit riders, travel time to work, and attendance at cultural events. We will measure riders and travel time by app usage data. We will measure attendance at cultural events by the number of social media postings about events that include the RideLA hashtags.",Connect,2018043,https://activation.la2050.org/connect/geffen-academy-at-ucla/geffen-academy-at-ucla.jpg,https://youtu.be/m9NRl8lAdZY

We represent the true diversity of our society through working with young voices from throughout Los Angeles and developing their on-camera and behind-the-camera talents. The first of its kind, Literary Riot is not only a vehicle for training young artists, but also for featuring and sharing their voices. It is based on the belief that young people’s ideas and solutions matter, and that new platforms are needed to amplify their responses at a particularly challenging and divisive time. Launched in 2017, this in-house incubator and full-service production company is a collective of artists ages 13-23 who have trained as poets and filmmakers with Get Lit. 
 
 
 
 For many of our Literary Riot youth, their first exposure to the power of poetic expression comes through Get Lit’s In-School Program. Eligible and interested young poets continue on as Get Lit Players. Students who are interested in film join our ""Pilot"" Program, a free 16-week course in independent filmmaking in which they learn and implement everything from development to distribution. Graduates are offered a 6 month Literary Riot Fellowship that includes additional classes and on-set experience. Young artists then move into the Literary Riot Content Studio where they receive advanced training and professional opportunities. The original content that they create builds their resumes, pays them, and promotes marginalized youth voices. 
 
  
 
 Literary Riot fosters artistic and professional prospects for these storytellers through continuing education and industry work, as well as training in professional etiquette, business skills, and other tools. It creates a bridge to success between high school and adulthood that is so often lacking in educational institutions, and has a meaningful impact on employment in L.A.’s creative industries, particularly for women and young people of color. 
 
 
 
 In its first year, Literary Riot has developed 5 original web series garnering over 3 million views, and our students’ work has screened at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, The Grammy Museum, and more. Current offerings include original content, in-house productions, manifestos commissioned by companies and organizations, and brand consulting that implements young voices into corporate social impact campaigns. In addition to building L.A.’s profile nationally, many of our Literary Riot filmmakers have become civic activists and gotten involved locally with the Women’s March, March for our Lives, and Rock the Vote, among others. In March 2018, our students were thrust into the epicenter of the national media campaign being supported directly by their youth peers across the country organizing the March For Our Lives. Our students produced the most watched and shared pieces of media for that campaign garnering 4 million views in 10 days.",Create,2018044,https://activation.la2050.org/create/get-lit-words-ignite/get-lit-words-ignite.jpg,https://youtu.be/ioZuMb9vLz8

Girls typically are not found in high level math and science classes, having been discouraged early on in their educational journey. The Girls Academic Leadership Academy (GALA) aims to break this pattern by providing girls with a STEM-centered college prep curriculum in a learning environment that strongly supports girls to be smart, self confident, and successful. GALA provides leadership training and the skills necessary to persist in STEM fields. The GALA Launch Her Future focus is a project based medical and biomedical program which will focus on the intersection of medicine and technology, allowing our girls to become true leaders and innovators in this burgeoning new field. Supporting the LA2050 LEARN metric of students’ immersion in science, technology, engineering, and math content, GALA is requesting support not just in STEM but in the newest field within STEM, including project based medical and technological innovation. GALA aims to encouraging learning and growth in this field by investigating medical mysteries, and using technology to solve them, which will advance the goal of 100% graduation and 100% college matriculation. In studying medical inventions, technological and biomedical innovation, students will work with the same equipment and tools used by professionals in the field. GALA students will be empowered to explore and find solutions to some of today’s most pressing medical challenges. Through activities that connect learning to life, students will step into the roles of biomedical science professionals investigating such topics as use of technology in medicine, genetics and issues in public health. Students will work together in teams to explore problems and find unique solutions, learning in-demand, transferable skills. One of the student inspired goals is health care advocacy and accessibility for Los Angelenos in need especially focusing in on homeless women. Our students hope to one day create an app or digital website that could be used to connect these women to health resources. This connects to the LA is the Healthiest place to LIVE part of LA2050 in that the girls long term goal is to affect greater change through access to medicine in the city. With access to the curriculum and resources, GALA students can explore public health issues such as how to detect and fight infection; screen and evaluate for disease and treatment options; and develop technology to support their findings. Through real-world cases, students will be exposed to a range of interventions, diagnostics, and devices related to immunology, surgery, genetics, and pharmacology.

This program will activate residents in educational, creative reuse workshops and create stronger, more connected, and resilient communities. In cooperation with local businesses, such as breweries and repair shops, as well as local artists and eco-gurus, Global Green will host 6-8 free, hands-on workshops on the art of upcycling and conserving household items by offering repair and repurposing strategies for commonly discarded items such as textiles, electronics, and bicycles. We aim to educate up to 240 Angelenos in these workshops to empower them to “upcycle”, creating a cycle of reusing and repairing items that would otherwise go to landfill. During the workshops, residents will learn how to transform their unwanted, worn out, or damaged items into “new” or improved materials, creating a space for creative reuse and waste prevention in the City of LA. Each workshop will focus on a specific need (i.e. textile mending) based on pre-surveys provided by Global Green to participants, and will include the tools and resources required for residents to reinvent ‘wasted’ items to create greener, more resilient communities. In addition to providing its own expertise for these workshops, Global Green will invite local, relevant experts to lead each workshop and provide one-on-one assistance to attendees.
 
  
 
 The CRC workshops will create more resilient communities by giving residents the ability to become more self-sufficient, resource-efficient, and cost-effective as they are enabled to utilize available resources to their fullest potential. Workshops will also give participants the opportunity to connect and engage with other community members, creating stronger communities that will be more resilient in the face of external issues. The goal is for residents to utilize the skills gained from the workshops in order to persistently upcycle and repair their commonly discarded items after the program; thus continuing to reuse the City’s existing resources and enforcing resilience within their communities. Residents will also be able to use the skills acquired in these workshops, combined with follow-up digital tutorial videos and blogs created by Global Green, to engage in peer-to-peer education with their family, friends, and neighbors, engaging the broader community in the activation and enabling more Angelenos to contribute to and benefit from a more sustainable LA. To this end, the long-term outcomes of increased reuse and repair of commonly worn out, broken, and discarded items in the City of LA will include increased waste prevention and diversion, reduced environmental health hazards, reduced stress on landfills, reduced costs for residents, and more, enabling residents to benefit from a more sustainable environment and making LA the best place to live.",Live,2018046,https://activation.la2050.org/live/global-green/global-green.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtgKX6NE490

As the neighborhood experiences rapid redevelopment and urban planning, such as the Downtown LA 2040 Community Plan Update, it is urgent now more than ever to educate and engage local residents, small businesses and organizations on how to interact with and be part of positive changes.
 
 
 
 WAPOW is a grassroots community multimedia project in the historic cultural urban neighborhood of LA Chinatown that uses narrative arts to advance various objectives including: 
 
 
 
 - storytelling to promote community building
 
 - civic engagement by raising awareness of urban planning and public services 
 
 - providing diverse volunteer opportunities that draw on people’s varied skills in art, translation, writing, event planning, etc.
 
 - promote community building and immigrant integration;
 
 - youth development;
 
 - cultural sharing and stewardship; and
 
 - local small business promotion/economic development. 
 
 
 
 We achieve objectives by engaging partners in a series of interrelated activities: 
 
 
 
 WAPOW Magazine - A bilingual quarterly publication, produced by volunteer community contributors, focused on community news and cultural highlights, that also lead conversations on civic issues otherwise not covered in mainstream and ethnic media.
 
 
 
 Small Business Outreach and Business Directory: As part of the publication, small businesses may access free or low-cost graphic design or translation services to help broaden their community reach.They will also be able to place advertisements, with ad spaces prioritized for local small businesses. Currently, older legacy businesses struggle to reach newer generations, and newer businesses struggle to reach older generations, in part due to branding or linguistic barriers. Conversations with businesses may also include counseling on how to increase reach—whether by adding translation or trying online marketing. Concurrently, we will be developing a small business directory that will feature older and new businesses to capture the different types of businesses in Chinatown. 
 
 
 
 Community Engagement Events - in person events at local venues to engage the public in meaningful interactions and dialogues. Opportunities include movie screenings, housing rights workshops, community panels on local issues, and cultural activities. 
 
 The project’s new storytelling platform is a vehicle for community building around important issues of shared interest. It also provides new ways to access community resources, and opportunities for people to activate and connect—either actively as volunteers or event-goers, or passively as readers. The focus on storytelling helps build empathy and mutual understanding across different generations, experiences, histories and perspectives, toward building community cohesion and resilience.",Connect,2018047,https://activation.la2050.org/connect/good-shine-studio/good-shine-studio.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03UxLqNGuvE

The CIC will make Los Angeles the best place to CREATE by offering to the general public state-of-the-art prototyping tools, vocational education and job-training, a framework to receive funding to patent innovations, and exposure to hackathons that bring thousands of community members together. 
 
 
 
 Our first CIC will occupy up to 5,000 square feet for the purpose of managing a makerspace, mixed-reality lab, a classroom, private offices, and collaborative event space. The first CIC is set to open in Q2 of 2019. Membership will be sold to the general public at discounted rate of $200-$250 per month. The CIC will be able to house on average 100 people throughout the day as it operates from 8:30AM to 10:30 PM, with the first 6 hours dedicated to collaborative coworking and manufacturing activity, and then using the next 8 hours to optimize for educational workshops, job fairs, and hackathons to serve up to approximately 250 members of the public. 
 
 
 
 Members of the CIC will be able to learn design, software engineering, hardware development, data science, and rapid-prototyping from industry mentors from Hacker Fund’s existing network of 250+ technology volunteers, including professionals from SpaceX, IBM, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon. The availability of 3D printers, laser-cutters, and soldering tools will make manufacturing more accessible thanks to our corporate sponsors. The use of this new knowledge through tools and mentorship will allow members to develop civic innovations that increase the number of potential patents per capita in Los Angeles. Once members develop their prototypes, they will be able to access Hacker Fund’s fiscal sponsorship services in order to raise additional funding for additional manufacturing and hiring employees. The increase in social impact projects developed by Angelenos will also increase the availability of volunteer opportunities and jobs per capita.
 
 
 
 The CIC will be funded through a combination of grant funding (including LA2050 and $50,000 that we have already received from the Craig Newmark Philanthropic Fund), membership fees, corporate sponsorship, and in-kind donations.",Create,2018050,https://activation.la2050.org/create/hacker-fund/hacker-fund.jpg,https://vimeo.com/231126321

Our purpose is to teach the children of South LA, Compton and Inglewood the skills that will lead to their success as students, athletes and citizens. Skills like self-control, resilience, teamwork and a growth mindset have particular importance for kids that grow up in low-income urban communities. We believe that with intentional program design and talented coaches, the sport itself and its complementary academic support provide the perfect context to teach these skills. This model transcends a typical after-school sports program by providing wrap-around programming in a safe, structured, year-round environment that is centered on immersive academic and sport-based learning. We know that the sport is naturally engaging for all kids and we are hopeful that together, with LA2050, Harlem Lacrosse — Los Angeles can continue to deepen our impact and provide the kinds of experiences that are truly life-changing to even more young people in our community, intergenerational families, and the community at large.
 
 
 
 On HL-LA “playdays,” Enterprise Park transforms into a recreational oasis. As the buses deliver eager players ready to take part in the day’s events, parents, guardians, grandparents and siblings of all ages begin to gather in the prime shady locations on the sidelines. Volunteers from area high schools and colleges start organizing the players into age groups and teams; while the lacrosse training begins, coaches, tutors, police officers, teachers and mentors from corporate partners chat with parents about their child’s experiences, academic improvement, school choice or tutoring questions, goals, and much more. Harlem Lacrosse-LA is not just affecting its student-athletes’ lives, its impact is felt across generations and across the community. Many HL-LA parents and guardians did not attend college and rely on the advice and counseling of the HL-LA program directors, tutors and career advisors to help create an academic path to college preparedness for their children. Aside from the direct impact, HL-LA is growing alongside its members, expanding to high school programs as many students advanced to ninth grade. Many coaches and staff are themselves “graduates” of Harlem Lacrosse-LA (and its predecessor City Lacrosse), and these valuable work opportunities empower the older students to stay involved and give back. 
 
 Providing opportunities like these helps to keep HL-LA students and their families engaged in the program; these students are encouraged to improve attendance and grades, and stay in school, in order to remain as active members of the HL-LA community.",Learn,2018051,https://activation.la2050.org/learn/harlem-lacrosse-los-angeles/harlem-lacrosse-los-angeles.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WVD26iAwmw

8102053,2018,Homeboy and LA Voice: Organizing formerly incarcerated Angelenos to vote,"Activate 100,000 Angelenos in civic engagement, increasing voter participation and supporting community organizing among formerly incarcerated and formerly gang-involved men and women.",,,,,"[""Government responsiveness to residents’ needs"",""Voting rates""]","In the state of California, individuals with a criminal record have the right to vote if they are not currently in a state or federal prison or on parole for a felony conviction. Not every state has the same voting rights, leading to a lot of confusion or misinformation when it comes to voting rights. As a result, far too many eligible voters who are deeply impacted by the policies passed by our elected officials are not being represented in our elections. Homeboy Industries, with thousands of formerly gang-involved and previously incarcerated individuals coming through their doors annually, and LA Voice, with their experience turning out tens of thousands of underrepresented voters to the polls, are ideally situated to address this problem. 
 
 
 
 Voter turnout among the formerly incarcerated population is generally very low due in large part to a lack of information and misinformation about voting rights, socioeconomic factors, and community narratives of voting being worthless. Yet Homeboy Industries and LA Voice have seen through previous collaborations that when this segment of the community organizes, change happens. 
 
 
 
 Our idea for the LA2050 activation grant was sparked by this question: How much more could we achieve for Los Angeles if every formerly incarcerated Angeleno were civically engaged?
 
 
 
 With nearly 50 years of combined experience, Homeboy Industries and LA Voice’s models are complementary in serving the reentry population and organizing for civic engagement and voting. In 1986 when Homeboy’s founder Father Greg Boyle began serving in Boyle Heights, Los Angeles was regarded as the gang capital of the world. At the time, law enforcement tactics of suppression and criminal justice policies of mass incarceration were the prevailing means to deal with gang violence leading to hundreds of thousands of individuals serving time in California correctional institutions. Today, Homeboy is the largest gang intervention, rehab and reentry program in the world. The Homeboy model emphasizes true transformation combining therapeutic and support services with the goal that no one would recidivate and that everyone would have improved social connectedness. 
 
 
 
 For the last three elections, LA Voice has organized voter engagement efforts led and staffed by formerly incarcerated leaders who educated their own communities on ballot measures and encouraged their communities to vote. If our idea is funded, Homeboy and LA Voice together will turn these efforts into a year-round movement of formerly incarcerated leaders who educate their community in a non-partisan way to impact their communities, change the criminal justice system, and engage with other poverty-related policies by increasing their collective voice in the halls of power.",Connect,2018053,https://activation.la2050.org/connect/homeboy-industries/homeboy-industries.jpg,0
8102054,2018,Intersections: The power of our common stories.,"It all begins with sharing stories. Imagine LA and L.A. Works are joining to empower 150,000+ Angelenos to share their own life experiences to help alleviate homelessness in our city.",,,,,"[""Adults getting sufficient social & emotional support"",""Rates of volunteerism"",""Total number of local social media friends and connections Angelenos have""]","People are more likely to trust and fully engage with one another when they share common experiences and interests. Knowing this, Imagine LA created a unique onboarding process, which we use when matching volunteer mentors with families who’ve experienced homelessness. Our professional staff trains and guides the mentor/mentee pairs as they share life timelines, family genograms, personal values, and views on money management. These exercises evoke laughter, “a ha!” moments and sometimes tears. Shortly, they discover they have more in common than they would ever have thought. 
 
 
 
 Often used as a therapeutic intervention, the timeline project creates an intimate connection between participants as they explore their history, attitudes, circumstances, and decision-making. “It’s been said that a picture is worth a thousand words. If so, then capturing your life on paper with a timeline exercise may be worth millions.“ (Staik, 2013)
 
 
 
 Modeling this deep and barrier-busting experience, the ""Intersections"" campaign will significantly increase the number of mentors in the Imagine LA program. Potential volunteers need to see the foundation we create for success and be empowered with the realization that they too have what it takes to be a life-changing mentor for families emerging from homelessness — simply the ability to share. What begins with a connection ends with breaking the cycle of homelessness.
 
  
 
 Partnering with L.A. Works, the largest volunteer network in Los Angeles, Imagine LA will create a public awareness and outreach campaign, pairing social media marketing, community outreach, and events to educate and empower 150,000+ Angelenos. Ultimately, this will influence individual behavior, CONNECT 1,000 new mentors with vulnerable families in the Imagine LA program, and increase rates of volunteerism — not only as mentors, but with shorter-term volunteer roles. 
 
 
 
 A key component of our campaign is events-based. At L.A. Works’ large-scale days of service, which draw volunteers from around the county who are primed to make a deeper connection in service, we’ll lead trust-building activities like those we use during our mentor/mentee on-boarding process, educate participants, post on socials and ultimately sign up new volunteers to become mentors. 
 
 
 
 Mentorship promotes community and develops meaningful relationships full of mutual respect, love, and laughter. Showcasing this, and CONNECTing Angelenos to each other through their stories, will bring this campaign to life. Our shareable videos (live and animated), photos, and tactics like a mentor taking over our Instagram feed for a day will help increase the total number of local social media friends and connections Angelenos have. We anticipate the campaign to CONNECT Angelenos way beyond our goal of signing up mentors. It will empower them to volunteer in other ways and LEARN about those with disparate backgrounds and circumstances. It will break the cycle of homelessness for hundreds of families.",Connect,2018054,https://activation.la2050.org/connect/imagine-la/imagine-la.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBbjWQRI1Lc

We need to get to work, to school, to soccer games, to get food, everyday. In Los Angeles this is often easier said than done, particularly if your trips are invisible.



 Only 16 percent of daily trips are for work, yet nearly all of Los Angeles’ transportation efforts go into improving travel for commuters. So what is happening for the other 84 percent of trips?



 While we increasingly see women in the workforce, we still see traditional gender splits in different-sex parental households. Women tend to remain the primary caregivers, including making trips for school/child care, appointments, activities, and household errands.



 Our LA2050 activation will daylight these trips, faces, and voices.



 Transportation connects Angelenos with opportunity. But at its worst can prevent them from accessing resources and networks. Our activation will employ a multi-pronged strategy to ensure that women and mothers are not forgotten as we look to expand how our transportation network connects us.



 Data and groundtruthing: Analyze national and regional travel data to analyze patterns we see in women workers, caregivers, and mothers. Preliminary findings will be shared with community organizations and members to identify alignment with their lived experiences.



 Storytelling: Work with community organizations and local media to develop and distribute multilingual, multimedia stories of women’s daily needs and how transportation impacts them. This process will also teach women how to utilize film and photo to tell their own stories.



 Education and advocacy: Host online and in-person advocacy trainings to co-power community members to advocate for their own transportation needs. Groundtruthed data and stories from the first two strategies will be used to message the unaddressed needs of women with transportation policymakers at these trainings.



 We propose to utilize metrics recommended by LA2050 and our own suggested metrics we believe will measure successful impact of our activation:



 Government responsiveness to residents’ needs (LA2050): Data-driven advocacy and humanizing stories will be used to influence regional transportation policy and funding decisions.



 Transit-accessible housing and employment (LA2050): Transit improvements that serve both work and non-work trips will increase the connection between public transportation and daily origins and destinations.



 Advocacy capacity (suggested): Individuals exposed to technical assistance in advocacy tactics and storytelling development, through both online and offline platforms. Includes, but not limited to, neighborhood councils (LA2050).



 Transportation funding allocated based on non-work trip data (suggested): Formulas or metrics adopted in Metro countywide policy and funding frameworks that account for both work and non-work trips based on our data analysis and advocacy.",Connect,2018055,https://activation.la2050.org/connect/investing-in-place/investing-in-place.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_hZaJvzgqE

A huge barrier to creating this environment is the exorbitant rates of incarceration and state violence perpetrated against Black, Latino, immigrant and poor communities throughout LA County. For too long, LA County has viewed safety exclusively through a policing and incarceration lens and poured billions of limited public resources into failing solutions. Over the past 20 years, LA County has dramatically increased the budgets of its Sheriff’s Department and Probation Department. These decisions were made despite evidence that policing and incarceration does not significantly impact crime rates and a mandate from the majority of Californians to decrease reliance on incarceration to public health and safety issues.



 Ending mass incarceration is a growing movement. For this effort to continue to gain momentum and to garner additional support, we must work to change narratives, shift culture, and engage communities most affected — many of whom do not know or believe that they can be advocates for positive change or recognize their place and power within the democratic process. We must educate residents about initiatives that bring us closer to our goal and will have an immediate impact on their quality of life. Two such initiatives include: stopping LA County’s $3.5 billion project to build two new jails and reinvesting those funds into much needed community services and reforming the money bail system to increase the number of people able to return home after arrest, thereby reducing LA’s jail population.



 Justice LA will produce:



 Public art exhibits are unique opportunities to gather large and diverse groups of people, introduce residents to the arts and encourage people to visit other arts and cultural institutions. The art installations will be created by local artists and feature actual jail beds. These activations will help LA2050 reach its targets for 50 percent of households participating in the arts by engaging with at least one arts and cultural institution, and increased attendance at public/open streets gatherings.



 People with common interests and concerns need spaces like Town Halls to learn from, converse and stay in touch with one another. Our activations create the chance for residents to meet and exchange social media contact information. This environment will help facilitate LA2050’s work to increase the total number of local social media friends and connections Angelenos have and for 95% of adults receive social and emotional support.



 Potential voters are likely to register when they understand how democracy should work and envision themselves participating. The voter registration/education component of these activations align with LA2050’s work to increase participation in the political process, and will help it reach its target of 75% of Angelenos voting often in local elections, as well as impact government responsiveness to residents’ needs.",Connect,2018056,https://activation.la2050.org/connect/justice-la-dignity-and-power-now/justice-la-dignity-and-power-now.jpg,https://youtu.be/p_JwubxZcKA

It’s my hometown and I feel very lucky to be an Angeleno. Los Angeles is also where we conceptualized and created Kitchen Table App and so it’s our organization’s hometown too.
 
 
 
 But, Los Angeles is a difficult place to meet new people, make new friends, and build authentic community in your neighborhood. The social behaviors and social norms that Angelenos have come to adopt limit engagement with people that live in your building or on your block, restrict the ability to meet your neighbors when buildings don’t offer common or outdoor spaces, and reduce the instinct to say hello to people in your community that you’ve never met before because they are strangers and you don’t know if they are interested in meeting you.
 
 
 
 Kitchen Table App’s mission is to bring people together to share dining experiences, make meals accessible, easy, and memorable, and redefine what it means to eat local. We are all familiar the popular “eat local” movement, originally kicked off in the 1970s by environmentalists advocating that people buy food that was local to them. Farmers markets, grocery stores, restaurants, and individual brands soon followed and #eatlocal #buylocal #supportlocal trended on social. Kitchen Table App is redefining “eat local” to mean sharing dining experiences with friends, neighbors, and newcomers that you may have never met before. Our “eat local” is about connection: human connection with those around us, over the universal language that all speak, food.
 
 
 
 Kitchen Table App provides individuals with the ability to host a meal or gathering in their home or space and the opportunity to join a meal or gathering at a host's home or space with a table full of others including neighbors, friends, parents, colleagues, classmates, advocates, activists, networking circles, and people in the community that they may have never met before. Our mobile app allows individuals to connect with neighborhood hosts in an open marketplace to meet each other, make new friends, learn more about and volunteer for non profit organizations that matters to them, discuss how city and local policies affect their neighborhood, apartment building, grocery store, education, and employment opportunities, and influence behavior whether that’s getting more young people to register to vote, encouraging more people to conserve, recycle, and support local businesses. 
 
 
 
 Kitchen Table App is an expert in facilitating communal dining and gathering experiences and creating the opportunity to easily connect with others by participating in both hosting meals and get-togethers for others or joining meals and get-togethers with others. Kitchen Table App is rooted in connecting. It’s our core value.

You can twiddle your thumbs until the someone builds a park near you, or form an advocacy group with your neighbors, but it’s pretty hard to make anything happen.
 
 
 
 KDI wants to change this. We want to give you an easy way to bring outdoor play to your neighborhood, NOW!
 
 
 
 Let’s say your neighborhood has tons of space but nowhere to play. You want to play basketball in the street, but it’s always full of traffic. Or you’re next to a vacant lot that would be a great park, if only you could access it. Or the sunny sidewalk on the corner would be the perfect spot to enjoy street food, but there’s no seating.
 
 
 
 What if you could turn those spaces into areas for play?
 
 
 
 Our activation will make this quick, easy, and fun! We’ll take care of all the forms and phone calls needed to make it happen. All you have to do to get started is geotag the spot you think should be used for play on social media. Tag it with #PlayYourWayLA!
 
 
 
 Get 10 people to tag it, and we’ll come and make sure the space is public and safe to use. We’ll put up a sign letting people know play is on the way, if they keep tagging. You tell your friends and family to tag the spot. Hit 100 tags and we’ll set a date to bring our Park-in-a-Box to that very place. Simple!
 
 
 
 Then, we’ll hold a community workshop so you and your neighborhood can make the activation YOURS. Maybe you have lots of young kids in the neighborhood, or you want a space for your knitting group. Our Park-in-a-Box can transform into almost anything — a toddler’s play zone, a craft corner — whatever you want! Every activation will be unique to its neighborhood and the people in it.
 
 
 
 Once you’ve planned your activation, we’ll drive our Park-in-a-Box to your neighborhood and PLAY!
 
 
 
 There’s no limit to how you can play, or how much you get involved. Maybe you just want to show up and enjoy the activation. Maybe you want to lead the community workshop. Maybe you want a permanent park in your area. If so, we’ll set you up with the networks and know-how to make it happen.
 
 
 
 So how are we meeting those LA2050 play metrics?
 
 
 
 * There will be more spaces for play. You’ll enjoy the benefits of open space in your neighborhood, almost immediately, without having to wait for permanent parks to arrive.
 
 * You’ll have access to unique, vibrant and intergenerational play spaces to suit everyone — because YOU made it happen!
 
 * You’ll feel safer and more connected to your neighborhood.
 
 * You’ll create visual data and community interest to show the City where permanent parks are needed and desired.
 
 * You’ll pave the way for permanent improvements and be able to get involved in making them happen.

This activation will lay a strong foundation to build an economic bridge - from LA to LAX - from Seed to Sky. This isn't about making LA a better city to live in - LA already has powerful assets! Instead, it's about strategically leveraging assets to collaboratively build a more resilient, just and connected food community. We are developing an urban food system, in which we put communities at the center.
 
 
 
 This project builds on L.A. Kitchen’s existing social enterprise, Strong Food, which employs graduates from our culinary job training, and takes on contracts to manufacture food products for other businesses and L.A. Kitchen’s own brand. Strong Food will be partnering with a premier concessionaire at LAX to produce L.A. Kitchen sandwiches, salads and parfaits, creating a complete menu that offers traveling Angelenos and global visitors healthier food alternatives. This contract will bring L.A. Kitchen closer to realizing the power of a nonprofit that is self-sustainable - relying on consistent, earned income rather than the fluctuations of philanthropic funding. 
 
 
 
 What’s most exciting is that this contract with LAX is already helping L.A. Kitchen create more jobs and fight recidivism, food waste, and hunger through its community meal distribution program. When given the opportunity to share the wealth, L.A. Kitchen wants to squeeze every ounce of community impact we can. Funding from LA2050 will allow us to use our LAX contract to purchase produce from community-led gardens that are offering entrepreneurship training and job opportunities for residents in their neighborhoods, starting in South Los Angeles.
 
 
 
 Together with coalition partners, RootDown LA (RootDown) and Our Foods, we are building the first food production site, featuring hydroponic and aquaponic technology, that will serve as a training ground and provide jobs for youth. L.A. Kitchen will purchase the produce to enhance its existing supply channels, creating an economic bridge from LA gardens to LAX. This activation will include an invitation to other garden programs in South LA: We welcome partners who share our goals - not only to nourish LA gardens, but also engage LA’s youth, teaching them about supply and demand, profit and loss, reinvestment and philanthropy, empowering the next generation of change agents in our neighborhoods. 
 
 
 
 We will realize the power of everyday commerce as fuel for philanthropy and revolutionize the way communities support each other, creating a more economically viable future for Angelenos. At every touch point across this economic bridge, from planting seeds to distributing salads, every dollar made will be reinvested back into our communities.

 Utilize New Tools for Greater Civic Engagement -
 
 We will create a digital survey and a digital toolkit targeted at millennials specifically for use with this activation.
 
  
 
 Influence Individual Behavior - 
 
 We will entice millennials to become civically engaged by leveraging their passion for eating, art and digital sharing.
 
  
 
 Policy Advocacy/Digital Organizing for Activism - 
 
 A digital survey will specifically enable participants to weigh in on the issues of homelessness and housing in the city and how they would like to get involved in addressing the problem. A digital toolkit will support the organizing effort by supporting participants in leading their own engagements or “kitchen table” conversations.
 
  
 
 In-Person Engagements -
 
 Digital toolkit will serve as the basis for people to engage their friends in “kitchen table conversations” focused on homelessness and housing in local restaurants and other popular gathering places. In addition, food, art and music happenings called “Our Neighborhood Cooks” hosted in conjunction with Neighborhood Councils (NC) and popular local artists and performers serve as platforms to weigh in on the best ideas coming out of the digital survey. Our Neighborhood Cooks will include a cooking/eating competition for the recipe that best represents the neighborhood. People would vote on the recipe that includes migration stories and oral histories about the recipes. The selected recipes are incorporated into the final recipe book along with a road map on replicating the activation in other communities and cities.

We’re challenging the people of Los Angeles to experience the world as a holistic, interdependent living exchange of energy that exist through people and the soil we live on . Compost is the process of returning nature’s materials to the earth through decomposition, turning what was once discarded into a valuable resource.

 LA Compost hubs are spaces where kitchen scraps are turned into the ammendment needed for healthy soils. All hubs exist in partnerships with incredible organizations to support their thriving communities - from Monrovia to Elysian Valley, DTLA, to Venice. These compost hubs are established in shared spaces-places where we coexist. The hubs create a space for people to connect to the natural world existing within our urban landscape. Angelenos will have the opportunity to participate in various ways: learning food waste awareness and methods of composting, correctly sorting household food scraps, “deposit” food scraps at their community hub, join a workshop to learn about soil health, turn a compost pile at an urban farm, learn about vermicompost, interact intergenerationally, and create social connections to support healthy neighborhoods. We see these shared spaces as a bridge to connect individuals to their surrounding community. We live in a society full of disconnection, within communities there is isolation, between age groups it difficult for people to relate. This issue of disconnection has contributed to the increasing rates of mental suffering, lack of social support, lack of intergenerational activities, low rates of volunteerism, and less time spent interacting with the vibrant natural world and all of its wonders. Each of the LA Compost hubs is a space to reconnect, a platform to begin building these social bridges for us to nourish our environments. It is a space to share, volunteer, and engage in our civil society, broadening our horizons to meet outside of a coffee shop or board room, or our computer screens.

 There are significant environmental benefits to both reducing food waste and using finished compost- ultimately completing the story of food from farm to table to compost and back to the soil. The environmental benefits of compost include increased water retention, reduce erosion, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and increase nutritional value of food. These environmental benefits help stabilize and protect our changing climate, making LA more resilient. Our goal is to strengthen the social fabric of LA by amplifying shared spaces for connections, with each other, our food system and the vibrant ecosystems of LA- while diverting food waste from landfill, generating healthy compost to nourish LA’s landscapes, protecting LA from drought and erosion, and celebrating diversity within soil and people.",Connect,2018061,https://activation.la2050.org/connect/la-compost/la-compost.jpg,https://youtu.be/QeunrIbUzt0

Without a sense of a viable path toward solving our problems and creating solutions, it’s no wonder that voting rates are low and government isn’t as responsive to residents’ needs as it should be. LA is incredibly fragmented and at this key junction, is grappling with how to deal its increasingly post-suburban reality. We need an intentional effort to publicly and civilly debate these challenges and bridge these divides so Angelenos can enjoy affordable housing, transit connectivity, economic opportunity, and a healthy environment in a region that is increasingly resilient.
 
 
 
 LA Forward’s approach to increasing voting rates is not premised on the common concept of exhorting people to vote based on civic spirit or any kind of gimmicks. Our theory is that people will vote when they understand what’s at stake in the decisions made by LOCAL elected officials. When they comprehend the region’s big picture challenges and how those relate to their own interests and values, Angelenos will be far more motivated to participate. That’s the purpose of our popular and growing civic media, e.g. ballot guides, the LA Forwards & Backwards podcast, essays, collateral like civic trading cards, digital live steams of events—which aims to reach more than 100,00 Angelenos by 2020.
 
 
 
 Second, the path to deeper and enduring involvement requires a transition from the less active form of engagement with media and digital actions like petition-signing to participating in the interactive experiences of events, especially connecting with other people face-to-face. On its own, media can increase government responsiveness by letting officials know their actions are being tracked, but media’s greatest power can be as a funnel to draw people into hands-on work. That’s the purpose of our growing number of live actions—election parties, podcast events, classes, trainings, “take action” fairs, and neighborhood hangouts in places like parks, bars, cafes, & co-working spaces.
 
 
 
 Third, as community organizing experts like Marshall Ganz have shown, the only way to sustain mass involvement is by building organizations that enable individuals to take on increasing leadership responsibilities toward common purposes. We know that people are satisfied by participating in different ways and that the best way to be involved is with a group small enough that they can form meaningful relationships with each other. LA Forward is cultivating volunteer-led teams specific to various issues and methods of engagement. The main job of LA Forward’s staff and top leadership will be to act as organizers—coaching volunteers to step up into leadership roles, providing guidance, and facilitating connections and trainings as necessary.",Connect,2018062,https://activation.la2050.org/connect/la-forward/la-forward.jpg,https://youtu.be/iK1p6nJf5bg

 The Art Barge is a traveling, interactive, living archive. It is, in itself, an activation. Its unique design and dual function as an archive will attract people of all ages and backgrounds. The activities around the barge 'dockings' will invite people to connect to each other and to their community. 
 
 
 
 As a living artifact for the collection of diverse stories that weave together to form a multi-faceted public place identity, these stories of public art and culture will contribute to the meaning of the River’s communities, reconstituting “communities of memory” that bridge and preserve historical with contemporary public art and cultural projects. 
 
 
 
 The LA River Public Art Project can serve as a facilitator; the communities will lead, explore, and add their stories and recollections of art events along the River. Arts and cultural activities will be presented, discussed, reviewed, and selected in conjunction with individual site partners. 
 
 
 
 Each of the proposed 12 docking sites will consider how to best tailor events, programs, and coordinate with neighborhood community organizations, businesses and residents. 
 
 
 
 Our team's art historian and curator will bring additional perspective to the art installations, events, speaker/music series, and educational activities. While the barge will draw its county-wide audiences, local dockings will provide local residents unique access cultural events and volunteer opportunities.
 
 
 
 The Art Barge will be designed to increase awareness of the cultural history of the River, entice people to go a park they may have never visited before, have a picnic along the River, engage with neighbors and community members at events and activities, encourage local and neighborhood organizations to develop associate events to coincide with Art Barge dockings, and enhance awareness of the cultural history of the LA River.

Florida is notoriously gun-friendly place, yet the students were able to lead common-sense gun law reform when their voices were raised and heard. Larchmont Charter School believes student voices need to be raised and heard on social justice issues in Los Angeles. Our student population is 40% low income, and we serve students from all over the city. They KNOW what poverty is, and are confronted by its confines every day. Larchmont Charter School, a grades K- 12 school, has established itself as one of the top performing public schools in Los Angeles. Unique among public charter networks in our focus on racial, ethnic, and socio-economic diversity, Larchmont Charter School aims to provide a richly diverse community of students with a high quality public education. Social justice is woven into the mission of our school, and who better to rally youthful members of the community to fight injustice but our students? The Larchmont Social Justice Alliance will pivot from this deeply held value system into an activist platform. Joining student voices toward social justice, our Poetry Slam Competition (already a prominent feature in our curriculum and in student life in the upper grades) will support a new level of community activism. Our students can reach more students through guided use of social media, events, civic-minded field trips, and historical perspective on the importance of politics. We want to empower young members of the community with literary avenues for their voices, as well as rallies, service learning, and spoken word. This alliance seeks to use the power of student voices for social change. Homelessness, environmental degradation, and immigration are 3 issues that affect our population.

Created in 2013, KidBot offers children the opportunity to engage with computer science and engineering through hands-on learning experiences that introduce them to the basic components of robot technology and elements of robot design. 
 
 
 
 LA’s BEST KidBot is hosted on elementary school sites during the afterschool hours in the school’s computer lab. The KidBot program currently serves 320 students in 16 schools. Through the LA2050 activation, we can reach all 25,000 students in close to 200 elementary schools across LA!
 
 
 
 LA’s BEST provides high-quality training to program staff — young adults with deep connections to the communities we serve — to facilitate KidBot effectively, while also supporting the development of skills coveted by today’s workforce. “KidBot coaches” guide students through the process of utilizing LEGO Mindstorms kits to work in teams to design and program their own robot.
 
 
 
 Over the course of a 12-week period, KidBot participants explore the three areas of STEM learning--mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and computer science--increasing their knowledge of robotics engineering and robot functions. This process takes place as students practice collaboration skills when building and designing their team’s robots and problem-solving skills when programming robots. As students begin interacting with the robot parts, coaches encourage participants through the process of engaging with their work as “engineers” in a robotics laboratory or workshop. With support from i.am.angel foundation, each KidBot site participate in regional competitions with other robotics clubs from surrounding schools. These competitions offer children the opportunity to learn how friendly competition and mutual gain are not separate goals; helping each other is the foundation of teamwork.
 
 
 
 A key value of organization is student choice, so children select the activities or clubs in which they take part. With all activities offered at no cost to parents, children who would otherwise not have opportunities for quality out-of-school time learning experiences are afforded important, often life-changing computer science and engineering education through KidBot.
 
 
 
 In fostering critical thinking skills, KidBot empowers students to flourish creatively and view competition as another way to learn from and teach others. Further, the integration of social and emotional learning in programming encourages students to cultivate higher-thinking skills such as responsibility, empathy, teamwork, problem solving, emotion management and initiative. These components empower students as they develop strong, positive relationships with peers and adults through their journey to becoming young leaders in the STEM field.",Learn,2018065,https://activation.la2050.org/learn/las-best/las-best.jpg,0

 “Providing mobile showers to those in need has been inspiring. I’ve made long lasting connections with our shower guests and consider them my friends. I have a much better understanding of why people are homeless, and I have so much love and compassion for them. Seeing the impact on the people of the LA neighborhood where I volunteer is a blessing, and it’s given me much more of a sense of connection to my community.” 
 
 ~ Jennifer, Lava Mae volunteer
 
 
 
 While Lava Mae provides critical access to showers and toilets for people experiencing homelessness, our work is about much more. It’s about connection. We reconnect our guests with their sense of self-worth and dignity, and with staff and volunteers who treat them with the utmost care and attention. 
 
 
 
 Through our volunteer program, we engage individuals from all walks of life to deliver our service. In doing so, we give them the opportunity to connect with our guests and acknowledge and honor their shared humanity. Since launching our service in 2014, we’ve created transformative connections for thousands of guests and volunteers alike. 
 
 
 
 Lava Mae’s vision for LA2050 is to mobilize 100,000 Angelenos to dramatically expand mobile hygiene across Los Angeles to restore hygiene, dignity and hope to our unhoused neighbors. Here’s how we’ll do it:
 
 
 
 1. Replication. We’ll begin by helping individuals and organizations across LA replicate our service by providing the resources, guidance, and hands-on help they need to launch mobile showers in their communities. The best and strongest services come from the communities where the need exists.
 
 
 
 2. Education. Lava Mae will execute a robust campaign to educate neighborhood groups, schools and universities, businesses, nonprofits, social entrepreneurs, philanthropic organizations, faith-based groups, and other organizations/networks about access to hygiene and its link to dignity/opportunity, with the goal of mobilizing a volunteer force of 100k Angelenos.
 
 
 
 3. Transformation. We’ll also launch a visibility raising campaign to inspire citizens to consider what a shower really means, what it means when you cannot shower, and what they can do to help provide hygiene, dignity, hope and opportunity for their unhoused neighbors. 
 
 
 
 For example…
 
 
 
 The Power of a Shower. Did you shower today? If you’re living on the streets, you probably didn’t.

Over 57,000 people are without a home each night — 5,000 are children, and 4,000 are senior citizens. There is public consensus that something must be done, but a plurality of us has yet to agree on solutions, so little progress has been made. With the passage of Prop. HHH and Measure H to fund homeless housing and services, LA has an opportunity. How do we build the political will for tangible policies that lift the homeless, and Los Angeles, out of this crisis? Political will is entirely rooted in unity, consensus, and collaboration — in a word, connection. 
 
 
 
 LawMaker proposes building this connection with a 1-year public activation that brings LA residents, homelessness leaders, and elected officials together to answer one question: “What programs to help the homeless can you support in your neighborhood?” The public dialogue will focus on increasing awareness of key levers impacting homelessness and building support for tangible policies to help individuals and families off the streets. 
 
 
 
 LawMaker is an online platform, but not everyone has equal access to technology. To ensure broad participation, LawMaker will work with the City’s neighborhood councils to hold public events in each of LA’s city council districts. These meetings will be advertised well in advance, shared through LawMaker's partners and the NCs, and will be streamed/transcribed online at LawMaker.io. In collaboration with the City, LawMaker will publicize these neighborhood council events as a way to truly connect and constructively discuss issues around homelessness. 
 
 
 
 To guide this public conversation toward a productive and tangible resolution, LawMaker will convene a Leadership Board of six elected officials, six leaders from the homeless service sector, and six civic leaders. This board will guide the various phases of the conversation and provide feedback to stakeholders at regular intervals. For example, problems identified in Phase 1’s open call for problem statements, will then be segmented by the Board into distinct verticals to be addressed in Phase 2, for example: affordable housing, homelessness prevention, mental health services, drug rehabilitation services, veterans programs, and safe parking zones. The elected officials and other board members will also be responsible for consolidating community feedback into draft proposals to help the homeless with programs distributed across the city. See the budget for an outline of the phased process.
 
 
 
 The policies developed will be presented to LA residents for review and comment via public government meetings, neighborhood council meetings, and via the online voting/discussion platform at LawMaker.io. The public nature of these discussions, and the commitment made by the participating elected officials, are designed to build public support and pressure for concrete legislative action based on stakeholder input in the following legislative cycle.",Connect,2018067,https://activation.la2050.org/connect/lawmaker-io/lawmaker-io.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH8x6av0XTA

 Los Angeles County ranks seventh in income inequality out of the nation’s 150 largest metro regions. While Los Angeles County has the highest number of millionaire residents in the country, 21.5% of our city’s residents are living in poverty. LIFT-LA actively builds bridges and provides opportunities for people within these communities — the top 5% and the bottom 21.5% - to connect. This is an intentional and radical approach as part of our four-year strategic plan to build bridged social capital between communities, and to allow our members and supporters to be in relationships with one another. We know from experience that the power of social networks can make or break our ability to achieve goals. LIFT-LA not only shines the light on the achievements of our members, we shine the light on the value of networks, compassion and the ability that the philanthropic community has to directly affect the well-being of others. 
 
 
 
 Through this activation, LIFT-LA will break down the barriers that divide us, and show Angelenos the real faces of people living in poverty: the faces of fierce and determined parents who are working hard to create opportunities for themselves and their children. LIFT-LA offers so many ways for people from different communities to connect. Through our Member2Member (M2M) network we facilitate direct transfers of cash and resources between supporters and members in times of crisis. Through our Holiday Fiesta, LIFT-LA connects supporter and member families during the holidays to be in relationships with one another that span the course of the year. This facilitation of bridged social capital not only has direct impacts for the member and supporter families involved, it helps to change the narrative of division and separation between communities.
 
 This innovative model of social capital is like no other work taking place in Los Angeles, and it is making our city a better place to live for everyone. We are directly impacting families by reducing adverse childhood experiences and lifting up families to reach a place of self-sufficiency.

 LOLA is a website where young, busy Los Angelenos can quickly and easily learn how their city works.

 Executive functioning, commonly thought of as organizational skills, are something that typically developing students acquire over time, but students with various types of learning differences find especially difficult to overcome when reaching for academic success. Approximately 13% of the 55 million preK-12 students in the United States are diagnosed as needing special education services; 64% of these students are categorically labeled as having a Learning Disability or Specific Learning Disability (NCES, 2015). Learning Disabilities and/or Specific Learning Disability can include Dyslexia, Dyscalculia, Auditory and Visual Processing Disorders, and Dysgraphia. Additionally, students with Traumatic Brain Injuries, Other Health Impairments, Attention Deficit Disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, and Autism Spectrum Disorder also struggle with executive functioning.

Based on a survey of over 800 workers led by the Fair Workweek team and volunteers, and a UCLA study based on that survey and other research, 80% of retail workers lack a set schedule each week, 72% work different days every week, 77% receive one week or less notice of their schedules, and 62% of workers are expected to have “open availability.”
 
 This practice creates insurmountable obstacles to planning for childcare, attending classes, obtaining a second job, or being active in their communities. To overcome this problem, workers need to connect with each other and advocate for themselves.
 
 Retail workers are discouraged from civic engagement due to the difficulty of connecting with each other in a city the size of LA. Through use of social media including Facebook and Twitter, we will enable workers to connect on line from Sylmar to Wilmington.
 
 We are enhancing on line connectivity by designing a customized app accessible to all retail workers in the city through which they can learn about their rights, enforcement of wage and hour rules, and the problems they share with other workers.
 
 The Retail Workers App, in addition to enabling connection among workers, will ask workers to enter their work schedules so that the Fair Workweek team can collect data and determine if those schedules violate any rules. They will be able to share their problems and, by connecting with each other, become activated to work on solutions by joining the campaign to win a policy that will regulate scheduling practices. Retail workers can also engage with each other to share strategies to manage their lives and join together to advocate for a better city and job quality. 
 
 Through advocacy for a policy, workers will become civically engaged and can learn how to push the city government to be responsive to their needs. This will provide an opening to promote voter registration and turnout.
 
 Based on face to face meetings with workers and connecting on line, we can identify potential leaders who will be trained in leadership skills and can volunteer to take leadership roles in the campaign.
 
 Once the policy is adopted, workers will be better able to connect with each other through scheduled meetings and events and to participate more actively in civic life. Their lives will be fuller as they are able to spend more time with their children, attend school, and other activities that require having a predictable schedule.
 
 We will also test which platforms and apps are most effective in connecting and activating workers.",Connect,2018072,https://activation.la2050.org/connect/los-angeles-alliance-for-a-new-economy-fair-workweek/los-angeles-alliance-for-a-new-economy-fair-workweek.jpg,https://youtu.be/7GHqVKrYCjM
8102073,2018,Voting Solutions for All People: Engaging Voters Through a Mock Election,"As LA County prepares to revolutionize the voting experience, voters will participate in a countywide mock election to interact with new voting technologies and get excited about future elections.",,,,,"[""Government responsiveness to residents’ needs"",""Voting rates""]","The County’s current voting system has served the voters of Los Angeles County with accuracy and integrity since 1968, the design of the systems and the age of their technology do not offer the technical and functional elasticity necessary to continue to accommodate our growing and increasingly diverse electorate. Additionally, the existing voting systems market is limited and inadequate to meet the needs of our region. We are overdue for solutions that are transparent, publicly owned and that ensure the security and integrity of our elections. In 2020, the Los Angeles County will introduce a new voting experience that will address many of these concerns. To prepare Angelenos for this change, we will conduct a mock election in September 2019 at 50-100 locations throughout the County. 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 By providing Angelenos the opportunity to become civically engaged through this mock election, the Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk (RR/CC) will get voters excited to try a new and improved voting model that addresses their needs. We also hope that this activation will increase the rates of voting in Los Angeles County. This new voting model, and the mock election, will support LA2050’s goal to make “Los Angeles the most civically engaged region in the U.S. During the Presidential Primary Election in 2016, only roughly 42% of registered voters cast a ballot. For the Presidential General Election on November 2016, 69% of Los Angeles County voters turned out to vote. LA County sees much lower turnout rates for off-cycle election. As is the case of the CA 34th District Representative election; turnout for the Primary Election in April, 2017 as well as the General Election in June, 2017 was just 14% of registered voters. With the mock election, we hope to activate Angelenos to vote in all elections, not just Presidential Elections. We also want to increase the number of registered voters, and make voting easier and more accessible to those voters. This mock election will provide eligible voters who are not yet registered the opportunity to register on-site the day of the mock election. 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 The mock election will serve as a way for the RR/CC to gather feedback from voters about their thoughts on the new modernized voting system. This will ensure that the RR/CC, a government entity, is responsive to the needs of LA residents when it comes to exercising their right to vote. An increased responsiveness to the voting needs of Angelenos will in turn make Los Angeles a hub for innovation, policy changes, and government transparency. 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 Like the efforts of LA2050 to “#PartyatthePolls,” the mock election is a county wide event that is all about voter engagement, activation, and education.

 We refurbish fields across LA County to support community play in underserved communities through Dreamfields. At these fields, we set the stage to play baseball/softball by adding stadium aesthetics to existing fields, planting new sod, and upgrading backstops, dugouts and benches to make parks a safer place to play baseball/softball in the community. Our data shows that these revitalized fields have the power to create vibrant play spaces, as well as cultivate safe and centralized environments for communities to play.
 
 
 
 Through Dodgers RBI, fitness clinics, skills clinics, workshops and community events, we promote programs that are necessary to sustain park activity and ensure these spaces remain vibrant parks for the community. With RBI, we provide underserved communities with equipment and program resources that are necessary for youth ages (5-18) to play baseball/softball in LA. Here, youth are able to participate in a positive recreational activity after-school, alongside their peers. To engage adults in RBI, we provide training to coaches, parents and park administrators to empower them to be better role models and leaders for their community. We encourage them to share their experience with us, and each other, to inform program design and improvements. We also provide them access to LeagueApps, an online sports registration and communication platform, to stay informed of program activities at Dreamfields, within RBI, and in the community. LeagueApps allows park staff to share announcements of upcoming events at their local park so as to drive digital organizing efforts in the places where they live. Collectively, these efforts engage the community to be active in play and to participate in inter-generational programming at Dreamfields and RBI.
 
 
 
 We also provide a breadth of volunteer opportunities for corporate and community volunteers at Dreamfields sites and RBI activities. Volunteers participate in registration and coordination of special events, such as community service days to further promote their involvement in the community and invest in play-related programs. Additionally, we collaborate with numerous fitness, sports, and play-oriented organizations to promote play in the community through fitness clinics, skills clinics and coach development workshops. These collaborations further engage youth in after-school programs, build cohesive community identity, reinforce play in our programming, and contribute to the vibrancy of the park that supports a play-active LA.
 
 
 
 Lastly, we engage over 3 million Dodger fans each season to support play and donate to our cause. At Dodger games, we interact with fans to enhance awareness of our mission and to get them activated for play in LA through individual giving opportunities.",Play,2018074,https://activation.la2050.org/play/los-angeles-dodgers-foundation/los-angeles-dodgers-foundation.jpg,https://www.mlb.com/dodgers/video/ladf-overview/c-1866876583?tid=80228278

In Los Angeles, we are uniquely positioned to improve the lives of millions of our neighbors while leading our state, changing a nation, and inspiring the world. But, there are no days off in a democracy. The Los Angeles LGBT Center’s Resistance Squad will connect people from across Los Angeles’ diverse communities, giving them a place to channel frustration into action. From fighting back direct policy and legislative attacks on our collective well-being to doing the long-term work needed to move us towards a more perfect union, this expansion of the Center’s mobilization and resistance squad will connect people in the fight to protect, ensure, and advance equality.
 
 
 
 Soon after the 2016 presidential election, we learned several things very quickly. Attacks on our community would be rooted in fear and bigotry at a level not seen in decades (and that our youngest LGBT generation has not experienced in their lifetimes). Attacks leveled against other vulnerable populations, including immigrants and people needing to access affordable health care, would also touch LGBT people who were part of those communities. There was an immediate need to band together in solidarity. People wanted, and needed, to DO something.
 
 
 
 The Resistance Squad was formed to mobilize Angelenos in response to attacks by the new Administration. Now with LA2050, we will recruit and train 200 more volunteers in grassroots organizing to carry out effective phone banking, letter writing, social media and web-based mobilization campaigns, as well as demonstrations. Activations are designed to yield immediate results — ranging from a constituent in another state agreeing to call their congressional representative to affecting the outcome of a bill or policy. 
 
 
 
 As an organization and community rooted in activism and a decades-long battle for equality, fighting for justice and winning is what our community knows how to do. In fact, it’s one of the things we do best. Our goal is to build on this experience and empower Angelenos to lead social and political activations in their communities, and by so doing, amplify our collective voice so that politicians take notice. 
 
 
 
 Those who have joined the Resistance Squad come away feeling empowered:
 
 
 
  “You hear all these terrible things on the news about our government and what they are allowing to happen and you can feel so powerless. It’s been really great coming here doing the phone banking and writing the letters and knowing that you’re actually making a positive impact on people’s lives and putting your money where your mouth is. Rolling up your sleeves and not just yelling at your Facebook friends.” - Laura Wu
 
 
 
  “There was just this need I felt to do something other than crying into the wind. It’s been a very easy way to get involved and to feel like you’re doing something that benefits other people. You don’t feel like everyone’s got good intentions but nothing is really getting done.”

It is the Master Chorale’s goal to inspire people to tap into a gift each person is born with, namely, the ability to sing in a safe, fun, non-competitive environment. Through Big Sing LA, we are reclaiming our public parks as a place where artistry and creativity can flourish and play music alongside the soccer fields, picnic tables, and baseball diamonds. 
 
 
 
 Participants will have the opportunity to learn and rehearse the pre-selected choral repertoire in advance of the event through online educational tutorials featuring our Artistic Director Grant Gershon and the Master Chorale’s Swan Artist-in-Residence and Grammy Winner Eric Whitacre. A Grammy-winning composer and conductor, Whitacre is very well-known among choral music enthusiasts. However, we are considering engaging conductors that reflective of the diverse communities we want to serve at the various parks.
 
 A dedicated website will be created for Big Sing LA and provide a central location where participants can access the video tutorials, connect with each other, and share their experiences. It will contain all the information participants will need to know to get involved, such as which parks will serve as hubs for the Big Sing LA events and how to create gatherings of their own should they wish to. After the event, the website will serve as a conduit for participant surveys, and tracking and evaluating data to determine impacts. However, no prior knowledge or registration are required, and people can simply just show up and sing along with the crowds.
 
 
 
 Taking part in Big Sing LA is truly a multi-generational endeavor that will significantly reduce barriers to involvement in singing by inviting people from all walks of life to join in at a location that is more convenient than traveling to Grand Park in Downtown LA. Anyone who loves to sing or enjoys live music will connect on a deeper level by experiencing a powerful and transcendent moment that only through singing together as an ensemble provides. We will work with local neighborhood councils and local organizations to determine the park that is geographically the most accessible and therefore, we will create more access points for increasing inter-generational play opportunities and making parks more vibrant.

LASA invites them to consider how they are problem-solvers and visionaries of both the LA of today and of tomorrow.,,,,,"[""College matriculation rates"",""District-wide graduation rates""]","LASA will make greater Los Angeles the best place to learn by providing an intensive introduction to the infrastructure and institutions of greater Los Angeles for high school juniors who have expressed an interest in public, civic, and civil service. As a supplement to their regular school year, LASA students learn from the very heart of the region's history and culture, and, in so doing, learn how best they can contribute to the region and our collective problem-solving obligations. LASA engages curiosity and the desire to create change in a diverse landscape of spaces from the Metropolitan Water District, the Port of Los Angeles, the business community, to the local arms of the judicial system.

Participants gain the experience and knowledge necessary to better understand the intricacies — infrastructural, historical, political, economic, and otherwise — of the region in which they live, and build lasting bonds of friendship, camaraderie, and work experience with a diverse group of peers.

LASA speakers - in the dozens - including Jeff Kightlinger of the Metropolitan Water District, Raphael Sonenshein of the Pat Brown Institute at California State University-Los Angeles, and Belinda Waltman of Whole Person Care Los Angeles - help the students create a foundation of knowledge to inform their visions for the future.

LASA contributes to LA as a space to learn by encouraging the students to learn by sharing their diverse experiences with each other and with the speakers. They listen to each other and define the issues in LA they want to address moving forward.

New this year, LASA partnered with Pasadena's Partnership for Success and Polytechnic School to launch the Mt. Wilson Project that engages student interest in STEAM and culminates in a nighttime trip to view the universe through the 60"" telescope. Further, LASA launched a summer research essay competition to sponsor and mentor two students pursuing research on Los Angeles after their LASA year.

However, top-down resilience-building initiatives marginalize the voices of the most vulnerable among us, and inclusive resilience-building initiatives bank on the participation of people who are already overwhelmed and under-resourced. The organizations that provide the services, education, and support to these vulnerable populations are the backbone of LA’s human safety care net. These are the groups that do gang prevention/intervention, wraparound services to youth in foster care and probation systems, legal and educational services for undocumented immigrants, primary health and dental care to low-income people, and supportive housing for those without homes. Their front-line staff, organizers, and volunteers often share some of the same vulnerabilities of the people they serve, and the work itself is challenging and draining. Although it is well known that vicarious trauma and significant burnout are commonplace, funding challenges prevent organizations from providing the support their people need to make programs and initiatives effective and sustainable. If the people supporting the community are stumbling under the weight of their work, the community itself suffers and does not have the bandwidth to engage with large-scale change efforts. To activate community level resilience, we need to take a foundational step; we need to grow the resilience of the people on the front lines of the safety net. By resourcing and connecting the professionals, peer specialists, and community members, the people who are needed to make systems change will have the needed social-emotional support and actually be change-ready. 
 
 Our project begins by bringing committed partner organizations together into two regional community focus groups (South Bay/South LA and Antelope Valley), where we will learn more about their specific challenges and strengths. Based on this information, we will develop and deliver 30 compassion fatigue and resilience-building workshops using a curriculum based on The Resilience Toolkit, a holistic evidence-informed practice and process with a demonstrated track record in the LA area. Trauma-informed and culturally competent perspectives will be woven into the entire program. We will certify 24 key community partner representatives and provide technical assistance to organizations to develop ongoing programming for staff and volunteers. As the organizations’ worker capacity and internal resources increase, we will mentor them in establishing similar programming for their clients, students, or members. We will conduct a comprehensive program evaluation. The program will culminate in a series of regional convenings of partner organizations, other community stakeholders, and funders to discuss how the outcomes of the program can leverage their increased personal/organizational resilience to the community level.",Live,2018078,https://activation.la2050.org/live/lumos-transforms/lumos-transforms.jpg,0

More important than jobs, manufacturing is a critical piece of innovation infrastructure that, if activated, could better unleash Los Angeles’ creative potential. 
 
 
 
 Maker walk engages thought leaders and the creative public for a unique look behind manufacturing in the city. Our pilot run attracted more than 500 participants. They checked in for this free event at the Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator and received a map for a self-guided walking tour of the Arts District neighborhood. Participants enjoyed visits to a dozen different factories and businesses, including Hyperloop, Angel City Brewery, La La Land Production and Design, HIVE lighting, the LADWP substation, the Advanced Prototyping Center, Blue Bottle, Greenbar Distillery, and Oblong Industries. It ended with an after party, featuring mini maker workshops and locally crafted cocktails at locally made shoe brand, COMUNITY. You can watch a video here: http://makeitinla.org/makerwalkvideo 
 
 
 
 Our attendees were impressed and surprised by the diversity of industries that are manufacturing in LA and they asked us for more. To build on Maker Walk’s success and expand its impact, we want to engage new neighborhoods and manufacturers and become a monthly event. We have yet to finalize the neighborhoods, but we have begun to scout venues in El Segundo, Pasadena, Vernon, in DTLA, and Long Beach.
 
 
 
 We have partnered with Artisanal LA and the LA Food Fest to bring a pop-up market aspect to enhance the event. The markets will raise awareness of consumers and inspire them to purchase locally made goods. 
 
 
 
 Because the tours are so visual, we expect many attendees to share on social media and we will add playful encouragements for sharing like photo stations. We will highlight many of the makers and manufacturers on social media and on our website to drive traffic and awareness. We will also implement an extensive PR campaign to attract media coverage.
 
 
 
 We anticipate repeating our Arts District Maker Walk in October 2018, and ramping up to a total of 18 events in the grant period.

Much of this waste could be recycled or composted if residents had sufficient access to disposal systems. Many Angelenos however lack access to recycling services in their apartments or workplaces. Low-income neighborhoods and communities of color are disproportionately affected by the unequal distribution of municipal services. Hindered access to responsible disposal systems can increase exposure to environmental hazards and health problems that emanate from poor air and water quality. Lack of access to environmental education is another contributing factor. Only 10% of the students enrolled in our youth program for example, recalled receiving environmental education in their schools. The environmental impacts for marginalized communities and gaps in environmental education are causes for significant concern. These concerns are addressed by Mar Vista Family Center’s (MVFC) Youth New A.G.E. Initiative. The Initiative aims to create a more sustainable and conscious relationship between Angelenos and the environment while introducing creative strategies for community fundraising. 
 
 
 
 MVFC youth want Los Angeles to be an environmental justice leader--that is, a zero waste city that protects its low-income residents from environmental health hazards through community-driven initiatives. The Youth New A.G.E Initiative coaches low-income youth on how to Abate waste, Generate revenue, and Educate communities about waste management in order to engender environmental sustainability, creative fundraising, and social responsibility. The Youth’s Recycling Campaign and “Green-Giving” strategy has encouraged local residents to donate their recycling to MVFC leading to the collection of thousands of plastic bottles and aluminum cans that our youth will cash in. The campaign has raised significant awareness about plastic pollution in the community. 
 
 
 
 Our activation will support LA2050’s efforts to decrease the acres and miles of polluted waterways. Plastic trash from consumer goods makes up the majority of what becomes marine debris which significantly affects the environment, wildlife, and human health. The Initiative’s focus on waste reduction, environmental education, and community fundraising encourages Angelenos to mobilize in favor of cleaner waterways. By educating Angelenos on the benefits of waste reduction and by linking this advocacy to Green Giving, or community fundraising campaigns, we believe that we can clean up the city, protect our waterways, and provide children the environmental quality and sustainability they need to lead healthy and environmentally conscious lives thus decreasing adverse childhood experiences. Our activation also creates and supports resilient communities.

MOVE’s mission is to strengthen L.A.’s culture of service by making volunteer opportunities accessible and meaningful, by building collaborations that inspire citizen engagement, and by creating long-lasting change around issues that Angelenos care about.
 
  
 
 Benefits of volunteering can include higher overall civic engagement, improved health, skills development, and lower criminal activity. Volunteering makes our communities stronger and more resilient. Corporate-based volunteerism builds employee culture and is a key component to corporate social responsibility efforts. 
 
 
 
 In May, MOVE will launch the VolunteerLA platform, an online resource that includes a curated list of volunteer opportunities in order to easily connect Angelenos to opportunities that are available in local communities across the region and that build on a diverse collection of skills. The volunteer opportunities featured on the site will represent the best of Los Angeles with MOVE’s vetted nonprofit partners posting opportunities as they become available. The platform will be powered by Golden, the leading volunteer mobile app. The Golden app features technical capabilities that will allow MOVE to capture valuable data to best inform how to grow volunteerism in the city and the region. Golden aims to solve one key challenge of volunteering — recruiting and converting volunteers — by making signing up easy and fun with clear, engaging descriptions and real-time logistics (like automated sign-in). In addition, Golden includes a backend dashboard that tracks key metrics and analytics, including economic value of volunteer time logged, percentage of new versus returning volunteers, interests and search terms, and a zip code heat map. 
 
 
 
 The platform will also serve as a place to tell the story of the great work being done by volunteers from nonprofits, corporations and institutions across the city and region, and will provide space to acknowledge and thank partners. 
 
 
 
 MOVE has also convened a Nonprofit Council and Corporate Council of leading nonprofit organizations and companies from across the city to come together to support VolunteerLA.

Designed to bring people together in neighborhoods across the city, the program will provide simple, meaningful, and impactful ways to support our newest neighbors while promoting volunteerism and Neighborhood Council participation. 
 
 
 
 The program will have four stages:
 
 
 
 1. LEARN: In June 2018 (prior to the grant period), we will kick off with a New Arrival Festival at Grand Park in Downtown LA cosponsored by Miry’s List, DONE, and other city departments and elected officials. This free, public event celebrating the city’s designation of June as New Arrival Month will feature educational panels, music, and food from around the world. Speakers will include representatives from the refugee community, experts, advocates, and city elected officials. 
 
 
 
 2. RESOLVE: Neighborhood Councils across the city will vote on and adopt the Neighborhood Welcoming Resolution written by Miry’s List founder Miry Whitehill and adopted by the Eagle Rock Neighborhood Council and the City of Los Angeles in 2017. You can read the resolution at www.miryslist.org/neighborhood-welcoming-resolution 
 
 
 
 3. COMMIT: Each participating Council will form a Welcoming Committee to foster refugee and immigrant inclusivity. The Welcoming Committee will oversee and lead the Welcoming Actions detailed below. 
 
 
 
 4. ACTIVATE: Led by the Welcoming Committee, each participating Council will take Welcoming Actions -- tangible steps, curated by Miry’s List, to support resettling individuals and families. Each council can choose actions that align with its goals and capabilities. In addition to supporting resettling refugees, these Welcome Actions will help increase participation in the Neighborhood Councils. The menu of possible Welcoming Actions includes:
 
 
 
 --Make Council board meetings a drop-off zone for donations 
 
 --Invite someone experiencing resettlement to a meeting to share their experiences
 
 --Host a town hall on refugee resettlement to educate neighbors 
 
 --Host a community dinner party to introduce community members to the incredible foods and cultures of our newest neighbors
 
 --Adopt a resettling family’s wishlist of needed items and activate neighbors to send them welcome gifts and notes 
 
 --Assign a Welcoming Committee chairperson to provide regular, monthly board meeting updates about immigrants and resettling neighbors in the community
 
 
 
 Through these stages and actions, “Welcome, Neighbor” will provide resettling individuals and families with social and emotional support, promote participation in Neighborhood Councils, and boost volunteerism. Ultimately, we believe that an LA where neighbors come together to welcome refugees will be a better, more compassionate, and more engaged city for all its residents.",Connect,2018083,https://activation.la2050.org/connect/mirys-list/mirys-list.jpg,https://youtu.be/6re3u9HlO-A

Move LA was created to build a broad coalition to support a grand bargain on transformative change: Measures R and M will now fund the largest public infrastructure investment in the country. 
 
 
 
 We now face an even greater threat from exposure to air toxins, diesel pollution and climate change. Transportation accounts for 90% of our NOx emissions, 80% from heavy-duty vehicles, most powered by diesel engines, resulting in the dirtiest air in the country. The heaviest exposure to diesel exhaust is experienced by low-income communities of color who live along the goods movement corridors of Southern California. It is a public health and an environmental justice imperative that we seek to replace diesel with clean technologies.
 
 
 
 In addition, transportation sources in Southern California account for 50% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions known to cause climate change. Rising seas and worsening droughts threaten our community and our world, today and for future generations. 
 
 
 
 But we now have a chance to save the world from climate change and clean our air because of decades of California leadership, leadership which has resulted in a growing array of zero-emission and advanced hybrid light-duty vehicles and the imminent deployment of zero and near-zero emission trucks. We are now poised to play a powerful role in the worldwide efforts to abate climate change while helping free our region from exposure to air toxins; all we must do is find the strategies to accelerate the deployment of these clean vehicles significantly.
 
 
 
 Move LA has a plan: “Vision 2020: A Plan to Clean Southern California's Air and Abate Climate Change,” and we have launched a regional dialogue to build a coalition capable of addressing these two most significant challenges.
 
 
 
 Move LA will activate 100,000 Angelenos and Southern Californians to finish our clean air and climate change mission, utilizing our innovative and successful civic engagement model to build the coalition and develop the strategy to do it. 
 
 
 
 Help us fund a two-year public outreach and coalition building effort that will: 
 
 
 
 - Identify and champion a grand bargain to win the funding needed to implement the South Coast Air Quality Management District’s mobile sources plan, which would dramatically accelerate the deployment of zero and near-zero emission light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicles to abate climate change and end air pollution in fifteen years.
 
 
 
 - Implement an all-electric regional Metrolink commuter rail system and create a much more efficient goods movement system.
 
 
 
 This effort will, we hope, culminate in legislative or ballot initiative action in 2020 (hence ""Vision 2020""); when joined with the efforts of the State of California, it could create the economies of scale needed for clean transportation to be cost and performance competitive with gasoline and diesel vehicles in markets around the world.",Live,2018084,https://activation.la2050.org/live/move-la-a-project-of-community-partners/move-la-a-project-of-community-partners.jpg,https://youtu.be/4JnqpY0nP4s

Rise up! will seek to establish a model for resilient community development at the neighborhood scale by improving community connections and awareness. We will document the tools and methodology that will be developed to increase civic engagement and provide resources and services to equip community members to remain in place and help shape the future of planning in their community. Through a strategic media advocacy campaign we will share this model throughout Los Angeles and beyond. 
 
 
 
 In addition to eliminating the loss of life due to car collisions, we believe that equitable and just improvements to the community must also ensure that there is no loss of lives due to state violence, or loss of residents in the neighborhood due to displacement. An intersectional approach to improving the quality of life of residents will provide:
 
 
 
 - A platform for local artists and community members, to help shape the local landscape to reflect their identity;
 
 - Opportunities for creating open space through open streets and cultural events in park deficient communities so that residents can connect with one another in an intentionally intergenerational and cross cultural spaces;
 
 - Pop-up examples of built environment improvements to get feedback and support from the community to improve biking, walking, and accessing public transportation in the area;
 
 - The ability for residents to build resilience by shaping their own narratives to better be able to influence decision makers through storytelling documented in portraits and curated audio; 
 
 - Protection against displacement, gentrification, and state violence by connecting residents with local resources and providing popular education to help inform them of their tenant and legal rights.
 
 
 
 There will be in-person engagement at various scales with large “Street Beats” events and “Rise and Shine” mini-events. Street Beats is a community-led, collaborative effort to bring safety improvements and engaging activities at the intersections of Slauson/Broadway and Slauson/Western. “Street Beats” events will feature creative designs on the streetscape that educate the public on the importance of street safety and our need to claim public spaces. “Rise and Shine” events will use popular education to teach the community about the inequities they are facing and increase knowledge and awareness of tenant and legal rights for community members of color. Additionally, we will use storytelling as a tool for building resilience; we believe that the documentation of community images and stories is one way to honor current and past residents and combat displacement by ensuring that histories are not erased. All of these activities and events will be able to connect cross-cultural and intergenerational volunteers (particularly youth and elder volunteers) from the neighborhood.

If only LA knew…",,,,,"[""Housing affordability"",""Rates of homelessness"",""Resilient communities""]","LA will be the best place to LIVE when it has enough affordable housing to be considered a truly inclusive place. We plan to activate Angelenos to build more housing units in Los Angeles: one unit - per backyard - at a time, to accomplish this goal.
 
 
 
 Our activation will create an easily accessible database that identifies which properties in Los Angeles County can have secondary units (also called Accessory Dwelling Units or ADUs) on their lots. We will also create an awareness campaign to educate homeowners on the opportunity that lies in their backyards: an additional housing unit that can create rental income while helping with efforts to increase affordable housing in LA.
 
 
 
 Los Angeles is struggling with lack of affordable housing and an increase in its homeless population. ADUs are a significant way to increase the housing stock in Los Angeles.
 
 
 
 LA County and the City of LA have relaxed zoning regulations in order to allow for construction of more ADUs. The number of permitted ADUs has grown this past year. However, if we are to make a dent in the affordable housing crisis we have to build many more ADUs per year.
 
 
 
 Nowadays, a process to determine if a lot is eligible for an ADU addition requires the design consultant’s or homeowner’s investment of time to read and interpret complicated zoning code constraints.
 
 
 
 We propose to streamline this process by generating quick answers for homeowners on their possibilities regarding ADUs on their properties. To accomplish this task our database will use machine-learning and existing Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to predict with good certainty the likelihood of a property being allowed by zoning codes to have an ADU. 
 
 
 
 After the database is generated, we will develop a user-friendly website where anyone can search for their property and see if they can build an ADU. We will be able to reach out more people in less time and hopefully contribute to engage more homeowners in building ADUs.
 
 
 
 We will also create an awareness campaign targeting homeowners of South LA, Central LA and East LA.
 
 
 
 Our activation will eventually contribute to the addition of affordable units in communities impacting Housing Affordability Metric and Homelessness Metric. We also believe that it will impact the Resilient Communities Metric since it will boost much needed housing opportunities.
 
 
 
 LA will be the best place to LIVE when housing becomes more affordable, and homelessness is drastically reduced. We will activate Angelenos to participate in the affordable housing movement.

It will become the ""best"" place to live as it addresses self-sufficiency and homelessness issues.

 Collaborative efforts are key to efficiency and success. It takes more than money, it takes activities that ""Carry Forward"" the city and county. We will reach out to include organizations, businesses, and government agencies.



 The empty houses, apartment building, motels/hotels, warehouses, and other building with good bones will stand strong as they are converted to sustainable living environments. The first step will be to lease homes to house homeless individuals and veterans who are in need of housing so they have a safe place to live while attending free workforce training and connecting individuals to needed services.



 Through collaborative efforts of organizations located outside and inside the city of LA and LA County, efforts are increased. Neighboring counties and organizations know about the challenges that exist in LA County and want to help in the efforts to ""Carry Forward"" their communities.



 The University of Southern California and the Los Angeles Veterans Collaborative did a study of California Veterans, finding and concluding the following:



 Each year, approximately 12,000 military veterans will settle in Los Angeles County as they transition out of the military, joining the 325,000 veterans who currently reside here. For the most part, veterans in California and Los Angeles County reflect the larger national demographics, with the exception that the local population has more Hispanic and Asian veterans than the national average.



 The findings from the Los Angeles County Veterans Study have revealed several overarching issues that deserve attention:

 * 1st, many service members leaving the military are not prepared for the transition.

 * 2nd, many military veterans have a wide range of needs that cannot be easily provided by a single organization.

 * 3rd, veteran support organizations are not organized to provide holistic support to current and returning veterans.

 * 4th, most veteran support organizations are focused on meeting acute and chronic needs of veterans, such as homelessness, immediate or severe health issues, or acute or chronic unemployment. Very little attention is given to preventing these conditions or intervening early to prevent them from becoming chronic.



 Additionally, relocating homeless individuals to locations like Lancaster, Apple Valley, and Hesperia which have available jobs, lower rents, and price of properties.

Research from Small Business Majority finds that 91% of small business owners identify this as a top area of concern. When small business owners are denied a traditional loan, many turn to high-cost alternative financing sources. Opportunity Fund research has found Los Angeles business owners face APRs of an average of 94%. These high-cost products can jeopardize businesses, homes, and families and leave a vacuum in communities should these businesses fail. This is particularly true for women and minority entrepreneurs, who are less likely to be approved for traditional loans than their white male counterparts.
 
 
 
 To address this issue, the RBLC formed in 2015 to support responsible practices in the small business lending sector. We have created the Small Business Borrowers’ Bill of Rights (the Rights)—a set of practices lenders and brokers adhere to when financing small business owners—and are now planning an intensive LA-focused campaign to activate Angelenos around responsible lending through education and policy advocacy. By creating momentum among the county’s small business and entrepreneurial community, we can push for stronger protections against predatory lending and better support those most affected by discriminatory and predatory lending practices, in particular, women and minority entrepreneurs working to start and grow their firms.
 
 
 
 In our education campaign, we will create and disseminate materials to ensure that entrepreneurs know the following: 1) their rights when searching for a loan, 2) which responsible lenders operate in their area, and 3) which questions to ask to ensure they find a responsible loan. We will compile an LA-specific online toolkit with this information and share it with our networks and with local business organizations for distribution to their networks. We also will conduct in-person educational events for local entrepreneurs. These events will be open to all, but we will focus our outreach on engaging women and minority entrepreneurs to better support their ability to protect themselves from predatory lenders.
 
 
 
 We also will create and advance a policy agenda informed by feedback from LA entrepreneurs. To advocate for stronger legal protections, we will collect stories from small business owners who have been trapped by predatory lenders, and we will share these stories widely. We will train small business spokespeople to speak with the media and send opinion pieces to local outlets. We will meet with local government leaders to elevate the issue, and we will connect our spokespeople with their elected representatives to ensure that policymakers understand the detrimental impact of predatory lending on local business.

 2. Opening Community School Parks at every school in LA
 
 
 
 Through COMPAS, parents, neighbors, and friends come together to build relationships, assess recreation needs, create action plans, build skills, volunteer, and receive recognition for CSP related contributions and innovations.
 
 
 
 To complement PFP’s in-person relationship-building work, COMPAS will use digital activism to bring together Angelenos from different neighborhoods so that they can build a strong, collective voice supporting CSP expansion. As community members learn about the benefits of CSPs, they will become advocates for play, and galvanize their communities to move decision-makers towards city-wide shared-use policies.
 
 
 
 With LA2050’s support, PFP’s COMPAS will:
 
 * Activate 300 hundred parents per school at existing CSPs to become parent volunteers and vocal supporters of CSPs and shared-use
 
 * Activate 5,000 neighbors per school at existing CSP sites to build awareness of CSPs and shared-use.
 
 * Activate parents to recruit and engage their community members through COMPAS, with a goal to register supporters at 20 schools (total potentially activated: 100,000)
 
 * Advocate for LAUSD to authorize low-cost or no-cost shared-use options so that communities across LA can access school playgrounds during non-school hours.
 
 
 
 Through COMPAS we will activate parents’ & neighbors’ civic power to advance shared-use policies that can improve parks equity in LA.",learn,2018095,https://activation.la2050.org/play/people-for-parks/people-for-parks.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2ZWX_tk4BU
8102096,2018,Safe Place for Youth by Podshare,"PodShare has built over 190 affordable housing units across Los Angeles and SPY serves 1,100 homeless youth each year, connecting them to jobs, schools, housing, healthcare, and basic necessities.",,,,,"[""Rates of homelessness"",""Rates of mental illness"",""Resilient communities""]","Currently, there are thousands of young people on the streets of LA fighting to survive. They are creative, resilient, generous, powerful and represent immeasurable untapped talent. County-wide efforts to address homelessness are critical to systemic shift, yet community level interventions have tangible impact on neighborhood culture, connectedness, safety and health. By taking a local approach to addressing youth homelessness and leveraging key organizational skill sets, Podshare and Safe Place for Youth (SPY) are poised to take on youth homelessness in West LA, improving the lives of housed and unhoused Angelenos alike.
 
 
 
 The vast majority of homeless adults, first experience homelessness in their teens and early 20’s. If stabilized early, time spent on the streets can be brief and non-recurring. However, without intervention, today’s homeless youth go on to become tomorrow’s chronically homeless adults, with deeply exacerbated medical, mental health and emotional scars due to extended trauma of life on the streets. This activation seeks to break that pipeline to chronic homelessness by meaningfully engaging young people in safe, youth- friendly, easily- accessible temporary housing. In doing so, we will show impact along the following metrics:
 
 
 
 Homelessness. With enough pods to shelter 20 young people each night, “SPY by Podshare” will move 50-250 individuals off the streets each year. This provides immediate safety and respite while significantly decreasing the likelihood that those individuals will become chronically homeless adults, impacting ~1,600 to ~8,000 people by the year 2050.
 
 
 
 Mental Illness. Youth experiencing homelessness deal with complex mental health concerns related to disconnection from family, histories of abuse and neglect, grief, isolation, and criminalization. Yet less than 6% of SPY youth report mental health concerns as a contributing factor to their homelessness. With onsite staffing and services available, guests will receive the care they need, preventing them from becoming part of the nearly 30% of chronically homeless adults with serious mental illness in LA County. 
 
 
 
 Resilient Communities. Engaging the housed community in local responses to homelessness allows for deeper social connectedness, greater feelings of community pride and ownership, and humanization and empathy-building for those living outside. We will measure community resilience year over year through the number of volunteers participating in our programs and pre and post questionnaires regarding measures of connectedness for both guests and volunteers.
 
 
 
 Youth unemployment/underemployment. After housing, connection to jobs is the most requested service from youth at SPY. With a strong track record of engaging hundreds of youth in employment programming each year, this activation will ensure that guests are provided ample opportunity to find meaningful work and are offered metro passes and bus tokens to increase work transit accessibility.",learn,2018096,https://activation.la2050.org/live/podshare/podshare.jpg,https://youtu.be/9T1sxwl670s

 ProduceAthon participants are divided up into teams during the event. Storytelling Teams and Tech Teams. While some team members develop actual content, videos, and prototype new technologies, other team members will be focused on strategy and growth pertaining to their projects.



 Storytelling Teams are responsible for delivering a Content Strategy Plan to ensure the cause they've worked on can use the content to (1) generate awareness (2) increase volunteerism (3) increase donations



 Tech Teams are responsible for delivering a business plan on how to fund, scale, and implement their proposed technology to address the social or city challenge they worked on.



 The best ideas are presented to a panel of judges and investors at event culmination -- during a Release Party.



 From there, the top two pitches will receive funding to implement their content strategy and business plan as well as access to resources, mentors, co-working spaces, and city officials for guidance that monitors progress and ensures sustainable and systemic growth.



 The more events we're able to host in a given year will increase and attract higher caliber participants and result in more innovative ideas and concepts.

We will do this by improving the health and social connectedness of families by training and supporting 25 promotores from within the community to reach out to over 4,500 residents over two years to:
 
 o Increase families’ awareness of health and wellness resources, and
 
 o Help families connect to and navigate health and wellness services. 
 
 
 
 Below are details of the activities to achieve this goal:
 
 1. Promotores Training — increase participation in community problem-solving by training promotores in the community. Trainings will include:
 
 o Foundation-building training sessions — for the promotores to developing skills in areas such as listening, connecting with others, and public speaking. We will conduct four sessions up to three hours each. 
 
 o Content-specific training — in areas such as understanding and navigating wellness resources, trauma needs/issues, community wellness needs, and impact and coping tools for community and individual stress. 
 
 
 
 2. Promotores Support — ensure continual participation in community problem-solving by offering ongoing support to promotores. Promesa Boyle Heights will offer in-person engagements to support and coordinate promotores as they begin their work in the community through:
 
 o Monthly promotores meetings 
 
 o Building a strong peer-to-peer support system, including “Lead Promotores”. 
 
 
 
 3. Promotores community-level work once trained will include: 
 
 o Influencing individual behavior in the community around health and social connectedness through:
 
 * Resident outreach
 
 * Wellness referrals 
 
 o Conducting in-person engagements with community members through presentations and workshops 
 
 o Increasing participation of the residents in community problem-solving by offering residents volunteer opportunities to get involved in community organizing efforts to advocate for policy e.g. connecting them to the Comite de Lideres and other organizing and system-level efforts.

 DISTRICT-WIDE GRADUATION RATES improve when students and families feel connected to their school, teachers, and other personnel. Our school-based healing gardens and compost hubs connect young people and their families with the earth and her bounty, providing almost immediate tangible rewards for their physical effort, routine attendance, and mindful presence. The collective effort required to manage a school builds social cohesion and acts as the glue that holds together a community of learners together that support and care for one another as they support and care for their plants. Gardening and compost curriculum aligned to academic content in science, technology, engineering, art and math creates ""Aha!"" moments with promising potential to the bridge learning gap, motivate learners, and promote success in school. In sum, academic success, meaningful connections to school and peers, and strong community of learners can drive up school graduation rates.
 
 
 
 PROFICIENCY IN ENGLISH, LANGUAGE ARTS, AND MATH are supported by Proyecto Jardin's gardening and composting curriculum. Participants maintain garden journals and compost logs to track inputs, outputs, record observations, and summarize outcomes. They measure, weigh, illustrate, and write to describe, reflect, analyze, synthesize, report, and share. Proyecto Jardin works closely with a school site teacher(s) to align the organization's garden/compost education program to the specific needs of participating classroom(s) and school-wide goals and objectives. Our outdoor garden/compost ""classrooms"" at schools sites and in public parks rely on hands-on, experiential learning, adding a tangible quality to abstract academic concepts. 
 
 
 
 YOUTH EMPLOYMENT & UNDEREMPLOYMENT are addressed through meaningful education that can lead to meaningful work as a Certified Compost Maker or a community/school garden coordinator. Our Compost Academy is a comprehensive 8-week course that prepares individuals for entry-level employment as a compost hub manager, compost associate, or vermi-culture (worm farm) practitioner.

The workshop series will provide low-income youth with free arts education in the fields of literature, music, and dance, as well as offer writing master classes taught by renowned Los Angeles poets and writers. 
 
 
 
 Funds will support the purchase of equipment, including laptops, desks, chairs, instruments, music stands, audience seating, sound system equipment, lights, and other staging equipment. Red Hen has much of the infrastructure for this project already in place, including a performance and workshop space and a rotating team of about 20 volunteers to perform programming and administrative duties. The press also has a strong relationship with local artists who will be hired to instruct workshops.
 
 
 
 The purchase of basic workstations will allow Red Hen Press to host 20 free one-hour youth arts workshops per category (writing, music, and dance) for a total of 60 workshops annually. The press will conduct 60 workshops; serve 1,000 elementary, middle, and high school students; and employ 6 teaching artists. Through the program, students will be encouraged not only to emulate great art, but create and share original works, thus building improved artistic skills, deepening appreciation for the diverse landscape of art, and increasing confidence in peer-to-peer sharing and public presentation. The series will also provide low-income students a safe space to spend time after school.
 
 
 
 Additionally, Red Hen will program a writing master class workshop series for adults. Workshops will be offered in a range of prices and durations (one-off workshops and multi-week series) to increase accessibility for aspiring writers. The press anticipates hosting 30 master class workshops annually, to be instructed by lauded Los Angeles poets and writers. 
 
 
 
 The purchase of staging equipment and audience seating will also enable Red Hen Press to host its own events. Currently, the press primarily programs literary events at arts venues, museums, art galleries, and theaters throughout Los Angeles, and such events often incur space rental costs. By programming literary events at our own performance space, the press will eliminate venue rental costs, allowing for free entry for audience members and higher honoraria for performing artists. Support for this project will also support Red Hen’s efforts to increase attendance from low-income populations by providing free tickets to students, their families, and faculty at Title I schools in Los Angeles.",create,2018101,https://activation.la2050.org/play/red-hen-press/red-hen-press.jpg,0

 A tool is needed that allows residents to gather all of these streams into a single flow and also to add their own voice in the dialogue.



 REGIONAL.LA is a social media tool that allows residents to find and connect with their civic community according to local geography: cities, neighborhoods, service areas.



 By bringing these parties together, REGIONAL.LA allows residents to obtain better response from their local governments, participate more meaningfully in their neighborhood councils and other bodies, and form more & deeper social media connections with other residents through shared participation.



 Regional.LA works as follows:

 (a) PLUG-IN: Create an account and link it to your other social media so that you may consume the experience in your preferred environment (Regional.LA means to work with other social media platforms rather than compete).



 (b) GEOGRAPHIC DISCOVERY: Identify your address or neighborhood and be presented with a list of gov't agencies & bodies operating in your area (this is accomplished by analyzing intersections between your area and the service areas of the gov't entities).



 (c) EXPEDITE SERVICES: Browse from available services listed by local gov't entities and submit any requested info that would expedite these services (Gov't can serve you better if they know you better). This can apply to utility initiation, emergency response, volunteer opportunities, etc.



 (d) STAY INFORMED: Subscribe to news feeds from gov't entities in your area.



 These software capabilities have already been deployed in early form in select pilot areas, and over the course of the grant life cycle deployment will be expanded ultimately throughout all of Los Angeles County. In addition, deployment will be accompanied by a robust ""ground game"" of local ambassadors, drawn from local communities, and funded to actively promote adoption of the platform in their areas.



 This activation will enhance GOVERNMENT RESPONSIVITY by providing a venue for direct citizen/government connection: residents can discover and make themselves known to their local government agencies, facilitating better interactions. Furthermore, governments can post surveys & questionnaires and also advertise volunteer opportunities and services --residents can respond & register online to enhance government response.



 This activation will enhance CITIZEN PARTICIPATION (voting) in Neighborhood Councils by providing (a) a means for the Councils to have a higher profile amongst residents and deliver more value to residents, and (b) a means for Councils to actively advertise and facilitate voting opportunities.



 This activation will deliver more and deeper SOCIAL MEDIA CONNECTIONS among residents by providing new ways for them to participate together in activities of common interest, thus promoting direct residents-2-residents discovery.",create,2018102,https://activation.la2050.org/connect/regional-la/regional-la.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdB1z_4U_0A

Highlights will be featured in a documentary special on PBS SoCal and the content will be incorporated into Roadtrip Nation’s educational resources for middle school, high school, and college students.
 
 
 
 High-tech Startups
 
 LA has become a leading destination for high-tech startups. Silicon Beach, located in the Westside region of metropolitan LA, is home to more than 500 tech startup companies and is considered to be one of the hottest tech hubs in the world. Venture capital in the billions is flowing into the city, thanks in part to efforts by Mayor Garcetti and a council of entrepreneurs, venture capitalists and community leaders which introduce investors with local tech funds. 
 
 
 
 Manufacturing
 
 From aerospace and medical supplies to food and furniture, the Los Angeles area is the biggest manufacturing hub in the country with more than half a million jobs here. There is space to build factories and runways, the weather is ideal for testing planes year-round, the huge ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles let companies quickly ship products to a global market, and a massive logistics region east of Los Angeles is the first stop before products get on trucks to go across the country. Skilled workers are in high-demand, and business are working with local educational institutions to help students obtain training and skills for these jobs, many of which do not require a four-year college degree.
 
 
 
 Creative Industries
 
 Los Angeles is one of the most diverse cities in the world, but the entertainment industry remains a very small, largely white, male “club”. This year offered hope that the industry may have reached a tipping point. With the Grammy’s long overdue recognition of hip hop as the dominant genre in music, and with the critical and box office success of films like The Shape of Water, Get Out, and Black Panther, the hope is that the industry is finally changing to better reflect the diversity of our country and the world at large. The challenge ahead is to build from these successes. Beyond the Red Carpet will highlight writers, directors, producers and other creative talents who are forging new ground so that the entertainment industry continues to nurture and attract the best creative talent from all cultures and walks of life.",create,2018104,https://activation.la2050.org/create/roadtrip-nation/roadtrip-nation.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jT5D2oFUbpQ

Parents don't feel confident sending their children to school. Teachers are overwhelmed, overworked and under-resourced.



 Kids are anxious, over-scheduled, stressed out, exposed to too much too soon, and being bullied and teased. Families are disconnected, lacking psychological tools to navigate through a socially isolating world. Parents don't know how to parent effectively and are either too permissive or too punitive. Kids are depressed and anxious and the adults in their lives don't have the tools to know how to help.



 Adverse childhood experiences can create negative, lasting impacts on a child's development. Roots & Wings believes that the opportunity is now. We need to better understand our children and acquire tools to make raising children a joyful, transformational experience for both you and them.



 Social Emotional Learning Specialists teach children mindfulness, techniques for emotional regulation and dealing with stress. They offer tools for conflict resolution and problem-solving. Done in groups through play & creative expression, children will develop critical life skills that are not taught elsewhere. The services provided will decrease rates of anxiety, depression, bullying & disciplinary action.



 The Activated Potential School addresses all three levels of students needs from a low-level of misbehavior to repetitive and more serious behavior to serious, chronic and dangerous misbehavior. This model is originated from the work of Sugai et al at the University of Oregon.



 Providing parents with access to free, positive discipline training led by a Certified Positive Discipline instructor will decrease child abuse and improve family cooperation & communication. Monthly parent workshops on topics such as social media, bullying, and more will promote constructive conversation among the community.



 Providing teachers with training and ongoing support throughout the duration of the school year will help them feel more equipped to deal with classroom challenges.

However, air pollution was once so bad that people were forced inside. Our oceans were unsafe to swim in. Through the tireless work of environmental nonprofit organizations Los Angeles we overcame these challenges, and while we have come a long way, there is a lot more that needs to be done. We need a sustainable energy infrastructure, oceans free of plastic pollution and clean air to breathe. We rely on organizations like the Coalition for Clean Air, the Surfrider Foundation and the US Green Building Council to advance these changes. Yet while we rely on the nonprofit environmental sector for transformative change, they operate in an extremely resource-limited field. Only 3% of charitable giving in 2015 went towards environmental issues. That is where we come in.



 SeedLA is an innovative solution to empower the environmental nonprofits working towards a healthier more sustainable Los Angeles. We started from the realization that there is a large untapped resource in LA — our very own Angelenos. Our city is home to many highly skilled, motivated and sustainably minded people who want to make a positive impact. By recruiting LA’s brightest young minds we facilitate their ability for real, tangible impacts accelerating the work of environmental nonprofits.

8102108,2018,Equal Footing LA: Providing New Shoes For Kids In Need,Too many kids in LA are missing school because they don’t have shoes—or being bullied because they are wearing inappropriate shoes. We will provide brand new athletic shoes to LAUSD school children.,,,,,"[""Number of households below the self-sufficiency standard"",""Prevalence of adverse childhood experiences""]","The children in our community need to know that they are important and we believe in them. For too long in LA, we have ignored these children’s needs and neglected to send this message. Funding from LA2050 will provide a direct investment in the children of Los Angeles—the future of LA—and make the city a better place to LIVE by dramatically improve the lives of these children, many of whom have never owned a new pair of shoes. 
 
 
 
 Shoes are so much more than shoes. The gift of new shoes can be a transformative experience for young children, many of whom have never received a new box of anything before, certainly not expensive shoes. With the support of their community, children grow to be better citizens—better Angelinos. This sentiment is best captured in the following thank you note: “Thank you so much for the shoes you are giving me. This is amazing what you are doing... You are going to make a lot of kids happy and you are showing me what kind of person I want to be when I grow up.” 
 
 
 
 Our program provides a meaningful, concrete way for individuals, businesses, and community organizations to make a real difference in what can often seem an overwhelming problem—child poverty. We believe that most people want to make a difference but feel overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the problems we face. Shoes That Fit offers a solution by connecting people to schools in their own backyards; we operate wherever we have people who want to make a difference. Year after year, our volunteers return to help schools in their own neighborhoods, often increasing their support and buying more shoes for more kids. Helping children empowers our volunteers, provides a sense of pride in their community, and empowers them to make a real impact on the daily life of children in need. Ultimately, it creates a more engaged community, and a better LA. 
 
 
 
 Unfortunately, the inner city of LA is so large and has such high poverty rates that it does not have the number of local support groups we find in other communities. Yet Southern California has an enormous concentration of wealth and social conscience. Being based in Southern California, our number one goal is to increase the number of children we reach in Los Angeles so that we create a more thriving community now and for future generations. Together, we can inspire the next generation of Angelinos through the simple gift of a new pair of shoes.",play,2018108,https://activation.la2050.org/live/shoes-that-fit/shoes-that-fit.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiWi0EoNxHc

As anchors of their communities, they create opportunity in disadvantaged communities, strengthen local economies and revitalize neighborhoods. They are critical partners in the work to reduce inequality and expand opportunity for all.

 To make LA the best place to create, we will support local entrepreneurs through our Entrepreneurship Program, which delivers education and resources that small business owners need to launch and run a successful business. Focused on supporting women, minority and other underserved entrepreneurs, the program has quickly expanded throughout the LA area, accompanied by national webinars and educational websites. The program includes seminars and resources in English and Spanish on topics such as access to capital, healthcare, retirement security and asset-building.

 Key elements include:

 * Access to capital: One of the biggest challenges facing entrepreneurs and small business owners continues to be the inability to access credit and capital. We provide education on how to find responsible lenders, avoid predatory lending traps, improve a credit score and access capital through non-traditional methods like crowdfunding. This education is particularly important for women and minority entrepreneurs, who are more likely to be denied a traditional loan than their white male counterparts.

 * Access to healthcare: We believe that every person has the right to quality, affordable and equitable healthcare. We help small employers explore their options to access affordable healthcare coverage for themselves and their employees.

 * Women entrepreneurs: Despite many gains, gender inequality continues to heavily impact women entrepreneurs. LA is the pilot city for our new Women’s Entrepreneurship program, specifically designed to educate women business owners about their networking, mentorship and procurement options. We educate women on obtaining certification as a woman-owned business, resources to meet their childcare needs and accessing the capital necessary to start and grow their businesses.

 * Venturize.org: This online platform provides education and resources for small business owners seeking loans, while also offering more in-depth resources such as business planning and financial management tools. We are expanding this platform to LA, engaging partner organizations to share its resources, and developing a feature to connect entrepreneurs with local, in-person support to help them grow their businesses and create good jobs in their communities.

 * Ecosystem mapping: A small business ecosystem comprises the local organizations that offer low- or no-cost assistance to small businesses. Our in-depth mapping of LA-area lenders and business assistance organizations allows us to easily refer small business owners to trusted partners for in-person assistance.",connect,2018109,https://activation.la2050.org/create/small-business-majority/small-business-majority.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMxPYmoLgA

 * Improve asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) outcomes among residents by providing actionable information to support self management

 * Identify hotspots of respiratory disease in the community, better understand how environmental drivers are influencing these patterns.



 SmartAirLA is modeled after Air Louisville, in which the city of Louisville and a coalition of private, community health, and philanthropic organizations provided more than 1,100 smart inhalers to asthma sufferers.



 Within 12 months of the smart inhaler deployment, AIR Louisville participants reported:

 * Average of 82% reduction in asthma rescue inhaler use

 * Doubled their symptom-free days

 * Better sleep, with an average of 19% increase in symptom-free nights

 * 29% of uncontrolled participants gained control of their asthma



 The data collected by the smart inhalers empowered Louisville City to:

 * Identify buffer zones around pollution emitters and set pollution limits

 * Build greenbelts to reduce particulate matter pollution by 60% in high asthmatic neighborhoods

 * Reroute freight routes from high asthmatic neighborhoods



 To achieve our outcomes, SmartAirLA will deploy smart inhalers through partnerships with local environmental health organizations and health care providers to educate patients on the health benefits of the smart inhalers.



 SmartAirLA will design and execute a pilot project to deploy the smart inhalers to underserved asthmatic children (age 5 to 17) in the Wilmington neighborhood of Los Angeles County.



 The targeted outcomes from the SmartAirLA Pilot include:

 * Improve quality outcomes for patients

 * Reduce health care costs

 * Identify potential hotspot locations where increased asthmatic events may occur

 * Provide the collected data to public and nongovernment organizations to implement preventive actions.",connect,2018110,https://activation.la2050.org/live/smartairla/smartairla.jpg,0

Trails make regional assets available to populations that otherwise might not derive benefit. Physical activity becomes accessible to the widest range of people, including persons with disabilities and others who are known to be less physically active. Trails provides an amenity open to residents of every age.

Walking, Running and Biking are fun and green, curbing our carbon footprints, reducing air pollution and our reliance on fossil fuels. The momentum for active transportation is building, thanks in no small part to completion of the South Bay Bicycle Master Plan. Active transportation is perceived by more and more as a safe way to get outdoors and have fun!

For example, if by answering the call to join in on the fun ACTIVATE SOUTH BAY LA TRAILS! residents begin to support City infrastructure that supports pedestrian and cycling activities, then when an issue comes up in a City related to that, they are empowered to speak out in the public forum.

Expanding uses of linear paths will help us meet our primary goal of augmenting access to space to PLAY in the our urban environment. Since we suffer from a low ratio of park acres per thousand residents (critically underserved in some South Bay Cities), trails are a component of the solution. Seniors, adults, families and children need the benefit of playtime. Having greater access to trails will expand available play spaces, regardless of age. The importance of intergenerational connections is generally acknowledged. Although not defined as park space, trails will help to increase the opportunities for residents of all ages to meet in their pedestrian and cycling activities.

Activating the trail system will bolster the walk/bike/transit scores for every neighborhood along the way. The Walk Score offers an answer to two important questions. ""What can I do to improve my personal health?"" and ""What can I do to improve the health of the planet?"" Furthermore, living a walkable or bikable lifestyle means rush hour traffic becomes less relevant. It is well documented that real estate values are higher in neighborhoods with higher scores.

 LA is home to over 2.2 million children. We have so much space to play--mountainous wilderness, vast desert/prairie plains, over 200 park & rec. depts., and 57 miles of coastline. Yet, there is a legacy of segregation of swimming pools and ocean spaces in LA that has led to what we term a ""crisis of blue culture."" Our children are not learning how to swim (in 2017 64% of African American children, 45% of Latino children, and 40% of caucasian children cannot swim) and they are not visiting their beaches to play (50% of middle school aged children in LA Co. have never seen the beach). For young Angelenos to realize their full potential, we have to transform our legacy. Like the ocean, we must afford our youth equal opportunity by bridging gaps in access to swim lessons, ocean safety and surf lessons, and a fun and interactive marine science curriculum to buttress their physical experience. We must focus on involving entire families/communities in the solution. We seek to measure the quantum impact of their inclusion and support on the whole of Los Angeles.
 
 
 
 Surf Bus and partners have created a multi-level plan to activate 100,000 Angelenos to claim coastal spaces through play. Our program, “Splash Force LA” is a collaboration with AltaSea and Los Angeles Maritime Institute. Together, our focus is on measuring the following three LA2050 metrics: 
 
 
 
 1. Number and quality of informal spaces for play: Where do water lovers hang out between sessions, how come, what is happening there? Beach parking lots, pool decks, port hangars…
 
 2. Number of parks with intergenerational play opportunities: pools and beaches provide open and creative play opportunities for all generations. Our program integrates entire families into various levels of ""play"" and we have a plan to encourage and measure family involvement.
 
 3. Number of residents with easy access to a “vibrant” park: ""Vibrancy"" to us means amount, quality, and creativity of use. Beaches provide tons of open space--both structured and unstructured. Vibrancy is impacted by the ability to travel with ease, the confidence to start the trip, a feeling of support, and a sense of belonging upon arrival.
 
 
 
 Our plan combines our reach to achieve the following:
 
 
 
 1. Teach 3rd graders (100,000+) in LAUSD how to swim as part of their in-school pe experience. 
 
 2. 40 field trips a school year for elem/middle/high school LAUSD students that include a Surf Bus lesson in Santa Monica, lunch, a visit to AltaSea/Cabrillo Aquarium, and a sail on a LAMI tall ship. 
 
 3. We will host two urban luaus a month at LA Park and Rec facilities to build relationships with families and community.
 
 4. Each partner will host a quarterly “ohana day:"" visits to the beach/altasea/lami for family/friends. 
 
 5. Perfect attendance earns eligibility for end-of-year trips: 2 voyages to Catalina for 30 people on each ship and/or 1 surf camping trip for 20 groms.",connect,2018114,https://activation.la2050.org/play/surf-bus-foundation/surf-bus-foundation.jpg,https://vimeo.com/262573193

 It seems impossible, it seems like nothing will happen, BUT with new tools for connecting, your participation, and a big LA2050 campaign to welcome everyone, LA is going to be awesome! 
 
 
 
 There are new tools for connecting online. They are not like social media, they are based on time tested best practices of face to face deliberative discussion. 
 
 
 
 ""Deliberative discussion"" is a structured conversation allowing a group of people to receive and exchange information, to critically examine an issue, and voice their conclusions in a way which will inform decision making. 
 
 
 
 These new tools are designed to enable deliberative discussion on line, like a professional facilitator would in person. They make it possible for people, who may disagree, to collaborate in investigation of the issues they confront, to understand the many concerns involved, to be heard and counted, and once in a while to find a new idea that no one had thought of before. And online, very large numbers of people can participate. 
 
 
 
 With everyone CONNECTED and engaging with each other, their neighborhood council, their city council, their state and US representatives, LA is going to be the best place to connect, and it's going to be awesome!
 
 
 
 Now a council (or rep.) can hear from constituents their answers to questions like:
 
 
 
 ""What are the biggest concerns you have for your neighborhood""
 
 or 
 
 ""How can we all make our neighborhood an even better community together?""
 
  
 
 And instead of getting overwhelmed with individual comments, they will receive a prioritized list of answers, as rated by the community, with their most important reasons why and why not, again rated by the community. And these aren't just the top of mind ""answers"" like from a poll, these are thoughtful answers the community has discussed and reconsidered.
 
 
 
 And then the top answers can be turned around into new questions for the community to discuss. Thus the engagement can continue and become a norm.
 
 
 
 The community and council will see the numbers, understand the competing viewpoints, and find affinity for those who have them, and 'politics' will evolve into working toward solutions that work for the community as a whole. The polarization will reverse.
 
 
 
 This form of problem solving is what face to face deliberative discussion is good at - but it has always been constrained by space, cost and time. Now, online, we do not have those constraints!
 
 
 
 Our metric is voter turn out, and deliberative engagement has been shown to increase that. And with everyone in LA connecting and working together deliberatively, awesome, impossible things - will happen.",connect,2018115,https://activation.la2050.org/connect/synaccord-llc/synaccord-llc.jpg,0
8102116,2018,Los Angelenos Resilient in the Face of Natural Disasters,"At Team Rubicon, disasters are our business and veterans are our passion. We unite the skills and experience of our nation's military veterans to provide efficient, local, and rapid disaster relief.",,,,,"[""Number of households below the self-sufficiency standard"",""Rates of mental illness"",""Resilient communities""]","Team Rubicon utilizes technology to effectively provide relief to the most vulnerable populations during a disaster. A recent review of studies on the relationship between poverty and disasters in the U.S. by Fothergill & Peek revealed that socio-economic status is a significant predictor of the physical and psychological impacts in the pre- and post- disaster stages. Using a platform developed by Palantir, Team Rubicon maps neighborhoods that are most vulnerable from a socio-economic standpoint by overlaying tax records, insurance information, and census data. In many cases these communities lack the tax-base to provide professional, community based disaster services, or are overshadowed by wealthier areas impacted by the same disaster. Within urban areas, Team Rubicon’s focus is often on communities of color and non-native English speakers. These communities are disproportionately impacted by disasters, lack the personal or community-based resources to fend for themselves, and cannot agitate for government support as effectively as their affluent neighbors. 
 
 
 
 Team Rubicon’s Resilient City Initiative will create greater volunteer density in Los Angeles, training local residents to provide disaster relief. Our initiative tackles three pressing issues: Los Angeles' preparedness for and ability to respond to disasters; the challenges of veterans reintegrating into our communities; and the lack of civic engagement in local communities today. The recently released Veterans Civic Health Index reveals veterans consistently outperform civilians in volunteer hours contributed and are more apt to work with neighbors to fix community problems. 
 
 
 
 Leveraging the power of the military’s diversity can help our country and city heal and respond in new (yet proven) ways, bringing a new sense of social cohesion to Los Angeles. The military is one of the most diverse institutions on the planet today. However, most veterans return to their less-diverse origins upon discharge and the value of inclusion and understanding dissipates over time. Yet, if inspired to come together once again in service, engaging and empowering veterans builds bridges across the divides that are tearing at the fabric of our country. 
 
 
 
 Team Rubicon believes that Los Angeles County's veterans can and should be a force of change to help those most vulnerable. According to the USC School of Social Work: Los Angeles County Veterans Study, California is home to over 1.8 million former service members, with approximately 12,000 military veterans settling in Los Angeles County every year, joining the 325,000 veterans who currently reside here. One in five veterans suffer from post-traumatic stress and over two-thirds report difficulties adjusting to civilian life. Team Rubicon seeks to merge veterans’ military identity with civilian life by establishing a community network of volunteers supporting communities affected by disaster in Southern California.",live,2018116,https://activation.la2050.org/live/team-rubicon/team-rubicon.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BOUm4PBeUc
8102117,2018,Inspiring Community Action to End Gun Violence in L.A. by Stopping “Bad Apple” Gun Dealers,The Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence will educate and empower Los Angelenos to take meaningful action to stem the flow of crime guns and end gun violence in the community.,,,,,"[""Per capita crime rates"",""Perceived safety""]","Brady’s strategic campaign to stop “bad apple” gun dealers engages local residents, local Brady chapter members, and community-based organizations to take meaningful action to end gun violence in Los Angeles. 
 
 
 
 Chronic gun violence has a devastating impact on community health. There were 470 gun homicides in Los Angeles County over the past 12 months, according to the Los Angeles Times. Such tragedies are often the result of guns getting into the hands of people who should not have them, such as gun traffickers, convicted felons, domestic abusers, and people with a dangerous mental illness. Though these prohibited purchasers are not able to pass a Brady background check as required by law at federally licensed firearm dealers, they may obtain guns through “bad apple” gun dealers. These gun dealers knowingly ignore the law and engage in irresponsible business practices just to make a profit. The most recent Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) data shows that nationally, 90 percent of crime guns are sold by only 5 percent of gun dealers. These “bad apples” supply nearly the entire U.S. criminal gun market. 
 
 
 
 While California has some of the strongest gun laws in the U.S., the safety of Californians is dramatically compromised by the impact of “bad apple” gun dealers. Most California crime guns come from “bad apple” dealers in-state. Out of the 39,034 crime guns recovered in California in 2016, for which the source was identified, 67 percent were traced to California dealers. 
 
 
 
 “Bad apple” gun dealers facilitate the flow of crime guns into vulnerable communities. These dealers knowingly or negligently skirt the law and endanger communities. For example, they may allow someone to “straw purchase” a gun on behalf of another person, typically someone who cannot pass a Brady background check. Or they may sell dozens or hundreds of the same type of gun to the same person in a short time. These purchasers are often trafficking guns to criminals. “Bad apple” gun dealers may also sell guns “off the books” that they then claim were lost or stolen. These purchasers are often people who could not pass a Brady background check or do not want a record of the sale. 
 
 
 
 We take a city-based, supply-side approach in stemming the flow of crime guns into vulnerable Los Angeles communities by reforming or shutting down the “bad apple” gun dealers who knowingly or negligently sell guns to prohibited purchasers. Brady convenes and coordinates a wide array of partners including law enforcement, the legal community, researchers, the media, and community-based organizations to: 1) identify and name “bad apple” gun dealers, 2) wage public, legal, and economic pressure to shut down or reform “bad apple” gun dealers, and 3) encourage sensible practices by responsible gun dealers.
 
 
 
 Ultimately this work will reduce gun violence and increase public safety by reducing access to guns by those who would use them in crime.",live,2018117,https://activation.la2050.org/play/the-brady-center-to-prevent-gun-violence/the-brady-center-to-prevent-gun-violence.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpI8redM2To

By building a Burg for each district and hosting unique features such as online town halls, we're lowering the barriers to give people access to the city of LA in a brand new way, and it is out now for iOS and Android. Download links on our website! 
 
 
 
 We operate on 3 pillars: 1. Connect the community 2. Properly inform the community 3. Make it easier for representatives to actually represent the community.
 
 
 
 1. We have built our own voter verification infrastructure working with the CA Sec. of State’s office that verifies voters and places them in their correct city or city council district (depending on the size of the city). All we need is a user’s name and birthdate, and we can cross reference to check their voter status and place them within their city/district. Verified voters are given unique access and an “I Vote” sticker that acts as a badge that indicates their status in the community (slightly similar to a Twitter checkmark).
 
 
 
 2. As Pew Research Group and Mark Zuckerberg have stressed, local news is directly correlated with local civic engagement. If we can better inform communities with relevant local news, they will be more likely to civically engage. Our answer: we pick up RSS Feeds of Local Newsrooms (e.g. here in LA we use the local section of the LA Times and Daily News, Curbed.LA, etc.) and streamline them to Burgs across the city. We optimize this for every Burg depending on their area. 
 
 
 
 3. Local Representatives now have a never before seen direct tap into the pulse of their community, and not just to a data file but real access to their constituents. They can interact with verified voters directly in real-time and can host Online Town Halls (combo of a Reddit AMA/Quora Session) where voters can submit and upvote questions in a democratic system for reps to answer.

 We currently have a proprietary interactive prototype that we will use to build out into a fully functional initial app. In collaboration with the University of Washington we will establish a baseline pedestrian network, and then invite participants to validate and adjust individual areas. Functionality will include GPS tracking of data including barriers, incline, curbs, lighting, ramps, tactile paving, wheelchair access, amenities such as water fountains, benches, shelter, toilets and others. Additionally, we may implement camera width measurement and exact incline measurement by gyroscope. 
 
 
 
 Using this initial product, after thorough testing, we will design and hold ‘mapathon’ events centered around high density transit areas to gather data in initial large bursts. Using those learnings, we will refine the app if needed, as well as our incentivisation approach, and hold more mapathon events, as well as release the app for use in people’s everyday lives. 
 
 
 
 The data we generate will serve two important purposes. It will allow citizens to plan the best routes, end to end. It will also allow us to collect open-source information to add to LA’s on the condition of pedestrian access in and around the most dense and trafficked transit areas. This will help both public and private organizations to prioritize issues that may keep citizens from walking and using transit to its fullest. 
 
 
 
 The end result will have benefits that tie directly to improving LA’s walk, bike and transit score. If physical access to transit is easier to understand, as well as in better repair, that will increase transit use and ridership. Allowing citizens to find the most accessible route for them, especially for those in wheelchairs, with limited mobility, or simply pushing a stroller will enhance overall safety, making people feel better about getting outside and enjoying Los Angeles. Finally, simply the knowledge that “someone is listening” when citizens report problems goes a long way to instill faith and trust in civic organizations. These all contribute to our shared goal of a more livable and sustainable city.

8102120,2018,Farmers Market Delivery,"We make it easier for all Angelinos to sell or shop locally, by creating a Farmer's Markets app where anybody can have their craft products delivered across the city.",,,,,"[""Employment in the creative industries"",""Jobs per capita"",""Minority- and women-owned firms""]","Creators in Los Angeles have never struggled in being creative. However, it has become increasingly hard for creators to derive wealth out of their creative value.



 There are many barriers for creators to economically succeed, especially creators from underprivileged communities. These barriers include financial resources, experience, business resources, marketing apparatuses, connections, and the increasing challenge of oligopolies monopolizing every industry.



 Creators find it difficult to sell the things they create, because there are startup costs, and it takes infrastructure. Generally one needs to have a facility, which means high rents, and this does not favor well for small businesses or non high earners looking to economically move up. It is increasingly hard for these mom and pop shops to compete with big businesses as well.



 Natch wants to remove many of these barriers by making the business industry more accessible for creators. Supporting local businesses is currently hard for both shoppers and sellers. By creating our online marketplace we create a network of local businesses, where shoppers can more easily find and receive locally made products. So we make it easier for these creators to market their products. But we also make it easier and cheaper for them to deliver their products too. By handling the fulfillment and delivery, sellers do not need to rent out retail space, nor hire expensive drivers to transport their goods. They also do not need to worry about developing their own website and driving traffic. We simplify many of the difficulties behind creators starting their own business, and we make it cheaper.



 By enabling sellers to sell directly to consumers we also ensure that they receive the financial value from most of what they produce. By removing middle men when it comes to manufacturing, distribution, and retail, the creator can once again become an owner of what they produce.



 Natch believes that by empowering creators, and giving anybody in LA a chance to compete with bigger businesses, local spending will be channeled away from the hands of bigger corporations and directly into the hands of the people in the city.



 This engages LA in multiple ways. It helps spread wealth across the city. It helps empower diverse communities of creators to play a part in the everyday lives of all Angelinos. And it gives access to people around Los Angeles to the different things creators produce. We aim to improve the quality of life for Angelinos by giving them the opportunity to connect directly with other Angelinos through the food they create.",live,2018120,https://activation.la2050.org/create/the-natch-inc/the-natch-inc.jpg,0

This year, there has been an impact of diverse representation as seen through films like Coco, Black Panther & Ava Duvernay’s A Wrinkle in Time in the box office figures and viewer ratings. America’s audience demand for inclusivity has resonated throughout the entertainment industry and we’re seeing the shift in the growing need for content creators to create more of these inclusive stories. By the year 2050, minorities will become the majority and for Los Angeles’ biggest industries, the need not only for diverse stories in entertainment but a more inclusive workforce, is imminent. Since it’s inception, NALIP’s mission is to advance Latinx content creators and their careers by providing resources and guidance in order to provide more accurate representation behind the camera, from producers to directors to even those just starting their career. With the Emerging Content Creator Inclusion Initiative, NALIP aims to support ALL creators from diverse backgrounds in preparing them to enter the media workforce. The Emerging Content Creators Inclusion Initiative will help make a LA the best place to create by providing access to college ready youth and those interested in media opportunities to learn and prepare for the entertainment industry workforce. It is intended to be an informative step by step guide for young content creators to successfully transition into the industry through forums, networking, mentoring, summer programs, workshops, and funding college-entry projects. Top industry professionals will share their insights and experience, along with some of their biggest challenges. Through the physical, and digital platforms NALIP will provide, the ECC Inclusion Initiative will reach over 100,000 Angelenos and promote the advancement of emerging talent, reach youth and create awareness. With the support from LA2050, the Emerging Content Creators Inclusion Initiative will be able to stand as its own program by funding additional staff, supporting the production of workshops, digital team, funding production of projects as well as aid in leveraging NALIP’s industry partners such as CAA, Youtube, CBS, Google, and more by providing participants access to mentorship/job opportunities after undergoing the program. The initiative will aid in bridging the gap between diverse content creators and the media companies that need them, creating more opportunities for underrepresented communities as well as providing more representation in the media landscape. As a result of the ECC Inclusion Initiative, college ready youth will be able to gain access to resources in regards to both film/media universities and serve as a pipeline to the entertainment job market in Los Angeles to give a more diverse, equitable, and creative Los Angeles.",Create,2018121,https://activation.la2050.org/create/national-association-of-latino-independent-producers-nalip/national-association-of-latino-independent-producers-nalip.jpg,https://youtu.be/3uy1I03CPas

Without addressing our park and open space inequities, we cannot make LA the best place to play by 2050.
 
 
 
 The first two days of the event will bring together between 500-700 community residents, designers, educators, innovators and policy-makers representing a range of multi-disciplinary issue areas including parks and open space, health, housing, transportation, and design to create a Play! Vision for LA County that ensures everyone has access to free and safe places to play by 2050. The event will conclude with a county-wide play day that includes opportunities for residents from around the region to get outside and play in our parks, streets and open spaces! 
 
 
 
 The event will start with a Park Equity Summit led by community members highlighting the racial and environmental injustices that have led to LA’s inequitable park access. Inequalities in the allocation of park and recreation resources will be shared through the perspectives of community leaders’ lived experiences. Elected officials, CBOs, academics, and school districts, including LAUSD and agency staff, will be on hand to hear community members outline problems and define solutions for park equity. Day one will conclude with a community vision for a healthy and equitable LA County and offer ideas to inform discussions on day two.
 
 
 
 The second day of workshop sessions will engage leaders from cities around the globe in participatory conversations with local stakeholders. These sessions will draw on successful park equity solutions, with participants working across sectors, backgrounds, and experience to generate new solutions to advance park equity and help inform the conversation and shape best practices for LA County. Participants in these sessions will be accountable to community-identified problems developed in day one. 
 
 
 
 The final day of the event is a countywide celebration of the power of play, including hundreds of play-based events throughout greater LA County. The three lead partners will work with agencies, institutions, businesses, and CBOs to inspire and organize play-based events in parks and public spaces around the region, transforming greater LA into a veritable playground. Residents will be welcomed and encouraged to participate in guided activities in local parks, and will experience the reimagination of public spaces into vibrant and safe informal spaces for play (street closures, sidewalk events, activities in plazas, etc.).

8102124,2018,YouthCare: Low-cost inter-generational care for those with dementia,YouthCare is the most affordable intergenerational respite and memory care program that partners trained college student volunteers and persons with early-stage dementia in a community-based setting.,,,,,"[""Healthcare access"",""Rates of mental illness"",""Residents receiving coordinated healthcare services""]","One of the most difficult realities of a dementia diagnosis is that there are no effective treatments for the disease, nor is there a cure. We do, however, have the opportunity to mitigate the difficulties of its decline. As the rates of this disease double in the next twelve years, effectively bankrupting our healthcare system, cities that implement avant-garde solutions to address its care will be ones that stand out in the international challenge to solve what is likely to be the greatest public health crisis of modern history. 
 
 Traditionally, the effort to seek solutions for this disease has been limited to the elderly generation, but we are rapidly bringing the realities out of the shadows and injecting intergenerational innovation.
 
 The Youth Movement Against Alzheimer’s (YMAA) offers a novel, inexpensive solution to provide respite care services to the Los Angeles Community: YouthCare. YouthCare is an intergenerational respite-care program that partners trained college student volunteers and older adults with early-stage dementia in a community-based setting. For three hours, twice a week, they play games, participate in artistic activities, and deliver the research-backed Brain Boot Camp, developed by the UCLA Longevity Center to help people compensate for age-related cognitive decline. Students and seniors are paired based on similar interests and hobbies, creating a unique mentor-mentee relationship.
 
 YouthCare has been recognized by MIT, UCLA, and the Clinton Global Initiative. Most recently this model won openIDEO’s care for dementia challenge, which received 250 applications from around the world, and Social Venture Partners LA Fast Pitch 2018.
 
 YouthCare is built on a 2 year pilot with UCLA Geriatrics. Our caregiver waitlist was at more than four times capacity, with more applying to volunteer than we could accept, and most importantly, three-quarters of caregivers said this program alone was all the break they needed - a key finding in our efforts to reduce caregiver depression rates. One hundred percent of students reported that they would recommend this program to a friend, and many seniors with Alzheimer’s provided anecdotal evidence that they had found purpose once again in their lives. With just six hours a week, we found a win—win—win for older adults with dementia, their caregivers, and students, who now have a skill development opportunity to work with our growing aging population. 
 
 YouthCare is the least-expensive respite-care option. Research shows that respite is critical to keeping loved ones at home longer. In fact, 2-4 years of YouthCare costs are comparable to just one month of nursing home costs. If YouthCare reaches 17% of Angelenos with dementia and allows them to age at home for just two more months, we will save the healthcare system five-billion dollars. YouthCare has launched our pilot program at USC. With an investment from LA2050, we can bring this model to several other colleges and communities in LA county.",create,2018124,https://activation.la2050.org/live/undergraduate-gerontology-and-alzheimers-disease-awareness-association-dba-the-youth-movement-against-alzheimers/undergraduate-gerontology-and-alzheimers-disease-awareness-association-dba-the-youth-movement-against-alzheimers.jpg,https://youtu.be/5fwflSIChBM

Because most creatives buckle at bureaucracy, starting with ideas rather than legal feasibility, regulation tying up cultural opportunity acts as a hidden landmine that takes a big idea’s legs out before seeing the light of day. If more creatives could produce compliant work, they could empower their practice & employ collaborators more often; we believe collaboration is fuel for creation. We aim to pull such projects up from hiding spots below the radar, benefiting economic leadership in the process.
 
 
 
 Bringing underground & unregulated productions that we all know exist out of the shadows removes fear to advertise or engage with the community. It also provides local economic impact by tapping a wider audience, allowing for open dialog between artists’ audiences & the City, free of hiding their art from regulation.
 
 
 
 Weeks before Oakland’s Ghost Ship Fire, we submitted a similar LA2050 application, provided an honorable mention by judges. Since then, we’ve been offering free consultations to DIY productions coming to us after compliance speedbumps. We also co-directed Bringing Back Broadway’s annual festival spearheading use of nontraditional spaces for 3 years, with 90k+ attendees. Now we’ve been invited to join LEIA (below) to form a permitting committee with governing bodies that regulate safety for artistic creation in LA.
 
 
 
 With them, this project institutes a catch-all website, a repository for regulatory measures & how to smoothly work through them. This resource is assembled by our experts, with a large survey of problems from local creators & solutions to those problems. It will be sent to various governing bodies for feedback, but will exist as a standalone asset for creators to explore. While it will not automatically send users directly to agency inboxes or applications (using up limited government resources for such consultation), it will provide creators with a checkbox & drop down menu system that bounces them out to informative pages on how to create compliant events & artworks. The resource will culminate with hyperlinks to application forms & office contact information, once they reach the point that agency outreach is appropriate.
 
 
 
 LA is the epicenter for artistic creation. Our mayor called it “the most creative city in the history of the world,” but its permitting process has been convoluted, & many large projects have been chopped off at the knees. The vast sprawl & diverse creative industry of our city allows for boundary pushing work, matching our city’s constant flux of neighborhood boundaries, & we have witnessed a group of artists eager to know what the city wants from them. At the moment, the largest projects that these creators produce are fleeing to cities that have less intimidating processes (recently, the massive “Tension” show’s move to Vegas), & it's time to regain LA’s place as the most vibrant, immersive region for artistic monetization",create,2018125,https://activation.la2050.org/create/think-tank-productions-inc-dba-think-tank-gallery/think-tank-productions-inc-dba-think-tank-gallery.jpg,https://youtu.be/msrLyYttTv8

 Los Angeles is America’s capital city for the homeless. Thousands of families with young and teenage children find themselves on the streets for a variety of reasons. Every family has a different story ranging from addiction to a fluctuating job market Partner all of that with an overpriced rental market that has little relation to the average earnings of many Angelenos and the combination of factors is a perfect storm for growing a large homeless population.



 The Community Circle Project has two key components: (1) a strong, volunteer outreach program and (2) developing relationships with supportive local housing authorities.



 By sharing 15 years of successful metrics from Topanga Women’s Circle (TWC) we will create a guide detailing aspects of our 100% volunteer organization. The guide will include storage, purchases, maintenance of a volunteer base, fundraising and strong communications with volunteers.



 Helping other city service group transform bare-bones, bridge housing into comfortable, welcoming homes for the homeless, a sense of pride is established for both the volunteer and the homeless client, often carrying forward as the client moves into their permanent housing. By being a part of every aspect of creating a welcoming home for these families, the volunteer develops a better understanding of the challenges the homeless population faces and can feel confident that their time spent setting up a home is appreciated beyond measure.



 We will cultivate a relationship with Los Angeles County’s supportive housing authorities and develop a comprehensive database of those groups in need of CCP’s services.



 A CCP goal is to create an environment of love and comfort with a focus on dignity and self-worth and all items provided are new or like new. CCP volunteers not only provide these building blocks to comfort but also decorate each apartment in order to welcome all families with dignity and love. Everything purchased is a straight donation to the families as they move forward from bridge to permanent housing.

The exhibit will also be free to all and a shortened experience will be available online.
 
 
 
 3) Guests at the exhibit can share their experiences via social media, using the hashtag #51percentLA, which will be collated on a dedicated website for the exhibit. Additionally, citizens can visit the website and add their own experiences, photos, stories and strategies to make LA a better place for all women.

The B-RESILIENT texting intervention was born out of community and patient partners’ requests to increase the availability of coping resources used in Building Resiliency in Communities for Health (B-RICH)--a manualized, 7-week class led by lay health workers to introduce CBT concepts--that emerged as a key innovation in Community Partners in Care (CPIC). Consistent with tracking and building on community input and engagement in interventions, the present study uses the same community engagement approach to expand access and availability to core coping and symptom self-management resources as well as information on and encouragement to receive needed services, through a mobile platform (Chorus). Our B-RESILIENT intervention introduces and reinforces principles of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) in order to support personal resiliency and reduce the risk for and impact of depressive symptoms and promote symptom self-management in response to multiple stressors in under-resourced communities of color.

As a result, he was able to get a full-time job in the education field and was no longer homeless.
 
 
 
 What a great impact!
 
 
 
 By giving those who are experiencing homelessness in L.A. the ability to see well, we give them the opportunity to start to live well. MCP and UMEC services go where individuals live and work, which improves access to our free care. In fact, 81.3% of clients report that the UMEC-MCP Night Clinic improved their access to other healthcare resources in L.A. In addition, UMEC provides educational packets to give patients more information about their eye conditions and available resources they can utilize. We have found that 69% of patients we examine have a treatable eye condition and that over 90% of them need eyeglasses. Those 69% were treated for refractive error, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, pinguecula, pterygium, and cataracts and were provided access to ophthalmic care at UCLA Olive View and Harbor County hospitals which alleviates strain on emergency rooms. An estimated 18 billion dollars could be saved annually if “non-urgent” clinical problems such as correcting refractive error with glasses were treated outside of the emergency room through programs like the UMEC-MCP Night Clinic.
 
 
 
 Satisfaction in our services is as high as 86.9% of clients that prefer our clinic to other free clinics in the L.A. area and 89.6% that prefer the Night Clinic to a hospital emergency department for non-emergency care. Thus, our services have an incredible impact on the quality of life for those experiencing homelessness in L.A.
 
 
 
 In addition, our services will improve the understanding of the demographics and eye health problems of L.A.’s homeless populations, as knowledge of these is scarce. The last study addressing ocular disorders among the homeless in L.A. was published decades ago in 1990. Not only will our findings improve our clinics, but it may also guide future organizations to address the vision health needs of the L.A. homeless population. We share LA2050’s goal to ensure that 100 percent of L.A. residents have access to affordable healthcare services, including vision care.
 
 
 
 This project also engages Angelenos to understand the health care equality issues in their communities and help people experiencing homelessness in L.A. To engage more Angelenos, we will advertise our free eye care to undertreated patients who visit MCP’s multiple clinic sites and use the Night Clinic’s services. In one study (in Hawaii), 49% of the homeless did not know where to go to seek eye care and 68% did not know where to go to obtain eyeglasses. By reaching out to the homeless in the areas we serve, we can reduce these statistics and offer our health services to more people.",connect,2018130,https://activation.la2050.org/live/ucla-mobile-eye-clinic-umec/ucla-mobile-eye-clinic-umec.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX7-agoIc2M

But while 84% of the county’s eligible voters are registered, turnout in the city’s municipal elections is notoriously low, resulting in measures getting passed with fewer than 200,000 votes in a city with a population of almost four million.
 
 
 
 Democracy grants power to individuals. It affords every American the opportunity to be heard and to hold elected officials accountable. But democracy only has power when it’s active. Many Americans, particularly those Americans who have historically been ignored or marginalized, are disengaged from the political process, their power to improve their lives and their communities untapped. UPAS seeks to address the glaring inequity apparent in the city’s civic life and engagement.
 
 
 
 Too often, grassroots advocacy groups approach organizing as a part-time or volunteer endeavour; built on a belief that if you can get enough people out onto the streets then things will change. But that’s not how power transitions. Organizing individuals with little personal history of civic engagement is a full-time job that requires professional experience and knowledge of the formal skills necessary to mobilize diverse groups of people around a common cause. It then requires that those same professionals relinquish their own power, step aside, and allow the individual to take the reins and lead. 
 
 
 
 United Parents and Students (UPAS) fundamentally believes that in order to secure long-lasting community progress and revitalization, community organizing must be recognized as a profession requiring vital and identifiable knowledge and strategic skills. UPAS uses a training model successfully used by the Industrial Areas Foundation since the 1970s, built on the iron rule of organizing: “Never do for others what they can do for themselves.” Nowhere is this mindset more important than in activism; UPAS organizers ground training on an understanding that systemic change must be pursued by the community itself rather than through the efforts of others.
 
 
 
 UPAS builds the capacity of grassroots coalitions by fostering vibrant community hubs in many of Los Angeles’s traditionally politically silent neighborhoods. In these hubs, individuals identify the root causes and socio-political context of the challenges they face, persuasively communicate on a wide range of issues, and organize friends and neighbors to take collaborative action. Schools are a natural partner for such work; they are multi-generational centers of learning with a built-in, responsive audience of families acutely aware of community challenges. UPAS is a 501(c)(3) non-profit that partners with existing organizations to leverage their communities to civic action.",connect,2018131,https://activation.la2050.org/connect/united-parents-and-students/united-parents-and-students.jpg,https://vimeo.com/205438757
8102132,2018,"EVERYONE IN: Preventing 30,000 Angelenos from Becoming Homeless","“EVERYONE IN: Preventing Homelessness” will help 30,000 people avoid homelessness by creating affordable housing & helping Angelenos keep their homes",,,,,"[""Housing affordability"",""Rates of homelessness""]","While we have proven we know how to end homelessness through permanent housing and services, we haven’t made a significant impact on the flow of people into homelessness. By some estimates, monthly in LA County more than 10,000 people fall into homelessness but less than 20% ends their homelessness. 
 
 
 
 We will activate 100,000 Angelenos to advance short-term prevention- the need to make sure vulnerable residents stay housed- and longer-term prevention that increases the supply of housing to make more housing affordable to low-income Angelenos. We will inform and mobilize residents to:
 
 
 
 UNDERSTAND THAT OUR HOMELESSNESS CRISIS IS A HOUSING CRISIS. According to recent focus group research, most people don't understand that the cost of housing is the number one driver of our homelessness crisis. People especially don't understand that if we make housing more affordable, we can solve homelessness for most people. In fact, 2/3 of homeless people don’t need supportive housing, they just need housing they can afford. Lifting this issue up will be a core focus of this partnership.
 
 
 
 SUPPORT TENANTS AT RISK OF EVICTION TO STAY IN THEIR CURRENT HOMES. Historically low vacancy rates have created an environment where landlords often force families out of their homes, by legal and illegal means, so they can rent to higher income tenants. Displaced families must quickly find replacement housing or risk becoming homeless. But without enough affordable housing, and with an eviction on their record, it is an uphill battle. 
 
 
 
 Inner City Law Center established a pilot program for keeping families in their homes. Lawyers help tenants resolve differences with landlords, and if necessary, fight evictions. In addition, short-term rent subsidies are available to keep tenants current on rent. Social workers help tenants resolve underlying issues that have placed them at risk. We will spread the word about these programs and advocate for doing more.
 
 
 
 But the work these programs can do is limited by existing legal frameworks that make it too easy to put tenants on the street. We will activate Angelenos to support meaningful tenant rights reforms. For instance, more cities in LA County could pass rules for just-cause evictions, meaning families can only be evicted if they violate the lease. 
 
 
 
 SAY YES TO MORE HOMES AND BETTER RULES. Building more housing that is affordable is critical to helping people avoid homelessness. We will activate Angelenos to support new housing in their communities. Elected officials who decide whether to approve new homes are very attuned to input from local residents. People who turn out for hearings on these projects have traditionally been opposed to new housing, often when it's for lower income and homeless people. Supportive messages and in-person testimony from residents who believe we need to address LA’s homelessness and housing crisis can make a huge difference in allowing more homes of all types to be permitted and built.",connect,2018132,https://activation.la2050.org/live/united-way-of-greater-los-angeles/united-way-of-greater-los-angeles.jpg,https://youtu.be/omjbiTiHXxU
8102133,2018,Leveraging Neighborhood Data to Activate Local Change,"Neighborhood Data for Social Change empowers civic actors to learn about trends, challenges, and opportunities facing LA County neighborhoods through maps, charts, data analysis, and storytelling.",,,,,"[""Travel time to work"",""Number of public transit riders"",""Participation in neighborhood councils""]","LA County is home to 10 million people with unique stories and circumstances, each of whom strives to make their communities the very best version of what they can be. Neighborhood Data for Social Change (NDSC) will make LA the best place to connect by equipping civic actors with information needed to contribute meaningfully in civic processes. 
 
 
 
 NDSC serves neighborhoods throughout LA County with high-quality and policy relevant data at the neighborhood level. It enables local nonprofits, government agencies, neighborhood councils, advocacy groups, and civic institutions to make data-informed decisions to improve the quality of life within their neighborhood. NDSC directly impacts the LA2050 metrics that help measure and support efforts to make LA the best place to Connect. In fact, multiple metrics for the Connect goal exist as distinct indicators within the platform, including: travel time to work, number of public transit riders, social connectedness, and voter registration. NDSC allows users to understand, measure, and track these indicators across the entire County, or by specific neighborhoods. Data can be viewed down to the census tract level, making NDSC a powerful tool to understand how connectedness varies across different neighborhoods. Users can even create their own custom neighborhoods by joining census tracts and tracking aggregated data.
 
 
 
 However, NDSC is not only about producing data. The platform empowers civic actors to better tell their stories, voice their opinions, and influence key decision-makers through the production of bi-weekly data stories produced in partnership with community based organizations and published by NDSC’s official media partner, KCETLink. Data stories incorporate maps, visualizations, photos, and rich narrative that highlight trends, opportunities, and challenges facing communities in the LA region. These data stories offer a powerful vehicle to advance additional Connect metrics, offering a platform to advocate for a number of key policies and investments that will make Los Angeles the most civically engaged region in the U.S. by 2050. 
 
 
 
 Lastly, NDSC activates Angelenos to make LA the best place to CONNECT through its ongoing series of community trainings, which are held monthly at USC and in the community. NDSC has launched a partnership with the Department of Neighborhood Empowerment, which supports the City’s 97 neighborhood councils in promoting public participation in government and improving government responsiveness to local concerns. Together, NDSC and Empower LA provide ongoing community workshops to train Angelenos on how to use data to activate change within their neighborhood. This partnership directly supports participation in neighborhood councils — a specific metric within the Connect goal. 
 
 
 
 Through these activities, NDSC helps the region work to become a place where every resident has the opportunity to engage, interact, and contribute to the region’s civic vitality.",connect,2018133,https://activation.la2050.org/connect/university-of-southern-california/university-of-southern-california.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iKW4H-17BA

With relatively low voter turnout and a city council that is 77 percent men, LA is an ideal location to connect and engage through civic participation and women's leadership training. VoteRunLead would be honored to help residents connect through our tried-and-true strategies: 
 
 - In-Person Trainings and Engagements. Our signature training, called ""Run As You Are,"" is a six-point curriculum covering key ways for women to develop and execute their public leadership skills, including 1) Confidence & Qualifications; 2) Campaigns & Elections; 3) Government & Civic Literacy; 4) Practice & Feedback Cycles; 5) People & Networks; and 6) Reputation & Impact. Evaluations of these award-winning trainings show that women emerge with greater knowledge and confidence, committed to the path to lead. 
 
 - Digital organizing and activism. VoteRunLead's online trainings and workshops provide an opportunity for leaders to learn from anywhere, on their own schedules. In 2017, 6500+ views of our curriculum demonstrate that women are willing to partake in online experiences, and our social media network of nearly 20,000 individuals is active, engaged, and supportive. 
 
 - Increasing participation in political processes. VoteRunLead targets women to run for office between now and 2020; specifically, those who are underrepresented: women of color, younger women, women with lower incomes -- and they are eager to lead. Our data shows that our trainings are effective: In November 2017 elections, we had 49 women on the ballots across the country (a similar organization, 6x the size of VoteRunLead, had 55 women running). Nearly 70% of our candidates won their elections, including 70% of *first-time* candidates (statistics show that usually, first-timers win 10% of the time) and 39% were women of color. And, even if trainees don't run, they vote. 
 
 - Advocating for policy. Studies show women are more likely than men to pass a bill and work in a bipartisan manner. Our alumnae pass pay equity bills, bring long-ignored issues to the fore, and advocate for vulnerable populations. Nonpartisan VoteRunLead welcomes women of all backgrounds and beliefs, speaking to all parties and millennials who often claim no party affiliation.
 
 - VoteRunLead creates new tools and technologies for greater civic/political engagement. As mentioned above, VoteRunLead has an engaged online community and aims to expand online tools. 
 
 - Influencing individual behavior. VoteRunLead's message of empowerment and collaboration impacts women not only on a systemic level, but also on an individual one, which opens new doors in their everyday lives. 
 
 
 
 Through this work, VoteRunLead will deliver specifically on the LA2050 metric to increase participation in neighborhood councils, training and propelling women into office to create a more responsive governance that addresses residents' needs.",live,2018134,https://activation.la2050.org/connect/voterunlead/voterunlead.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJlhdh9rWgs

 We propose three pillars of engagement and asks for your help to see them grow across the city!
 
 
 
 Engaging Young Professionals
 
 Creating Young Leaders Who Give Back
 
 Recruitment & Engagement Management
 
 
 
 We have long been the hub for young professionals to find a place to give back while connecting to a network of like-minded individuals. With the new FTK Social Club or our For The Kids Young and Young at heart professionals group that was recently formalized, we have created a community service platform in which these young volunteers can give of themselves and become a resource for other young professionals as well as the organization as a whole. Membership in FTK requires a minimum of 15 hours of volunteer service to WWS within the year and in exchange they receive networking events and speaker series aimed at the issues they care most about. They have their own governing board and create their own content and events! It is a unique formula that crosses all ages and creates a regular stream of volunteers for the organization. With this working model, we aim to replicate FTK in another part of the city.
 
 
 
 With so many youth that we are investing in long term, many of them find are looking for something that can help guide them into secondary education and civic engagement. WWS heard the call and created our Junior Mentors Program, Mentees ages 14 — 17 that are ready to begin their path towards volunteerism and leadership. This group also agrees to a certain amount of minimum volunteer hours at WWS’s Friendship Activities or Fundraisers and in return they receive curated content from Advisory Board, FTK and other resources as well as special opportunities and a chance at not only WWS’s Fred’ Future Young Leaders Scholarship but also other community scholarships within our Hub of resources.
 
 
 
 For the first time since our inception, Walk With Sally has hired a Volunteer Recruitment and Manager to specifically create the pathways to engagement for prospective volunteers through Walk With Sally. While the pathway to find our beneficiaries is predominantly and clearly 85% through our schools, the one to find the many mentors we need to fulfill the need in the city is not. Therefore, this person’s responsibilities include searching for opportunities to find and recruit not only WWS mentors but also WWS Ambassadors that can help WWS leverage growth much faster than we can relying solely on our own internal resources by attending Outreach events when a staff person cannot, or volunteering for one of our special events committees, or Friendship Activities where they are able to interact directly with our Mentees.
 
 
 
 And lastly, we will hire a 5th Program Coordinator to work remotely and along side our current Program Dept. in order to expand these as well as our mentoring program throughout DTLA, East LA, The Valley, Pasadena and beyond",live,2018135,https://activation.la2050.org/connect/walk-with-sally/walk-with-sally.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnfEE7Dx14g

They receive less than 3% of venture capital, 17% of angel investment, and 4% of commercial loans. Yet, women are starting businesses at 1.5 times the rate of men... even faster for women of color. Companies led by women, that have more women on their boards, or women as decision-makers outperform their competitors on EVERY measure of profitability...by 63%!



 We Are Enough's activation will create measures of cultural and global economic influence by changing women's mindsets. Women do not consider themselves investors and are passive with their investments BUT women control or influence 75% of consumer discretionary spending around the globe. After four sold-out and successful pilot events (which included surveys) in LA proved women were eager to learn how to activate their economic power, we concluded that we could reach all women in LA County. Where LA goes, so goes the country and the world... so it's the perfect place to launch and pilot our new global campaign.



 Why will this ""make LA the best place to create""? LA is the most economically unequal place in the country. Women reinvest more of their capital back into their communities than men... by 50% more. If we really want our region to be the best place to create, we need to remove the inequities. This is what women will do if they have more wealth and their businesses more financial support. Our campaign will build wealth for all women and teach our girls to do the same.",live,2018136,https://activation.la2050.org/create/we-are-enough-c-o-social-environmental-entrepreneurs/we-are-enough-c-o-social-environmental-entrepreneurs.jpg,https://youtu.be/hYxxWm_J0Yc

 According to a University of Southern California School of Social Work report, nearly 12,000 veterans return to Los Angeles every year, largely unprepared for civilian life. The study found that six in 10 post-9/11 veterans identified assistance needed for employment, education and Veterans Affairs benefits. LAVO can be a preventative measure ensuring veterans find the resources they need before it’s too late. 
 
 
 
 LAVO will host speakers and representatives who provide various resources for employment, education, VA benefits (medical), family services, housing, and more. 
 
 
 
 LAVO will provide an atmosphere of camaraderie and social interaction. Every veteran will have an opportunity to introduce themselves and there will be a social atmosphere for veterans to meet one another including veterans who are well connected to the veteran community in LA.

In the 90s, founder Kelvin Anderson opened up a small studio in the back of the store to keep kids out of gangs. From the back of the store careers such as Snoop Dogg, Warren G and Nate Dogg were launched after they recorded their first demo for their group 213.



 For 40 year, a sign called the VIP sign sat on top of the store and most recently that sign became a Historic Landmark, making the only one of its kind in the world but the sign has been put in storage until we secure a home to open a museum.



 This has been a major loss for Long beach and tourist from around the world to came to see the sign.



 In the meantime, to keep the brand alive and to help create economic opportunities, we have secured a building on long beach blvd. which we currently need assistance in activating



  The space is about 5000 sq feet and another 2000 in the back of open space.



 Our plan is to open a business incubator and multi media center , music recording radio station and retail store in the front.



 The goal is to incubate an foster careers in the area of technology, music, non profit sector, broadcasting, writing and provide a 24 hour radio station that will deliver content through all digital platforms and that will be hosted by radio personalities from across la county.



 The space has several rooms and this is what each room will offer members.



 1. tech room with computers and printer and copiers

 2. Radio station that will air 24 hours a day through all digital platforms

 3. music recording studio

 4. Outside event and workspace

 5. Conference Room

 6. Green Screen Room

 7. Workspace room couches, tables etc

 8. Resource office



 Center Design



 The center will engage artist to create murals all over the walls to reflect the vip history and we will also work to create digital experiences throughout the center.



 Outside Design



 A replica VIP sign, from snoop doggs, first video will anchor the building, as seen in the attached image.



 Although the sign is no longer that color, the replica represents the ara that the young artists got their start in the 90s and gives the center a unique draw.



 We will be working to also assist entrepreneurs with financing through programs like Kiva and a partnership with the City of Long Beach.



 Community Engagement



 On going music, small business and other creative contests will be launched from the center to engage the community and to continue to foster engagement.



 Our open space, will be made available to non profits in our communities for meeting and event space to allow them the ability to collaborate and serve the health and well being of our communities.

The World Harvest Dream Village is a place where you can have it all: Affordable housing, groceries and restaurants, healthcare on site, jobs and job training, a maker space and small business incubator, a credit union with microloans, free bikes and Wi-Fi, multigenerational housing, artists-in-residence, community gardens, participatory budgeting projects, and other elements of a healthy, thriving, authentic village community — located in the big city. 
 
 
 
 We are not reinventing any wheels. These elements all pre-exist. Our innovation is to bring them together with affordable housing, which is made possible by the passage of County Measure H and City Proposition HHH, which provide funds to build affordable housing. We’ll stretch these dollars by bringing in additional partners to fund the build. Activating Angelenos to help plan this project will raise awareness that there is a better way to live, that we can live our dreams, and that it’s up to us to build it for ourselves. We can do it!
 
 
 
 Food, housing, and healthcare are the top three metrics addressed by the proposed project. Over a third of households in Central L.A. experience food insecurity, and a sixth experience hunger — among the highest rates in L.A. County. A combination of rising rents, barriers to building affordable housing, and stagnant wages has resulted in a humanitarian crisis of homelessness and housing insecurity. L.A.’s poorest residents pay more than half of their income to stay housed. Universal access to healthcare remains out of reach. The proposed project addresses these issues through a replicable, modular Dream Village model.
 
 
 
 Operating almost entirely without grant funding for nearly ten years, World Harvest social supermarket has a proven capacity for managing complex projects. In addition to serving 50,000 clients annually on a self-sustaining budget, we provide many tons a week of high-quality diverted waste food on demand to clients like the L.A. Zoo and reentry transitional housing agencies. 
 
 
 
 With the award of LA2050 Activation Challenge funding, the World Harvest Dream Village will lead a two-year activation in collaboration with the city, the county, our neighborhood council, neighborhood residents, and future residents of our dream village. AltaMed will help plan the Dream Village health clinic design. ADX will help plan the maker space and small business incubator. Participation in the planning process will activate Angelenos around a vision for wholeness beyond mere housing. 
 
 
 
 Now is the time to make affordable dream villages a reality. The World Harvest Dream Village is more than a housing project; we’re building a community.

We will work in Pico-Union and Westlake, bringing the community together to choose five areas to turn into a “museum mile,” each featuring 2-4 murals. YPI’s Community Engagement Coordinator will work closely with local artists, including YPI’s partner Juan Reyes, to activate residents and work together towards designs that showcase community identity and resilience. We will distribute a community feedback form through local schools, YPI afterschool programs, and door-to-door canvassing to get widespread input. Reyes will use this input to make an initial design, which will be available for public review. Parents who are active on YPI’s Safe Routes to School Task Forces will be engaged to give input and activate their friends and family to participate in the mural process. Once a design is finalized, volunteers will work with Reyes at a community event to prepare the wall and paint the mural. The Museum Miles will activate community members at every stage of the process, offering volunteer opportunities and culminating in a large community cultural event in a public space.
 
 Nuestros Murales Unidos will also create a summer program for local students to participate in beautification. The program will be run by the Community Engagement Coordinator and held each weekday for an hour. Students will work with local businesses to talk about the appearance of their storefront, offering to repaint shabby exterior walls with simple designs or place decorated potted plants outside. The summer program will activate the next generation of community leaders, empowering students with a sense of responsibility to their community and the tools to take action. Parents and community members will be encouraged to help with designing and creating these smaller works.
 
 Throughout the process, we will work with community members and partner organizations to kick off a social media campaign using the artworks as a focal point for community pride. #MuralesUnidos and #OurMurals will give this project a unified online presence, and carry connections created through the design process online. Angelenos across the city will be connected to the art through Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, and encouraged to start similar projects in their own communities. By offering meaningful volunteer opportunities and cultural events in community spaces, YPI hopes to provide resources for these communities to come together and create something that truly represents them. The collaborative murals will serve as a visual representation of the community’s pride and resilience, as well as the power of collective action.
