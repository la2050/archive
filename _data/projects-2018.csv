8102001,8102001,Normalize Periods by Giving Back!,An art installation of the words PERIODS and #HAPPYPERIOD in numerous locations within L.A county made for the public to donate menstrual products for a homeless passer-by to freely take.,"A 25-foot art installation of the words PERIODS and #HAPPYPERIOD set in five locations within Los Angeles county. The letters will be made of ply-wood with bins built in back, to be covered in packages of period products. The public will be encouraged to take photos with the installation and donate their unwanted disposable or reusable products for a homeless passer-by to take for themselves or someone else in need. #HappyPeriod will be able to refurbish and collect donations for shelters. ","In a 2011 Feeding America survey, people of all income listed menstrual hygiene products as a basic essential or an item â€œthat cannot be forgone or easily substituted.â€ Yet homeless women have to find substitutions every month such as plastic bags, old rags, newspaper, socks, and tissue. In Los Angeles County, 57,794 people experienced homelessness on a given night in 2017. Of this number, over 17,000 are women and nearly 500 are transgender. The average homeless female in Los Angeles County is a woman of color and is of reproductive age. Most of these women and girls will menstruate each month, which is a natural part of the reproductive system, yet it remains taboo. As a result, the challenges of menstrual hygiene are heightened due to the socioeconomic status of these women. A 3 foot high, 25-foot art installation of the words PERIODS and #HAPPYPERIOD set in five locations within Los Angeles county. The letters will be made of recycled materials with bins built in the back of each letter. The front of the letters will to be filled with packages of period products. The back bins will be made to also be filled with donations. The public will be encouraged to take photos with the installation and donate their unwanted disposable or reusable products for a homeless passer-by to take for themselves or someone else in need. #HappyPeriod will be able to refurbish and collect donations for shelters. With this activation, an individual in need would have a new resource from which to obtain period products at any time. This activation will ideally be installed in five locations across Los Angeles in communities with a high walk score, for example Hollywood, Downtown, Mid-city, Venice, and Santa Monica.

","This activation will ideally be installed in five locations across Los Angeles in communities with a high walk score, for example Hollywood, Downtown, Mid-city, Venice, and Santa Monica. The goal is to present an interactive way of giving back and encourage digital activism. Artists can get involved with the project and tackle the unique challenge of having to incorporate a way for period products to be housed on the structure. The installation could be made using environmentally safe supplies, and recycled materials that are similar to ply-wood or better. Signage will also be required for informing the viewers about the installation. The signage will include #HappyPeriod's mission, a sign-up sheet for volunteering, a petition to remove the tampon tax in the state, statistics on homeless community in Los Angeles, and instructions on how to directly participate in the activation. From selfies to donating, it will be a straight forward opportunity for engagement. The public will be encouraged to use social media to spread awareness on the activation and cause. 
","Success of the activation will be defined by a number of key factors: 1) The number of products donated, 2) products that are taken by an homeless individual, 3) Analytics and insights, 4)Impressions on social media. Data science will be our biggest tool for measuring the impact of the activation. We will take a daily count of products donated and received, and this will be assisted with the help of volunteers. Since the public will be encouraged to use social media to spread awareness about the activation, hashtags will be key in measuring our success online. Hiring a data scientist or analyst will be definite in monitoring all of this victoriously.","After going global, I hope to turn my organization into a B corporation or social enterprise.

8102002,8102002,#HashtagLunchbag Feeds LA,"#HashtagLunchbag - through the power of social media and dedicated volunteers - will bring hope and meals to over 50,000 Angelenos, affirming that we can be the change we want to see in the world.",#HashtagLunchbag aspires to promote and affirm the notion that solutions to large scale problems are attainable even when a small group of people dedicate their time and resources to solve these issues. It is when hundreds of volunteers get together and connect to prepare meals and messages of hope to our most vulnerable communities.,"Since its launch nearly five years ago, #HashtagLunchbag takes advantage of the power of social media to to digitally organize Angelenos to come together and bring about meaningful change to the most vulnerable of our communities. What makes #HashtagLunchbag so unique, successful and incredibly popular is our belief that in person connections will yield greater results and greater overall impact. When nearly 200 volunteers come out each month to prepare, decorate, inspire, and serve meals to those in need, we not only feed the recipients of our lunch bags but also feed our souls by making a difference through our actions, through our volunteerism, and through  our belief that we can solve large and complex problems when we work together.
We work with our local business communities and leaders in a myriad of fields to bring awareness of the important work we perform. We provide businesses with a number of opportunities to engage in #HashtagLunchbag activations and encourage them to promote our efforts in alignment with their corporate social responsibilities. Such efforts are typically tied into two major elements:
Increase volunteerism within their business and local offices
Increase financial contributions in order to broaden and enhance our impact
Through our activations we provide deeply meaningful and moving opportunities for volunteers to tackle large scale challenges like food insecurity. 
One of the newest programs #HashtagLunchbag is poised to launch is a voter registration component to increase voter turnout and participation within our volunteer groups. We believe that civic engagement is directly tied to an informed citizenry that is crucial in bringing about change to large scale and complex programs within our city and communities.  
","We know that volunteering in your local community creates a deep sense of belonging. This sense allows individual members to create community and ultimately make Los Angeles a place they can call home. This sense of belonging also allows Angelenos to view difficult, complex, and large scale problems like food insecurity as something they would want to take ownership of. By volunteering their time to help combat poverty, hunger, and food insecurity, these volunteers will develop a much deeper level of love and satisfaction. Through both the internal and external changes in volunteers, we together will make Los Angeles the best place to live.
","Our activiations each carry targets and metrics both in meals prepared and served and the number of volunteers engaged with our efforts. We also work hard to retain volunteers by continuously improving the volunteer experience. Since our business community is a key stakeholder and partner in our efforts, we also set targets in the number of sponsorships and partnerships we develop and execute each year. We measure success if are actual figures are within 90% of our targets for our various metrics. 
","Key signature programs: Our organization strives to build on the success of our signature #HashtagLunchbag program and aims to add additional LA locations for activations throughout LA City and LA County to dramatically increase the number of meals served and communities provided for by 2023.
Awareness, Outreach, & Connecting Angelenos: Living Through Giving Foundation looks forward to enhance its current outreach and awareness strategies to increase the use of technology in order to deepen the engagement of Angelenos looking for ways to bring about change in their communities.

8102003,8102003,"Write the Future of LA: 100,000 Stories to Connect Volunteers","By sharing student writing with 100,000 Angelenos, Los Angeles will connect as 826LA volunteers or supporters to amplify and honor the voices of young people from underserved communities.","826LA will inspire Los Angeles residents to support local students through volunteering. 826LA will share student writing via a special-edition student-written newspaper, public readings, social media platforms, and a citywide celebration of our 15th anniversary, connecting students, families, volunteers, and educators. These steps will help 826LA grow its volunteer program, with a focus on recruiting diverse Angelenos to mentor local students.","826LA is part of an ecosystem of services that help young people break out of poverty, by helping students improve their grades, apply to college, and develop the skills and confidence to express themselves fully. 826LA was founded in 2005 to address the need for academic and literacy support for Los Angeles students. Since that time, 826LA has served more than 74,000 students. More than 240 public school teachers each year benefit from 826LAâ€™s support, and, in fiscal year 2017, over 1,230 trained, individual volunteers contributed over 21,000 hours of their time at 826LA. 

Since its founding, 826LA has enlisted evidence-based practices to give students the tools they need for academic success and positive self-regard. In the 2018 fiscal year, 826LA anticipates serving 9,365 students. By offering its services for free, 826LA presents a sustainable way to provide educational programs to students from underserved communities. We believe that creativity is key for young people to develop critical thinking skills. At 826LA, students are transported to a world where writing is a form of magic, their voices are celebrated, and anything is possible. 

826LAâ€™s work is only possible with the help of volunteers. 826LA focuses on providing consistent, individualized attention from community volunteers, and in many programs, offers multiple sessions per week. This kind of educational support, from caring adults outside young peopleâ€™s own families, has been shown to play a significant role in providing a number of developmental assets for students. A study by the Afterschool Alliance found that programs like 826LAâ€™s, which are â€œstaffed by community members, may be viewed by parents as more approachable than schools.â€ This accessibility â€œmakes [these programs] an ideal partner to help schools break down barriers between parents and schools and increase parental engagement.â€ Not only does this engagement help parents feel more connected to their community, but it can also embolden them to seek out sufficient social and emotional support in other aspects of their lives. 

To expand the reach of our programs and recruit more volunteers in our mission to reduce educational inequities, 826LA must connect with a wider and more diverse group of Angelenos. By connecting 100,000 people with the stories, essays, poems, and dreams of young Angelenos, along with a call to volunteer, 826LAâ€™s volunteer base will grow and diversify and the rate of volunteerism in the city will increase. Support from LA2050 will enable us to focus on access and increased distribution of the over 300 student-written books and newspapers 826LA publishes each year. 

The more often Angelenos hear our students speakâ€”in their own wordsâ€”about their hopes and challenges, the more often those same Angelenos will volunteer their time, donate funds, share stories with others, and advocate on behalf of LA students at the ballot box and beyond.","Stories are emotional connections that create community connectionsâ€”stories are what can bring Los Angeles together in service. With LA2050, 826LA will share student stories with 100,000 Angelenos to encourage residents to step up and volunteer.

Sharing student-written publications via libraries, community organizations, and local businesses will increase the number of 826LA volunteers. 826LA will recruit at least 1,000 new volunteers and will see at least 21,000 volunteer hours per year, with a 10% growth in volunteer hours over the two years of this grant. Through outreach and presentations, 826LAâ€™s families, educators, and college and corporate partners will see how volunteering can impact Los Angeles.

826LA will also run a compelling digital recruitment campaign, featuring informational webinars, interactive posts, and powerful storytelling. 826LA will discuss the importance of volunteering with the over 9,200 students it serves each year and will launch an initiative that fast-tracks teenagers enrolled in 826LA programs into becoming 826LA volunteers. This will connect 826LA students with their own community through volunteering and will set an example for the younger students whom theyâ€™ll mentor. 

Finally, to help activate 100,000 Angelenos and recruit volunteers, 826LA will turn its 15th anniversary in 2020 into a citywide, celebratory call to action through a special-edition student-written newspaper, to be distributed digitally and in print all around Los Angeles.","826LA uses a cloud-based platform to track volunteer attendance and retention. To ensure 826LA is recruiting a diverse group of volunteers, we analyze numbers of senior volunteers and volunteers of color. Student data is tracked with spreadsheets developed by 826 National, 826LAâ€™s umbrella organization. 826LA conducts pre- and post-program surveys with students, families, and teachers to assess the qualitative success of programs. 

To gain a more thorough understanding of its data reporting processes and results, 826LA analyzes big-picture volunteer trends. 826LAâ€™s annual volunteer survey, biannual roundtables, and post-program volunteer debriefs help staff members understand why people volunteer in programs, what training opportunities theyâ€™d like, and ways to improve the volunteer experience at 826LA.

826LA will track the engagement of Angelenos on social media, through zip code-based surveys, targeted Facebook ads, and reports from Constant Contact, an email subscription service. To assess the reach of Angelenos interacting with studentsâ€™ stories, 826LA will track the distribution of student-penned books and newspapers to local libraries, family shelters, and book festivals, including the Leimert Park Book Festival and the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books. Measurable goals include at least 1,000 volunteers attend volunteer orientations per year, and over two years, 826LA will increase the number of volunteers of color by 10% and the number of senior volunteers by 10%.","826LA is in the initial stages of developing its strategic plan for fiscal years 2019-2021. As a result of the LA2050 activation challenge, 826LA hopes to have an expanded pool of volunteers to support its programs. With more volunteers, 826LA will be able to serve more students, increase the one-to-one ratio in each program, and scale our programs. We have identified Writersâ€™ Rooms as the best option for expanding the depth and reach of programming while minimizing overhead costs. Volunteer recruitment is paramount to fully activating the Writersâ€™ Room model. 826LA hopes that with the 2,000 volunteers recruited, the organization can continue to grow by expanding its classroom/Writersâ€™ Room model into other high schools.

826LA doesnâ€™t just impact students; the adults who participate in the programs, either as volunteers, parents/guardians, or educators, all leave with a renewed connection to their city and to each other. Juventina, a parent of three students who have participated in 826LA programs for seven years, said, â€œThank you for the great job you are doing for our community. I'm so glad to find the right way to help my children to be great citizens. [826LA is] the inspiration of their life.â€ 

Renee, an 826LA volunteer for five years wrote, â€œThank you, 826LA, for being such a vibrant presence in the communities where you work. Thank you for being a place kids like to go to; thank you for doing, and not just talking; for bringing so many diverse people to one place, where we canâ€¦realize those diversities are our very strength. And, oh! How strong we are together.â€ With LA2050, 826LA will connect even more Angelenos with meaningful, effective volunteer opportunities, showing our city just how strong we are together.

This is done via a park prescription platform. Physicians provide prescriptions for their patients with nutrition & fitness barriers to participate in UCLA-Fitted fitness instruction, disease specific Grocery Store Tours, and Growing Grit, a gardening and mindfulness workshop. The programs are lead by youth from corresponding communities.","A Healthier Community Starts with YOUth (HCSY) will make LA the best place to live because, it directly address health disparities faced by residents of South Los Angeles. HCSY is a public health education and career pipeline program exposing youth to a culture of upstream preventative thinking. The program model provides an opportunity for students to receive mentorship and experience within the public health field as they build and conduct community health programming with professionals. Students and professionals will be collaborating on three programs focused on improving skills around nutrition, fitness and mindfulness. 
Participants of these youth led programs are patients that have been identified by their primary care physician as having barriers to nutrition and fitness. These patients receive a written prescription from their physicians that we call park prescriptions. A patient participating in the park prescription program will partake in a 10-week program that provides personalized fitness instruction, nutrition education via grocery store tours and a gardening and mindfulness workshop.  
Undergraduate students leading the workshops will receive mentorship and public health career exposure from graduate students as well as professionals in the field. Undergraduate students will in-turn mentor high school students and expose them to the paths of higher education. 
The final phase of the program will include a train-the-trainer component for representatives of Community Based Organizations to conduct this programming in their own communities, spreading and sharing the effectiveness of this program to communities beyond.
","HCSY vision is to make a healthy lifestyle possible for all Angelenos by translating the best practices known in the science of public health demonstrated by youth and adults in their communities. HCSY will realize this vision by collaborating with physicians as well as public health and community professionals to mentor and teach youth. Youth-led public health programming will be deployed via park prescriptions. Park prescriptions are an evidence based strategy that encourages patients to use parks and open spaces for the purpose of improving their health. Success stories in Washington DC, San Francisco and Tuscon have shown to have physical, mental and even social health benefits. HCSY is collaborating with MLK Outpatient center, UCLA Fitted Fitness Program and Netiya Gardens to train students to conduct 10-week nutrition and fitness workshops. The Program is supported by UCLA Clinical Translational Science Institute-Community Engagement Research Program (CTSI-CERP) which will manage the programs evaluation process.  ","UCLA CTSI-CERP will manage the programs evaluation process. Measurement tools include a community based needs assessment, a pre and post patient reported outcomes survey (PROS), and pre and post health screenings (reported from the participants primary care physicians).

AIMS:
-       Improve the health outcomes of patients suffering from or at high risk for metabolic diseases specifically (obesity; diabetes; heart disease; and hypertension). 
-	Provide exposure to hands on fitness and nutrition education via physician referred park prescriptions.
-	Expose youth to public health practices
Measurable Objectives:
-	80% of participants report increase in produce consumption

These powerful speeches have lasting, transformative impacts on classrooms, schools, and communities.
 
Our activation is focused on amplifying these student speeches, a call-to-action, to inform and inspire Angelenos to participate in local neighborhood councils and vote in 2018, 2019, and 2020.","Youth Voice 2020 is a joint initiative between Action Civic LA and ProCon.org. We will give Angelenos an easy way to encourage, motivate and facilitate youth activism in Los Angeles county, inspiring them to take action in their communities, participate in local government, and vote on local issues, making LA the best place to connect.
 
By training Los Angeles teachers and students to translate their passion into action, highlighting the civic action of youth, and connecting youth to local government, we will show Angelenos how to be active in their communities. Youth Voice 2020 will increase the percentage of young people who are registered to vote; regularly volunteer; and involved in local government. Our focus on action will also increase government responsiveness to local issues. Our ability to amplify youth voices through public events and websites will increase adult participation in local issues, voting rates, volunteerism.
 
Youth Voice 2020 has 3 components:
1.Youth training
Teachers work with Action Civics LA to engage their students to identify the most pressing issues in their communities and take action to address these issues. Students learn how to SPEAK OUT, ADVOCATE for change, COLLABORATE with peers and community organizations, RESEARCH issues, DEVELOP action plans to affect change, and SHOWCASE their year-long activism efforts.
 
Past projects include:
Â·South Central HS students advocated for the rights of undocumented immigrants and DREAMers in their school and community bringing in the assistance of immigration lawyers and representatives from Congresswoman Karen Bassâ€™ office; Hancock Park Elementary students researched homelessness rates in their neighborhood and presented their findings to Councilmember Ryu in City Hall; Boyle Heights 9th graders started a school-wide â€œUnplug Mondayâ€ during free periods where students detach from all electronics and focus on interpersonal connections and mental health care.  
2. Public events:
Â·2 showcase events where students will present their Action Civics projects and receive feedback from community leaders.
Â·6-8 large open community events hosted by Pro/Con where local issues are debated (proposed locations include the Santa Monica Pier, USC, and others). Student projects will be featured and event participants will be asked to take action to support them. 
3. Digital amplification and action:
We will highlight select student speeches and projects on the ProCon.org website for the 500,000 annual users from Los Angeles. We will focus on the following four areas: Water and the environment; Community and School safety; Civic Participation; and Education.
 
The projects will be linked to pro and con research on these issues on ProCon.org, a website use by 25 million people per year, including more than 500,000 Angelenos. Web visitors will be able to view the projects, replicate them in their own neighborhood, contact their local representatives, and share with their own social networks.
","Using in-class instruction, city-wide events, teacher trainings, and school partnerships, in 2 years 7,000 students from over 20 different LA schools will be trained in identifying issues and turning them into action. Our current partner schools reach wide across LA county, from South Gate to West LA, from the San Fernando Valley to Downtown LA.  
 
From our group of student projects, Action Civics LA teachers and partner organizations will select student projects that inspire, educate, and inform in four areas: Water and the environment; Community and School safety; Civic Participation; and Education.
 
These projects will be featured on procon.org. Based on existing traffic on procon.org, we estimate that over 50,000 Angelenos will visit these pages and take action to support student work whether it is reading about an issue, sending the issue pages to their neighborhood council, replicating the project in their own neighborhood, or by contacting their local representative.  
 
Finally, over an additional 50,000 people from Los Angeles County will be exposed to issues and youth voice at six county-wide public events featuring youth voice on civic issues. After these events, participants will have greater understanding of issues, be able to connect with and support youth leaders, and be ready to take action.
","Activation is measured in the following ways:
 
Student participation: 7,000 students in 2 years will participate in Action Civics LA in-class programs where they develop their issues and projects. We will measure student learning throughout, measuring increases in ability to debate, do research, analyze issues, and developing strategic plans. Additionally, we plan to track alumni of the program via surveys.
 
Public participation though events: Through our public events across the county, we will measure event attendance and exposure to youth issues. We will also measure adoption of student calls to action.
 
Digital participation: Once students have developed their issues we will measure dissemination of their ideas and passion via visits to web pages and clickthroughs on various actions including contacting their neighborhood council, contacting their representatives, and downloading information to replicate the project in their own neighborhood. We estimate that 10% of the Los Angeles traffic to ProCon.org will view these student pages, representing 4,000 actions per month or 50,000 people per year.","We hope that in 5 years, Action Civics LA will grow to working with 15,000 students annually across the city and to launch statewide training for educators. We hope to have continued our partnership with ProCon.org so that together we are a resource for educators across the country.","[""Attendance at public/open streets gatherings"",""Participation in neighborhood councils"",""Voting rates""]","Youth Voice 2020 is a joint initiative between Action Civic LA and ProCon.org. We will give Angelenos an easy way to encourage, motivate and facilitate youth activism in Los Angeles county, inspiring them to take action in their communities, participate in local government, and vote on local issues, making LA the best place to connect.
 
  
 
 By training Los Angeles teachers and students to translate their passion into action, highlighting the civic action of youth, and connecting youth to local government, we will show Angelenos how to be active in their communities. Youth Voice 2020 will increase the percentage of young people who are registered to vote; regularly volunteer; and involved in local government. Our focus on action will also increase government responsiveness to local issues. Our ability to amplify youth voices through public events and websites will increase adult participation in local issues, voting rates, volunteerism.
 
  
 
 Youth Voice 2020 has 3 components:
 
 1.Youth training
 
 Teachers work with Action Civics LA to engage their students to identify the most pressing issues in their communities and take action to address these issues. Students learn how to SPEAK OUT, ADVOCATE for change, COLLABORATE with peers and community organizations, RESEARCH issues, DEVELOP action plans to affect change, and SHOWCASE their year-long activism efforts.
 
  
 
 Past projects include:
 
 * South Central HS students advocated for the rights of undocumented immigrants and DREAMers in their school and community bringing in the assistance of immigration lawyers and representatives from Congresswoman Karen Bass’ office; Hancock Park Elementary students researched homelessness rates in their neighborhood and presented their findings to Councilmember Ryu in City Hall; Boyle Heights 9th graders started a school-wide “Unplug Monday” during free periods where students detach from all electronics and focus on interpersonal connections and mental health care. 
 
 2. Public events:
 
 * 2 showcase events where students will present their Action Civics projects and receive feedback from community leaders.
 
 * 6-8 large open community events hosted by Pro/Con where local issues are debated (proposed locations include the Santa Monica Pier, USC, and others). Student projects will be featured and event participants will be asked to take action to support them. 
 
 3. Digital amplification and action:
 
 We will highlight select student speeches and projects on the ProCon.org website for the 500,000 annual users from Los Angeles. We will focus on the following four areas: Water and the environment; Community and School safety; Civic Participation; and Education.
 
  
 
 The projects will be linked to pro and con research on these issues on ProCon.org, a website use by 25 million people per year, including more than 500,000 Angelenos. Web visitors will be able to view the projects, replicate them in their own neighborhood, contact their local representatives, and share with their own social networks.",Connect,2018005,https://activation.la2050.org/connect/action-civics-la-an-initiative-of-mikva-challenge/action-civics-la-an-initiative-of-mikva-challenge.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRyOMoxgsbE,8102005

","After serving a homeless family in our inaugural summer we were introduced to the growing crisis that affects 63,000 Los Angeles youth. A new partnership with School on Wheels and Shields for Families Inc. is the perfect merge to have targeted academic and social intervention that mitigates traumas and supports youth affected by homelessness. This activation will secure our traditional summer camp and initiate our Jr. Counselor program to provide service opportunities for 9th-12th graders.

8102007,8102007,Mentoring College Success with Big Brothers Big Sisters of Greater LA,"Big Brothers Big Sisters of LAâ€™s College P.A.C. Program  (Preparation, Access, Completion) provides underserved youth with mentoring support to finish high school, graduate college, and start careers.","We are proposing an expansion of our College Preparation, Access, Completion (PAC) program to provide all our youth mentees with an umbrella of resources and support to promote success at not only gaining entry to college, but in developing the knowledge, skills, and dispositions to both graduate and start careers. This activation will also enable us to expand our collaborations with other organizations to share resources and best practices on college success to greatly magnify our impact.","We live in an increasingly segregated Los Angeles where youth of color are not benefitting from the advantages of our growing economy. Measure of Americaâ€™s â€œPortrait of Los Angelesâ€ estimated that life expectancy would increase by 1.5 years, murder rates would fall by 9%, and the voting rate would increase by 10% if every Angeleno graduated from high school. LA is now a majority Latino community- yet more than three in ten young Latino immigrants arenâ€™t enrolled in school of any kind. 

Our College PAC program launched as a pilot in the Fall of 2016 with a focus on 150 Juniors and Seniors in high school and 55 first year college students. Our pilot was particularly directed at first generation college bound youth of color, including many undocumented students. The core of the pilot program provides professionally supported mentorships to assist students with graduating high school, applying for college, and in persisting through the first year of postsecondary education. By facilitating a positive relationship that provides social, emotional, and academic support for youth, we can help them overcome the significant barriers holding them back from a college success. 

For high school students preparing to attend college, the College PAC program team also provides supplementary workshops and materials to address common gaps in knowledge and skills of underserved youth, their families, and mentors. The College PAC program produced extremely promising results: 100% of the Littles receiving support from the program graduated high school and matriculated to a 2 or 4 year college and 100% of the mentees enrolled in college persisted through their first year of school. College PAC students in high school also improved their SAT scores by 119 points on average. In partnership with the LA Mayorâ€™s Office, starting in 2018 all college youth in the program will also be eligible for paid internships at major entertainment corporations in fields such as tech, business development, and production as part of Mayor Eric Garcettiâ€™s efforts to diversify the industry. 

With a LA2050 partnership, we will have the staff resources to support college and career preparation and training for one-to-one mentoring of youth as early as 2nd grade that continues through college completion. This will directly impact 6000+ youth/mentors/families in our programs. Our current College PAC Coordinator will focus on developing the curriculum to support all mentors, mentees, and families. She will also focus on building upon our partnerships with the Mayorâ€™s Office and the California Community Foundationâ€™s Young Men of Color (YMOC) Initiative to share our resources and promote mentorship as a crucial component of college and career prep across the region.
","BBBSLA serves 1800 youth ages 6-22 throughout LA County. 95% of the children or youth impacted by our programs are youth of color. Approximately 70% served by our programs live under the federal poverty line and 80% live in households earning less than a living wage for LA County.
Our activation engages youth, their families, and their mentors with the professional support of our staff to directly provide college and career resources and training yearly to over 6,000 Angelenos.  In addition, the network of organizations and corporations with whom we collaborate to activate change play a crucial role in our success. Local partners include Comcast NBCUniversal, Sony, Paramount, Union Bank, the Mayorâ€™s Office, California Community Foundation, and others. Our partners provide the access to amazing mentors, college and career prep, and the opportunity to share best practices across the region. For example, our College PAC newsletter is already a monthly resource we share with other non-profits and can reach well over 100,000 youth and community stakeholders through our current collaborators. 
","BBBSLA already tracks high school graduation, college matriculation, and college persistence rates for all the youth in College PAC. As part of our new partnership to provide paid internship opportunities to the youth in our programs, we will also be tracking placement and employment outcomes. 

To refine and improve our College PAC efforts, program evaluation is ongoing through our Progress Tracking System. The Progress Tracking System tracks quantitative and qualitative data from BBBSLAâ€™s proprietary Agency Management System (collected quarterly), QuestionPro surveys and reports (collected bi-annually), SAT score data, and CALynx, a service provided by the California Futures Foundation to track college outcomes (collected annually). BBBSLA looks at all data collectively on an annual basis as part of developing its Annual Report. Evaluation is conducted by BBBSLAâ€™s Grants Manager, Keith Mataya, and Yvette Sanchez, the College PAC Coordinator. Findings include evaluation of mentoring match success, college success indicators (knowledge of the college process, financial aid literacy, and college experience), standardized test prep scores, and college continuation rates.
","In five years, we hope this activation not only dramatically improves the educational outcomes of all of our mentees, but that our efforts continue to assist other organizations working on college success in Los Angeles. We also are leading efforts with other Big Brothers Big Sisters affiliates around the country to expand mentoring to support college age youth. 
No single institution or organization in Los Angeles can make significant progress on improving key education metrics on its own. We have already worked diligently to partner with others to magnify our impact. Support from LA2050 will provide us with the opportunity to grow our capacity and share our successes and resources with other organizations.  Over the next five years, we believe the lessons we have learned, and continue to learn, can play a crucial role in the work with our partners on moving the needle on education outcomes for all youth in our community.

8102008,8102008,Invest in Youth Coalition: Advocating for a Los Angeles that prioritizes young people ,"We demand an equitable strategy and coordinated approach to comprehensive youth development, led by a city department focused on creating prosperity for all of LAâ€™s young people.","The Invest in Youth Coalition will activate 100,000 Angelenos to advocate for our cityâ€™s young people, urging policymakers to prioritize youth outcomes by funding a Youth Development Department. This work includes getting approval to establish a task force, an initial investment from the city, with representation of community members and youth development practitioners on task force. All this leads to the creation of a blueprint for an equitable youth development strategy.","Over 800,000 youth between 10 to 24 years of age live in the City of Los Angeles. A majority of this population, 81% are youth of color, and creating opportunities for this population will help them reach their full potential and make the City more prepared for the future. 

Opportunities for youth to engage as decision-makers and community leaders becomes a driving force in their likelihood of being publicly engaged and creates a life-long dedication to the wellbeing of their neighborhoods. Youth who have limited opportunities are at higher risk of developing personal, social, and behavioral problems. Youth who have access to civic engagement, educational opportunities, vocational programs, and health services have higher rates of psychological and emotional stability, positive self-esteem, and greater risk management capacities. Access to these programs and services makes it less likely for young people to engage in unhealthy behaviors such as smoking, alcohol and substance abuse, crime and violence, and unsafe sex. Positive youth development has also been found to have a positive relationship to life satisfaction.

An emphasis on preventing risky behaviors, preparation for the workforce, after school services, and raising academic achievement are all increasing the demand for youth programs. Los Angeles faces significant challenges in this area since policymakers have not adequately funded and successfully coordinated effective services. In fact, LA is only spending $75 per youth, while San Francisco and New York are spending $1,909 and $541 apiece on their young people. The Cityâ€™s current youth development effort is a piecemeal approach with multiple agencies managing various programs. We believe is it critical that one coordinating body be responsible for identifying strategies that increase positive outcomes and opportunities for young people.

Our activation will make LA the best place to live by demanding a greater investment in our cityâ€™s youth. This investment supports the healthy development of young people across various sectors, such as leadership development and workforce training, recognizes youth of color as one of our greatest assets in an increasingly globalized economy, and is a critical component of citywide efforts to combat poverty, reduce violence, and decrease homelessness.

The City of Los Angeles should recognize how critical young people are to its economy, culture, and civic discourse â€“ both today and in the future. Nonetheless, the City minimally invests in programs that benefit youth. The future of our City depends on the next generation of young Angelenos becoming ready for the transition into the workforce and/or higher education. It is time to ensure that all youth have access to high-quality programsâ€”no matter where they liveâ€”with public investment to support a Youth Development Department.

","We will engage nonprofits, community leaders, educators, parents, and youth to support this work in the following ways:

- Convening at community meetings and rallies
- Petition support
- Social media support
- Youth leadership committees that engage peers at school and within neighborhoods
- Direct actions, contacting local and government leaders via phone, email, text, and in-person

This is a city-wide activation with emphasis on where there is a high need and disproportionate investment in positive youth development opportunities and services. In addition to the five organizations collaborating on this activation, the Invest in Youth Coalition is already engaging 24 organizations in these areas.

The choice confronting City leadership is to finally recognize the importance of youth development. We are advocating for a strategic, adequately funded plan to promote youth development. We expect to get citywide support for our efforts -- and our partners will continue to be strong advocates â€“ but we need more city residents to help us urge the City Council and Mayor to prioritize youth development moving forward.","Immediate success would include the following:

- The City should begin the process of creating a Youth Development Department by first establishing an independent commission that could provide lead thinking and relationship building that could eventually turn into a department.
- The Youth Development Commission should consist of community leaders, resident advocates, and youth themselves and would serve as the focal point within the City to review policies and coordinate funding for youth programs.
- An immediate down payment for current youth programs in the FY 2018-19 budget would play a key role in kick starting the conversation in City Hall. It will send a message of long-term strategy, accountability, and ownership.

The end goals of our activation include the following:

- Formalized Strategy for Youth Development
- Consolidation of Existing Programs
- Interagency Coordination
- Coordination of Local Government Partners
- Finalized Plan for Funding

To ensure success we will track the following:

- Number of organizational partners
- Geographic spread of partners
- Number of meetings, rallies, actions hosted
- Number of participants at in-person events
- Number of petition signers
- Number of social media followers

",A multimedia â€œZombie Apocalypseâ€ campaign to raise awareness and advance meaningful systemic change about the impact of climate justice on communities of color.,Black Women for Wellness (BWW) and the California League of Conservation Voters Education Fund (CLCVEF) will design a multimedia â€œZombie Apocalypseâ€ campaign to raise awareness and advance meaningful systems change around the impacts of global warming in communities of color. The campaign will use a fictional dystopian future to illustrate the impacts of inaction on climate justice policy as well as solutions that can be implemented to create sustainable communities. ,"Climate change is worsening air pollution by altering regional weather patterns and impacting the location of pollutants, quantity of pollutants (such as ozone, NOx, VOCs), and formation of smog. The physical geography of California plays a large role in the rising smog levels. Increasing temperatures and higher quantities of pollutants combined with wind patterns and physical barriers such as mountains result in areas with high quantities of trapped air pollutants. One clear example of this is the city of Los Angeles which is surrounded by the San Gabriel and San Bernardino mountains. Los Angeles is home to some of the worst air quality in the country (number one for ozone and fifth for year-round particle pollution).
 
Changing regional weather patterns are causing heat waves or extreme heat events to become more common, which is increasing the risk of heat-related mortality.  Specifically, in urban areas, large quantities of asphalt, tall buildings, and limited trees cause an effect known as an urban heat island. This is a phenomenon when cities are substantially warmer than the surrounding areas. Climate change is intensifying urban heat islands and increasing the risk of mortality in certain communities from circulatory and respiratory diseases. Risk factors for heat-related illnesses and deaths include age, gender, health status, location, and income status.  Communities of color experience a large proportion of these risk factors, and they are the most common victims of heat waves.  Climate change is predicted to increase heat deaths in Black communities.
 
Through blending media, popular education, and policy, our goal is to engage communities of color as well as key stakeholders and elected officials in the climate justice fight with the intention of advancing meaningful institutional change at the state and local level. Using an intersectional lens, we will raise awareness about how climate change can impact Los Angelenos of color both globally and locally, as well as promote solutions that center on the most vulnerable populations. This includes linking how affordable and safe quality housing, transportation, oil drilling, fossil fuel reduction, water and food policies can help prevent further global warming in addition to creating healthier and more sustainable communities for all. Furthermore, by engaging communities of color directly, we can apply more pressure to local and state elected officials to support and champion true climate justice legislation.
","By using a popular culture metaphor, the â€œZombie Apocalypse,â€ as a frame for discussing the perils of climate change, we can engage more creatively and enthusiastically with the communities that are most impacted by the negative effects of air pollution and climate change. The theme will give Angelenos the opportunity to become â€œHeroesâ€ and engage with their neighbors and networks. The metaphorical premise turns abstract, complex scientific issues into a more tangible, relatable (if fictionalized) challenge.

The project will include:
Development and dissemination of popular education materials about climate change and climate justice with a focus on the impact to communities of color. This includes ads on public transportation and local community newspapers, videos, handouts, posters and social media posts. 

Development and dissemination of policy and regulation suggestions that takes an intersectional approach to looking at solving the climate threat. 

A minimum of three community meetings/trainings on climate justice and its impact on people of color.

We plan to focus the campaign in neighborhoods that have large communities of color including, South Los Angeles, Central Los Angeles, and the Antelope Valley. In addition, even though the goal is to increase engagement for the broader communities of color, we will have a particular focus on women of color and young people. 
","We will use several different metrics for success including: 
Social media insights
Pledges 
Sign in sheets 
Pre and post evaluations
Measuring media penetration for both earned and paid","We see this project as one of the first to use popular culture to engage communities that are traditionally left out of environmental and climate justice conversations. This multimedia campaign will not only bring in a new wave of activists who will learn about the disproportionate impacts of climate change on their communities but also will engage them to develop creative solutions as ""heroes"". With the success of Black Panther in theaters (earning more $631 million and counting with approximately 40% moviegoers being African American) this campaign is aptly timed to engage communities of color and train them as climate justice heroes.

There are several goals that we would like to achieve through this project in 5 years:
-Build a strong base of climate justice heroes in Los Angeles who are actively engaged in educating their networks and advocating for their communities health 
- Pass community-driven climate policy at the state level
-Inspire climate justice and environmental health organizations to develop creative and relevant campaigns to engage impacted communities ","[""Exposure to air toxins"",""Resilient communities"",""Walk/bike/transit score""]","Climate change is worsening air pollution by altering regional weather patterns and impacting the location of pollutants, quantity of pollutants (such as ozone, NOx, VOCs), and formation of smog.

Yet leadership in the social entrepreneurship and nonprofit sectors have struggled to reflect that diversity. 

We want to activate 10,000 innovators of color in Los Angeles--who each reach 10 people to increase opportunity for everyone in Los Angeles.  

Through boot camps and trainings, online engagement we will help Los Angeles become the best place for innovators of color to create.","Brioxy will help make Los Angles the best place to create by supporting a generation of innovators of color to build creative spaces that drive community.

We know that we are on the precipice of incredible change in this country. LA is leading the nationâ€™s demographic shift as people of color become the majority of our nation. Yet as our community becomes increasingly diverse, leadership in the social entrepreneurship and nonprofit sectors have struggled to reflect that diversity. 

Creative innovators drive transformative change in our communities. We believe by investing in artists and creatives of color we can help them to stay imbedded within their communities, combatting displacement, and giving communities the tools to create jobs, provide leadership and generate community wealth. 

By cementing a commitment to LAâ€™s Diverse creative scene we will not only ensure that LA remains the creative hub of California but we will do so in a way that all Angelenos see themselves reflected in our creative core. Our arts and culture sector cannot thrive if it is not equitable. 

Our Cerebro Pipeline Program trains social entrepreneurs of color to build and scale solutions that increase opportunity and equity. Highly interactive, these programs give Angelenos space to practice what they are learning, build a powerful network and access critical skill building. Sessions on topics like leadership, management, governance, strategic planning, fundraising, financial management, marketing, grant writing, evaluation and more. With your vote we can help position Los Angeles to be an epicenter of creative activation for innovators of color.

8102012,8102012,Financial Security for Low-Income Angelenos,"Improving the lives of working Californians by creating financial security through a program of research, analysis, public information and education. ","Golden State Opportunity strives to improve the lives of working Californians through a program of research, analysis, public information, and education. GSO leads, participates in, and supports comprehensive efforts related to economic security such as job creation, community development, and distribution of benefits.","Golden State Opportunity strives to bring economic security and improve the lives of working Californians through a program of research, analysis, public information, outreach and education. Our primary program is CalEITC4Me, a public-private partnership with the Governorâ€™s office and State to conduct outreach and education about the California Earned Income Tax Credit (CalEITC). 

As inequality grows in California, work is simply not paying enough to keep up with rising cost of living and a changing economy. The CalEITC is a cash back tax refund that makes work pay better, and provides much needed assistance in an economy that grows more and more imbalanced every year.  In the programâ€™s first two years, it has helped put nearly $2 billion directly into the pockets of almost 800,000 low-income working California families between the state and federal EITC.

The EITC advances social and economic equity throughout low-income communities by providing financial security and helping reduce short and long term poverty.  CalEITC4Meâ€™s aggressive outreach efforts ensure available CalEITC and federal EITC money reach under-resourced communities, bringing economic security in the near term and increased opportunity over time to those in poverty, especially women and children. Research shows children whose families receive an EITC income boost perform better in school, are healthier, and earn more as adults.

As a result of our advocacy efforts in 2017 to expand access to the CalEITC, where workers making up to $22,300 a year and ALL self-employed people (not just W2) are now covered, over 1.6 million Californians will now be eligible for the CalEITC in 2018. This is triple the eligible population of the last two years, and CalEITC4Me is now responsible for ensuring this population benefits from the economic opportunity created by the CalEITC. We hope to take the success of last year and expand our best practices and organizing model to more of Southern California. 

Our ultimate goal is to help low-income Californians not only collect thousands of dollars in EITC refunds now, but ultimately achieve life-long sustainable financial security and economic equality. We hope to turn our EITC outreach efforts into a year-round organizing model to further improve EITC uptake, connect EITC filers to other economic benefits, and help provide a platform for the working poor to be heard on issues important to their lives.
","CalEITC4Me runs a multi-layered outreach and education campaign, combining innovative and accessible online tools, grassroots organizing, multi-lingual and culturally sensitive materials and sophisticated targeting strategies to reach those likely to benefit from the EITC.  We strive to reach the right people with the right information, through multiple channels of communication. 

Given this yearâ€™s unique challenge to educate so many filers about the Cal EITC and Federal EITC, and connect them with local VITA sites, we propose the following multi-layered strategy:


Grassroots Organizing:  Organize in underserved communities with free tax preparation events, community canvasses to targeted areas, and community activities throughout targeted areas. 

Digital Outreach: Deploy texting and social media tactics for cost-effective microtargeting and layered communication directly to eligible filers in multiple languages.


Community Partners: Expand the existing coalition of trusted community messengers in Los Angeles.


Media: Aggressive ethnic, paid and earned media throughout underserved communities.


School Outreach: Work extensively with school districts, school boards, parent groups and education leaders to reach the target population: working parents with young kids.
 
 
CalEITC4Me is working with LA County to have better financial security to improve uptake of EITC in LA, reach families through the county and schools. 
","In 2017, more than 380,000 Californians claimed the EITC, putting nearly $203 million back into their pockets. Many families claimed as much as $6,000 in EITC payments when including their federal EITC refund, and the average worker received a credit of $532. 

In Los Angeles:
101,941 low-income workers claimed the Cal EITC in Los Angeles County putting more than $46 million back into their pockets.

However, more than 330,750 eligible Californians do not claim the Federal EITC in Los Angeles County, leaving more than $575 million on the table. CalEITC4Me is working hand-in-hand with trusted community partners who serve and interact with those most likely to be eligible. We have created innovative online tools designed for use by individuals and the organizations working directly with them:

-The multi-lingual CalEITC4Me Calculator allows individuals and the non-profits serving them to quickly and easily see if the state and federal EITC will benefit them and the approximate amount of their potential refund.
-The calculator links to the Free Tax Prep Finder tool, a resource map that connects families to free tax preparation services in their neighborhoods.
-The CalEITC4Me Interactive Heat Map helps to identify key regions of eligible filers by ZIP code and other searchable criteria to better target efforts on the ground.

Our annual goals for Los Angeles county include:
250,000 people claim the EITC credit
Reach 100,000 individuals likely eligible for the Cal EITC via text
","It is the hope of CalEITC4Me that we will increase uptake for the state and federal EITC. Through education and awareness campaigns, we hope to have a utilization rate of 80%. We also hope to utilize community support to expand access and eligibility to the EITC and continue to lift working people out of poverty. Everyone who works deserves to have the dignity of financial security and providing for their families!","[""Number of households below the self-sufficiency standard""]","Golden State Opportunity strives to bring economic security and improve the lives of working Californians through a program of research, analysis, public information, outreach and education.

8102013,8102013,Pop-Up Sites for Overnight Temporary Shelter: Serving our homeless neighbors with dignity first,"We will deploy architecturally designed, low-impact shelters made of treated cardboard at managed sites around LA nightly to transform conceptions of what emergency homeless shelter can be.","Cardborigami will establish safe, managed, temporary shelter sites on secured premises of private property hosts, where our shelter structures will be set up in an open-space area for assigned use by homeless clients. Each client will be registered or continued in individualized case management by the local homeless services organization with whom we are partnering. These pop-ups around the City of LA will demonstrate a practical, neighborhood-based solution to a widely distributed crisis.","We need to rethink what an emergency homeless shelter can look like, where it can be located, and how it can better serve and maintain dignity for those experiencing homelessness. LA has the highest numbers in the country of homeless who are without access to shelter, and we also top the percentage of unsheltered homeless (78%) amongst US urban areas. That means over 45,000 people do not have a sanctioned place to sleep as of the Jan 2017 count; the number will likely be higher once the 2018 count is reported in May, given the 26% rise in homelessness between 2016 to 2017.
Emergency shelters are typically conceived of as physical buildings within which people are aggregated into open sleeping arrangements. Two main problems of this approach are: traditional brick-and-mortar facilities cannot be built or converted fast enough to meet the urgent need, and grouping strangers into such an environment can elevate anxieties. Instead of limiting the format of such shelter to permanent structures, our activation reimagines what we can do with existing outdoor lots that can serve multiple purposes, including for very temporary and quickly deployable shelter. The Cardborigamis will also give clients a sense of private space that will reinforce their well-being while a part of the collective site.
Our homeless neighbors belong to all geographies of LA, and they find places to sleep wherever they can, often in areas that are familiar to them. Itâ€™s crucial for us to recognize that the need for emergency shelter is dispersed, and concentrating services or resources in a few spots that are hard to reach or require transportation to is not the answer. As reliable access to shelter is top priority for someone to transition off the streets, locating shelter pop-ups closer to where the homeless already are, rather than moving them to far, unfamiliar places, ensures a higher likelihood of them progressing with services. With our no-lasting-trace footprint, Cardborigami will empower neighborhoods with our shelters and joint planning to show that creating a shelter site does not need to be a long-term capital commitment for a what should be a temporary state. This approach also allows for siting that is much more responsive and flexible to changes in demand.
The lack of emergency shelter is an acute bottleneck preventing more homeless from being connected with needed services. Further, what legal shelter is available often has preset limits for who they can accept and how many, based on gender, life stage and official funding allocations of beds for various sub-populations. This type of planning is heavily weighted in infrastructure and cannot adjust to the dynamic conditions or demographics of homelessness. Our activation will increase the efficient use of outreach workers by creating new locations where they can do intakes & assessments for the countywide Coordinated Entry System, while reducing disruptions that unsheltered folks experience with street sweeps.","Many Angelenos are looking for ways to effect change in our homelessness crisis beyond just approving ballot measures; others want to see more immediate results now. We intend to activate a broad swath of folks who are interested in taking action to enact a local, near-term solution. They will be involved in helping to make emergency shelter pop-up sites successful in their own unique communities. Our project will empower them in local decision-making around siting, operating characteristics and, most importantly, how to realize a common goal by using creative resources. By working through the Neighborhood Councils, we will also link those who have not participated there in the past to get more involved in other issues affecting their neighborhood. 

Our activation will engage:
- Residents & other stakeholders to call on their local councilmembers and relevant public agencies, such as Planning and Fire, to voice support for policy changes that would allow the implementation of outdoor solutions
- Residents & their family members to volunteer onsite as greeters; monitors; intake assistants; storage helpers and other light functions
- Those who have volunteered onsite to share their first-hand experiences interfacing with homeless guests to educate fellow community members about their stories, and create support for long-term solutions
- At-risk youth who are participating in community-based programs to work in paid internships assembling the Cardborigamis for shelter site use","The primary success of our activation will be defined by the intended impacts on the Homelessness metric that were described in Q9, and will be measured in the following ways:
Increasing access to shelter for unsheltered homeless - distinct number of individuals who did not have a regular, sanctioned place to sleep before coming to a pop-up
Changing the paradigm on what emergency shelter looks like - amending the applicable municipal standards to account for outdoor solutions, and proving our site operations are compliant
Promoting a distributed geography of where such a resource can exist - our ability to create pop-ups in places where emergency shelter did not exist, especially locations that are prohibitive to easy transit
Expanding the capacity of homeless services outreach efforts - increases in new intakes and rates of follow-up for those already enrolled in system

Secondary success will be all about how we are able to engage Angelenos in the 2-yr activation. We will document and measure how effective we have been at mobilizing folks to:
Advocate for policy, via both digital and in-person means
Help us organize and plan pop-up sites
Volunteer onsite, and the number of unique volunteer roles we create at each site
Change their perspective regarding the issue of homelessness
Get involved with their Neighborhood Council (first-time)
Donate to our nonprofit to sustain our broader programming
Support other organizations working along the spectrum of housing for the homeless","It is our sincere hope that this activation will become a very self-generating tool / coordination plan for local communities and widely replicated in 5 years, not just in LA but across the state and hopefully other regions in the US. We want to contribute meaningfully towards increased buy-in by a large and diverse cross-section of the public towards new ways of drastically reducing homelessness, including support for the most important preventative, more affordable housing. We hope that the activation will have shown all stakeholders, regardless of their present views on how this crisis should be solved, that those who are homeless can be better connected to services when consistent shelter is provided, and that it takes localized situating of that shelter in order to engage local homeless individuals who have an attachment to place.","[""Rates of homelessness""]","We need to rethink what an emergency homeless shelter can look like, where it can be located, and how it can better serve and maintain dignity for those experiencing homelessness.

8102014,8102014,Youth to Youth: Helping Young Adults Exit Foster Care,CASA of Los Angeles is recruiting graduate-level college students to help young adults in foster care exit the system and build thriving and independent lives.,"Through the LA2050 challenge, CASA/LA is looking to activate college students to work as court-appointed volunteers helping older youth in foster care, aged 18-21, exit out of the system. The Youth to Youth volunteers will help these young adults secure safe and permanent housing, and connect them with educational and training opportunities. But most importantly, they will make sure the young adults in extended foster care have all the tools in place to live independent and successful lives.","Exiting out of foster care can be a terrifying experience. For many young adults who have elected to stay in extended foster care, it will be their first time living on their own. Most of these young people have no support network, and no one to help them adjust to an ever complicated world. But they can have a CASA. It's our job to recruit more Court Appointed Special Advocates to support these youth, and it's our community's opportunity to show up for them and say, ""You are not alone.""

There are over 2,500 youth in Extended Foster Care in Los Angeles. In the next year or two, they will exit the system, and without help, their futures are challenging. According to a 2011 study, of the youth who age out of foster care in Los Angeles County, one third experienced extreme poverty, 20% received outpatient mental health services, 25% spent time in jail, only 25% were consistently employed, and nearly 40% become homeless. Only 4% will graduate from college. Additionally, young men and women of color are particularly over-represented in this system, and frequently struggle to access and maintain services available to them to help them successfully gain independence. 

CASA volunteers are critical in helping these young adults negotiate the gauntlet of paperwork, meetings, and phone calls needed in order to access critical social and victim services. CASA of Los Angeles currently serves 100 of these young adults with intensive advocacy, and is launching programming to serve significantly more. This is an opportunity to support young adults in taking charge of their lives and futures â€“ working with them on relationships, problem solving, personal responsibility and skill building to ensure they will thrive. As the students in the Cal State systems reflect the diversity of LA, this program will not only help to better support young men and women of color in the dependency care system, but will target recruitment of more culturally diverse volunteers. Through this project, CASA will recruit youth to serve youth. By training graduate level college students to help young adults exit out of foster care, we will be activating more young Los Angelenos in life-changing volunteer work. But most importantly, we will be helping to change the lives of young people who just need one person to help them succeed.","CASA/LA has long realized how important it is to connect with younger members of the LA community, offering them an opportunity to not only change their life, but to change the life of a youth in foster care. The youth served by CASA/LA have entered the Los Angeles County juvenile dependency system because of abuse and neglect by their parents or caregivers. CASA/LA not only works to promote the permanency, safety, and well-being of youth who have experienced abuse and neglect, we are advancing justice amongst the most vulnerable young adults in the system. It is well-documented that child welfare struggles with racial, ethnic, and economic equity. A 2004 study found that in addition to being the largest system in the nation, Los Angeles County also has a disproportionate number of African American children in the system in comparison to their population size within the region. In 2016, 25% of children in DCFS were African-American (compared to 38% served by CASA). Throughout LA County, only 7.5% of all children were African-American. Over the last several years, CASA has developed specific recruitment strategies in order to better diversify our CASA volunteers. In the last year, CASA was proud to report that 36% of CASAs recruited were people of color. Through the Youth to Youth program, CASA/LA will recruit significantly more volunteers from more diverse environments to serve as peer-to-peer mentors for some of the most vulnerable youth in care.","In 2016, CASA/LA completed the full implementation and training for our new monitoring database Efforts to Outcomes (ETO) Social Solutions, which provides a way to track case progress, and is the beginning of outcomes measurement at CASA. When a case is assigned, both the Advocate Supervisors and the CASA volunteer examine the case and rate the status and level of risk of the child on a baseline scale along the three core dimensions of safety, permanency and well being. We are documenting in the database the initial assessment related to these dimensions; the advocacy goals and plans (steps and procedures to be implemented); the degree to which the plan is then implemented; and how the assessment of safety, permanency, and well-being measures changes over time. Through ETO, we will not only be able to track who has become activated through the LA2050 program, but how their work has changed the lives of the young adults they have been appointed to serve.","Through the Youth to Youth Program, CASA/LA hopes to activate some of our youngest community members in a life-changing volunteer opportunity in order to serve every young adult, aged 18-21, in Los Angeles County's extended foster care with similarly life-changing advocacy.","[""Rates of volunteerism""]","Exiting out of foster care can be a terrifying experience. For many young adults who have elected to stay in extended foster care, it will be their first time living on their own. Most of these young people have no support network, and no one to help them adjust to an ever complicated world. But they can have a CASA. It's our job to recruit more Court Appointed Special Advocates to support these youth, and it's our community's opportunity to show up for them and say, ""You are not alone.""
 
 
 
 There are over 2,500 youth in Extended Foster Care in Los Angeles. In the next year or two, they will exit the system, and without help, their futures are challenging. According to a 2011 study, of the youth who age out of foster care in Los Angeles County, one third experienced extreme poverty, 20% received outpatient mental health services, 25% spent time in jail, only 25% were consistently employed, and nearly 40% become homeless. Only 4% will graduate from college. Additionally, young men and women of color are particularly over-represented in this system, and frequently struggle to access and maintain services available to them to help them successfully gain independence. 
 
 
 
 CASA volunteers are critical in helping these young adults negotiate the gauntlet of paperwork, meetings, and phone calls needed in order to access critical social and victim services. CASA of Los Angeles currently serves 100 of these young adults with intensive advocacy, and is launching programming to serve significantly more. This is an opportunity to support young adults in taking charge of their lives and futures — working with them on relationships, problem solving, personal responsibility and skill building to ensure they will thrive. As the students in the Cal State systems reflect the diversity of LA, this program will not only help to better support young men and women of color in the dependency care system, but will target recruitment of more culturally diverse volunteers. Through this project, CASA will recruit youth to serve youth. By training graduate level college students to help young adults exit out of foster care, we will be activating more young Los Angelenos in life-changing volunteer work. But most importantly, we will be helping to change the lives of young people who just need one person to help them succeed.",Connect,2018014,https://activation.la2050.org/connect/casa-of-los-angeles/casa-of-los-angeles.jpg,https://youtu.be/nUykHHtLIHo,8102014
8102015,8102015,Connection through Council,"To amplify the impact of the LA2050 Activation Challenge and foster deeper compassion amongst Angelenos, Center for Council will train ten of the finalist organizations in the practice of Council.  ","Center for Council will train the winning organizations and six semi-finalists in Council, a practice of bringing people together to listen non-judgmentally and speak authentically. Council diffuses tensions that arise from bias and misunderstanding and fosters respectful, cooperative relationships and compassionate, resilient communities. Integrating Council into these organizations will deepen their connection to the constituents they serve and amplify the impact of their activation projects.","Council is a tradition of bringing people together in a circle to listen non-judgmentally to one anotherâ€™s stories and to speak authentically. Combining elements of storytelling and mindfulness, the practice provides a tool for diffusing bias and misunderstanding, fostering more respectful relationships, and supporting the emergence of compassionate and resilient communities.  

Center for Council has worked with over 50 social justice organizations through its Social Justice Council Project. The Social Justice Council Project provides LA nonprofits with training in Council to more effectively listen to and engage with their constituents, and to create more cooperative and supportive internal work environments, mitigating staff stress and burnout. Program evaluation has shown that implementing Council helps participants improve their communication skills, empathy, connectedness, and mindfulness both within and outside the workplace, as well as reduces social anxiety when having to speak in group settings. 

If selected as an LA2050 Activation Challenge winner, Center for Council will employ the Social Justice Council Project model to help strengthen the internal work cultures and programmatic impact of the other five winning organizations and six semi-finalists.

In order for organizations to positively impact the community at-large, there is a critical need to be able to listen deeply to the populations they serve. Organizational staff must develop a capacity to understand both the context of underlying issues embedded within these populations and the history that lives in the stories of community members and their families. By learning to incorporate Council into their work, participants will experience a deeper connection and enhanced engagement in the in-person interactions they have with the community members they serve, as well as with one another, creating a cultural shift both within the workplace and in Los Angeles at-large. The practice of Council is carried from the workplace to the home, from the home back out into the world, and has the potential to impact every interaction an individual has. 

By integrating deeper listening and compassion-based communication into the LA community, the project will mobilize Angelinos and impact the following LA2050 CONNECT metrics: adults getting sufficient social & emotional support; participation in neighborhood councils; rates of volunteerism; trainings and in-person engagements; encouraging (nonprofit) businesses to change practices; and influencing individual behavior. Participating organizations will both experience and deliver significant positive shifts in personal health (lower stress, less stress-related disease), group health (better communication, more cooperation) and community health (more pro-social, compassion-centered engagement). ","By working with non-profits positively impacting the lives of Angelenos, Center for Council will create a ripple-effect of shared understanding and enhanced compassion radiating from the inner circle of change-makers out into the greater LA community. If the principles of human connectedness and commonality are embedded throughout the innovative ideas propelling our city forward, the notion of connection will be engrained in the bedrock of LAâ€™s future. Working with organizations on the frontlines of change in LA, Center for Council will indirectly engage the many community members those non-profits serve, activating over 400,500 Angelenos in totality. Center for Councilâ€™s activation challenge aims to create a shift in how the change agents of LA are engaging with the city, and how community members are interacting with one another for the benefit of the city. The two are profoundly connected.

Over the course of two years, the project will provide comprehensive training and support in Council, including pre-program consultation; immersive training for staff members; monthly follow-up workshops; individualized mentoring and consulting; and a culminating project-wide networking event. The first year will lay the groundwork for implementing the theory and elements of Council into the organizationsâ€™ daily operations. The second year will focus on a customized Council protocol, tailored specifically to each organization and enhancing each of the activation challenges. 
","Center for Council will employ an internal evaluation methodology for this program, which has been developed in partnership with RAND Corporation and UCLA. It will include administration of pre- and post-surveys, anonymous feedback forms, and anecdotal and narrative self-report accounts of the projectâ€™s impacts. Center for Council will evaluate: perceptions of authentic interpersonal connection, self-reported feelings of support and recognition versus isolation within staff groups, organizational resilience in instances of change or hardship, participantsâ€™ understanding of Council forms and processes, impact of the Council process on organizational function and client interactions, organizational readiness for the project, degree to which the organizationâ€™s specific stated objectives were met, overall effectiveness of Council trainers, including cultural sensitivity and self-awareness.

Center for Councilâ€™s past programs have been proven to reduce anger/aggression and hostility, enable participants to connect with others in ways they havenâ€™t before, create safe and supportive environments for self-expression without fear of judgment, help participants gain greater insight into themselves and issues holding them back, help with the development of effective communication skills, and increase resilience.    ","The overarching intention of the Connection through Council activation program is to engage local, community-based organizations on the front lines of creating change and shifting policy in Los Angeles, through work that emphasizes compassion and connection. Council is a generative, adaptable practice, with the capacity to evolve to fit the specific needs of those who use it. It is our hope that, once trained in Council, individuals participating in Connection through Council will begin to facilitate their own Council circles, extending their knowledge and understanding of the practice and our shared connection to those in their communities, creating a more connected, stronger, and compassion-rich city as a whole. 

The effects of a small group of individuals learning the skills and techniques involved in truly listening to one another, speaking authentically from the heart, and taking time to sit together in a communal practice is ten-fold. The principles embedded in Council have the power and potential to inform every interaction each participating individual has afterward, with their families, friends, and constituents. It is our hope that, in five yearsâ€™ time, every individual in LA will have directly or indirectly been impacted by the practice of Council. 

Center for Councilâ€™s aspirations are grand but not out of reach: we want to change the way that we, as a society, relate to one another, enrich the way we communicate with those both within and outside our communities, enhance our capacity to learn from one another and the emergent collective wisdom, and cultivate a sincere and embodied understanding of our profound, human interconnectedness.

8102016,8102016,Next Generation Science Standards: Empowering Teachers to Empower Students for the Future of STEM,"We empower teachers to prepare and inspire students for the future of STEM through dynamic training and mentoring on the state adopted, industry recognized Next Generation Science Standards.","We seek to empower teachers to prepare and inspire students for the future of STEM through dynamic training and mentoring on the state adopted, industry recognized Next Generation Science Standards.","In 2013, the California Board of Education adopted the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) for K-12 public schools.  Those standards were developed by 26 lead states in collaboration with key stakeholders in science, science education, higher education, and industry, based upon the new Framework for K-12 Science Education developed by the National Academy of Sciences.  NGSS emphasizes â€œthree-dimensional learningâ€: disciplinary core ideas, crosscutting concepts, and science and engineering practices.  NGSS aligns with Common Core State Standards to prepare students for college and careers. 

NGSS adoption in California was critical.  It had been 15 years since standards were revised, despite numerous advances in the field of science and the innovation driven economy.  However, implementation has been uneven with limited teacher training.   LA simply cannot be the best place to learn if our science teachers are not given the skills to prepare our students for the future of STEM.  Students will not be prepared for college, careers and citizenship unless teachers set the right expectations and goals.  Improved science standards will inspire students to pursue STEM in higher education and prepare them for the rigors of college, lifting our higher education completion rates and time to completion. In turn, employers can hire workers with strong science-based skillsâ€”including specific content areas but also skills such as critical thinking and inquiry-based problem solving.

To address the urgent need for training, our activation is an NGSS training that includes a dynamic combination of classroom training, real-time feedback, and group collaboration.  It will be rolled out to teachers in LAUSD-Local District South (includes San Pedro, Lomita, Gardena, South LA, South Central LA) and Compton USD.  We will train two cohorts of 50 teachers (100 total) in two years.  The program will be rolled out according to the following timeline each year:
Months 1-2: Teacher Selection - CISE will collaborate with superintendents and STEM coordinators to identify which schools will most benefit from training.  Principals at selected schools will recommend 2-3 K-9 teachers.
Months 3-4: 3 Days of NGSS Classroom Training - Teachers will be trained on the conceptual and instructional shifts from the current standards.  They will learn the 3 dimensions of NGSS, analyze lesson plans, and break down the new performance expectations. 
â€‹Months 5-6: Classroom Observations - 1) An NGSS expert and teacher will meet in advance to agree on the observation focus and review the lesson plan; 2) The NGSS expert will observe and document evidence of good teaching practices; 3) Formal feedback will be provided.
Months 7-10: Lesson Study Cycles - Teams of teacher trainees will engage in collaborative planning-teaching-observation of learning, followed by lesson evaluation and refinement.
Months 1-12: Training Evaluation and Revision - Will occur on an ongoing basis (details in #12).
","Our activation focuses on schools in LAUSD-Local District South and Compton USD.  These districts were selected because implementation has been limited and because the largest achievement gaps in science among student groups are defined by race and income. LAUSD enrollment is 90% students of color and 80% are socioeconomically disadvantaged.  Compton USD enrolls almost 100% students of color and 87% are socioeconomically disadvantaged.  

We will engage directly with teacher trainees, totaling 100 over 2 years.  In turn, these teachers will engage their students as they become more effective and inspiring teachers.  CISE will also give our teacher trainees strategies and tools to engage parents.  Examples include at a minimum keeping parents informed about the shift to NGSS and at most enlisting parents to volunteer in and outside of the classroom to help with NGSS-based science projects.

CISE will enlist the 50 trainees in our current pilot and the 100 additional trainees to become NGSS experts at their schools that mentor fellow teachers.  NGSS experts will provide guidance to these 150 teachers as they help their fellow teachers learn the new standards.

The 150 trainees we engage will represent 50 schools averaging 1,000 students.  With those trainees engaging their fellow teachers on the new standards, 50,000 students will be touched directly or indirectly by our effort.  With our push to keep all parents informed at a minimum, we will touch well over 100,000 Angelenos.","Success is defined by the impact participating teachers have on student learning.  This will be measured based upon 1) Participant Surveys: Participating teachers will complete a survey at the end of each training day and at the end of each lesson study cycle assessing training effectiveness; 2) Expert Observations & Evidence: NGSS training team members (experts) will participate in lesson study cycle as observers and will gather evidence based upon an instrument used for teacher observations by the district to evaluate performance; 3) Expert Review of Developed NGSS Lessons: Training team experts will review lesson plans developed by participating teachers for the lesson study cycles to assess quality based upon NGSS standards; 4) Consistent Attendance: Tracking attendance for all components of the training (in-person training, lesson study cycles, etc.).","Our goal is to train a minimum of 3-5 teachers from each school within our service area who will serve as the NGSS experts at their schools and districts, offering their students a more engaging and inspiring STEM instructional experience.  We expect our effort to translate into stronger results on the National Assessment of Education Progress in science, a narrowing of the achievement gap among student groups defined by race/ethnicity and family income, and more students enrolling and persisting in postsecondary STEM programs.","[""College and community college completion rates"",""College matriculation rates"",""Students’ immersion in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math content""]","In 2013, the California Board of Education adopted the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) for K-12 public schools.

8102017,8102017,Saturday Science Academy II: Preparing the Next Generation of STEM & Health Care Leaders,Saturday Science Academy II prepares underrepresented preschool through 12th grade students for careers in Science and health care through an engaging curriculum and hands-on STEM activities. ,"CDUâ€™s SSA II seeks to expand educational opportunities for underrepresented students enrolled in under-resourced schools in Los Angeles County. The results we expect from this activation are improved student academic outcomes, including interest in STEM and health care professions, high school graduation, college enrollment and graduation, and workforce leadership. SSA II seeks to provide learning experiences which form a foundation for success as scientists and health professionals.","Saturday Science Academy II (SSA II) is a Next Generation Science Standards-based program conducted in four programmatic phases throughout the academic school year. These phases are Human Physiology and Anatomy, Physical Science and Engineering, Marine Biology and Plant Life.  A 4-week summer mathematics program is offered to students to encourage reinforcement and retention of academic knowledge gained throughout the academic year. Students are provided with two hours of tutoring each Saturday to increase Proficiency in English and Language Arts and Math. 

SSA II incorporates Next Generation Science Standards as its base educational framework and is open to students in pre-kindergarten through 12th grade. Similar programs for students typically engage students at the high school level. In preparation for leadership and representation in STEM and health care careers, SSA II enrolls students early in their academic career to encourage early interest and involvement in STEM, increase college matriculation rates, connect youth with volunteer, mentorship, research opportunities, and increase proficiency, at or above grade level, in English and Language Arts, Math, and science.

The program strategy also includes a College Readiness component where high school students are offered SAT preparation, test tasking skills, a critical thinking course, college application completion assistance and monitoring, inclusive of college readiness activities designed to improve students' academic profile and increase college matriculation rates. The academic agenda evolves from the Charles Drew University Mission Statement, ""To conduct education, research, and clinical services in the context of community engagement to train health professionals who promote wellness, provide care with excellence and compassion, and transform the health of underserved communities."" Students are engaged in their school communities through community service collaborative partnerships with local school districts/schools, teachers and parents/caregivers.

SSA II follows best practice program models and incorporates three unique features: Parent Involvement, community engagement, and pre-kindergarten through 12th grade student participation. Research demonstrates parent involvement as a critical component of student academic success. Parents are actively engaged through coordinated program support activities as a way to increase program retention and support of student activities. Teachers for this program are local college students who volunteer their time to give back to the community. Students in the program connect with college students, learn about their experiences, and are motivated as they engage with demographically representative teachers on a weekly basis.","SSA II serves Los Angeles County preschool through 12th grade students. The student population is 80% African-American, 11% Latino, 61% female, 39% male, 75% Pre K-8 and 25% grades 9-12. â€œUnderrepresented minorities (URM) complete high school at lower rates and score lower on standardized exams than their peers do, often creating barriers into collegeâ€ (NACME). SSA II focuses its work on closing the academic achievement gap in STEM education and increasing representation of underrepresented groups, including women, in STEM and the health care professions.

The 2015 U.S. News/Raytheon STEM Index shows the persistent gap in STEM education and employment between genders, whites and minorities, and reports the gap is widening. According to the National Science Foundation, the globalization of the 21st century and an increasingly knowledge-based economy intensifies the need for STEM education, particularly as STEM skills are critical to training in the health professions. Evidence shows, attracting more URMs in the early stages of their education to meet the needs of a diverse population, is an effective strategy for reducing racial and ethnic disparities in health status.

SSA II exposes Los Angeles youth to science, actively engages the community in volunteer opportunities, increases student performance in English/Language Arts, Math, and Science and prepares students to matriculate through each educational path-continuing to make Los Angeles the best place to learn and connect.","The success of this project is defined by the following outcomes, which build upon the Consensus Developmental Outcomes and Learning Indicators for STEM in Afterschool programs identified by Afterschool Alliance. The Afterschool Alliance outcomes are congruent with the National Research Council (NRC) report, â€œMonitoring Progress Toward Successful K-12 STEM Education,â€ which identifies program outcomes of effective STEM education programs. The key SSA II program outcomes and corresponding program performance measures are: Outcome I: Students develop interest in STEM health sciences learning activities. Performance Measure: % of students who complete all four program sessions. Outcome II Students develop capacities for productive engagement in STEM learning activities. Performance Measure: % of students who increase their knowledge of STEM as measured by pre/post assessments of STEM principles and increase English Language Arts and Math as identified by their report cards. Outcome III: Students come to value the goals/importance of STEM in everyday life. Performance Measure: % of students who increase student knowledge of STEM and health care careers as measured by pre/post assessments of STEM and health careers. Outcome IV: Students develop interest in college attendance and a major in STEM or health sciences. Performance Measure: % of 12th grade participants who apply to a college or university as measured by College Readiness Checklist.","In five years, we hope to make progress in six critical areas below: 
 
Program Sustainability. Achieve program sustainability through securing a broad and diverse funding base inclusive of foundation and corporate grants, individual donors, and revenue-generating programs, goods, and services; and Increase financial and programmatic support from the CDU alumni association.
 
Student Retention. Retain 60% of the enrolled high school students each program session; Encourage 100% of eligible SSA high school seniors to apply to CDU each year.
 
Program Expansion. Enroll 150 Pre-K through 8th grade students per year and 100 high school students youth per year; Provide a medical and health-sciences focused technology component; Build the capacity and expertise to update SSA curriculum to align with NGSS and innovations every 3-5 years; Increase staff and program capacity to support the increase in student participation, program expansion, and the additional operational and administrative functions and responsibilities; and Sponsor and host an annual science day or science fair for Pre-Kindergarten - 12th grade community youth. 
 
Outreach, Visibility, and Community Engagement. Sponsor and host a yearly STEM conference for teachers, counselors, STEM program leaders and staff. We also aspire to establish and maintain a pool of program support volunteers, and a volunteer teaching corps of SSA alumni, adult professionals, college students (undergrad, graduate, and post-graduate including the medical and health professions), and exceptional high school students with interest in science and health care careers, with a focus placed on underrepresented groups.

Child360 will also oversee data collection and assessment of the activation, and provide regular reports to the community partnerships to learn from and develop plans to improve their work. Child360 will document community partnership participant information and attendance and will work with the community partnerships to identify performance measures, which include metrics that are most meaningful to the communities.","Child360â€™s will engage the communities of East LA, South LA, and Antelope Valley. This activation allows disenfranchised and marginalized communities to participate in collective community driven implementation. Child360 will build on its successful framework to support resident/stakeholder engagement and advocacy through community partnership. Successful stakeholder engagement and advocacy activities include: Parent Cafes, Strengthening Familiesâ„¢ trainings, Advocacy workshops, and Train-the-Trainers. A trained delegate from each community will facilitate train-the-trainer advocacy trainings. Delegates will be trained on how to develop outreach strategies to engage schools, residents, and other stakeholders. Delegates will also be invited to participate in visits with elected officials. Civic engagement trainings will build on these efforts by offering information topics requested by the communities. These may include: public transportation, immigration, education, and access to healthy food. In addition, Community Partnerships may use one of their meetings to invite elected officials to attend and address community issues. This model is based on the success of Senator Hertzberg collaborating with Child360 and the Northeast Valley Partnership to host a community breakfast to connect with and hear from community members. Finally, Child360 will design feedback mechanisms to ensure efforts are conducted in accordance with community partnersâ€™ intentions and goals.","The community partnerships will develop goals to define their success as well as work plans with measurable objectives and implementation timelines, which will allow Child360 to align activities and technical support with their goals.
 
Child360 will conduct focus groups and devise survey instruments to analyze data for community partnerships to reflect upon, learn, and improve. Child360 will use two sustainability-oriented frameworks, Empowerment Evaluation and Appreciative Inquiry, and train community partnerships to incorporate data use, regular reflection, and learning into their processes. Both frameworks emphasize the use of democratic participation and collaborative strategizing to advance existing programs. In combination, these frameworks enhance self-sufficiency. Empowerment Evaluation involves the use of evaluation concepts, techniques, and findings to foster ongoing improvement. Appreciative Inquiry examines, identifies, and further develops an organization'sâ€™ potential to create a better future by focusing on assets and strengths. Both formative and summative evaluation strategies will help identify successes and challenges and inform the iterative improvement process of the community partnerships. The evaluation methodology will include: focus groups with community partnerships, participant feedback forms provided at the end of every meeting, and participant profile surveys to capture demographic data.","Child360 hopes that the people it trains in this activation will have sustainable skills to lend to their communities and in five years, these community partnerships will thrive independently. This activation will have a ripple effect as participants forge stronger relationships and empower others in their community to become a part of the political and community development process, rather than remain bystanders. One of the outcomes of the activation should be that community partnerships in these communities become self-sustaining and look to Child360 as a trusted partner with expertise in training and technical assistance, rather than rely on it for on-the-ground coordination. Child360 hopes to study its success and pass on this information to other organizers and other communities so that young childrenâ€™s status and well-being will be elevated everywhere in Los Angeles.","[""Adults getting sufficient social & emotional support"",""Government responsiveness to residents’ needs"",""Rates of volunteerism""]","Child360 (formerly Los Angeles Universal Preschool) works in partnership with families, local residents and community groups to build, support, and improve early education in Los Angeles County.

8102019,8102019,Making LA the Best Place to Connect Angelenos to Support a Strong Start for NiÃ±itos,Children Now will support thousands of Angelenos to voice their support for quality care and education for LAâ€™s babies. ,"Too often in LA, childrenâ€”especially children of color, children in foster care, and those growing up in povertyâ€”face many systemic barriers to a healthy early start. In order to build the public pressure necessary to push policymakers to ensure all young kids have the supports they need to thrive in their first years, Children Now will execute a communications campaign to educate, connect, and mobilize Angelenos behind a strong vision for LAâ€™s babies. ","In the first three years of a childâ€™s life, foundational brain architecture is established, making childrenâ€™s earliest experiences the most important. The creation of healthy brain architecture is dependent on good health, positive and nurturing relationships with adults, exposure to enriching learning opportunities, and safe neighborhoods. Yet, many of LAâ€™s babies donâ€™t receive the supports they need for a health start. 

Children Now is committed to supporting and connecting the incredible constituency power that exists in LA to influence state and local policymaking in favor of our youngest kids. Policymakers are paying too little attention and allocating too few resources to those formative early years. We will execute a multi-faceted communications plan to raise awareness, build public support, and activate Angelenos behind a social media campaign in support of quality care, education and experiences for all of LAâ€™s babies. 

Children Now will leverage its reach to hundreds of organizations and businesses in LA County through The Childrenâ€™s Movement, a network of more than 470 direct service, business, parent, civil rights, faith-based and community-based organizations dedicated to improving the lives of kids, as well as use social media analytics to identify key organizations and businesses to promote messaging on early brain and social emotional development. Among this group, we will select key organizations and businesses that have a strong social media presence in LA to partner on social media content distribution. By coordinating the social media reach of hundreds of organizations behind one campaign, we will increase social media connections among Angelenos.

Once our influencer network is established, Children Now will develop and disseminate weekly content and toolkits for social media influencers to share online and to educate reporters on infant and toddler issues. This content will include:

â€¢	Infographics highlighting key data and statistics on the need for strong supports for early brain development and social emotional development; 
â€¢	Video blog posts on early brain development and social emotional development for young children;
â€¢	Shareable memes and photos with data points highlighting the need for better supports for infants and toddlers; 
â€¢	Links to partnersâ€™ and researchersâ€™ reports and materials that highlight infant and toddler issues; and
â€¢	Social media posts targeted at key state and LA County candidates of the 2018 election.

Our social media push will target window of opportunity for Angelenos to help push Californiaâ€™s gubernatorial and other state and local candidates to prioritize young children and, further, to stick to his or her campaign promise to support young children and to develop a plan to move forward on a comprehensive system of support for babies. 
","Social media can be a powerful tool to connect and engage with the general public to convey a powerful message, however, it can be difficult to break through the â€œnoiseâ€ to reach a wide audience. If all of the LA-based direct service, business, parent, civil rights, community, and faith-based groups that care about young children were connected and spoke with a unified voice, there would be significant policy changes for kids in LA, and infant and toddler outcomes would dramatically improve. Children Now has already established a network of these groups through The Childrenâ€™s Movement. We will engage the more 470 members in LA County in this network. Engaging groups with existing, large social media followings is a key strategy for maximizing reach to a broader audience. So, in addition, we use social media analytics to identify influencers with a strong interest in early childhood development to further our messaging. 

We will educate this influencer network on the need for early childhood supports and services in LA County through our toolkits and give them the content needed to engage their social media followers in a campaign for early childhood development in LA County. We will use tools such as hashtags, Thunderclaps, and Twitter Chats to generate buzz around the campaign. The network will also have opportunities to weigh in with candidates and policymakers through issue awareness and sign on campaigns. 
","Children Nowâ€™s ultimate goal is for policymakers to take action on a unified, long-term policy plan for a comprehensive system of support for infants and toddlers. Our key objective for this activation is to connect LA voices to demonstrate the strong support for infants, toddlers and their families.  For this project, we will measure our success by the following metrics:

-	Number of LA social media influencers engaged with to join our infant and toddler support network.
-	Estimated reach of social media influencers that have shared key posts, resources and advocacy tools and participated in related Twitter Chats on infants and toddlers.
-	Number of resources, including infant and toddler infographics, one-page snapshots, video blogs, graphics and memes, that are developed and disseminated.
-	Number of LA stakeholders and partners informed by the Children Now-developed infant and toddler policy roadmap http://bit.ly/start1ngnow. 
-	Number of LA groups and individuals that participate in Childrenâ€™s Movement campaigns including sign on statements and communications to policymakers. 
-	Number of infant and toddler social media posts that are targeted at key LA County state candidates of the 2018 election.
","This activation is a key component of our broader agenda to develop and sustain a comprehensive, family-centered, high quality early learning system that is accessible to all children and families, particularly those living in poverty. Public awareness and support building is a crucial piece of putting pressure on LA policymakers to make real change for young children. LA is the ideal place to be the most connected for childrenâ€™s advocacy, because if the policy change is scaled here, there is no excuse for not scaling it throughout California, and, then, given Californiaâ€™s size and diversity, throughout the country. 

We know achieving the vision of a comprehensive, family-centered, high quality early learning system wonâ€™t happen overnight. There will be many steps in the process, and we need to keep a network of dedicated Angelenos engaged throughout. In five years, our goal is that Children Now will move from significantly elevating an aspirational policy and advocacy vision for integrated infant and toddler supports in LA to achieving key policy wins on components of the vision, such as increasing the number of LA babies that are screened for developmental delays, improving the availability of voluntary home visiting programs for families that need them, providing support for young children who are dual language learners, addressing maternal mental health, and continuing to educate and engage our network to see the vision fully realized.

8102020,8102020,Fostering a better future for LA youth by expanding a successful foster family recruitment campaign.,"A non-profit coalition united on behalf of foster youth to increase participation in foster parenting, mentoring and educational opportunities.","To help meet LA Countyâ€™s urgent need for foster parents and mentors, the effort combines predictive analytics and powerful digital content to generate foster parent and mentor leads across LA County. This effort will connect with over 500,000 residents generating thousands of recruits and sharing a positive message about youth in foster care. ","With state-level reforms taking place, the need for foster parents in Los Angeles County is at crisis level.  With this in mind, our team of communications experts conducted research and focus groups to develop a winning, digital campaign to recruit foster parents and mentors, while at the same time reintroducing viewers to the potential of foster youth.
In a new approach for the field, FosterMore uses21st century techniques to engage people in the lives of youth in care.  This kind of specific targeting works at two levelsâ€”at best we have recruited a new person to actively support foster youth, while at the same time we have promoted the larger mission of FosterMore, to change hearts and minds, reducing stigmas for foster youth. 
In 2016, we ran a pilot campaign which produced 133 leads for local agencies at a cost of roughly $68 per lead.  To build upon that success, the online media buy began employing  predictive analytics and big data to provide accuracy and effectiveness. In 2017, armed with the latest in digital targeting and additional creative content, we produced over 1,800 leads and referred 260 prospective foster parents for just $26,000 (or $14/lead). 
The campaign messaging features uplifting stories of individuals and families whose lives were positively impacted by foster care.  Set to the One Direction hit song â€œThe Story of My Lifeâ€ with voiceover provided by Emmy winning actor Ty Burrell, the moving ads received a prestigious Cynopsis Social Good Award for best ad over 30 seconds and earned FosterMore a commendation from the County Board of Supervisors.
The funds from the LA2050 grant will enable us to continue this campaign for two additional years, reaching and connecting with 500,000 Angelenos, who will view the content during the run of the campaign.  Using a conservative estimate, the funding will also generate interest in foster parent opportunities from over 10,000 County residents. 
","The grant will allow us to reach millions of Angelenos and we will engage 500,000 to connect by watching our ads.  We will be able to provide realtime reports while the ads are being run. 
There are numerous ways to measure success (as defined in the next question) but for the purposes of connecting Angelenos, we believe that our greatest offering is the sharing of FosterMoreâ€™s message, to developing empathy for our young residents facing the challenges of foster care, and providing opportunities for individuals to support them in their journey to reach their potential. 

","We believe it is important to look at the impact of the ads through three different lenses, aligned with FosterMoreâ€™s goals.  Each of the three goals has a metric to measure success.
â€¢	Recruitment of Foster Parents: The number of referrals made to LA County Foster Family Agencies is a clear metric for success and evaluation.  The cost/referral allows for comparison with the efforts of other organizations to reach the same demographic.
â€¢	Reintroducing Foster Youth to the Publicâ€”The overall number of individuals who see the ads and watched the films is a strong metric for success because the ads are purchased to reach a specific demographic of potential foster parents.
â€¢	Long Term Culture Shift: Based on previous research of our partner organizations that states that the average foster parent spends two years in the prospecting pipeline, we may be able to project interest starting in 18-24 months, assuming appropriate follow up is conducted.  It is our belief that a periodic investment of advertising (targeting the same demographic) could yield a conversion rate of 0.005% from those who view the ad.
","We will have provided a significant resource to Los Angeles County to address the needs of foster youth and we hope that they will adopt and utilize the template in their ongoing efforts to recruit foster parents.  If we are successful, there will be sufficient foster homes to address the need and the public will see foster youth as they are â€“ children facing a difficult time, not simply difficult children.

All too often sensitive discussions live online and only cause greater division. By bringing into a room and beginning from a commonplace we are more able to show empathy, share perspectives, find clarity in our disagreements and more the conversation towards specific resolutions.","There are so many people who donâ€™t know their neighborâ€™s views on immigration, and they are immigrants themselves. There are many couples who simply do not discuss gender equity. We have let ourselves become a society in which we avoid the difficult conversations in person for fear of intimacy and offense. Meanwhile, ignoring these problems only makes them worse. Members of marginalized groups suffer alone and silos of thought only grow more divided while the news reports half-truths that support biased thinking. Citizens Of Culture is an organization that uses art to develop critical thinking and emotional intelligence. With the support of LA2050 we will make LA the best place to CONNECT by pushing against these silos of cultural perspective with a multipart symposium to connect diverse groups.

The project is presented in multiple phases over 2 years.
Year 1: CALL: Conversation, outreach, and engagement. 
Citizens of Culture will host 10-100person events bringing together Angelenos for  intentional conversation. This means that 1,000 people in total will gather to discuss  Racial Justice, Net Neutrality, Gender Equity,  Technological Unemployment, Housing& Homelessness, Immigration, Religion/Spirituality, Economic Inequality, Climate Change, and Fake News/ Political Polarization.

Each event will feature small groups of 10 to share stories, humanize each discussion , center individual impact on the larger topic, which is often missing from political debate. The stories and experiences shared here will be highlighted to the groups of 100 to speak on how these human stories may have hit home or shifted perspective. Recap videos of the events will model how face to face conversation can be used to build shared values and bring the discussions to larger audiences. Each clip will end with local organizations working on solutions that are accepting donations and volunteers.

Year 2: RESPONSE: Collaboration, research and, practice.
Another issue we see is that voting and calling are one of the only ways individuals can speak to institutions but both are individual pursuits. We need to draft consensus based suggestions that express public concerns to our schools, businesses, government, and cultural institutions, that answer 'What can be put into practice?"" from our conversations. In the second year we will focus on 4 topics that were most engaged in from Year 1 and speak Truth to Power.  The selected topics will comprise 4 cohorts to will convene in LAâ€™s 4 corners North (NorthEast LA) South  (South Los Angeles) East, (Hollywood, & Silverlake) and West ( Santa Monica, Venice). Each of these cohorts will reflect on the discussions from Year 1 and identify agreements or best practices that support modern etiquette and best practices for how the public would like to engage with institutions like government and business. These sessions will result in public letters as white papers and testimonial videos to be distributed directly to these institutions.
","Because we are unfamiliar with these conversations often times we are clumsy with our language or triggered by our sensitivities to the subject matter. At times our personal insecurities override our desire to listen when we feel attacked even though all of these issues are far bigger than any one individual or group.
The way to CONNECT Angelenos is by starting with common ground. Individual passion for Los Angeles to be an amazing place for themselves and their families. This is an idea we can all get behind and refer back to as an agreement. We will talk to people who are not already talking about these issues by leveraging those people who are passionate to bring in new voices. We will ask specific invitees to bring one or two friends to participate and we will separate them into different groups.

Much of what we do is based in storytelling, an artistic medium that asks the individual to share a related anecdote that highlights their experience and perspective.

We can then tie this anecdote to a social issue that is often discussed in terms of policy or economy and look at the human impact of the decisions we make as voters on the macro level. 

The more we engage, it increases social trust and activity and reduces polarity.The content we create shows that it is possible to have productive heartfelt dialogue around hot button issues as a clear challenge to media outlets that stoke polarization. We connect by coming together.
","Success for this project is multifaceted. The first thing we will be tracking is attendance to the events. With a capacity of 100 participants for each topic we will first need to make sure we hit a quota of at least 50 people to have enough groups of 10 to be worth while. The next thing we will be looking for is demographic and psychographic diversity. It is not enough to have a gender balanced racial diverse group. We also want to make sure we are intergenerational and welcoming people with various levels of education, experience, and ideologies to these conversations. 

We can track these indicators with a registration survey and count attendance.

The other metrics we will be looking at is impact and impressions. We would like to be sure that the program itself is impactful for attendees so we will be asking for some feedback after the event and following up with volunteer groups to see if we have actually driven any new participation.

On the media side we will be counting views and shares to our content customarily but we will also be keeping an eye on our social media and newsletter sign-ups during the campaigns to see if we are generating more interest in they kinds of conversations at large.
","In five years we hope that this method of engaging people in crucial conversations is closer to becoming commonplace and we hope that it begins to set the standard in media showing that honest conversations can be just as interesting and sensational as click bait and punditry.

For the organization, we hope that we are continuing to grow this work in Los Angeles and connect similar conversations to cities across the globe. It is our belief that the more that we","[""Adults getting sufficient social & emotional support"",""Attendance at cultural events"",""Rates of volunteerism""]","There are so many people who don’t know their neighbor’s views on immigration, and they are immigrants themselves. There are many couples who simply do not discuss gender equity. We have let ourselves become a society in which we avoid the difficult conversations in person for fear of intimacy and offense. Meanwhile, ignoring these problems only makes them worse. Members of marginalized groups suffer alone and silos of thought only grow more divided while the news reports half-truths that support biased thinking. Citizens Of Culture is an organization that uses art to develop critical thinking and emotional intelligence. With the support of LA2050 we will make LA the best place to CONNECT by pushing against these silos of cultural perspective with a multipart symposium to connect diverse groups.
 
 
 
 The project is presented in multiple phases over 2 years.
 
 Year 1: CALL: Conversation, outreach, and engagement. 
 
 Citizens of Culture will host 10-100person events bringing together Angelenos for intentional conversation. This means that 1,000 people in total will gather to discuss Racial Justice, Net Neutrality, Gender Equity, Technological Unemployment, Housing& Homelessness, Immigration, Religion/Spirituality, Economic Inequality, Climate Change, and Fake News/ Political Polarization.
 
 
 
 Each event will feature small groups of 10 to share stories, humanize each discussion , center individual impact on the larger topic, which is often missing from political debate. The stories and experiences shared here will be highlighted to the groups of 100 to speak on how these human stories may have hit home or shifted perspective. Recap videos of the events will model how face to face conversation can be used to build shared values and bring the discussions to larger audiences. Each clip will end with local organizations working on solutions that are accepting donations and volunteers.
 
 
 
 Year 2: RESPONSE: Collaboration, research and, practice.
 
 Another issue we see is that voting and calling are one of the only ways individuals can speak to institutions but both are individual pursuits. We need to draft consensus based suggestions that express public concerns to our schools, businesses, government, and cultural institutions, that answer 'What can be put into practice?"" from our conversations.

This will include collectively defining the needs within the community, identifying ideal site opportunities, and designing the proposed mixed-use, affordable housing developments.","IN House is a collaborative affordable housing design initiative between City Fabrick, affordable housing providers, community partners, and local residents to site, program, and design a collection of 5-7 affordable housing developments in Long Beach and surrounding communities in South Los Angeles County. The intention will be to assist affordable housing developers â€“ seeking to leverage the expansion of resources and legislation, to expand the availability of affordable housing. This will be done while educating and empowering residents to be participate and guide these developments to serve these new residents, as well as those already living in these communities.

Working with students and faculty of California State University Long Beachâ€™s Geography Department, City Fabrick along with affordable housing providers and community partners will map and define optimum areas within South Los Angeles County to consider developing new affordable housing. This will be based on a variety of factors including access to transportation, community amenities and services, funding sources, and availability of developable opportunities. Within these opportunity areas, focus areas will be identified for City Fabrick and community partners to engage.

City Fabrick and community partners will initiate contact with core constituents to determine the landscape of needs and opportunities for affordable housing and community development within these focus areas, determining the most well suited development partner for each area. This can include target populations for housing â€“ like senior living, families, or those with special needs, as well as amenities, services, and assets that can be leveraged to best serve these communities. Residents and community partners will begin to learn about the development process, so they are empowered to constructively participate in defining these and future developments.

City Fabrick will collaborate with these affordable housing developers and community partners in each of these focus area, reaching out to the broader community to further define and refine those needs while collectively identifying opportunities for affordable housing in those communities. This will balance optimum development opportunities with the ability to maximize the future public-private investment for community development. This will also consider the capacity to leverage existing assets and proposed future investments to maximize their collective impact.

A series engaging workshops with residents and community partners will facilitate collaboration for each proposal through conceptual design. This process will continue through until initial submittal to the approving jurisdiction, where the local government will likely lead the designâ€™s refinement for their approval. With the substantial groundwork of participation, the intention will be for community partners and local residents to remain actively engaged along with the design and development team.","IN House will provide a space for affordable housing providers, community partners, and local residents to deliberating collaborate to place, define, and design affordable housing development in their community. The intention is to proactively engage residents to guide the design process so that public-private investment in their community so that it serves those news residents, as well as those already living in the neighborhood.

There is a growing awareness across the region about housing affordability, gentrification and resulting displacement, and homelessness is impacting the makeup and stability of their communities. This is reflected in recent passing of Measure H and Measure HHH to support creating more affordable housing and expanding homeless services, as well as countless legislation at the local and State levels of government to expand housing and affordable housing development.
Yet, the development process is still obstructed by trepidation from communities of all backgrounds and socioeconomic characteristics, for both new affordable and market-rate housing. The intention of IN House, is for City Fabrick, affordable housing developers, community partners, and local residents to collaborate to define how these substantial public-private investments can best serve new and current residents of these neighborhoods.","The most obvious success of IN House will be determined in the medium term, as new affordable housing and mixed-use development that began as part of this initiative are constructed and open to new residents while serving those living in the communities they are located. The goal of this initiative would be for IN House to kick off 5-7 new affordable housing developments across Long Beach and South Los Angeles County. While they will not be completed within the timeframe of this round of LA 2050, the proposals should be clearly articulated, and some of them within their approval stages.

Short term success of IN House will be measured by the quantity and quality of collaboration among the community partners, affordable housing providers, and local residents. This will be quantitatively measured by number of workshops, meetings, and events, along with the number of participants at each of them. The quality of the collaboration will be measured by the regularity of participation, application of the learning, along with the consensus and ownership of the designs that emerge from the process.

Long term attainment of IN House will be evident based on its ability to continue â€“ even grow from the initial LA2050 scope, to become a sustainable enterprise. Ideally, the success will propagate similar initiatives within other communities â€“ without out City Fabrickâ€™s direct participation, instead becoming self-perpetuating.","Within five years that IN House will be a sustainable initiative of City Fabrick, encompassing multiple projects in progress throughout Long Beach and South Los Angeles County. Some of the initial cluster of affordable housing developments will be completed or in the construction phase. Their success will define a new model for how linking affordable housing and community development - designed in a collaborative environment, can lift neighborhoods for the current residents while expanding their capacity to include new neighbors.

City Fabrick is among an emerging field of nonprofit design studios dedicated to improving communities in need, by providing creative and professional services. As an active participant in this space, we will share those lessons learned throughout the process, with those in design as well as other affordable housing developers. This will further extend the reach of the IN House initiative beyond what City Fabrick and our partners can do alone.","[""Housing affordability"",""Rates of homelessness"",""Resilient communities""]","IN House is a collaborative affordable housing design initiative between City Fabrick, affordable housing providers, community partners, and local residents to site, program, and design a collection of 5-7 affordable housing developments in Long Beach and surrounding communities in South Los Angeles County.

","Activating hyperlocal leaders, the BlockMobile travels block by block in LAâ€™s high-density neighborhoods to draw neighbors to the street to connect socially and tackle local community issues.","In LAâ€™s dense multi-family neighborhoods, neighbors live the closest to each other but are often disconnected. In a fun & engaging way, The BlockMobile creates a pop-up forum for neighbors to meet and connect where they live. Through food, games, & information, all neighbors will learn how they can connect to solve local concerns and create a stronger community. Potential hyperlocal leaders will be identified & supported through a network of resident leaders from over 400 of LAâ€™s densest blocks.","Los Angeles has a history of trucks rolling down the street to deliver value. From the Helms bakery trucks and their baked goods-announcing whistle to the iconic twang jingle of an ice cream truck drew families from their homes on summer nights and weekends to join together for a cool treat, trucks called people from their homes to meet on the street. In the 21st century, Angelenos continue to expect mobile delivery of what they want from the Kogi-launched gourmet food truck industry to Amazonâ€™s on-demand packages. Yes,  people are more connected than ever to the world but less so to their neighbors. Learning from the past, The BlockMobile models home-delivery of treats and goods and applies that to civic engagement and neighborhood leadership.

The BlockMobile is an innovative design to make civic and community engagement a good that can too be brought to the front doors of Angelenos. Connecting in LA must be achieved at the most local level: on the streets. Too often, civic engagement is pushed from the top down, and The BlockMobile seeks to engage traditionally tough-to-engage Angelenos living in apartments where they live: on their block. And by doing so, we will create a fun space for neighbors to connect, micro issues to be identified, and for local leaders to emerge. 

The BlockMobile concept is simple: pack a food truck-style vehicle with community engagement tools and resources, promote the trucks visit in advance to a block, park the truck on a block for 2 hours, and draw neighbors to connect with each other with food, games, and conversations about living on their block. Partnering with local agencies like LAPD, LAFD, local non-profits and larger community groups, this localized engagement will also provide resources to participants and offer them the opportunity to talk specifically about their local concerns. The BlockMobile and partners will be trained to support individuals in understanding they can address their local issues, and offer those interested the opportunity to be supported in their effort to continue the dialogue and create a small neighborhood action plan (SNAP) for the issue of concern. These hyperlocal leaders will be offered monthly support and connected to a network of other local leaders as well as given support to continue conversation with their own neighbors on their block.

This local activation will see at least five events per week in the evenings and weekends (when people are home) on as many blocks, with the intention of identifying at least one new, hyperlocal leader to volunteer to tackle a local concern, whether its hosting more block gatherings or as simple as learning how to request a sidewalk repair or pothole to be filled. By supporting local leaders to emerge and become caretakers for their block, The BlockMobile initiative will leave behind connectors who make that block more livable, transforming high density areas of isolation into thriving, interconnected communities.","The BlockMobile employs proven tactics of reaching and activating residents to connect and create micro communities. We specifically want to target high-density, lower income blocks made up primarily of multifamily buildings. The BlockMobile provides a hub for neighbors to connect, local issues to be identified, and local leaders to emerge. The BlockMobile is a modified, food truck-style vehicle that includes all the tools to engage a high-density block, including food, entertainment, and activities that allow residents to connect and talk about whatâ€™s important to them.
The BlockMobile creates hyperlocal connections in three simple steps. First, a street team connects with local partners and leaders to develop and implement local outreach on a block to engage all residents. Next, The BlockMobile parks on the block for a two-hour event with informational tools, community advocacy activities, and entertainment to attract neighbors, including a map of community issues that prompts feedback, the â€œWheel of Engagementâ€ resident can spin to both win prizes and connect with neighbors, and a fun edible treat like ice cream! Trained staff will help engage and facilitate the activities & neighbor conversations to foster organic connections among the residents. The final step is for this staff to identify and engage local leaders and invite them to participate in a network that provides support and resources as they continue the efforts to build connections and community on their block.","After a four-month program planning and development phase, the primary goal will be to visit and activate five blocks every week. Within a two-year timeframe, we plan to visit 400 blocks and engage thousands of Angelenos. At each event, weâ€™ll connect with local residents who are interested in taking the next step to increase connection on their block, developing a network of at least 400 new block leaders. We aim to provide the capacity and tools for these 400 leaders to continue the facilitation of community engagement in their neighborhoods. Weâ€™ll be able to see how many more people these 400 are connecting with on their blocks, creating a long-term local leadership effect.","In five years, our model will be replicated across the country by cities and organizations working to engage and activate high-density communities. Furthermore, our concept will have engaged hyperlocal leaders to take actions for improving their neighborhoods through small and big changes, creating a network of over 1000 emerging leaders. The neighborhoods we visited will have developed deeper connections and those that lived there and have moved on will carry with them the sense that community can be created, even in places where it might seem difficult.","[""Attendance at public/open streets gatherings"",""Government responsiveness to residents’ needs"",""Rates of volunteerism""]","Los Angeles has a history of trucks rolling down the street to deliver value.

Funding will enable the City to manage an Air Quality Data Collection Pilot that will provide valuable information regarding local air quality. The data can inform communities about impacts that may be contributing to their livability & health. This will incentivize communities to become engaged in policy decisions: reducing traffic, encouraging walking/biking, zoning decisions.  ","Los Angeles has some of the most polluted air in the nation. The trend over the last 25 years has shown significant improvements in smog and pollutants until recently.  In the last couple of years this trend has shown an increase in the pollutants.   Air quality information from the California Environmental Protection Agencyâ€™s Air Resources Board has been invaluable to identify the most highly-impacted communities statewide â€“ many of which are found in Los Angeles â€“ and thus provide a warning for those that are particularly sensitive to the health hazards of air pollution such as asthmatics, young children, the elderly, pregnant women and people with compromised immune systems but does not provide this information at a community level.  
  
This proposal will provide local air quality information directly to the City policy makers, as we are currently reliant on information provided to us by the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD).  SCAQMD inspectors are spread far and wide, and required to cover the entire Southland.  It would be a tremendous advantage to have access to our own air quality data within the 500 square miles that constitutes the City of Los Angeles.  This could lead to development of our own  air quality polices, and ultimately programs designed to mitigate the harmful effects of our residents.
  
Additionally, this will give residents a sense of ownership and responsibility for their communities and their destiny.  Air quality is impacted by large issues such as car emissions, but can also be impacted at a local level due to traffic patterns, zoning, industrial uses, and the number of vegetation and trees that are present.  This information will allow the City and those communities that partner with this proposal to observe the disparities in communities and attempt to link them to specific contributing factors.  

The data gathered will become available on the Cityâ€™s open data portal so the public is informed.   In addition, this project has the potential to develop and place air quality sensors â€œbeaconsâ€ that will provide an instantaneous visual indication of the current air quality in the local area.  
","Local air quality data will enable City policy makers to engage residents in an effort to make differences at the municipal level by developing programs that will mitigate air quality impacts.  Current air quality sensors are not locally based, so communities do not feel they have the power or control to impact air quality. ","The program will measure success by completion of the following metrics: 

â€¢	The completed deployment of the air quality sensors and transmission of data. 
  
â€¢	The establishment of a public education program based on the air quality data which is accumulated  
and the development of new community-based programs with the goal of mitigating the harmful effects of air pollution.   
","We hope that as Smart City technology evolves, the use of sensors on streetlights will grow and enable data collection regarding various interests.   This will provide real time data to the community and public officials, enabling policy direction and the enhancements to improve the livability for all residents in the City of Los Angeles.","[""Exposure to air toxins"",""Prevalence of adverse childhood experiences""]","Los Angeles has some of the most polluted air in the nation. The trend over the last 25 years has shown significant improvements in smog and pollutants until recently. In the last couple of years this trend has shown an increase in the pollutants. Air quality information from the California Environmental Protection Agency’s Air Resources Board has been invaluable to identify the most highly-impacted communities statewide — many of which are found in Los Angeles — and thus provide a warning for those that are particularly sensitive to the health hazards of air pollution such as asthmatics, young children, the elderly, pregnant women and people with compromised immune systems but does not provide this information at a community level. 
 
  
 
 This proposal will provide local air quality information directly to the City policy makers, as we are currently reliant on information provided to us by the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD). SCAQMD inspectors are spread far and wide, and required to cover the entire Southland. It would be a tremendous advantage to have access to our own air quality data within the 500 square miles that constitutes the City of Los Angeles. This could lead to development of our own air quality polices, and ultimately programs designed to mitigate the harmful effects of our residents.
 
  
 
 Additionally, this will give residents a sense of ownership and responsibility for their communities and their destiny. Air quality is impacted by large issues such as car emissions, but can also be impacted at a local level due to traffic patterns, zoning, industrial uses, and the number of vegetation and trees that are present. This information will allow the City and those communities that partner with this proposal to observe the disparities in communities and attempt to link them to specific contributing factors. 
 
 
 
 The data gathered will become available on the City’s open data portal so the public is informed. In addition, this project has the potential to develop and place air quality sensors “beacons” that will provide an instantaneous visual indication of the current air quality in the local area.",Live,2018026,https://activation.la2050.org/live/city-of-los-angeles-bureau-of-street-lighting/city-of-los-angeles-bureau-of-street-lighting.jpg,https://youtu.be/tVCxc_xD6Xo,8102026

Inspire.,"City Year Los Angeles connects Angelenos across the city to beautify school campuses, making them more welcoming, vibrant places for students to learn.  ","City Year Los Angeles will engage volunteers across the city to beautify some of the highest need school campuses in LAUSD. Together we will transform dozens of school campuses, making them more vibrant places for students to learn and grow. We will connect volunteers to the various vibrant neighborhoods that exist across Los Angeles, and will work together to help students feel a deeper connection to their communities and a greater sense of pride in their schools. ","Los Angeles is a city filled to bursting with diverse, vibrant communities. But for many in our city it can be easy to grow isolated within our own neighborhoods, and we donâ€™t always take the opportunity to experience all that is happening across Los Angeles. City Year Los Angeles seeks to connect Angelenos across community lines, bringing them together in the name of service. We will engage volunteers from all over the city to beautify school campuses in some of the highest need neighborhoods in Los Angeles. Together we will paint murals, tend gardens and build the necessary infrastructure to make every childâ€™s school an exciting place to learn. 

We believe that volunteerism and civic engagement are at the heart of building a strong democracy, and at the center of our organization is the conviction that no matter where someone lives, they should play an essential role in making sure their larger community is healthy and thriving. In fact, our service is founded in Martin Luther King, Jr.â€™s idea that â€œeveryone can be great, because everyone can serve.â€ It is our dream to engage every single Angeleno in one of our volunteer projects, giving each person an opportunity to give back to their community. When we volunteer in our schools, we show students that adults who arenâ€™t even from their communities care about them. Every child deserves to know that even if we donâ€™t always look like each other, we are there to look out for each other.

In addition to connecting Angelenos from all over the city, beautifying schools helps students feel safe, comfortable and at-home in their school environment. When we paint a schoolâ€™s walls we help ensure that every school is a space where a child is excited to learn. It is our hope that creating these spaces helps keep kids in school and invested in their education. We work closely on every project with a schoolâ€™s administration to make sure we are doing projects that align with a school's goals. Many of our elementary school partners are trying to promote a college-going culture on their campuses, so we paint college logos and examples of pathways to success to help manifest this culture of excellence. At our high schools we often paint murals that help generate school pride and bring together the student body as one unified community. We also paint school blacktops and handball courts with games and activities to help provide students with spaces to play as they learn. 

One example of our incredible impact is our annual Martin Luther King, Jr. Day of Service. On this day we connect over 800 people in volunteerism, including students, teachers, corporate partners, political leaders, community members and City Year AmeriCorps members and their families. Every year on this day we build bridges across town in order to transform a high school in need. At other projects throughout the year we engage students from independent schools and their families, as well as individuals from every sector and walk of life. ","It is our primary goal to connect Angelenos across communities in service. We will bring students together with adults from outside their communities, and will work closely with our corporate partners in order to ensure we have enough volunteers to complete service projects all over the city. We rely heavily on our corporate partners to recruit and bring in volunteers to help us complete our projects. Past corporate partners have included Comcast NBCUniversal, Sony, Aramark, Hulu, The LA Clippers, Starbucks, Holland & Knight, Dreamhost, The Wonderful Company, AT&T, TSA, The Honest Company, and the LA Rams. We also partner with independent schools in Los Angeles to complete service projects, helping students learn the value of service together with their families. Additionally, we engage our own Board of Directors and Associates Board to help bring together people from their networks to engage in projects. Of course, our most important partner and collaborator is the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD). We work closely with LAUSD to determine which schools most need our help and can benefit from our service. These are the places we most frequently deploy our volunteers. ","Evaluation and data are at the heart of our work at City Year Los Angeles. We know a Day of Service has been successful when our volunteers leave feeling engaged and educated about our work, and when a school is happy with the work we have done. In order to measure success with our volunteers, we use volunteer surveys. It is always our goal that based on these surveys, we maintain a Net Promotor Score of 90 or above for each project. This shows us that volunteers believe the day was enjoyable, well-organized, and had an impact on the community.

We determine our success with school partners via the survey we provide our principals and school administrators. The number one question we look to is whether or not a principal would recommend our services to another school. Our goal is that 100% of our partner principals will recommend our work, because we believe this means they considered our service to be impactful for their community. 

Over the two years of the LA2050 grant it is our goal to engage a minimum of 5,000 volunteers, who will beautify school campuses serving over 100,000 students, families and community members. Over the two years our volunteers will complete a minimum of 15,000 hours of service during which they will not only beautify school campuses, but also develop a deeper understanding of a school or community they may never have engaged with otherwise. 
","City Year Los Angeles currently deploys 270 AmeriCorps members to provide individualized academic services to students at 31 Los Angeles schools. When we engage with our volunteers at schools all over the city, it helps introduce our services to future partner schools and allows us to get acquainted with new community members. It is our hope that this activation will serve as a catalyst to further grow our services and partnerships in Los Angeles. Through our activation we will grow the number of corporations and individuals in the city who know about our work, and will also have the opportunity for forge new relationships with schools we havenâ€™t had an opportunity to work with yet. In five years we hope to be deploying even more AmeriCorps members, who will help us serve in more of Los Angelesâ€™ schools, and we hope to continue engaging even more partners and volunteers in our Civic Engagement work.","[""Rates of volunteerism""]","Los Angeles is a city filled to bursting with diverse, vibrant communities.

Common Senseâ€™s free English and Spanish-language online resources are linguistically and culturally relevant, and can activate the skills and knowledge that underserved families need to play an active role in their kidsâ€™ media and tech lives. A grant from LA2050 will fund our Latino Specialistâ€™s in-person trainings for parents and community-based organizations.","Common Sense is uniquely positioned to address the needs of Latino families in Los Angeles. Over the last year, Common Sense began efforts to broaden our reach to low-income Latino families in Los Angeles. We launched a new destination for Spanish-speaking families,  Common Sense Latino, which features all of our Spanish-language resources including blog posts, reviews, and advice content. This content development is led by specialists in Latino-focused communications and parent advice experts. Weâ€™ve also formed a Latino Advisory Council to help forge new partnerships with grassroots LA organizations serving Latino families. To date, weâ€™ve established partnerships with key organizations such as Abriendo Puertas and EveryoneOn/ConnectHome, as well as with several school districts, such as Compton Unified, that are interested in educating Latino families about media and technology.  

With support from LA 2050, we will strengthen our partnerships with these organizations as well as build relationships with additional nonprofits working with Latino families. These partnerships allow us to bring the content we are creating at the national level directly to parents locally.  Specifically, we will engage in the following activities: 

Facilitate parent workshops to help families understand the impact of media and how to best guide their kids - a unique opportunity for families who are not tech savvy to understand better the digital world, identify tools to support their kids goals, feel safe so they can learn. 

Create new and culturally-relevant content (English and Spanish) for families, including tip sheets, recommended lists, and other parent-facing resources covering a wide range of topics including:
*Helping families discover and use quality and age-appropriate media with their kids
*Establishing a healthy media diet, using technology to bond with kids, and media that brings family together
*Using media to support academic goals
*Supporting kids in being good digital citizens and discovering new ways that technology can empower kidsâ€™ learning at home and in school

Establish more partnerships with community organizations ( i.e. Para Los Ninos, First 5 LA) to disseminate our content with the families they serve.

Provide in-person training to community-based educators, who will then provide workshops to families on media and technology issues

Through these efforts, we will help kids build the skills they need to harness technology for learning and life - from using the internet safely and responsibly to using media and technology to optimize learning.  Our award-winning Digital Citizenship program covers media balance and well being, digital footprint and identity, privacy and safety, relationships and communication, digital drama, cyberbullying and hate speech, and news and media literacy.

We want to expand the range of these in-person trainings to other schools and community organizations so they may help more Spanish-speaking families understand the impact of media on their kids and teach them how they can play an active role in helping their kids harness media and potential to its full potential. Our content is readily sharable, and our train-the-trainer model facilitates easy adoption in schools and grass-root organizations. Our interactions on the ground in underserved communities, in turn, influence the creation of content at a national level that benefits all families through our social channels and media outlets.","Common Sense is committed to measuring the impact of our work. By the end of the grant period, we anticipate that we will have:

Our Reach:
At least 200-300 parents will have attended a parent workshop (via schools or community partners). These workshops offer a better understanding of the digital world, identify tools that support the educational goals of the family, and allow underserved parents to feel welcome in a safe environment for learning. 

Partnerships will be established with at least 4-5 community-based organizations in LA who will disseminate Common Sense content.

At least 100 community-based educators will be trained to provide workshops to families on media and technology issues. All participants in the train-the-trainer programs will receive recognition for being agents of changes in their community as a Common Sense Technology Champion.
 
Our Impact:
Through surveys of Los Angeles area parents:
At least 90% of parents and families will report that they were either â€œvery satisfiedâ€ or â€œsatisfiedâ€ with Common Sense sessions 
At least 90% of parents and families will report that our sessions were of â€œhigh qualityâ€ or â€œquality.â€ 
At least 85% of parents and families will report that they have higher levels of confidence in helping guide their kids to be good digital citizens
At least 80% of parents and families will report that they feel better educated on where they can go to access more information and support on digital tools to support learning at home
","In five years, we hope to have grown and fostered a community of parents and families who can guide their children towards success in the 21st Century.  We hope also to have learned how to best support these families, and that these lessons will inform content production for our national Latino resources. This will have been possible thanks to the support of organizations such as LA2050, who help us create culturally-relevant, research-based content that is disseminated to trusted partners (schools and nonprofits) through ongoing in-person trainings and consultations.","[""Proficiency in English and Language Arts and Math"",""Students’ perceived sense of safety at and on the way to school"",""Students’ immersion in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math content""]","Common Sense is uniquely positioned to address the needs of Latino families in Los Angeles.

Yet in the country that invented the Internet, nearly one in five Americans (64 million), disproportionately from low-income and minority communities, are not connected to the Internet at home, forcing them to use inconvenient public sources to access basic services. The global impact of the digital divide lies in how it compounds and deepens other social inequalities. For example, 80% of K-12 students need Internet to do homework, 90% of college applications are filled out online, and 90% of job applications are hosted online. An unemployed person who has Internet at home will be employed over seven weeks faster, due to availability of online job search platforms and advice, which translates into over $5,000 in additional income over a year.

EveryoneOn is committed to eliminating the digital divide by making high-speed, low-cost internet, computers/tablets, and free digital literacy training accessible to all unconnected people in the U.S. By employing a dynamic strategy through the Digital Equity Champion Initiative, we plan to connect low-income households throughout the county, a population that is dramatically underserved and the least likely to be connected. If we can eliminate the digital divide within low-income communities with this initiative, we can use connectivity to create social mobility for all. 

Connecting people to the internet creates opportunities for an abundance of connections. Internet connectivity is imperative in providing all Los Angeles students with access to early education programs, the capability to graduate from high school and be college and career ready, and acts as a key tool in parents ability to be engaged and empowered to direct their childrenâ€™s learning.  Connecting through social media, technological products and an increasingly interconnected society allows residents to feel like the world is their backyard. Today, the ultimate vehicle for opportunity is through the internet.","Working with local partner organizations that support low-income communities, we seek to add a question around home internet access to existing processes for various benefit and assistance programs. Our challenge will seek to increase capacity in each organization and highlight the increased return on investment through employee hours and increased access to online resources for residents. Being online is so critical for nearly everything you do today, from applying to social services to submitting job applications and turning in homework for students. It is imperative that stakeholder organizations that are anchors in their community be equipped with the tools and resources necessary to support residents attempting to navigate barriers to access. ","EveryoneOn on will track the number of low-income people in public housing who receive connectivity and get connected to the Internet at home, tracking outcomes in education post connectivity. In short, not only will we track the actual number of Internet adoptions, but the benefits of which these adoptions yield long term results in regards to educational progress and economic mobility. Through local data collection, on the ground surveys, standardized questions, and real time evaluations, we will be able to analyze the effectiveness of our outputs versus outcomes, measuring our findings against comparable data. Rigorous monitoring and evaluation for EveryoneOn thus far has yielded useful insights which have guided our overall operations. In addition, we plan to highlight success stories to help show the real life impact that digital inclusion provides.","We hope that this activation will allow us to sunset our efforts in Los Angeles County because the work of digital inclusion will be integrated in existing processes within anchor organizations and community stakeholders that are already doing work with low-income populations. By empowering the organizations to take up this work, we will no longer be needed.","[""Access to free wifi"",""Total number of local social media friends and connections Angelenos have""]","Technology has changed the way we do business, pursue education, find jobs, and communicate. Yet in the country that invented the Internet, nearly one in five Americans (64 million), disproportionately from low-income and minority communities, are not connected to the Internet at home, forcing them to use inconvenient public sources to access basic services. The global impact of the digital divide lies in how it compounds and deepens other social inequalities. For example, 80% of K-12 students need Internet to do homework, 90% of college applications are filled out online, and 90% of job applications are hosted online. An unemployed person who has Internet at home will be employed over seven weeks faster, due to availability of online job search platforms and advice, which translates into over $5,000 in additional income over a year.

8102031,8102031,Coro Southern Californiaâ€™s Neighborhood Leaders Program: Cultivating Leaders to Empower Communities,"Coroâ€™s Neighborhood Leaders Program (NLP) trains emerging leaders from South LA in civic leadership and public affairs, preparing them to enact meaningful change within their communities.","Coroâ€™s Neighborhood Leaders Program (NLP) is a nine-month, part-time program that provides a cohort of 25 emerging leaders from South LA with leadership training to solve complex challenges in their community, effectuate lasting change, and activate thousands of other community members to do the same. NLP cultivates South LA leaders through a cross-sectoral skill-building immersion, equipping participants with the skills, knowledge, and networks to enact impactful change in their communities.","Coroâ€™s mission is to strengthen the democratic process by preparing emerging leaders for effective and ethical leadership in public affairs. For over 60 years, Coro Southern California has used the city as its classroom to teach rising leaders from across sectors how Southern California works so they can make it better. Today, Coroâ€™s multiple leadership development programs continue to strengthen the regionâ€™s leadership pipeline by cultivating a community of alumni who are shaping the future of Los Angeles.

NLP will bring Coroâ€™s proven training methodology to South LA community leaders and equip them with the skills they need to understand complex policy issues and effectively enact impactful change in their communities. Program participants will also gain an in-depth understanding of city and county government, political campaigns, and large-scale community organizing efforts.

Through the program components outlined below, participants will gain the knowledge, skills and network to directly impact three metrics outlined under LA2050â€™s CONNECT goal: (1) government responsiveness to residentsâ€™ needs; (2) increased participation in neighborhood councils; (3) and increased rates of volunteerism.

1) Interviews: Through inquiry-based exploration, NLP participants will interview leaders across the public, private, and nonprofit sectors in South LA, helping participants to build key relationships and expand their social capital, learn important subject matter from experts, and build strategies to advocate for their communities.
2) Issue Days: Each cohort will travel the region to explore policy issues and complex community challenges. Participants will come away with in-depth knowledge of the issues persistent in their neighborhoods, and the resolve to enact change.
3) Group Projects: NLP cohorts will engage in group projects, immediately applying the program tools and knowledge gained to navigating complex challenges with high levels of ambiguity. This includes a Neighborhood Logic Study, where the cohort will collectively study and present on the â€œlogicâ€ of their community.
4) Seminar Training: Participants will engage in leadership development, reflective practice, and hard skills training through a variety of analytical tools and frameworks used to train civic leaders for over 60 years.
5) Community Change Projects: NLP participants will apply their program learnings and newly expanded networks to launch community change projects addressing the salient challenges theyâ€™ve identified and explored throughout their experience.

NLPâ€™s core goal is to connect community leaders in South LA to each other and to the civic network in the region. Through this cohort-based, experiential learning, participants will not only be more inclined to run for Neighborhood Council seats, engage their elected officials to respond to their needs, and increase the rate of volunteerism; they will have the skills to activate and guide thousands more to do the same.","NLP will help current and emerging local community leaders from underserved communities in South LA to develop stronger civic leadership skills that enable them to be more effective leaders within their communities and our city. Through Coroâ€™s proven methodology of cross-sectoral, inquiry-based, experiential learning, participants are given the skills, resolve, and networks to champion meaningful change in South LA and activate thousands of other community members to do the same. Participants will be those who reside and/or work in South LA, age 18 or older, who currently volunteer to support an organization or institution within their community. Examples include school PTAs, faith-based organizations, neighborhood councils, or local non-profits. 

NLP will involve leadership development seminars each month exploring topics such as community asset mapping, effective inquiry, and reflective practice. Seminars will be coupled with one-day issue explorations each month: a deep dive inquiry-based investigation into the challenges most prevalent in South LA. These Issue Days will involve interviews with leaders across sectors to provide participants with multiple point of views to analyze. At the programâ€™s conclusion, each participant will launch a community change project to use their newfound leadership skills, frameworks, and connections to bring concrete improvements to their community. ","By participating in NLP, South LA neighborhood leaders will:

â—Examine challenges facing their South LA communities;
â—Employ Coro methodology of inquiry and reflection through interviews with leaders in the community and group debriefs, giving participants invaluable insight on what it takes to be a leader in the region;
â—Expand leadership capacity through exposure to Coroâ€™s leadership tools and frameworks;
â—Build and bridge social capital through group learning processes and team management towards common purposes;
â—Demonstrate project management skills through the development of a community change project;
â—Build and expand social capital by deepening their networks across the region.

Success for the program will be measured in a variety of ways. The first is through pre-program participant surveys assessing: 1) prior access to leadership development; 2) prior access to hard skill development; and 3) proficiency in various skills, including presentations, project management, written communication, team management, and understanding of leadership frameworks. Post-program surveys will collect self-reported proficiencies in these skills as a result of participation in NLP. Coro will also measure the impact of participantsâ€™ community change projects by assessing how many people have been or will be affected by the project, and will evaluate qualitative data from participants and partner organizations on the impact both felt and observed as a result of NLP participation.","In 5 years, Coro will have trained approximately 125 community leaders in South LA who are continuing to implement their Community Change Projects in their neighborhoods and communities. Armed with Coroâ€™s proven tools and wide network, NLP participants will have the ability to effectively activate and engage the residents of South LA, creating concrete, lasting impacts that will continue to strengthen and revitalize the region. Additionally, NLP will be positioned to launch in other communities in Los Angeles, allowing Coro to expand its impact and reach in Southern California.","[""Government responsiveness to residents’ needs"",""Participation in neighborhood councils"",""Rates of volunteerism""]","Coro’s mission is to strengthen the democratic process by preparing emerging leaders for effective and ethical leadership in public affairs.

Local Sharing Network co-ops create an opportunity for all care workers to both co-own and get paid for operating their neighborhood sharing infrastructure including Internet access, renewable power generation, and storage. New sharing technologies enhance existing community social sharing with Internet communications, logistics, paid remote work, and free all-ages educational resources.","* Access to free WiFi will be part of any partner 501(c)(4) Local Shares Network community welfare mission. 
* Adults, especially in unpaid care work, will get more social & emotional support in the co-ownership and operation of these networks. 
* Government responsiveness to residentsâ€™ needs will increase with more ready access to online government resources. 
* Travel time to work will be negligible for new hyperlocal and telecommuting jobs. 
* Percentage of public transit riders will increase to networked coworking hubs in each neighborhood served, and as a result of more previous vehicle commuters now working from home.
* Participation in neighborhood councils and other local volunteerism will become more convenient as home care workers are allowed to stay nearby all day, with no long commutes between local functions.
* Total number of local social connections among Angelenos will increase with cooperative membership.
* Online resources and local coordination groups will allow political messages and voting process updates to be communicated more readily around each service neighborhood.
","This will make connections more affordable for all Angelenos, and bring connectivity where currently none is affordable or readily available. Richer communities will be able to afford better access, complementary services, and local cache offsets to remote Internet and power services. Lower income communities will obtain subsidies for charitable class home installations, co-op membership, and increased access to local and remote jobs online or in local network maintenance. Home care providers in particular (who are still disproportionately women and mothers) will be recruited and trained in routine network maintenance for their local cooperative, in order to both provide them with better paying on-call jobs and prevent the high expenses of site visits and truck rolls from remote service centers. These home and hyperlocal work forces will also act as the front line of customer service and novel service studies for each neighborhood cooperative, to give them each a faster lead in customer innovation testing and scalable demand assessments.
","We will count the number of neighborhoods adopting local cooperative sharing network organizing methods; total members per cooperative; and fraction of new local membership employed as in situ network infrastructure installers, maintainers, and on-call repair staff. We will specifically reach out to at-home care workers as existing neighborhood social leaders, with training opportunities as paid infrastructure installers and maintainers.","Every self-defined community or Neighborhood Council district within LA City, and major portions of LA County, will have member-owned Local Shares Network co-ops, operated in whole or part by neighborhood connected home care workers (who are no longer as disproportionately women). Thousands of new local and remote-online jobs will be created in these service areas, and millions more Angelenos will have the same or better bandwidth connections to the Internet at much lower aggregate service costs.

By engaging vendors, small businesses, manufacturers, public officials, and food lovers from across our diverse city, we seek to grow security and opportunity for an innovative street food industry that contributes to LAâ€™s vibrant food culture and economy.","Street vending is an iconic part of LA culture, and a clear pathway to economic opportunity for 50,000 micro-entrepreneurs who sell food and goods on the sidewalks of LA. Approximately 80% are women of color who contribute to the rich, diverse street food landscape through the informal economy. They bring healthy, affordable, culturally diverse food to Angelenos, and when allowed to do their work legally and safely, contribute to the economic vitality of their neighborhoods and our city as a whole.

The LA Street Vendor Campaign organizes and advocates for rights for street vendors as an important part of an inclusive and equitable LA economy. Through this activation we seek to mobilize a broad base of Angelenos to learn about and get involved in this important economic justice issue. We will also engage street vendors, businesses and manufacturers to work together to safeguard street vending as a viable and valuable asset to neighborhood-based economies in LA.  

Our activation has multiple pathways to engagement for Angelenos and includes: 1) Information: a dynamic public outreach campaign on social media that will activate over 100,000 Angelenos by tapping into the extensive membership base of our 65 coalition member organizations; 2) Participation: concrete opportunities for a diverse cross-sector of Angelenos to make their voices heard in the new policy formation by participating in public hearings and engaging their representatives; 3) Action: a #isupportLAstreetvendors â€œbuycottâ€ will be part of a digital activism strategy to activate Angelenos around the campaign. 

Our activation will also include vital capacity building for street vendors to succeed and thrive, with training on how to navigate permitting, business development, and relationship building with manufacturers for supplies and equipment. And, through outreach and organizing we will work to get small business owners, manufacturers, policy makers, and street vendors working together to make the LA economy equitable and inclusive for micro-entrepreneurs, recognizing the economic benefits they bring to their communities. 

This activation will impact the CREATE metrics by: fostering entrepreneurship and increasing secure employment in the culinary arts, among the most vibrant creative industries in our city; making the local economy more inclusive and diverse, increasing both jobs for and businesses owned by women and people of color; impacting the GINI coefficient by allowing low-income entrepreneurs to generate more wealth; and engaging the manufacturing industry to supply critical equipment and supplies to street vendors at prices scaled to their small enterprise. Los Angeles is and has always been a hub for creativity and innovation. We hope to build the movement for economic opportunity for thousands of Angelenos by activating local engagement and civic participation to build an equitable, inclusive economic future for our communities.","Our activation creates clear, accessible pathways for engagement for uninvolved consumers, street vendor champions, and anyone in between. We will make LA the best place to create using the following activation strategies:

-Policy Advocacy: LASVC is advocating for a fair sidewalk vending permit program by 2019. This activation will amplify the collective efforts of our broad coalition to ensure an equitable vendor-driven policy is adopted by the City.
-Street Vendor Training: We will educate street vendors on important rules and regulations, business best practices, and beneficial supply-chain relationships.
-Business & Manufacturing Outreach: We will actively bridge relationships with brick-and-mortar businesses, business associations and improvement districts, chambers of commerce, and manufacturers of equipment and supplies, whose collaboration and support is vital to economic inclusion for vendors.
-Civic Participation: From social media outreach to participation in public hearings, there are multiple avenues for Angelenos to join the campaign to support street vendors to win an equitable street vending policy.
-Digital Activism and Consumer Support: Our online outreach campaign will build our support base, garnering visibility through social media and influencers such as food bloggers and radio hosts. We will also mobilize consumers through a social media hashtag â€œbuycottâ€ to leverage buying power in support of street vendors as a way to contribute to the local economy.","We will define and measure success based on the relevant CREATE metrics and progress toward the following goals:

-100,000 Angelenos reached through social media to learn about LASVC and issues facing vendors. Initial outreach targets the membership of 65 coalition member organizations.
-10,000 Angelenos participate in online posts and petitions advocating for an equitable street vending policy.
-2,000 Angelenos participate in â€œbuycottâ€ tracked by using the hashtag â€œ#isupportLAstreetvendorsâ€ in social media posts.
-500 street vendors, primarily women and people of color, trained to secure their businesses, including how to navigate the policy/permitting process (when passed by City), build connections with public, private and manufacturing sector, and business management.
-400 small businesses (including BIDs, business associations and chambers of commerce) engaged to support a sensible street vending policy that includes their concerns and ensures equity and inclusion for vendors.
-300 street vendors participate in research project that tracks increase in income generation and decrease in losses as a result of new policy implementation and activation challenge.
-200 new micro-enterprise jobs created when legalization brings economic security and safety that will bolster vendors ability to expand their businesses and create jobs in a favorable policy environment.
-5-10 manufacturers engaged to provide equipment and supplies to street vendors at discounted rates.","In five years from now, we hope that street vending is a legal, viable, and secure form of employment, particularly for immigrant entrepreneurs of color and women of color. We hope to see the outcomes of this activation become an integral part of the LA economy and civic culture. In many cases, street vending is a pathway towards household wealth building that creates pathways out of poverty for thousands of families living in Los Angeles. In five years time we hope to see successful street vendors activating city sidewalks, contributing to local economic activity, growing their businesses into food trucks, moving into brick-and-mortar establishments and creating more creative culinary jobs. Ultimately, we envision a City that values and supports street vendors, and sees them as contributors to the economic and cultural tapestry of Los Angeles.","[""Jobs per capita"",""Manufacturing activity"",""Minority- and women-owned firms""]","Street vending is an iconic part of LA culture, and a clear pathway to economic opportunity for 50,000 micro-entrepreneurs who sell food and goods on the sidewalks of LA. Approximately 80% are women of color who contribute to the rich, diverse street food landscape through the informal economy. They bring healthy, affordable, culturally diverse food to Angelenos, and when allowed to do their work legally and safely, contribute to the economic vitality of their neighborhoods and our city as a whole.
 
 
 
 The LA Street Vendor Campaign organizes and advocates for rights for street vendors as an important part of an inclusive and equitable LA economy. Through this activation we seek to mobilize a broad base of Angelenos to learn about and get involved in this important economic justice issue. We will also engage street vendors, businesses and manufacturers to work together to safeguard street vending as a viable and valuable asset to neighborhood-based economies in LA. 
 
 
 
 Our activation has multiple pathways to engagement for Angelenos and includes: 1) Information: a dynamic public outreach campaign on social media that will activate over 100,000 Angelenos by tapping into the extensive membership base of our 65 coalition member organizations; 2) Participation: concrete opportunities for a diverse cross-sector of Angelenos to make their voices heard in the new policy formation by participating in public hearings and engaging their representatives; 3) Action: a #isupportLAstreetvendors “buycott” will be part of a digital activism strategy to activate Angelenos around the campaign. 
 
 
 
 Our activation will also include vital capacity building for street vendors to succeed and thrive, with training on how to navigate permitting, business development, and relationship building with manufacturers for supplies and equipment. And, through outreach and organizing we will work to get small business owners, manufacturers, policy makers, and street vendors working together to make the LA economy equitable and inclusive for micro-entrepreneurs, recognizing the economic benefits they bring to their communities.

8102036,8102036,Back to Basics: Transforming How Angelenos Connect,"Using service and play to humanize, connect, and empower Angelenos from all walks of life.","By 2020 Eayikes brings empowerment to thousands of LA youth and adults through school programs and public events. For students we expand upon our empathy and self-esteem programs, which focus on exposure to outside communities through experiential field trips and courage through vulnerability-based activities. For adults we expand upon our human connection and personal growth programs, which focus on self-reflection and paying-it-forward as instruments for developing community and fulfillment.","Eayikes builds bridges within, and between, people - connecting participants more deeply with themselves and creating moments of empathy-building with each other. Whether itâ€™s a field trip, community service project, workshop, weekend camp, or social event, what we create is an uninhibited space. Itâ€™s within this environment of wonder we begin the work of building belief in self and the road to empowerment. The next layer is utilizing the powerful diversity within our city, the richness of the human experience, and bringing participants from all walks of life together.
Our current community of youth and adults is far-reaching. Eayikes programs serve teens of Hollywood movie producers to Skid Row residents. Itâ€™s through the power of this diversity that we begin to plant seeds of compassion and a care for the â€œotherâ€ through the recognition of shared humanity. Ultimately we believe for someone to take action, to actually take time out of their day-to-day lives to engage with the world around them (and the issues affecting their neighbor), he/she must either feel an emotional connection to that affected person(s) or to the people engaging in the activity together. This is how we build community and, at the very core, relationships between people becoming empowered.
For the young people we work with, role-modeling is the most powerful tool in creating a safe space to connect and explore. Our programming always starts with play, such as improv games and partner introduction activities, which teach the practice of stepping into oneâ€™s authentic self. We break down the fear of judgement and this process is transformational. From this place of empowerment we then create opportunities for youth to reflect and share about their life experiences - celebrating differences and embracing commonalities. Whether itâ€™s young people from low-income and high-income communities camping together or young people realizing their personal greatness and belief in themselves, itâ€™s the micro breakdowns of barriers that, over time, lead to macro breakthroughs. And as much as youth are in-need, over the course of 5 years of experimentation and programming, weâ€™ve found adults to be equally in-need of this barrier breaking work. 
Weâ€™ve learned how as we grow older adults lose touch of their childlike-wonder; becoming hardened and jaded by the ways of the world. As guides, we reconnect adults back to themselves by providing respites from the hustle of life and opportunities to engage in fulfilling enrichment. We are seeing our adult participants growing in their capacity to see themselves as agents of change, and finding immense emotional support in our uninhibited spaces of self-reflection and sharing. We utilize the power of paying-it-forward and the fun within our community-building programming to draw more adults into this social and emotional support system.","Currently we target high-income West LA and low-income Long Beach communities of students. Weâ€™ve developed two school contracts, and are in the process of developing at least 4 more for the 2018-2019 school year. The programs focus on community-building within cohorts of grades, helping release students from the burdens of self-consciousness through activities that push past comfort zones, and community service & exposure trips through community partnerships.
Our population of adults come from a middle-class, 26-38 age range. Weâ€™ve found that this demographic in LA is in the midst of experiencing the grind of their own professional work that leaves community and fulfillment overlooked. For this audience we create evening workshops and weekend community service projects. As we build the community throughout the year, we then create larger-scale functions, like our festival-like campout. This includes the already communal-vibe with added on social layers of music, art, and big group experience.
Weâ€™ve never allowed financial status be a barrier to participation. Since the beginning our programs have been available to all as to create as much diversity as possible. We fundraise to provide equal access regardless of financial situation.","Our ultimate barometer of success comes in the form of participants taking their Eayikes experience into their own communities, becoming agents of change within their social circles. This would take the form of activations sprouting outside of our direct efforts, of which we could be asked to consult and support through our base.
Other metrics are increased attendance of unique participants and retention of past participants. 
Continual pre and post survey quantitative data measuring the metrics above, as well as qualitative testimonials and content capturing will keep us on track.","In 5 years we hope to be across California, state lines, and international, bridging together communities around the world. We have a vision for bringing young people around the world to develop global mindsets through service-learning, the Eayikes way. Weâ€™ve already experimented with a service project in Tijuana, bringing our Eayikes Communitaaaay adults to volunteer at an orphanage. Additionally, building a beacon of diversity in Los Angeles through our own community center would be the next audacious goal - rooting Eayikes physically in a lower-socioeconomic area, partnering with local businesses, organizations, and schools, and bridging relationships into higher-socioeconomic areas by facilitating programs for all people in the space.","[""Adults getting sufficient social & emotional support"",""Rates of volunteerism"",""Total number of local social media friends and connections Angelenos have""]","Eayikes builds bridges within, and between, people - connecting participants more deeply with themselves and creating moments of empathy-building with each other.

8102037,8102037,#NextStopCleanAir: Electric School Buses for LA's Kids,"Worried about the smog affecting our kidsâ€™ health? Join students, parents, teachers, and the community to put 100 percent clean, electric buses on school bus routes across LA by 2030! ","We seek to run a campaign to transition Los Angelesâ€™ old and polluting school buses to new, clean and safe electric buses. Our coalition will engage and activate 100,000 students, parents, teachers, and community members in the effort. This activation will not only affect change in the short term, but because we are focusing on young people, it also will help build an enduring movement for clean air, a healthy climate, and good jobs.","When people think of Los Angeles, they think of the incredible mix of cultures that make up the backbone of our city, the sunshine, and maybe the beach. But they also likely think of the traffic and the smog, and their effects on our environment and our kids. Itâ€™s true that in our state, emissions from our transportation system accounts for a majority of the emissions that lead to climate change, and dirty air days are on the rise for the last three years running. These impacts are magnified on our cityâ€™s kids, leading to an astounding million days of missed school for kids suffering from respiratory problems, who travel to and from school on polluting school buses powered by dirty energy we donâ€™t need. It shouldnâ€™t be this way. Through intentional policies, we have the power to end this problem and create a more livable, breathable, and greener city for allâ€”most importantly for our youngest residentsâ€”while creating pathways into good, clean manufacturing jobs for youth and underserved communities. 

Every weekday, over 40,000 kids and hundreds of bus drivers and climb aboard 1,300 school buses around Los Angeles. But what if these school buses were powered by electricity, generated from the sun and the wind? The LA County Electric Bus Coalition is working to convince the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) to take a critical step towards making our city the best place to live, cleaning up our air and creating a safer, healthier climate for the kids of today and tomorrow by transitioning its old polluting school buses to new, clean and safe electric buses by 2030 or sooner, that are manufactured right here in Southern California. 

Our coalition has already had two major successes that are laying the groundwork for an all-electric school bus fleet. First, we convinced LA Metro to make a historic commitment to transition its fleet of more than 2,400 buses to electric buses by 2030. Second, we won a commitment from the LA City Council to transition the Department of Transportationâ€™s 350 buses to electric by 2030 or sooner. Together, both commitments represent more than a quarter of all transit buses in the state.

We know how to win this fight, and it will take Angelenos of all stripes to make it happen. We will activate 100,000 students, teachers, parents and community members in our campaign, engaging them in activations as simple as signing a petition to training a teacher to turn out her students to an event in support of electric buses to engaging young people to monitor air quality on their daily bus commutes. The members of the LA County Electric Bus Coalition are committed to empowering kids to become leaders in their communities and build the movement fighting for a better city for decades to come, cleaning up our air, and creating good jobs for the region.
","Our activation aims to engage Los Angeles students, teachers, parents, and the broader community to build a clean air future for our city, starting with electrifying school buses. Through our activation, we will not only win a tangible improvement in health and air quality, but also help support the development of youth leaders that can use the skills learned in this campaign to advocate for broader change for the rest of their lives. We plan to:
 
Activate 60,000 Angelenos via a compelling digital organizing campaign using our websites, social media, text alerts and more;

Organize 15,000 students, teachers, parents and community members through on-the-ground trainings and workshops to advocate for a clean, electric bus future; 

Activate students to apply for modest stipends to run projects designed to activate a combined total of 10,000 peers and parents within their community in support of electric school buses; selected projects, supported by the coalition, will also incorporate scholarships for the most fully realized projects; 

Empower teachers through a small grant competition to develop electric school bus related projects. Combined, teachers will activate 10,000 students;

Work with 5,000 students at LAUSD and Community College District schools like Rio Hondo and Antelope Valley to ensure that there is a robust pipeline from historically marginalized communities into careers in transportation electrification.
","Our activation tactics are intended to meet Angelenos where they are at and deepen their engagement in the movement, ensuring a ladder of engagement that gives everyone starting out with our campaign the tools and resources to develop and take on more leadership over time. Our activation tactics combine light engagement with deep engagement, providing pathways for leaders to carry the work forward after the two-year activation ends. Itâ€™s critical that this activation effort build a durable, long-term movement for clean air, green careers, and a healthy, equitable environment.

As organizers, we meet people where theyâ€™re at, and today that means activating people on social media. Through Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, along with emails, text messaging, and other digital tools, we will activate Angelenos in a variety of tactics from tweetstorms to petitions, phone calls and more. Engagement means anyone who takes a specific, tangible action, whether itâ€™s signing a petition, volunteering, placing a call, or asking their peers to get involved. 

In addition to our digital work, we will be organizing on the ground with young people and parents across LA, from the classroom, to events, trainings, workshops, and more. Folks who get involved will be given opportunities to get more engaged. Activation means taking an action at school, at home, or in our communities, whether it be a petition, attending an event, or participating in a workforce development program.","We hope that this activation for electric school buses serves to strengthen the movement for a zero-emissions, equitable future in LA county. Each of our campaigns seeks to build on the previous campaign to support the next. We believe this campaign is winnable based, in part, on the work of our coalition to transition agencies like LADOT and LA Metro to 100 percent electric buses. Collectively, our campaigns build a legacy of good jobs in manufacturing electric buses, installing electric infrastructure, and engaging the public in the effort to clean up our air, fight climate change, and build a fairer economy. In five years, we hope to be running campaigns to electrify the regionâ€™s trucks, street sweepers, garbage trucks, and more, all the while using those policies to create the good jobs LA County needs to support historically excluded communities access good careers.","[""Exposure to air toxins"",""Resilient communities""]","When people think of Los Angeles, they think of the incredible mix of cultures that make up the backbone of our city, the sunshine, and maybe the beach.

Family Adventures will provide weekly activities to bring families together in local nature destinations in and around Los Angeles to cultivate family bonds, build community, and allow children and families to play.","According to the Nature of Americans, the connection to nature is not a dispensable amenity but, rather, is essential to the health, economic prosperity, quality of life, and social well-being of all Americans. EverWild combines this with 21st Century Skills (collaboration, teamwork, creativity, imagination, critical thinking, and problem solving).

Family Adventures is a weekly opportunity for families to connect with the outdoors in a supportive environment at local nature destinations. Community partners will provide space for EverWild and highlight events and activities offered at the local destination. Every adventure, following a similar framework, offers child and family-led decision making, open play, and connection to nature. Family members will choose from activities and will have free time to explore and play on their own. Experts in various fields or from the destination will be a resource and meet with families to provide information and/or an interactive activity. Family Adventure allows both the child and parent/guardian to explore and learn, grow in confidence and knowledge, and build community-growth values with other families. Each adventure is followed by a survey to provide feedback, suggestions for locations and activities, and opportunities for families to take the lead in upcoming events.  

The Environmental Conservancy Program (ECP) is an after school program that works with youth ages 11-17. ECP combines environmental stewardship, positive youth development practices such as involving and engaging youth as equal partners (youth.gov), implementing evidence-based standards to conduct meaningful service learning (National Youth Leadership Council), and open play. Led by qualified staff, youth work together to develop a long-term project to create a positive impact and meaningful change. EverWild will offer cohorts throughout the year at community gardens and the Santa Monica Mountain Range. Based on youth interest, the group will design their own project. ECP offers a high staff to youth ratio to allow seamless integration if youth want to participate after the initial start date. Projects include composting, engaging businesses in green practices, and sustainable trail maintenance techniques.  

To increase access, EverWild will continue to develop partnerships with open space and park facilities to host activities and to present events, programs, internships, summer employment, and volunteer opportunities they offer. EverWild will offer client support for public transportation and van rentals to bring young people and families to and from program, as needed. EverWild will document partnerships with memorandums of understanding, letters of agreement, and written communication with open spaces.

EverWild will provide client support such as gas cards of public transportation costs allowing youth and families with transportation barriers access to EverWild programs. Additional strategies include developing nature destinations and partnerships closer to community areas where youth and families are signing up for program. This â€œon-wheelsâ€ model allows for EverWild to easily replicate and expand services. EverWild has provided programming at over twenty natural destinations including community gardens, park districts, museums, recreation areas, and beaches.  

EverWild will use multiple strategies to engage Angelenos from the westside and Central LA communities: (1) Social media including Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and other on-line platforms including Crowdsourcing (to increase volunteerism), Eventbrite, e-mails, and on-line newsletters, (2) Community, business, and partner marketing strategies including newspapers such as the Argonaut, flyers, posters, and co-planned events, and (3) Community and neighborhood fairs, markets, and festivals such as the LA Nature Fest held by the Natural History Museum. EverWild is committed to using culturally competent language in all marketing strategies, including translating all documentation to meet family language needs. ","EverWild uses both LA2050 and agency metrics to measure success. EverWild defines and measures success by: (1) Amount of open spaces/partners, (2) Number of individuals and families that attend program, (3) Number of children that participate in either ECP or at the open spaces/partners that EverWild introduces, (4) Number of participating businesses, (5) Percentage in changes or influence of individual behaviors, and (6) Number of volunteers at EverWild.  
EverWild utilizes the following benchmarks to define and measure success specific to programs, as well. For ECP, EverWild tracks (1) Number of youth participating, (2) Number of youth that demonstrate growth in 21st Century skills (collaboration, teamwork, creativity, imagination, critical thinking, and problem solving) using the General Self-Efficacy Scale, (3) Number of youth that demonstrate growth in technical skills such as gardening and composting using pre/post skills assessments, (4) Number of community and business partners involved, (5) Retention rates, and (6) Family engagement. For Family Adventures, EverWild utilizes the following benchmarks: (1) Number of families and individuals participating in Family Adventure, (2) Number of individuals that access EverWild resources and website, (3) Number of returning families, (4) Number of families and children that attend additional programming at partner organizations. EverWild also provides youth and family satisfaction surveys for continued improvement. ","EverWildâ€™s goals include creating a strong community for families invested in the nature immersion philosophy and an opportunity to replicate and expand programming to more communities in Los Angeles. Within five years, the goal is to create an online community forum to increase nature immersion resources for families and educators, increase community building through the lens of nature immersion, build tools for families to increase bonding and a methodology to encourage child-led activities within the family, and increase professional development tools for nature immersion practitioners. EverWildâ€™s mission is to intentionally create a pipeline for young people to continue nature education and participate in the EverWild Way throughout their childhood, young adulthood, and as parents. While EverWild is mainly serving the Westside and Central Los Angeles communities, the goal is offer ongoing Environmental Conservancy Program (ECP) and Family Adventures at multiple locations throughout the city of Los Angeles to offer all residents an opportunity to engage with nature in a meaningful and hands-on way: the EverWild Way.","[""Access to open space and park facilities"",""Number (and quality) of informal spaces for play"",""Number of children enrolled in afterschool programs""]","According to the Nature of Americans, the connection to nature is not a dispensable amenity but, rather, is essential to the health, economic prosperity, quality of life, and social well-being of all Americans.

We have been talking to City and County personnel and pitching this idea to a variety of groups but have never been able to show it to anyone.  

This grant would allow us to build an actual small location to convince government and communities that this idea is a real solution to the homeless problem.","Tiny Cities LA: 
A holistic solution to solving the homeless crisis today
Tiny Cities LA, in conjunction with its partners â€“ ModPod Solutions;  Dept of Architecture & Design, Los Angeles Trade Technical College; and Nick Rasmussen, Executive Director of Family Promise of the South Bay â€“ intends to build Tiny Cities (â€œTCâ€™sâ€) throughout Los Angeles County.
The team will utilize volunteers to identify vacant land in all sizes throughout the County, and to determine ownership.  Small parcels that are geographically close to other vacant land would allow resources to be spread among the TCâ€™s within close proximity of each other.  Public transportation corridors, particularly LA Metro, are ideal building areas, and legislation pending in Sacramento relative to building along public transportation corridors may facilitate this project.
Our homeless agency partner will be instrumental in helping to determine the homeless needs in each community:  chronic? drug, alcohol, other mental illness? temporarily homeless families?  need education or employment skills?  skilled but without employment?
LATTC design students have drawn the ideal TC space, with the number of residents on approximately Â½ block equaling 96.  Resources will fit the population, with nutritional food being primary in every community.
For the chronically homeless, access to mental health and basic medical services are likely important.  Families may need educational and vocational counseling, access to computers, and creative â€œmaker-spaces.â€  All of these would be undertaken with experts in the field and with engaged community volunteers.
The cargo containers themselves will have a basic living space layout;  these can be modified easily for the number of people to be housed in a unit.  Architectural students have developed vertical trellises, kinetic canopies for roof gardens, 3D printing recycled fences and tensegrity towers to create, identify and help the energy network in some of their designs.  All TCâ€™s will utilize renewable energy and sustainable solutions to the maximum extent possible.
Units have air conditioning and heating, can be designed back-to-back or multi-layered to provide for more living space, and only have to be hooked up to water to be functional.  Pumping the black water is the only on-going maintenance.  Units on the ground floor will meet ADA accessibility standards.  
The LATTC design team has worked for over 10 years developing this idea, with partnerships in architecture, engineering and construction, as well as product manufacture.
Building in costs for stairs, painting, landscaping and other creative aspects, it is estimated that 2 people could be housed for $100,000.  

The LA2050 grant would allow our team to build a prototype in the County that would clearly show the integrity of this concept.  ModPod Solutions, the cargo container provider, will adapt its costs to assure that one resource unit and one housing unit can be built on the designated TC#1.

","Our project intends to engage the 50-60,000 homeless individuals in the County so we design the exteriors and interiors of these spaces to meet their needs and lifestyle.  Our vision is to place people in a Tiny City that best meets their personal needs, whether they are chronically homeless and need to move around, or whether they are temporarily homeless and need a stable family environment for a period of time while they get back on their feet.

We want to engage neighborhoods where we select the empty lots so residents can be helped to feel comfortable about the project;  and we want to use volunteers in each community to help with the resource offering and the maintenance of the premises.  We plan to reach out to homeless agencies within each community to determine how best to engage and utilize these citizens.
","If we are successful in building a prototype in any community, the project will be successful.  This will show that we can secure the land and permitting, and we can engage the community in supporting the project.  Once we have built one, others will want to implement this idea!","We hope to be providing low cost housing throughout Los Angeles County, wherever there is vacant land, to eradicate the homeless problem and alleviate the cost of housing for struggling families.","[""Housing affordability"",""Number of households below the self-sufficiency standard"",""Rates of homelessness""]","Tiny Cities LA:

A free community screening at the 2019 LA Film Festival will feature a selection of these films, followed by a discussion and networking event.","LA is one of the most diverse places on earth and is home to people from every country and culture. It is also home to the film industry â€“ a place that falls dramatically short of reflecting the diversity of Los Angeles. To quote Mayor Garcetti, â€œWhen â€˜Oscars So Whiteâ€™ and â€˜Timeâ€™s Upâ€™ put a spotlight on inequality in Hollywood, they captured the frustrations of people shut out of the opportunity in what the world knows as LAâ€™s signature industry.â€ With Made in LA, we aim to open the door for those opportunities, giving a voice to everyone in LA and creating a more connected sense of community by including these important stories in the conversation. We will empower 50 filmmakers (or 50 filmmaker teams) to show us their LA through a series of shorts to be featured as part of an online interactive map and with select films premiering at the LA Film Festival.

Film Independent will host an open call for community members to submit short films inspired by a three-part prompt: 1) show us your LA, 2) tell us who you are and 3) speak to your future hopes for your neighborhood or the county. There will be no cost to submit, eliminating barriers for filmmakers. Submissions will be solicited via outreach to film schools, LA-based cultural organizations, Film Independent online presence (one million subscribers) and more. All submissions will be reviewed by our Digital Content and LA Film Festival programming team. 50 short works will be selected to represent every corner of the countyâ€”from Malibu to East LA and from Long Beach to the Valley. Creators will be diverse, representing an inclusive spectrum of race, gender, ability, sexuality, immigration status and socio-economic status. Likewise, creators are encouraged to explore the prompt across a variety of genres.

The call for entries will be announced at the LA Film Festival in September 2018. Allowing time to finalize selections, the shorts will begin to premiere online in February 2019. The films will roll out over approximately six months and will be added to a custom playlist on YouTube. The primary digital activation will be on an interactive microsite at filmindependent.org featuring a map of LA, with tiles for the short films placed over their neighborhood that play and expand when clicked. Each short film will include bios, headshots and social media info for the filmmakers. As each film is released, our marketing team will promote the film through social channels, inviting Angelenos to have open discussions about the future of LA and connect on social media. A selection of shorts will play on the big screen as part of a free community event at the LA Film Festival including a conversation with filmmakers discussing how to get more involved in your community followed by a networking event, serving as a way for people to engage and connect in-person. We intend to open up a dialogue about LA and its future by inviting all Angelenos to participate in the conversation and have their stories told.","The Made in LA truly democratizes the way in which Angelenos can connect to one another in their vision for the future of Los Angeles. The activation encourages community members to come together and learn about the diversity that makes Los Angeles a beautiful place to live. At Film Independent, we believe that visual storytelling has the power to change the way people see the world. As Roger Ebert said, â€œMovies are the most powerful empathy machines in all the arts.â€ Content creators have the power to foster understanding, to change hearts and minds and to help sustain a modern, pluralist society. Our community is enriched when the stories told through film reflect the visions of diverse independent artists. Through this activation, we are inviting all Angelenos to create content, regardless of their filmmaking (or lack of filmmaking) background. This activation will represent all populations and communities across the County. ","Film Independent is wholly committed to this activation and will measure success using a variety of quantitative and qualitative benchmarks. Quantitative measures include number of people who attend the event at the LA Film Festival, number of people who submit films for consideration, number of people who view the films on the interactive microsite and on the YouTube playlist and number of people who engage on social media. We aim to engage creators and community members who reflect the broad demographics of Los Angeles across race, gender, ability, sexuality, immigration status and socio-economic status. We will collect these stats to meet program benchmarks. Additionally, qualitative measures include collecting the sentiments of engagement on social media, the points of view and stories we receive from all submissions, not just the selected short films and the conversations that arise out of the LA Film Festival event. We will survey the Festival attendees to ask demographic questions, as well as open ended questions about whether they are inspired to participate in future community discussions, whether they feel like they learned about other neighborhoods in LA, how eager they are to visit neighborhoods across the county, whether or not they connected with the filmmakers on social media and more. ","We expect that in five years, this map will continue to be a way for Angelenos to learn about the diversity of their community and the different neighborhoods our unique county includes. Film Independent is always exploring ways to increase diversity and inclusion in the film industry and find exciting avenues to engage artists and community members. This activation will further our goals for serving community members and filmmakers alike. It will provide a forum for talented, diverse filmmakers with unique voices to celebrate all that LA offers and encourage their peers to create stories that draw from their own diverse surroundings.

8102041,8102041,Make LA the first city where everyone can live free from abuse,"FreeFrom is working to revolutionize LAâ€™s response to the epidemic of gender-based violence by making sure every survivor has the financial resources to heal, rebuild and live free from abuse. ","1 in 4 women will suffer severe domestic violence in their lifetime, and domestic violence is the leading cause of homelessness among women and children in LA. Only if survivors can afford to leave, rebuild and heal, can we break the nexus between domestic violence, poverty and homelessness. FreeFrom is working transform the domestic violence movement in LA by scaling our robust and holistic financial security program to equip every survivor with the tools and services to build long-term safety.","Here in LA, 460,000 women will experience severe domestic violence in their lifetimes. The current domestic violence movement focuses on emergency services, but not on the long-term financial security needed to ensure permanent safety of survivors and their families.  FreeFrom is changing this paradigm. Through our compensation, credit repair and small business entrepreneurship programs, we work with survivors to create the financial security needed to rebuild their lives free from abuse. 

Financial insecurity is the number one reason survivors stay in and/or return to abusive relationships. Survivors who leave often do so without the financial means to rebuild their lives (e.g., securing housing, childcare, transportation, etc.), making domestic violence the leading cause of homelessness among women and children nationwide. The 2017 Point in Time Homeless Count found that 50% of homeless women in LA have experienced domestic violence, and the number of homeless individuals with histories of domestic abuse has more than doubled since 2016. If we are to end domestic violence in LA, we must help survivors rebuild financially. Only then can we achieve long-term change.

In 2017, FreeFrom piloted our Small Business and Financial Repair program through partnerships with more than a dozen domestic violence organizations in Los Angeles as well as the Mayorâ€™s Fund for Los Angeles and the Housing and Community Investment Department of Los Angeles. 

Through this pilot, we worked with 24 survivors to launch their own small businesses. Of those businesses, 100% yielded a profit within their first month of sales. Ten months later, not one of our clients has returned to the abuse. Instead, they are securing safe housing, building their credit, investing in healing services for themselves and their children and saving for their futures. Ventures started by our clients include seamstress services, catering, jewelry design, cleaning services, hair styling, and handcrafted bath and body products, among others. 

Tailored to the unique needs of survivors, our services cover the following topics: protecting, repairing and building credit; entrepreneurship as a source of income; business planning; finance and accounting; sales and marketing training; logo design and branding; mentorship; counseling; childcare and self-care; confidence-building and access to seed funding.  

With the support of LA2050, FreeFrom wants to expand our program to serve survivors in every domestic violence shelter in LA County and build a city in which shelters are not the only solution but rather a stepping stone to safe lives centered around abundance, community and healing. This the Los Angeles we could be. This is a Los Angeles that everyone can live in.","FreeFromâ€™s activation engages survivors, service providers, local government and the general public through trainings, media campaigns and advocacy. Over the next 2 years, we will use the following strategies to make LA a place where survivors can afford to heal, rebuild, and access their full potential:

Conduct a study on the effectiveness of financial services for survivors in reducing rates of abuse and length of shelter stays, making LA a pioneer in the work to end the nexus between poverty, abuse and homelessness.  

Triple the number of survivors FreeFrom is able to serve directly. 

Train every domestic violence shelter and service provider in LA on financial repair for survivors, making economic justice a key factor of the work done to end domestic violence.

Partner with community groups as well as organizations working with LGBTQ, formerly incarcerated, and trafficking survivors to make sure we are reaching individuals who are not accessing traditional domestic violence services. 

Create online resources to reach the more than 88% of survivors who do not have access to the shelter system in LA. 

Promote thriving, women-owned ventures and advocate for a living wage for survivors of domestic violence. In April 2018, FreeFrom is launching a social enterprise in Los Angeles that will exclusively sell products handmade by survivors as well as employ survivors to run operations for a living wage of $20 / hour. The goal of this venture is to foster survivor wealth.","FreeFrom defines success as effectively implementing a new framework for domestic violence prevention and intervention in LA County. Our goal is to reach survivors across the spectrum of gender-based violence to form a new movement focused on survivor wealth and healing.  

Metrics:

The number of domestic violence shelters in LA trained on how to implement our economic justice model in their work with clients;

The number of domestic violence shelters that make credit repair and income building a key part of their work;

The length of time it takes program clients to secure permanent housing;

Increases in income, savings, credit scores, sense of safety and confidence among program clients;

I was depressed, and I wasnâ€™t sure I would be able to survive as a single mom with two kids. Fast forward to today, 6 months later, I launched my cleaning business and I am making more money than I have ever made since arriving in the US. And Iâ€™ve been here for almost a decade! Also, for the first time ever, I am saving! I am saving so much! I donâ€™t know for what yet but I know FreeFrom will help me figure it out. I never thought this day would come and I never thought that my own work, skills, and passion would get me here. But here I am and I am happy and so, so proud.""
- Maria, FreeFrom client

FreeFromâ€™s ultimate goal is to create a city that no longer needs us. We envision a Los Angeles where every survivor has the financial freedom to choose safety. An LA where every survivor has access to services that are stepping stones to financial independence. Where every survivor can afford to heal and access their full creative potential, and no one has to choose between staying in an abusive situation and homelessness.

One of the greatest obstacles to creating change in the domestic violence movement is a lack of up-to-date, accurate data on domestic violence, its impact and the efficacy of current approaches to solving the issue. As we expand our program to serve survivors in all of Los Angeles, we are creating a study that will track the differences in outcomes for survivors who participate in our programs those that do not. Through this study, we aim to bolster support for our financial services and economic justice, increasing the availability of these services to survivors and reducing the time that survivors stay in shelter before securing permanent housing and employment. 

As we grow this model within LAâ€™s domestic violence shelters, FreeFrom will also create robust remote services in the form of applications and web-based resources for survivors who do not have access to the shelter system or other domestic violence-related services. Within the next 5 years, we aim to complete our work in Los Angeles, and expand our program to cities and states throughout the US.

In January 2018, FreeFrom launched its groundbreaking Online Self-Help Compensation Tool that survivors throughout California can access on our website to learn how to pursue compensation for the abuse they have suffered. Once users answer a few questions regarding their experience and the forms of compensation they are seeking, the tool generates detailed information on the userâ€™s options for compensation and how to pursue those options within their jurisdiction. Within 48 hours of launching the tool, 25,000 individuals logged on to learn their options for compensation. Within two months, 60,000 individuals accessed the tool. We aim to make the tool available to survivors in all 50 states within the next 3 years. 

Throughout this time, we will cull data from the compensation tool to create a state-by-state advocacy agenda that speaks directly to survivorsâ€™ greatest needs and priorities when seeking justice. Our current advocacy priorities include working with credit card companies to create an easier process for survivors to claim abuse-related identity fraud, and ensuring disability insurance for survivors who are forced to leave work as a result of the abuse. 

Over the past year, FreeFrom has joined city-wide initiatives to increase the rights of low to middle-income entrepreneurs, women and survivors. We have partnered with the LA Street Vendors Coalition and Public Counsel for the City of LA to legalize street vending in order to increase the rights of women entrepreneurs who rely on their businesses as their primary source of income, and the Home Cooks Initiative to increase food vendorsâ€™ ability to make their products without the cost of a commercial kitchen. In 2018, we also became a community partner for the United State of Women in Los Angeles. As we expand we will continue partnering with other organizations working in the fields of homelessness, gender justice and LGBTQ+ rights, economic justice and legal aid reform to address domestic violence as an intersectional issue that impacts people from various backgrounds.

As we continue to develop our advocacy work, we intend to create spaces for organizing work for the clients in our programs, as they continue building their businesses, their financial stability and a sense of well-being for themselves and their children. It is our goal to redirect the current movement to ultimately be led and shaped by survivors and their voices.","[""Number of households below the self-sufficiency standard"",""Rates of homelessness"",""Resilient communities""]","Here in LA, 460,000 women will experience severe domestic violence in their lifetimes.

The app will also be fun, because it will be game based and riders will earn points, stored in the Blockchain, that can be exchanged around the city for goods and services. The more you ride, the more you earn!","Our app will make LA the best place to CONNECT because it will be fun and it will have clearly measurable impacts on four mobilization paths.
 
The app will influence individual behavior by incentivizing use of public transportation. Angelinos know that public transportation is better for the environment, but they arenâ€™t rewarded for using it. Our app will give riders points in three ways: for â€˜checking inâ€™ to a bus (or train), for submitting ridership density data and for distance travelled. Those points will be stored in the Blockchain and through partnerships with local businesses riders will be able to exchange their points for goods and services (ex. meals, event tickets, etcâ€¦). This will be measured by rider check-ins and density reporting.
 
Our app will encourage businesses to change practices through a Blockchain exchange. Businesses that join the exchange will gain positive PR for being supporters of public transportation and for being part of LAâ€™s innovation economy. This will be measured by the number of business that join the exchange and by the number of rider points exchanged.
 
Our app will also create a new tool for greater civic engagement. Public transportation projects are expensive and take a long time to complete. Incentivized, rewarded riders are more likely to support transportation projects, be patient with timelines and with possible tax increases for funding. This will be measured by suggesting pro-public transportation social media postings and user response rate.
 
Our app will use digital tools, specifically games and Blockchain, to engage and activate Angelinos to care more about our cityâ€™s transportation infrastructure. Our generation is media-savvy, digitally literate and politically active. We know what can be accomplished through social networks. #MarchForOurLives is a recent, important example of what we can accomplish. While public transportation is not as urgent an issue as gun control, it is one that we need to tackle now so that we can have a beautiful, healthy city to live in when we are adults in 2050. Change needs to be faster and start now! This will be measured by the number of rider check-ins and the number of pro-public transportation social media postings using RideLA specific hashtags.
 
The CONNECT metrics we target are: number of public transit riders, travel time to work, and attendance at cultural events. We will measure riders and travel time by app usage data. We will measure attendance at cultural events by the number of social media postings about events that include the RideLA hashtags.


","This project aims to target the entire region of Los Angeles, with a user base and map that covers the entire Metro system. Ads on social media platforms will be used to increase awareness, as well as promotions from people and celebrities with large followings. Specifically, we want to target three groups: Angelinos who care about the environment but donâ€™t use public transportation will join because the app makes doing the right thing fun, via games and leaderboards. Angelinos who want to join the innovation economy but donâ€™t have tech skills and/or Silicon Beach connections will join because the app will give them Blockchain access. Teen Angelinos who want a voice in the future of our city will join because the app will connect them to other teen riders and encourage mastery of the Metro system.","Our app will target four CONNECT mobilization paths that have clearly measurable impacts.

Through Literary Riot, local youth gain valuable professional skills and experience that prepare them for careers in LA's creative industry, while educating, inspiring and mobilizing their neighbors, families and peers on issues important to our country and our world.","Literary Riot is a radically inclusive film program and content studio. We represent the true diversity of our society through working with young voices from throughout Los Angeles and developing their on-camera and behind-the-camera talents. The first of its kind, Literary Riot is not only a vehicle for training young artists, but also for featuring and sharing their voices. It is based on the belief that young peopleâ€™s ideas and solutions matter, and that new platforms are needed to amplify their responses at a particularly challenging and divisive time. Launched in 2017, this in-house incubator and full-service production company is a collective of artists ages 13-23 who have trained as poets and filmmakers with Get Lit. 

For many of our Literary Riot youth, their first exposure to the power of poetic expression comes through Get Litâ€™s In-School Program. Eligible and interested young poets continue on as Get Lit Players. Students who are interested in film join our ""Pilot"" Program, a free 16-week course in independent filmmaking in which they learn and implement everything from development to distribution. Graduates are offered a 6 month Literary Riot Fellowship that includes additional classes and on-set experience. Young artists then move into the Literary Riot Content Studio where they receive advanced training and professional opportunities. The original content that they create builds their resumes, pays them, and promotes marginalized youth voices. 
 
Literary Riot fosters artistic and professional prospects for these storytellers through continuing education and industry work, as well as training in professional etiquette, business skills, and other tools. It creates a bridge to success between high school and adulthood that is so often lacking in educational institutions, and has a meaningful impact on employment in L.A.â€™s creative industries, particularly for women and young people of color. 

In its first year, Literary Riot has developed 5 original web series garnering over 3 million views, and our studentsâ€™ work has screened at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, The Grammy Museum, and more. Current offerings include original content, in-house productions, manifestos commissioned by companies and organizations, and brand consulting that implements young voices into corporate social impact campaigns. In addition to building L.A.â€™s profile nationally, many of our Literary Riot filmmakers have become civic activists and gotten involved locally with the Womenâ€™s March, March for our Lives, and Rock the Vote, among others. In March 2018, our students were thrust into the epicenter of the national media campaign being supported directly by their youth peers across the country organizing the March For Our Lives. Our students produced the most watched and shared pieces of media for that campaign garnering 4 million views in 10 days.","Through Literary Riot, Get Lit offers an unparalleled pipeline for youth to develop youth and share their stories. An organic outgrowth of Get Litâ€™s mission, Literary Riot offers training and opportunities for 60 students annually. Over 70% of these students come from Title 1 schools and 90% are students of color.

In Literary Riot, youth have co-created a contemporary, cutting-edge platform that recognizes them as leaders and culture-makers. The studio at Get Lit, with its suite of creative tools, technology, and screening room with a cinema quality projector, is a lab in which students hone their professional skills, maximize innovation, and establish themselves as forces in the media world. Original content includes 5 web series, including Get Lit NOW, in which teen poets perform original spoken word pieces in response to recent headlines, and productions like Write to Riot, a documentary that follows 5 teen poets as they prepare to compete in Get Litâ€™s Classic Slam. We are currently developing our capacity to offer creative services for them to develop entirely original media content.

Another exciting aspect of this program is our partnership with The United Nations. With the UN, Literary Riot is creating a curriculum that will be presented in schools as an activism toolkit. Based on the values of truth, thoughtfulness, and equality, this curriculum will act as a catalyst for civic engagement, giving youth the tools to turn their art into messages of peace and justice.","The impact of Literary Riot on the lives of the youth involved and their communities is significant. The program ignites meaningful civic engagement via unique platforms, allows students to develop skills for the digital economy, and offers opportunities toward successful career paths for an extremely underserved segment of our community, ushering in a whole new era of storytellers and content creators to the Los Angeles work force. 

Success will be measured by participantsâ€™ subsequent employment and leadership in the creative industries, as well as the growth of locally-created content, platforms, artistic endeavors, and partnerships created through the program. We will track the demographics of participants with an emphasis on diversity and number of beneficiaries, and the development of new tools and technologies for greater civic/political engagement, as well as engagement with the content created. Our program aims to align with and for our direct impact to be assessed by the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, an industry leading think tank studying diversity and inclusion in entertainment.

To assess the programâ€™s digital activism components, we will track social media metrics and engagement, as well as evidence of growing community involvement in the political process and dialogue around various social issues. Community comments and activity will be analyzed as well as participant numbers and demographics such as age, location, income, education level, and gender. 
","In five years, we anticipate seeing a significant increase in the participants, collaborators, and audience for Literary Riot. Our overarching goal is for Literary Riot to become a vibrant social enterprise whose income stream can become a primary source of support for Get Lit, reshaping the model of nonprofit funding. We aim to lead the way and pioneer the creative industry into a new digital ecosystem where Los Angeles youth have the ability to be at the forefront of the worldâ€™s biggest projects, movements, and masterpieces.","[""Employment in the creative industries"",""Minority- and women-owned firms"",""Percentage of graduates from local higher education institutions that remain in LA County 5 years after graduating""]","Literary Riot is a radically inclusive film program and content studio.

GALA seeks to launch a project based Medical Intervention and Biomedical Innovation program that teaches techniques and skills that will help young ladies become leaders and innovators with 21st Century skills. ,"Across Los Angeles, young women, particularly women of color are underrepresented in math, science, and technology. Girls typically are not found in high level math and science classes, having been discouraged early on in their educational journey. The Girls Academic Leadership Academy (GALA) aims to break this pattern by providing girls with a STEM-centered college prep curriculum in a learning environment that strongly supports girls to be smart, self confident, and successful. GALA provides leadership training and the skills necessary to persist in STEM fields. The GALA Launch Her Future focus is a project based medical and biomedical program which will focus on the intersection of medicine and technology, allowing our girls to become true leaders and innovators in this burgeoning new field.  Supporting the LA2050 LEARN metric of studentsâ€™ immersion in science, technology, engineering, and math content, GALA is requesting support not just in STEM but in the newest field within STEM, including project based medical and technological innovation. GALA aims to encouraging learning and growth in this field by investigating medical mysteries, and using technology to solve them, which will advance the goal of 100% graduation and 100% college matriculation.  In studying medical inventions, technological and biomedical innovation, students will work with the same equipment and tools used by professionals in the field.  GALA students will be empowered to explore and find solutions to some of todayâ€™s most pressing medical challenges. Through activities that connect learning to life, students will step into the roles of biomedical science professionals investigating such topics as use of technology in medicine, genetics and issues in public health. Students will work together in teams to explore problems and find unique solutions, learning in-demand, transferable skills. One of the student inspired goals is health care advocacy and accessibility for Los Angelenos in need especially focusing in on homeless women. Our students hope to one day create an app or digital website that could be used to connect these women to health resources. This connects to the LA is the Healthiest place to LIVE part of LA2050 in that the girls long term goal is to affect greater change through access to medicine in the city. With access to the curriculum and resources, GALA students can explore public health issues such as how to detect and fight infection; screen and evaluate for disease and treatment options; and develop technology to support their findings. Through real-world cases, students will be exposed to a range of interventions, diagnostics, and devices related to immunology, surgery, genetics, and pharmacology.  GALAâ€™s mission is to provide its diverse community of young women with an excellent STEM education that prepares them for success in both university studies and their careers.

The communities affected by the activation is GALAâ€™s school community at first. Then, depending on the research, the project also seeks to eventually engage Los Angelinos in general through the formation of an app used by non-profit organizations. 
Strategies/tactics: learning the curriculum and resources, developing a grade level integrated curriculum project for 11th and 8th grade, technology integration, research, partnership with UCLA and USC medical schools, incorporation of 21st Century skills, as well as incorporation of Next Generation Science Standards.
","GALA offers students a rigorous college preparatory curriculum in all grades, and the opportunity to earn college credit through Advanced Placement Testing beginning in ninth grade, with the goal of increasing the number and diversity of women in Los Angeles opting for careers in STEM fields. The immediate measurement of success will be incorporating a biomedical strand to our STEM curriculum, building interest in the medical field and encouraging leadership through a project based integrated curriculum focusing in the biomedical sciences. Currently, our 9th grade girls are researching STEM based medical professions and completing a project predicting what the future women will look, act and evolve into. A measure of success we anticipate is increasing the interest in STEM fields and supporting more young women in pursuing their dreams of becoming doctor, medical investigators, and innovators in the medical field. The long term measurement of success will come in 2020, when we graduate our first class and all young women are accepted into a four-year universities. GALA students will learn the techniques the students in college are already learning. They will be that far ahead by combining their technological knowledge and understanding of medical issues to become the future leaders finding solutions to public health issues. ","In five years our school will have experienced our first two graduating classes. In those five years, the activation of Launch her Future will have such a huge impact on the exposure these girls are getting to project based learning experiences in the STEM field, that more young women will go into four year colleges and prestigious universities where women are underrepresented STEM fields, finish and become the innovators of tomorrow.

We hope to foster a behavior shift towards the minimization of waste by repairing and reusing items that would otherwise be landfilled. ","Global Greenâ€™s CRC is aiming to foster a shift in behavior towards the minimization of waste by repairing and reusing items that would otherwise go to landfill. This program will activate residents in educational, creative reuse workshops and create stronger, more connected, and resilient communities. In cooperation with local businesses, such as breweries and repair shops, as well as local artists and eco-gurus, Global Green will host 6-8 free, hands-on workshops on the art of upcycling and conserving household items by offering repair and repurposing strategies for commonly discarded items such as textiles, electronics, and bicycles. We aim to educate up to 240 Angelenos in these workshops to empower them to â€œupcycleâ€, creating a cycle of reusing and repairing items that would otherwise go to landfill. During the workshops, residents will learn how to transform their unwanted, worn out, or damaged items into â€œnewâ€ or improved materials, creating a space for creative reuse and waste prevention in the City of LA.  Each workshop will focus on a specific need (i.e. textile mending) based on pre-surveys provided by Global Green to participants, and will include the tools and resources required for residents to reinvent â€˜wastedâ€™ items to create greener, more resilient communities. In addition to providing its own expertise for these workshops, Global Green will invite local, relevant experts to lead each workshop and provide one-on-one assistance to attendees.
 
The CRC workshops will create more resilient communities by giving residents the ability to become more self-sufficient, resource-efficient, and cost-effective as they are enabled to utilize available resources to their fullest potential. Workshops will also give participants the opportunity to connect and engage with other community members, creating stronger communities that will be more resilient in the face of external issues. The goal is for residents to utilize the skills gained from the workshops in order to persistently upcycle and repair their commonly discarded items after the program; thus continuing to reuse the Cityâ€™s existing resources and enforcing resilience within their communities. Residents will also be able to use the skills acquired in these workshops, combined with follow-up digital tutorial videos and blogs created by Global Green, to engage in peer-to-peer education with their family, friends, and neighbors, engaging the broader community in the activation and enabling more Angelenos to contribute to and benefit from a more sustainable LA. To this end, the long-term outcomes of increased reuse and repair of commonly worn out, broken, and discarded items in the City of LA will include increased waste prevention and diversion, reduced environmental health hazards, reduced stress on landfills, reduced costs for residents, and more, enabling residents to benefit from a more sustainable environment and making LA the best place to live.
","Creative Reuse Coalition workshops will be open to the public and will take place in 6-8 different locations across LA to attract a variety of participants. Workshop locations will be chosen based on the following criteria to ensure accessibility and diversity: 1) proximity to public transit; 2) location in or near highly frequented centers; 3) location near diverse communities to ensure participants of various backgrounds and financial means. The activation will engage up to 240 Los Angeles residents through free public workshops featuring local artists, artisans, technicians, chefs, celebrities, social influencers, makers, menders, etc. The workshops will give attendees a hands-on experience and the skills/knowledge that they need to repair items in their everyday lives. In addition, Global Green will engage community members after the workshop by developing and posting video guides and blogs following each workshop to educate those who could not attend workshops and to further educate/increase skill levels for participants. The ease of accessing and sharing these free videos and guides will increase program accessibility for all and provide an opportunity to engage more Angelenos. Based on current levels of viewership on Global Greenâ€™s Youtube channel, we anticipate 1200-1600 people will watch these videos. Post-workshop surveys will be administered, so that participants can provide feedback to ensure that we are progressing towards making LA the best place to live.","Outputs
1) 1 press release drafted/published to raise awareness 
2) 6-8 workshops hosted
3) 90-240 Angelenos attended workshops (15-30 attendees per workshop)
4) 6-8 local artists, fixers, chefs, etc. acted as mentors
5) 90-240 follow-up surveys administered with the following feedback: 80% of attendees thought the workshop was useful; 60% of people used their skills or would; 60% of people feel that they reduced their waste from attending the workshop
6) 6-8 videos, guides, and blogs produced to educate other Angelenos about how to upcycle their broken or old materials and provide follow-up assistance for participants

Outcomes
1) Participants engage in peer-to-peer education on skills gained through workshop training; an estimated 225 - 600 people reached based on average of 2.5 people per household in California
2) 1200-1600 views of the workshop videos, reaching individuals who did not attend the workshop and individuals who did attend but would like a reminder of what they learned
3) Decrease in commonly discarded items and food waste in the landfill in LA
4) Increased awareness about strategies for reusing broken or worn-out items among residents
5) Metrics collected for lbs diverted from landfill (items repaired/ repurposed)
6) More resilient communities in LA because of increased number of opportunities for individuals to engage with one another, be self-sufficient, and keep valuable resources out of the landfill
","Global Greenâ€™s Creative Reuse Coalition is aiming to foster a shift in behavior towards the minimization of waste by activating communities with the skills and knowledge to repair, repurpose, and reuse items that would otherwise go to landfill. Therefore, in five years, we hope that our workshops inspire Angelenos in every neighborhood to repair and reuse their broken, worn out, or damaged belongings rather than throwing them out, and to share those lessons with others, making reuse the first instinct before disposal. We hope that our model workshops may inspire regular repair cafes in a variety of areas around the city, as well as increase the frequency of events, focus, education, and policies on repair and reuse strategies for waste prevention. In time, we hope that with more interest and enthusiasm for reusing and repairing old items, the City of LA will be a model city for waste diversion, with the incorporation of strategies encouraging repair and reuse as key approaches to meet diversion goals in its updates to the Cityâ€™s Sustainability Plan.

To this end, the long-term outcomes of increased reuse and repair of commonly worn out, broken, and discarded items in the City of LA will include increased waste prevention and diversion, reduced environmental health hazards, reduced stress on landfills, reduced costs for residents, and more, enabling residents to benefit from a more sustainable environment and making LA the best place to live.",Live,2018046,https://activation.la2050.org/live/global-green/global-green.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtgKX6NE490,8102046
8102047,8102047,Connect for LA Chinatown - WAPOW Community Media Project,"In a changing Chinatown, WAPOW is a community service project connecting a multigenerational, multicultural team of volunteers to create, organize and share local media, events and programs.","In a changing Chinatown, WAPOW uses media to unite and activate diverse stakeholders, as agents for integrative change that increases community power, resilience and engagement. 

Engagement is twofoldâ€”collaborating with volunteers to create a bilingual quarterly; then sharing knowledge in print, online and at events.

Our goals: raise civic consciousness, celebrate local livelihood, build empathy, and advocate for creative placekeeping, cultural stewardship and sustainable economic development.","As an immigrant enclave, LA Chinatown has had historic gaps in civic engagementâ€”in part due to linguistic isolation, as more than half of residents are Low English Proficiency. As the neighborhood experiences rapid redevelopment and urban planning, such as the Downtown LA 2040 Community Plan Update, it is urgent now more than ever to educate and engage local residents, small businesses and organizations on how to interact with and be part of positive changes.

WAPOW is a grassroots community multimedia project in the historic cultural urban neighborhood of LA Chinatown that uses narrative arts to advance various objectives including: 

- storytelling to promote community building
- civic engagement by raising awareness of urban planning and public services 
- providing diverse volunteer opportunities that draw on peopleâ€™s varied skills in art, translation, writing, event planning, etc.
- promote community building and immigrant integration;
- youth development;
- cultural sharing and stewardship; and
- local small business promotion/economic development. 

We achieve objectives by engaging partners in a series of interrelated activities: 

WAPOW Magazine - A bilingual quarterly publication, produced by volunteer community contributors, focused on community news and cultural highlights, that also lead conversations on civic issues otherwise not covered in mainstream and ethnic media.

Small Business Outreach and Business Directory: As part of the publication, small businesses may access free or low-cost graphic design or translation services to help broaden their community reach.They will also be able to place advertisements, with ad spaces prioritized for local small businesses. Currently, older legacy businesses struggle to reach newer generations, and newer businesses struggle to reach older generations, in part due to branding or linguistic barriers. Conversations with businesses may also include counseling on how to increase reachâ€”whether by adding translation or trying online marketing. Concurrently, we will be developing a small business directory that will feature older and new businesses to capture the different types of businesses in Chinatown.  

Community Engagement Events - in person events at local venues to engage the public in meaningful interactions and dialogues. Opportunities include movie screenings, housing rights workshops, community panels on local issues, and cultural activities. 
The projectâ€™s new storytelling platform is a vehicle for community building around important issues of shared interest. It also provides new ways to access community resources, and opportunities for people to activate and connectâ€”either actively as volunteers or event-goers, or passively as readers. The focus on storytelling helps build empathy and mutual understanding across different generations, experiences, histories and perspectives, toward building community cohesion and resilience.","WAPOWâ€™s bilingual coverage and events connect in many ways:
...to resources - With real estate speculation squeezing small businesses and residentsâ€”95 percent are renters, and about a quarter are fixed-income seniorsâ€”WAPOW is a tool, training locals on City planning processes and highlighting available supportsâ€”e.g., tenant rights and small business assistance. 
...to each other - As demographics change, WAPOW shares stories about people and places to celebrate local heritage, build empathy across cultures and generations, and encourage community-building and stewardship. Every quarter, we choose a theme to guide conversation around issues otherwise not covered by mainstream or ethnic media. In Issue 2, â€œFamily Traditions,â€ we brought Chinatown chefs from different backgrounds around a dinner conversation on their family traditions. In Issue 3, â€œRoots,â€ we held a tour of LA State Historic Park, and guest speaker Robert Garcia of the former Chinatown Yards Alliance, shared his experience with the coalition that fought for the park. In Issue 4, we'll celebrate New Chinatownâ€™s 80th Anniversary, and ask locals their hopes for the next 80 years, to start conversation on community visioning. 
...to volunteer opportunities - WAPOW is a collaborative project, successful because it leverages contributorsâ€™ strengths to contribute in ways that are meaningfulâ€”through artwork, language competencies, people skills, event planning, cooking, etc. It will continue engaging different partners.","WAPOW is meant to engage a multigenerational audience. As such, our metrics will vary across population groups. Engagement with younger folks may be through social media engagement. For older generations, because a major issue is illiteracy and digital redlining, impact is measured qualitativelyâ€”such as how the magazine has been valuable for exposing the community to new civic engagement knowledge.

-Institutional partnerships (e.g., distribution at events for Chinese American Museum, C.A.C.A., CAUSE, AAAJ, API Forward Movement, Chinatown Service Center, OCA-GLA, LA State Historic Park, etc.)
-Social media reach and interaction/mentions with other accounts
-Reader survey, including a question asking whether WAPOW increased awareness of community affairs
-Advertising and small business engagement, tracked by coupons
-Volunteer hours 
-Attendance at events, typically 100-150 per quarter

While harder to track, the impact of WAPOW also includes:
-New linkages to resources. On several occasions, many readers have commented that the bilingual Resources Directory page has been the most valuable.
-Conversations on civic matters. When a local hospital closed, WAPOW sent a student to Alpine Park to monitor resident reactions. Of 6 seniors interviewed, half did not know about the closure, and several commented that the services were lacking. 
-Every Launch Event provides networking opportunities in the communitiy.","We hope to create a headquarter space in Chinatown for WAPOW that is open for community use as a media lab, focused on supporting multimedia and storytelling and intergenerational community-building. Part of the programming includes:
- Art supply store to support local artists, design firms and Elementary students
- Participation and buy-in from local residents, businesses, institutions new and old. There are many community organizations that are doing great work. All of them need media production to share their work and tell the story.
- Partnership with educational institutions - primary, secondary, and post-secondary education; as well as local archival institutions like Chinese Historical Society of Southern California, which has a lot of raw materials waiting to be produced/finished into stories for broader consumption.
- Workshops focused on sustaining and remixing cultural traditions
- Gathering space for community groups to meet and use equipment (Wifi, software, etc.), while incubating and marketing their Chinatown-serving projects
- Computer lab space for elders to learn technology and possibly work with Visual Communications to organize a Digital Histories program that teaches seniors to make movies about their own lives","[""Attendance at cultural events"",""Government responsiveness to residents’ needs"",""Rates of volunteerism""]","As an immigrant enclave, LA Chinatown has had historic gaps in civic engagement—in part due to linguistic isolation, as more than half of residents are Low English Proficiency.

8102050,8102050,Hacker Fund Civic Innovation Center,"Hacker Fund is launching a Civic Innovation Center in order to provide Angelenos with resources for technology education, tools to prototype civic innovations, and a community workspace. ","Hacker Fund is building a Civic Innovation Center in order to provide Angelenos with technology education, tools to prototype and develop new civic innovations, and a collaborative workspace to activate a trans-generational community. ","In order to create a better Los Angeles and activate 100,000 Angelenos by 2050, Hacker Fund is launching a Civic Innovation Center (CIC) in Downtown Los Angeles. The CIC will make Los Angeles the best place to CREATE by offering to the general public state-of-the-art prototyping tools, vocational education and job-training, a framework to receive funding to patent innovations, and exposure to hackathons that bring thousands of community members together. 

Our first CIC will occupy up to 5,000 square feet for the purpose of managing a makerspace, mixed-reality lab, a classroom, private offices, and collaborative event space. The first CIC is set to open in Q2 of 2019. Membership will be sold to the general public at discounted rate of $200-$250 per month. The CIC will be able to house on average 100 people throughout the day as it operates from 8:30AM to 10:30 PM, with the first 6 hours dedicated to collaborative coworking and manufacturing activity, and then using the next 8 hours to optimize for educational workshops, job fairs, and hackathons to serve up to approximately 250 members of the public. 

Members of the CIC will be able to learn design, software engineering, hardware development, data science, and rapid-prototyping from industry mentors from Hacker Fundâ€™s existing network of 250+ technology volunteers, including professionals from SpaceX, IBM, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon. The availability of 3D printers, laser-cutters, and soldering tools will make manufacturing more accessible thanks to our corporate sponsors. The use of this new knowledge through tools and mentorship will allow members to develop civic innovations that increase the number of potential patents per capita in Los Angeles. Once members develop their prototypes, they will be able to access Hacker Fundâ€™s fiscal sponsorship services in order to raise additional funding for additional manufacturing and hiring employees. The increase in social impact projects developed by Angelenos will also increase the availability of volunteer opportunities and jobs per capita.

The CIC will be funded through a combination of grant funding (including LA2050 and $50,000 that we have already received from the Craig Newmark Philanthropic Fund), membership fees, corporate sponsorship, and in-kind donations. 
","Hacker Fund's Civic Innovation Center (CIC) intends to engage community members from diverse cultural and professional backgrounds, as well as mixed age groups. Angelenos will have access to a 5,000 square foot multipurpose hub containing a maker-space, co-working space, classroom, private offices, and a mixed reality lab. With the center open from 8:30AM to 10:30 PM, the first 6 hours of the day would be used for manufacturing and heavy duty creation. For the next 8 hours, the space is opened up as an educational space for youths, students, and learners of all ages. Educational opportunities would include workshops in science, technology, engineering, arts, and math (STEAM). Makerspaces and similar hardware spaces have historically had problems with accessibility. We intend to position our space in a location that makes the space easily accessible to communities that otherwise would not have access to the tools and educational resources we provide, as well as partner with K12 schools, local universities, community colleges, and trade schools. By helping those in our community become creators, and giving them the the resources to develop skills relevant in a constantly modernizing society, we create a ladder of engagement that leads to positive multigenerational change. Students become creators; creators become instructors, entrepreneurs, and valuable contributing community members.
","The success of the Civic Innovation (CIC) is defined by the success of our ladder of engagement, with the main goal being to create a lasting positive multigenerational change in Los Angeles where community members feel empowered to create, learn, and give back. This would be measured by number of technology innovations prototyped, the number of active members per month and per quarter, and then the number of students that become educators and contributors to the center. Data will be collected on the amount of students reached, as well as the conversion from member to creator, instructors, entrepreneur, and patent holder.

Help HL - LA build our home field advantage! ,"HL-LA engages families, communities, businesses, law enforcement, school partners, and athletes of all backgrounds to provide kids most at risk of dropout with personal pathways to future successes.","By activating all the individuals that HL-LAâ€™s programs touch both directly and indirectly, from students and parents to school staff and local police, neighbors and friends, corporate partners and colleges, HL-LA can drive real change in the south LA communities it serves.  Increased staff at current sites and additional opportunities for current students as well as expansion programs will all increase the breadth and scope of HL-LAâ€™s impact.","The Harlem Lacrosse model embeds Program Directors in the schools that host our program, which allows for daily mentorship, leadership and enrichment activities, tutoring, study hall, test prep as well as lacrosse instruction and competition. Our purpose is to teach the children of South LA, Compton and Inglewood the skills that will lead to their success as students, athletes and citizens. Skills like self-control, resilience, teamwork and a growth mindset have particular importance for kids that grow up in low-income urban communities. We believe that with intentional program design and talented coaches, the sport itself and its complementary academic support provide the perfect context to teach these skills. This model transcends a typical after-school sports program by providing wrap-around programming in a safe, structured, year-round environment that is centered on immersive academic and sport-based learning. We know that the sport is naturally engaging for all kids and we are hopeful that together, with LA2050, Harlem Lacrosse â€“ Los Angeles can continue to deepen our impact and provide the kinds of experiences that are truly life-changing to even more young people in our community, intergenerational families, and the community at large.

On HL-LA â€œplaydays,â€ Enterprise Park transforms into a recreational oasis. As the buses deliver eager players ready to take part in the dayâ€™s events, parents, guardians, grandparents and siblings of all ages begin to gather in the prime shady locations on the sidelines. Volunteers from area high schools and colleges start organizing the players into age groups and teams; while the lacrosse training begins, coaches, tutors, police officers, teachers and mentors from corporate partners chat with parents about their childâ€™s experiences, academic improvement, school choice or tutoring questions, goals, and much more. Harlem Lacrosse-LA is not just affecting its student-athletesâ€™ lives, its impact is felt across generations and across the community. Many HL-LA parents and guardians did not attend college and rely on the advice and counseling of the HL-LA program directors, tutors and career advisors to help create an academic path to college preparedness for their children. Aside from the direct impact, HL-LA is growing alongside its members, expanding to high school programs as many students advanced to ninth grade. Many coaches and staff are themselves â€œgraduatesâ€ of Harlem Lacrosse-LA (and its predecessor City Lacrosse), and these valuable work opportunities empower the older students to stay involved and give back. 
Providing opportunities like these helps to keep HL-LA students and their families engaged in the program; these students are encouraged to improve attendance and grades, and stay in school, in order to remain as active members of the HL-LA community.","LA will be the best place to learn when Angelenos from all backgrounds come together to support our most at-risk students.  HL-LA has a wide network of partnerships, and the unique ability to bring this diverse set of partners together. They include corporate partners like Advice Period, boarding schools, the Police Department, Parks and Rec, the Boys and Girls Club of Santa Monica, ICEF and LAUSD schools, Mar Vista Gardens public housing development, foundations, college partners like USC and Whittier, as well as families and volunteers from more traditional lacrosse communities from Santa Barbara to OC.
HL-LA actively recruits students identified by school administrators as most vulnerable to academic decline and dropout.  These students receive daily doses of academic and social-emotional support during study halls and meetings as well as the important lessons of commitment and teamwork during lacrosse practices and games.  Using lacrosse as a hook, students earn their spot on the team through attendance, academic performance and behavior, and HL-LA students show measurable improvement in each of these areas.
Program Directors assist teachers, administrators and other school staff with behavioral and academic interventions throughout the day.  PD's also work with parents and guardians to put together a comprehensive personal path for each student, including academic assistance, additional lacrosse opportunities, high school selection, career advice and more.  ","HL-LA will measure the success of our activation in several ways.  One metric will be the increased number of followers on social media, and the new requests for newsletter and email updates.  Additionally, HL-LA will measure any new volunteers and applications for jobs, specifically if LA2050 is mentioned as how they heard about the opportunities.  
Most importantly, HL-LA will measure the year-to-year increase in the number of participants, community partners, families, staff and school sites, which will be evidence that the funding provided by LA2050 directly impacted the scope and delivery of programming.  The LA2050 grant would allow HL-LA to offer more academic, athletic and enrichment activities to its current participants as well as reach more new members.  It would also support more enrichment activities and opportunities for HL-LA students to explore new parts of their city, like a field trip to the beach or Spacex, shadowing doctors at the local hospital, watching lacrosse sticks be made at String King, learning goal setting from professionals at Advice Period, attending overnight camp at the Thacher School, receiving career advice from a mentor, or attending a USC lacrosse game.  By increasing the number of these opportunities and expanding the capacity to include even more students, HL-LA can further its mission to help each student find his or her personal path to life-long success.","In five years, HL-LA hopes to help foster a deeply engaged community, one in which students who have been in the program for a long period of time are emerging as leaders for their younger peers.  HL-LA will proudly watch as graduates achieve academic and athletic success at the high school and college level.  
In five years, as a result of this activation, HL-LA will have more exposure in LA and beyond, which includes an improved ability to build relationships with even more partners across the city.  As more people are aware of our work, and more partners come on board, HL-LA can continue to scale up and grow, adding more school partners and serving hundreds of additional students.  
Over five years as the students progress through the HL-LA program, there will be more comprehensive high school programming, including boarding school and college application assistance, academic help in the form of tutoring and test prep, career planning and advice and the continuation of the personal pathway development that began in fifth grade.  
A central goal of HL-LA is to develop a strong sense of community, and to encourage each alumni to become an active and productive member of their community who will work to make LA a better place to learn and play.  As they advance through high school, students will start planning for their future, maybe as a teacher at an area school, a local business owner or community leader, with a desire to give back and create a culture of positive change.

,8102051,Every Angeleno is an all star on our team. Help HL - LA build our home field advantage! ,,"By activating all the individuals that HL-LAâ€™s programs touch both directly and indirectly, from students and parents to school staff and local police, neighbors and friends, corporate partners and colleges, HL-LA can drive real change in the south LA communities it serves.  Increased staff at current sites and additional opportunities for current students as well as expansion programs will all increase the breadth and scope of HL-LAâ€™s impact.","The Harlem Lacrosse model embeds Program Directors in the schools that host our program, which allows for daily mentorship, leadership and enrichment activities, tutoring, study hall, test prep as well as lacrosse instruction and competition. Our purpose is to teach the children of South LA, Compton and Inglewood the skills that will lead to their success as students, athletes and citizens. Skills like self-control, resilience, teamwork and a growth mindset have particular importance for kids that grow up in low-income urban communities. We believe that with intentional program design and talented coaches, the sport itself and its complementary academic support provide the perfect context to teach these skills. This model transcends a typical after-school sports program by providing wrap-around programming in a safe, structured, year-round environment that is centered on immersive academic and sport-based learning. We know that the sport is naturally engaging for all kids and we are hopeful that together, with LA2050, Harlem Lacrosse â€“ Los Angeles can continue to deepen our impact and provide the kinds of experiences that are truly life-changing to even more young people in our community, intergenerational families, and the community at large.

On HL-LA â€œplaydays,â€ Enterprise Park transforms into a recreational oasis. As the buses deliver eager players ready to take part in the dayâ€™s events, parents, guardians, grandparents and siblings of all ages begin to gather in the prime shady locations on the sidelines. Volunteers from area high schools and colleges start organizing the players into age groups and teams; while the lacrosse training begins, coaches, tutors, police officers, teachers and mentors from corporate partners chat with parents about their childâ€™s experiences, academic improvement, school choice or tutoring questions, goals, and much more. Harlem Lacrosse-LA is not just affecting its student-athletesâ€™ lives, its impact is felt across generations and across the community. Many HL-LA parents and guardians did not attend college and rely on the advice and counseling of the HL-LA program directors, tutors and career advisors to help create an academic path to college preparedness for their children. Aside from the direct impact, HL-LA is growing alongside its members, expanding to high school programs as many students advanced to ninth grade. Many coaches and staff are themselves â€œgraduatesâ€ of Harlem Lacrosse-LA (and its predecessor City Lacrosse), and these valuable work opportunities empower the older students to stay involved and give back. 
Providing opportunities like these helps to keep HL-LA students and their families engaged in the program; these students are encouraged to improve attendance and grades, and stay in school, in order to remain as active members of the HL-LA community.","LA will be the best place to learn when Angelenos from all backgrounds come together to support our most at-risk students.  HL-LA has a wide network of partnerships, and the unique ability to bring this diverse set of partners together. They include corporate partners like Advice Period, boarding schools, the Police Department, Parks and Rec, the Boys and Girls Club of Santa Monica, ICEF and LAUSD schools, Mar Vista Gardens public housing development, foundations, college partners like USC and Whittier, as well as families and volunteers from more traditional lacrosse communities from Santa Barbara to OC.
HL-LA actively recruits students identified by school administrators as most vulnerable to academic decline and dropout.  These students receive daily doses of academic and social-emotional support during study halls and meetings as well as the important lessons of commitment and teamwork during lacrosse practices and games.  Using lacrosse as a hook, students earn their spot on the team through attendance, academic performance and behavior, and HL-LA students show measurable improvement in each of these areas.
Program Directors assist teachers, administrators and other school staff with behavioral and academic interventions throughout the day.  PD's also work with parents and guardians to put together a comprehensive personal path for each student, including academic assistance, additional lacrosse opportunities, high school selection, career advice and more.  ","HL-LA will measure the success of our activation in several ways.  One metric will be the increased number of followers on social media, and the new requests for newsletter and email updates.  Additionally, HL-LA will measure any new volunteers and applications for jobs, specifically if LA2050 is mentioned as how they heard about the opportunities.  
Most importantly, HL-LA will measure the year-to-year increase in the number of participants, community partners, families, staff and school sites, which will be evidence that the funding provided by LA2050 directly impacted the scope and delivery of programming.  The LA2050 grant would allow HL-LA to offer more academic, athletic and enrichment activities to its current participants as well as reach more new members.  It would also support more enrichment activities and opportunities for HL-LA students to explore new parts of their city, like a field trip to the beach or Spacex, shadowing doctors at the local hospital, watching lacrosse sticks be made at String King, learning goal setting from professionals at Advice Period, attending overnight camp at the Thacher School, receiving career advice from a mentor, or attending a USC lacrosse game.  By increasing the number of these opportunities and expanding the capacity to include even more students, HL-LA can further its mission to help each student find his or her personal path to life-long success.","In five years, HL-LA hopes to help foster a deeply engaged community, one in which students who have been in the program for a long period of time are emerging as leaders for their younger peers.  HL-LA will proudly watch as graduates achieve academic and athletic success at the high school and college level.  
In five years, as a result of this activation, HL-LA will have more exposure in LA and beyond, which includes an improved ability to build relationships with even more partners across the city.  As more people are aware of our work, and more partners come on board, HL-LA can continue to scale up and grow, adding more school partners and serving hundreds of additional students.  
Over five years as the students progress through the HL-LA program, there will be more comprehensive high school programming, including boarding school and college application assistance, academic help in the form of tutoring and test prep, career planning and advice and the continuation of the personal pathway development that began in fifth grade.  
A central goal of HL-LA is to develop a strong sense of community, and to encourage each alumni to become an active and productive member of their community who will work to make LA a better place to learn and play.  As they advance through high school, students will start planning for their future, maybe as a teacher at an area school, a local business owner or community leader, with a desire to give back and create a culture of positive change.

8102053,8102053,Homeboy and LA Voice: Organizing formerly incarcerated Angelenos to vote,"Activate 100,000 Angelenos in civic engagement, increasing voter participation and supporting community organizing among formerly incarcerated and formerly gang-involved men and women. ","Homeboy Industries and LA Voice are partnering to increase education on voter rights, organize for voter registration and participation, and increase civic engagement among formerly incarcerated and formerly gang-involved Angelenos. In standing with the demonized until the demonizing stops, we are working to make Los Angeles a place where all residents are more able connect and become contributing members of our community.","In the state of California, individuals with a criminal record have the right to vote if they are not currently in a state or federal prison or on parole for a felony conviction.  Not every state has the same voting rights, leading to a lot of confusion or misinformation when it comes to voting rights. As a result, far too many eligible voters who are deeply impacted by the policies passed by our elected officials are not being represented in our elections. Homeboy Industries, with thousands of formerly gang-involved and previously incarcerated individuals coming through their doors annually, and LA Voice, with their experience turning out tens of thousands of underrepresented voters to the polls, are ideally situated to address this problem. 

Voter turnout among the formerly incarcerated population is generally very low due in large part to a lack of information and misinformation about voting rights, socioeconomic factors, and community narratives of voting being worthless. Yet Homeboy Industries and LA Voice have seen through previous collaborations that when this segment of the community organizes, change happens.  

Our idea for the LA2050 activation grant was sparked by this question: How much more could we achieve for Los Angeles if every formerly incarcerated Angeleno were civically engaged?

With nearly 50 years of combined experience, Homeboy Industries and LA Voiceâ€™s models are complementary in serving the reentry population and organizing for civic engagement and voting.  In 1986 when Homeboyâ€™s founder Father Greg Boyle began serving in Boyle Heights, Los Angeles was regarded as the gang capital of the world. At the time, law enforcement tactics of suppression and criminal justice policies of mass incarceration were the prevailing means to deal with gang violence leading to hundreds of thousands of individuals serving time in California correctional institutions. Today, Homeboy is the largest gang intervention, rehab and reentry program in the world. The Homeboy model emphasizes true transformation combining therapeutic and support services with the goal that no one would recidivate and that everyone would have improved social connectedness. 

For the last three elections, LA Voice has organized voter engagement efforts led and staffed by formerly incarcerated leaders who educated their own communities on ballot measures and encouraged their communities to vote. If our idea is funded, Homeboy and LA Voice together will turn these efforts into a year-round movement of formerly incarcerated leaders who educate their community in a non-partisan way to impact their communities, change the criminal justice system, and engage with other poverty-related policies by increasing their collective voice in the halls of power. ","According to Mayor Eric Garcettiâ€™s office, each year more than 45,000 people are paroled to LA County, and over 163,000 individuals pass through our county jail system. With this many impacted by the justice system, much work is needed to connect formerly incarcerated residents with tools to exercise their agency and voice. We believe that our schools, our environment, our justice system, and our city will be its best when all voices can connect to one another and connect to those in power.

In recent years, LA Voice trained more than 200 formerly incarcerated leaders in community organizing strategies, working closely with Homeboy and other organizations serving the formerly incarcerated. One local organizer and Homeboy trainee shared that, â€œIt wasnâ€™t until I came to Homeboy that I knew I could vote. People in my community donâ€™t think their vote matters, but thereâ€™s all kinds of things we can do to impact our communities.â€ 

Our strategies to CONNECT Angelenos for voter engagement include:

-	Voting rights educational materials to be distributed at Homeboyâ€™s 5k run/walk event held each September
-	Workshops on topics such as voter rights, practice ballots, and upcoming ballot initiatives
-	Voter registration booths at Homeboy events 
-	Social media voting rights educational campaign
-	Empowering individuals with information and/or accompaniment to local community meetings
-	Training events for formerly incarcerated individuals to learn how to organize their own communities","Our activation will build on our past partnership success to engage hundreds more formerly incarcerated individuals in voter engagement and organizing, toward activating at least 100,000 Angelenos for civic engagement.  As Homeboyâ€™s founder Father Greg Boyle often says, â€œunless you transform your pain, youâ€™re going to transmit it.â€ We aim to see individuals transform their pain into community contributions for the next generation and beyond.

Success in connecting Angelenos to civic engagement and voting will include the following outcomes:

-	At least 1000 new voter registrations per year
-	An estimated 50,000 informational conversations/announcements per year including online and offline outreach 
-	Two training seminars held each year at Homeboy Industries
-	Voting rights educational materials produced for distribution to over 100,000 Angelenos
-	Social media information on voting rights and registration will reach at least 25,000 per year
-	At least 100 previously incarcerated and/or formerly gang-involved individuals will be trained in community organizing 
-	At least 200 formerly incarcerated will attend community events or town halls to learn about and contribute to issues in their community","Homeboy Industries aims to change the way the world views, judges and treats our most marginalized and demonizedâ€”the formerly incarcerated and gang-involved. By our daily work and commitment to the healing of the most demonized in a trusting and loving community, we will demonstrate to the world a new way forward. We are committed to stand with the demonized until the demonizing stops. Toward that end, we invest in foundational healing and personal development to see that no one re-offends and that everyone becomes a contributing member of our community. As contributing members of the community, we envision formerly gang-involved and formerly incarcerated men and women as engaged voters and community members. 

In five years, together with LA Voice, we desire to see a greater block of formerly incarcerated individuals connected to civic engagement in the Los Angeles community. We will have trained over 100 additional formerly incarcerated organizers on voter engagement organizing, and they will be able to regularly register and reach thousands of formerly incarcerated individuals each year for sustainable outreach beyond the grant period. The partnership between LA Voice and Homeboy Industries will be cohesive and ongoing, supporting local organizing efforts for marginalized communities, and continually building up the base of individuals who identify as part of a growing voter bloc of formerly incarcerated voters. 

We believe now is the time to bolster our efforts to help disenfranchised voters connect to opportunities to make our city the best it can be for all Angelenos.

8102054,8102054,Intersections: The power of our common stories.,"It all begins with sharing stories. Imagine LA and L.A. Works are joining to empower 150,000+ Angelenos to share their own life experiences to help alleviate homelessness in our city.","Sharing stories and making connections is essential to developing the trusting mentor/mentee relationships that pull a vulnerable family out of the cycle of homelessness. This fresh outreach campaign will show that disparate groups of Angelenos have more in common than they would ever think, evoking the fun and reward of these commonalities, ultimately recruiting more volunteer mentors . With this grant, weâ€™ll be able to supercharge our program and make an enormous impact on homelessness in L.A.","People are more likely to trust and fully engage with one another when they share common experiences and interests. Knowing this, Imagine LA created a unique onboarding process, which we use when matching volunteer mentors with families whoâ€™ve experienced homelessness. Our professional staff trains and guides the mentor/mentee pairs as they share life timelines, family genograms, personal values, and views on money management. These exercises evoke laughter, â€œa ha!â€ moments and sometimes tears. Shortly, they discover they have more in common than they would ever have thought. 

Often used as a therapeutic intervention, the timeline project creates an intimate connection between participants as they explore their history, attitudes, circumstances, and decision-making.  â€œItâ€™s been said that a picture is worth a thousand words. If so, then capturing your life on paper with a timeline exercise may be worth millions.â€œ (Staik, 2013)

Modeling this deep and barrier-busting experience, the ""Intersections"" campaign will significantly increase the number of mentors in the Imagine LA program. Potential volunteers need to see the foundation we create for success and be empowered with the realization that they too have what it takes to be a life-changing mentor for families emerging from homelessness â€“ simply the ability to share. What begins with a connection ends with breaking the cycle of homelessness.
  
Partnering with L.A. Works, the largest volunteer network in Los Angeles, Imagine LA will create a public awareness and outreach campaign, pairing social media marketing, community outreach, and events to educate and empower 150,000+ Angelenos. Ultimately, this will influence individual behavior, CONNECT 1,000 new mentors with vulnerable families in the Imagine LA program, and increase rates of volunteerism â€“ not only as mentors, but with shorter-term volunteer roles. 

A key component of our campaign is events-based. At L.A. Worksâ€™ large-scale days of service, which draw volunteers from around the county who are primed to make a deeper connection in service, weâ€™ll lead trust-building activities like those we use during our mentor/mentee on-boarding process, educate participants, post on socials and ultimately sign up new volunteers to become mentors. 

Mentorship promotes community and develops meaningful relationships full of mutual respect, love, and laughter. Showcasing this, and CONNECTing Angelenos to each other through their stories, will bring this campaign to life. Our shareable videos (live and animated), photos, and tactics like a mentor taking over our Instagram feed for a day will help increase the total number of local social media friends and connections Angelenos have. We anticipate the  campaign to CONNECT Angelenos way beyond our goal of signing up mentors. It will empower them to volunteer in other ways and LEARN about those with disparate backgrounds and circumstances. It will break the cycle of homelessness for hundreds of families. ","In partnership with L.A. Works, Imagine L.A. aims to educate and engage adult Angelenos as mentors for families emerging from homelessness. We will CONNECT with more than 150,000 people, educating them about how sharing their own life experiences and expertise could play a significant role in alleviating the homeless crisis in Los Angeles, and empowering them to take action by signing up to volunteer. Exploring, embracing and showcasing the common ground we all share as Angelenos â€“ and capitalizing on the fun of it as the cornerstone of our campaign â€“ will make LA the best place to CONNECT.

We will utilize short, shareable videos and GIFs, targeted social media posts and social media advertising, info sessions/workshops, community outreach in target neighborhoods throughout Los Angeles, media outreach, and crowd activation activities. These will feature current mentors or mentor prospects and individuals who have experienced homelessness sharing their common life experiences, illustrating the joy and importance of sharing these experiences through storytelling. We will showcase these stories and create related, in-person activities to educate, recruit and sign up volunteer mentors at special L.A. Works days of service tailored to address homelessness in Los Angeles. ","We will define success as meeting the following objectives: 1) Educate more than 150,000 people about how sharing their own life experiences and expertise creates common ground and could play a significant role in alleviating the homeless crisis in Los Angeles, empowering them to take action; 2) Recruit and sign up volunteer mentors using many of the same tactics in person at targeted L.A. Works events. Throughout the course of the campaign, we will sign up more than 1,000 new mentors. 

A mentor makes 100 connections with his/her mentee per year. 1000 x 100 = 100,000 connections. Necessarily, our campaignâ€™s outreach impressions will actually represent a vastly larger number of connections that also have lasting impact.

We will measure success by assessing:
â€¢	Analytics about impressions, views and engagement on social media platforms
â€¢	Web site traffic 
â€¢	Media impressions
â€¢	Community engagement metrics
â€¢	Event attendance
â€¢	Volunteer sign ups
â€¢	Imagine LA mentor applications submitted
â€¢	Mentors matched with families and in the pipeline to be matched

Additionally, more volunteer mentors will allow the Imagine LA program to meet its potential so an extended result of this campaign, beyond its two years, will be helping hundreds more Los Angeles families flourish, breaking their cycle of homelessness and poverty. ","The majority of people who are homelessness have experienced homelessness before. Imagine LA, powered by mentors, public and private resources, and communities, will have ended this cycle for hundreds, perhaps thousands of families. This campaign will help us get there. It will also help us meet two goals of our five-year strategic plan: to be embedded in LA County and a nationally recognized model for homeless prevention and community mobilization.

This activation has limitless possibilities for renewal as it evolves to work with more narrowly defined target audiences throughout Los Angeles, i.e. different age groups, specific professions or community groups, geographic areas.

8102055,8102055,More than Minivans: the Female Future of Transportation,0,,,,,,"[""Government responsiveness to residents’ needs"",""Number of public transit riders"",""Transit-accessible housing and employment""]","Everyone needs to get somewhere. We need to get to work, to school, to soccer games, to get food, everyday. In Los Angeles this is often easier said than done, particularly if your trips are invisible.



 Only 16 percent of daily trips are for work, yet nearly all of Los Angeles’ transportation efforts go into improving travel for commuters. So what is happening for the other 84 percent of trips?



 While we increasingly see women in the workforce, we still see traditional gender splits in different-sex parental households. Women tend to remain the primary caregivers, including making trips for school/child care, appointments, activities, and household errands.



 Our LA2050 activation will daylight these trips, faces, and voices.



 Transportation connects Angelenos with opportunity. But at its worst can prevent them from accessing resources and networks. Our activation will employ a multi-pronged strategy to ensure that women and mothers are not forgotten as we look to expand how our transportation network connects us.



 Data and groundtruthing: Analyze national and regional travel data to analyze patterns we see in women workers, caregivers, and mothers. Preliminary findings will be shared with community organizations and members to identify alignment with their lived experiences.



 Storytelling: Work with community organizations and local media to develop and distribute multilingual, multimedia stories of women’s daily needs and how transportation impacts them. This process will also teach women how to utilize film and photo to tell their own stories.



 Education and advocacy: Host online and in-person advocacy trainings to co-power community members to advocate for their own transportation needs. Groundtruthed data and stories from the first two strategies will be used to message the unaddressed needs of women with transportation policymakers at these trainings.



 We propose to utilize metrics recommended by LA2050 and our own suggested metrics we believe will measure successful impact of our activation:



 Government responsiveness to residents’ needs (LA2050): Data-driven advocacy and humanizing stories will be used to influence regional transportation policy and funding decisions.

8102056,8102056,"Justice LA, along with FreeAmerica, are working to radically transform LA County's justice system.","Through public art exhibits, community town hall meetings and voter registration activations, we will connect and empower Los Angeles residents to build safer neighborhoods and end mass incarceration.","Using art as a catalyst for civic engagement, Justice LA will launch exhibitions in spaces featuring jail beds as a powerful visual to raise awareness about mass incarceration and its negative impact on society. Against this backdrop, we will host town halls to convene community members, organizers and public officials, utilize a robust digital strategy to inform residents about policies related to incarceration, register voters and provide residents with tools to stay involved and connected.","Justice LA is committed to making Los Angeles safe, connected and equitable. A huge barrier to creating this environment is the exorbitant rates of incarceration and state violence perpetrated against Black, Latino, immigrant and poor communities throughout LA County. For too long, LA County has viewed safety exclusively through a policing and incarceration lens and poured billions of limited public resources into failing solutions. Over the past 20 years, LA County has dramatically increased the budgets of its Sheriffâ€™s Department and Probation Department. These decisions were made despite evidence that policing and incarceration does not significantly impact crime rates and a mandate from the majority of Californians to decrease reliance on incarceration to public health and safety issues. 

Ending mass incarceration is a growing movement. For this effort to continue to gain momentum and to garner additional support, we must work to change narratives, shift culture, and engage communities most affected â€“ many of whom do not know or believe that they can be advocates for positive change or recognize their place and power within the democratic process. We must educate residents about initiatives that bring us closer to our goal and will have an immediate impact on their quality of life. Two such initiatives include: stopping LA Countyâ€™s $3.5 billion project to build two new jails and reinvesting those funds into much needed community services and reforming the money bail system to increase the number of people able to return home after arrest, thereby reducing LAâ€™s jail population. 

Justice LA will produce: 

Public art exhibits are unique opportunities to gather large and diverse groups of people, introduce residents to the arts and encourage people to visit other arts and cultural institutions. The art installations will be created by local artists and feature actual jail beds. These activations will help LA2050 reach its targets for 50 percent of households participating in the arts by engaging with at least one arts and cultural institution, and increased attendance at public/open streets gatherings. 

People with common interests and concerns need spaces like Town Halls to learn from, converse and stay in touch with one another. Our activations create the chance for residents to meet and exchange social media contact information. This environment will help facilitate LA2050â€™s work to increase the total number of local social media friends and connections Angelenos have and for 95% of adults receive social and emotional support.

Potential voters are likely to register when they understand how democracy should work and envision themselves participating. The voter registration/education component of these activations align with LA2050â€™s work to increase participation in the political process, and will help it reach its target of 75% of Angelenos voting often in local elections, as well as impact government responsiveness to residentsâ€™ needs.","Justice LAâ€™s ART+CONNECT+ACT will target Black, Latino, immigrant and poor communities that are disproportionately incarcerated at higher rates, while also having lower voting rates. Our activations will focus on residents who may not realize or understand the negative impact mass incarceration has on the population at large, LA Countyâ€™s vibrant and diverse arts community, the entertainment industry, and activist organizations with which weâ€™ve collaborated on other social, racial and economic justice issues. Justice LAâ€™s deep network and long-standing relationships with thousands of individuals and organizations give us the ability to widely cross-promote our activations, develop strategic messaging to generate excitement and interest within targeted constituencies, work with facilities to secure physical spaces, and utilize virtual tools i.e. mailing lists and social media followers to engage with attendees before, during and after the activations take place. The tactic of using art to stimulate dialogue, create narratives, foster understanding and compassion, unite diverse communities, and humanize complex, controversial issues has been successful. Local LA artists have created exhibits using actual jail beds, which we know tell a powerful, visual story about the devastating toll mass incarceration takes on society. For example, Justice LAâ€™s #JailBedDrop exhibits last year garnered wide media attention, and our Town Hall meetings have connected hundreds of people.  ","The success of ART+CONNECT+ACT will be our ability to activate 4 art exhibitions, 4 Town Hall meetings and voter registration drives in a 2 year period to:

Increase interest and attendance at L.A.â€™s arts and cultural institutions

Secure 5,000 signatures on a petition to the Los Angeles County Supervisor demanding a stop to the Countyâ€™s massive, wasteful jail construction project

Place a moratorium on the building of the two new jails and reinvestment of a portion of the $3.5 billion allocated to developing much needed services including affordable housing, youth centers, assisted living facilities for mentally ill people and transitional housing for the homeless population

Increase awareness about and public support for the passage of comprehensive cash bail legislation

Register 500 new voters, and positively impact voter turnout in LA County among Black, Latino and low-income residents 

Connect 10,000 Los Angelenos with each other via social media to help provide with social and emotional support 
","The ART+CONNECT+ACT activations will provide: powerful visuals to stimulate interest and conversation; a platform for in-person engagement at community Town Hall meetings on issues including the Countyâ€™s plan to build two new jails and a cash bail reform policy; training sessions to teach citizens how to advocate on policy issues and digital organizing strategies; new technologies/social media toolkits to increase civic and political engagement; and opportunities to educate and register new and disenfranchised voters. Within five years, we hope that ART+CONNECT+ACT: 

â—	Will have effectively shifted public attitudes and policy away from incarceration as a solution for creating a safer Los Angeles

â—	Can be replicated to address other social, criminal, economic and racial justice issues in cities and counties in California and throughout the U.S.

â—	Will have provided the infrastructure necessary to engage, empower and encourage our fellow residents in marginalized communities, and solutions to address reducing incarceration rates and over policing in these communities. 

â—	That the art created through this project will be permanently housed in an arts and/or cultural institution dedicated to fostering understanding about racial, criminal and social justice.  

We hope Justice LA will be able to pivot from stopping new jail constructions and reducing the prison population and, instead, be focused on reimagining radical, creative solutions for building a safer, more equitable, vibrant, healthier, happier Los Angeles for all residents.

8102057,8102057,Kitchen Table App brings people together over a shared love of good food and great company.,Kitchen Table App is a community building platform that brings people from all walks of life and every corner of Los Angeles together over a shared love of good food and great company.,"Kitchen Table App will activate 100,000 Angelenos to meet the neighbors theyâ€™ve lived next door to but never knew, make new friends in the city they call home, network with industry professionals for career development, fundraise for the charitable organizations they believe in, and build community in the neighborhoods they live and work. We do this by connecting residents with neighborhood hosts, managing a marketplace, and actively recruiting new hosts, diners, and nonprofits to join us.","Los Angeles is an amazing city. Itâ€™s my hometown and I feel very lucky to be an Angeleno. Los Angeles is also where we conceptualized and created Kitchen Table App and so itâ€™s our organizationâ€™s hometown too.

But, Los Angeles is a difficult place to meet new people, make new friends, and build authentic community in your neighborhood. The social behaviors and social norms that Angelenos have come to adopt limit engagement with people that live in your building or on your block, restrict the ability to meet your neighbors when buildings donâ€™t offer common or outdoor spaces, and reduce the instinct to say hello to people in your community that youâ€™ve never met before because they are strangers and you donâ€™t know if they are interested in meeting you.

Kitchen Table Appâ€™s mission is to bring people together to share dining experiences, make meals accessible, easy, and memorable, and redefine what it means to eat local. We are all familiar the popular â€œeat localâ€ movement, originally kicked off in the 1970s by environmentalists advocating that people buy food that was local to them. Farmers markets, grocery stores, restaurants, and individual brands soon followed and #eatlocal #buylocal #supportlocal trended on social. Kitchen Table App is redefining â€œeat localâ€ to mean sharing dining experiences with friends, neighbors, and newcomers that you may have never met before. Our â€œeat localâ€ is about connection: human connection with those around us, over the universal language that all speak, food.

Kitchen Table App provides individuals with the ability to host a meal or gathering in their home or space and the opportunity to join a meal or gathering at a host's home or space with a table full of others including neighbors, friends, parents, colleagues, classmates, advocates, activists, networking circles, and people in the community that they may have never met before. Our mobile app allows individuals to connect with neighborhood hosts in an open marketplace to meet each other, make new friends, learn more about and volunteer for non profit organizations that matters to them, discuss how city and local policies affect their neighborhood, apartment building, grocery store, education, and employment opportunities, and influence behavior whether thatâ€™s getting more young people to register to vote, encouraging more people to conserve, recycle, and support local businesses.  

Kitchen Table App is an expert in facilitating communal dining and gathering experiences and creating the opportunity to easily connect with others by participating in both hosting meals and get-togethers for others or joining meals and get-togethers with others. Kitchen Table App is rooted in connecting. Itâ€™s our core value. And we invite you and your community to join in and take a seat at the table with us. ","Itâ€™s undeniable we live in one of the greatest cities in the world, but itâ€™s also undeniable that Los Angeles can be an incredibly isolating place. The challenges of a fragmented metro system, congested roads, and the steep price of just living here (nevermind eating, shopping, or experiencing) can keep you from socializing, dining out, or even leaving your home -- for days. This only underscores the need for authentic social connection and human interaction.

Kitchen Table App provides individuals the opportunity to create that human connection so many of us desire.  Since we launched in 2016, weâ€™ve grown our community each month by individually meeting new people in new neighborhoods, sharing the concept of Kitchen Table App, inviting people we just met to join us for dinner, providing this unique and special experience, engaging with guests around the table, and creating the desire to continue connecting.

To date, our community has hosted more than 300 meals in 70 neighborhoods across Los Angeles.  Our hosts are people who love cooking, people who love sharing, people who love connecting, foodies, chefs, native Angelenos, LA transplants, students, moms, teachers, activists, podcasters, writers, photographers, intellectuals, spanish-speakers, travelers, and you.

With this as our base, we can effectively activate every neighborhood in Los Angeles and create a model of duplication that makes joining a neighborhood meal available and accessible to all Angelenos.","Qualitatively, we measure success through the connections made and the memories created at each dining experience. Thereâ€™s nothing more powerful than hearing feedback from our customers, diners, and hosts about the people they met, the culinary creativity they enjoyed, the welcoming, friendly, and inclusive host that greeted them at the door, the stories shared, and the memories that last a lifetime.

Quantitatively, we measure success through four key performance indicators: new user acquisition, duplication, retention, and partnerships with our non profit organizations.

New user acquisition is defined as the number of new hosts and diners that join our community.  Duplication is defined by the frequency of gatherings hosted and attended. Retention is defined by the number of Kitchen Table gatherings that diners return to after experiencing it for the first time.

Partnerships with our non profit organizations is measured both by the number of our non profit partners and the dollar amount that is fundraised at each charitable Kitchen Table App experience.

Philanthropy and social giving is a core value of ours and was built into our business model. Any host can donate the proceeds of their gathering to the non profit organization of their choice. This way, as we are meeting new people and making new friends, we are also giving back and contributing to our community in ways that bring us closer to a friendlier, more inclusive, and more connected city. ","In five years, my hope is that Angelenos in every neighborhood in Los Angeles county from the Santa Ana mountains to the Southbay are connecting with neighbors, friends, friends-of-friends, parents, colleagues, classmates, teammates, networking circles, policy makers, non profit organizations, and activists on a regular basis through the Kitchen Table App platform.

I want people to experience a community get-together through Kitchen Table, but not just one community get-together. My hope is that Kitchen Table App is a part of peopleâ€™s everyday live -- including their zeitgeist.  For example, if two colleagues meet in the break room at their office and one of them says, â€œWhat are you doing after work tonight?  Would you like to join a â€˜Kitchen Tableâ€™ dinner in Echo Park before heading home? Iâ€™ve been checking it over the past few weeks and there are some really great gatherings happening every night.  We have this amazing opportunity to meet new people, try a homemade cuisine, laugh, share stories, and make connections with an interesting group of people that we may have never had the opportunity to meet before Kitchen Table App brought us together.â€  â€œOf course! Iâ€™d love to try it!â€","[""Adults getting sufficient social & emotional support"",""Rates of volunteerism"",""Total number of local social media friends and connections Angelenos have""]","Los Angeles is an amazing city.

8102058,8102058,"Play YOUR way, LA!","Through a virtual game of tag called #PlayYourWayLA and a rip-roaring Park-in-a-Box for all ages, Angelenos will work together to identify overlooked spaces and transform them into playful places!","Weâ€™re asking you to nominate overlooked, underutilized everyday spaces in your neighborhood â€“ a sidewalk, a vacant lot, a street â€“ that YOU think would be perfect places to play! Tag a spot on social media, spread the word, and once a hundred of your neighbors tag the same spot, weâ€™ll bring a Park-in-a-Box to transform it into an exciting, adventurous space for all ages to enjoy. With #PlayYourWayLA every neighbor can have a say in how to make LA the best place to play.","If youâ€™re one of the 51% of Angelenos living more than a half mile from the nearest park and you want to play in your neighborhood, you donâ€™t have many options. You can twiddle your thumbs until the someone builds a park near you, or form an advocacy group with your neighbors, but itâ€™s pretty hard to make anything happen.

KDI wants to change this. We want to give you an easy way to bring outdoor play to your neighborhood, NOW!

Letâ€™s say your neighborhood has tons of space but nowhere to play. You want to play basketball in the street, but itâ€™s always full of traffic. Or youâ€™re next to a vacant lot that would be a great park, if only you could access it. Or the sunny sidewalk on the corner would be the perfect spot to enjoy street food, but thereâ€™s no seating.

What if you could turn those spaces into areas for play?

Our activation will make this quick, easy, and fun! Weâ€™ll take care of all the forms and phone calls needed to make it happen. All you have to do to get started is geotag the spot you think should be used for play on social media. Tag it with #PlayYourWayLA!

Get 10 people to tag it, and weâ€™ll come and make sure the space is public and safe to use. Weâ€™ll put up a sign letting people know play is on the way, if they keep tagging. You tell your friends and family to tag the spot. Hit 100 tags and weâ€™ll set a date to bring our Park-in-a-Box to that very place. Simple!

Then, weâ€™ll hold a community workshop so you and your neighborhood can make the activation YOURS. Maybe you have lots of young kids in the neighborhood, or you want a space for your knitting group. Our Park-in-a-Box can transform into almost anything â€“ a toddlerâ€™s play zone, a craft corner â€“ whatever you want! Every activation will be unique to its neighborhood and the people in it.

Once youâ€™ve planned your activation, weâ€™ll drive our Park-in-a-Box to your neighborhood and PLAY!

Thereâ€™s no limit to how you can play, or how much you get involved. Maybe you just want to show up and enjoy the activation. Maybe you want to lead the community workshop. Maybe you want a permanent park in your area. If so, weâ€™ll set you up with the networks and know-how to make it happen.

So how are we meeting those LA2050 play metrics?

â€¢	There will be more spaces for play. Youâ€™ll enjoy the benefits of open space in your neighborhood, almost immediately, without having to wait for permanent parks to arrive.
â€¢	Youâ€™ll have access to unique, vibrant and intergenerational play spaces to suit everyone â€“ because YOU made it happen!
â€¢	Youâ€™ll feel safer and more connected to your neighborhood.
â€¢	Youâ€™ll create visual data and community interest to show the City where permanent parks are needed and desired.
â€¢	Youâ€™ll pave the way for permanent improvements and be able to get involved in making them happen.

You can see that weâ€™re also hitting lots of â€œConnectâ€ metrics, like rates of volunteerism and public gatherings. Together, we can make LA the best place to play â€“ now, and in the future.","Of the 51% of Angelenos living in park-poor neighborhoods, the worst affected are often low-income communities of color â€“ such as South LA, where residents have 19x less park space than those in West LA. These are the communities we'll be reaching. Park-poor LA, weâ€™re coming to play.

Weâ€™ll take our park-in-a-box on a PLAY ROADSHOW so you can see whatâ€™s up for grabs if you join in. Weâ€™ll make a cool WEBSITE to give you all the info you need, and post all over SOCIAL MEDIA so that every Angeleno knows who we are.

If you live in a park-poor neighborhood and want to play outside, find a public space and geotag it on social media with #PlayYourWayLA! If it gets 10 tags weâ€™ll MEET you to assess it together. Once we decide itâ€™s viable, weâ€™ll ANNOUNCE it online and put up SIGNAGE.

Your job is then to SPREAD THE WORD and get 100 people to tag the site. Ask your grandma. Hand out cookies. Poke Facebook friends. Do what you have to do to get 100 tags, and weâ€™ll hold a COMMUNITY WORKSHOP to help you plan a PLAY ACTIVATION on that spot.

Then, we bring our PARK-IN-A-BOXâ€¦ and the play begins!

Weâ€™re relying on your networks, your ideas, and your activism, to bring play to you. Not only will thousands of Angelenos get to play outside, but the LEADERS among you â€“ whether youâ€™re an aspiring organizer or an old pro â€“ will advocate for LASTING CHANGE. Whether itâ€™s recurring activations you want, or a permanent park, weâ€™ll SUPPORT you and help you make the CONNECTIONS you need.","To measure the success of our activation, we first need to define our goals:
1)	Engage 100,000 Angelenos
2)	Reach 90,000+ residents through social media, website, and signage
3)	Get 4000 residents to tag 40 sites for activation
4)	Hold 40 activations in park-poor neighborhoods
5)	Engage 200+ residents at each activation
6)	Help 40 residents become play advocates in their communities
7)	Create a process that enables accessible, inclusive, active play that happens how you want

These goals will help us make LA the best place to PLAY (and CONNECT). How do we measure them? Firstly, we count:
1)	How many people visit our social media sites and website
2)	How many people see the signage at activation sites (weâ€™ll use pedestrian counts to estimate)
3)	How many tags sites get
4)	How many activations we hold and how many people attend (this tells us if weâ€™re increasing access to play)
5)	How many people become play advocates
6)	How many people we engage overall

So weâ€™ve got numbers, now what about opinions? KDI will gather feedback at all stages to get a detailed picture of whether you think weâ€™re meeting those play metrics.
1)	Weâ€™ll send a survey to everyone who plays #PlayYourWayLA
2)	At the play activations, weâ€™ll bring Feebe, our custom-made â€œfeedback beaconâ€, to collect feedback through interviews, surveys, and games
3)	You can tell us what you think on social media, anytime
4)	We will survey the residents who organize the activations with us to hear what worked and what didnâ€™t","In our five-year vision of the future, this activation program will have become a permanent, citywide initiative so you can play your way while youâ€™re waiting for parks to be built. 

Temporary parks and play spaces will be popping up like whack-a-moles. Every single Angeleno will be able to team up with other residents and make a play space on a street, City lot, or sidewalk â€“ whenever, wherever, and however you want. It will be as easy as making a quick phone call or filling out an online form! And the possibilities for play will be as endless as your imagination.

We hope this isnâ€™t the case, but if you still live in a park-poor neighborhood in five yearsâ€™ time, fear not! Youâ€™ll be able to access many of the physical, mental and social benefits of parks, while we all work towards more permanent solutions. Youâ€™ll be more friendly with your neighbors. Youâ€™ll have more active hobbies close to home. Your community will be healthier, happier, and more connected.

And the community leaders who spearheaded this activation will be equipped with new know-how to push for permanent play solutions. Theyâ€™ll know more people, theyâ€™ll have more data, and they will be an active voice for their communities when the time comes to allocate dollars for new parks. They will usher in a new era of public space and outdoor play â€“ planned by Angelenos, for Angelenos.

As for KDI, in five yearsâ€™ time weâ€™ll continue to be a leader in California for building healthy, vibrant and playful communities through public space. Weâ€™ll have worked alongside the communities most in need of play space, and the most influential decision makers, to create a statewide network of public spaces with committed and capable residents at its core.

Partners merge expertise in urban agriculture, entrepreneurial training, community engagement and social enterprise to activate a community-led food system. A foundation is set for an economic bridge, from Seed to Sky. Angelenos collaborate to grow healthy food right in our neighborhoods, create jobs, and generate profits that return to local residents through L.A. Kitchenâ€™s social enterprise.","Seed To Sky is L.A. Kitchenâ€™s latest effort to challenge existing business models and create powerful bridges for change. L.A. Kitchen is excited to launch a coalition to stand side-by-side with other organizations doing powerful work in a collaborative network. This activation will lay a strong foundation to build an economic bridge - from LA to LAX - from Seed to Sky. This isn't about making LA a better city to live in - LA already has powerful assets! Instead, it's about strategically leveraging assets to collaboratively build a more resilient, just and connected food community. We are developing an urban food system, in which we put communities at the center.

This project builds on L.A. Kitchenâ€™s existing social enterprise, Strong Food, which employs graduates from our culinary job training, and takes on contracts to manufacture food products for other businesses and L.A. Kitchenâ€™s own brand. Strong Food will be partnering with a premier concessionaire at LAX to produce L.A. Kitchen sandwiches, salads and parfaits, creating a complete menu that offers traveling Angelenos and global visitors healthier food alternatives. This contract will bring L.A. Kitchen closer to realizing the power of a nonprofit that is self-sustainable - relying on consistent, earned income rather than the fluctuations of philanthropic funding. 

Whatâ€™s most exciting is that this contract with LAX is already helping L.A. Kitchen create more jobs and fight recidivism, food waste, and hunger through its community meal distribution program. When given the opportunity to share the wealth, L.A. Kitchen wants to squeeze every ounce of community impact we can. Funding from LA2050 will allow us to use our LAX contract to purchase produce from community-led gardens that are offering entrepreneurship training and job opportunities for residents in their neighborhoods, starting in South Los Angeles.

Together with coalition partners, RootDown LA (RootDown) and Our Foods, we are building the first food production site, featuring hydroponic and aquaponic technology, that will serve as a training ground and provide jobs for youth. L.A. Kitchen will purchase the produce to enhance its existing supply channels, creating an economic bridge from LA gardens to LAX. This activation will include an invitation to other garden programs in South LA: We welcome partners who share our goals - not only to nourish LA gardens, but also engage LAâ€™s youth, teaching them about supply and demand, profit and loss, reinvestment and philanthropy, empowering the next generation of change agents in our neighborhoods. 

We will realize the power of everyday commerce as fuel for philanthropy and revolutionize the way communities support each other, creating a more economically viable future for Angelenos. At every touch point across this economic bridge, from planting seeds to distributing salads, every dollar made will be reinvested back into our communities. Who knew, the impact of a grab and go at LAX?","The following efforts create an urban community where cross-sector efforts ensure residentsâ€™ food dollars are reinvested to support health and wealth creation for all: 
2,000 South LA residents - youth, parents, police officers, farmers, business owners and seniors will be activated through training programs, garden installs, and produce distribution and sales. 6,000 Angelenos will be activated as they participate in promotional events - community garden days and nutrition/cooking workshops with L.A. Kitchenâ€™s Chef T. and RootDown's culinary training graduates.

An army of 12,000 L.A. Kitchen volunteers transform produce from existing suppliers and new coalition community-led farms into healthy meals donated to social agencies - picture youth taking produce they grow to local senior centers. A vast cross section of Angelenos will be activated along the economic bridge as produce is distributed - through farmerâ€™s markets, local cafes, senior centers, and LAX. 

Through high-visibility signage, product labeling and easy to share marketing tools, millions of travelers who pass through LAX monthly will learn about Seed to Sky, be inspired to support and join our efforts. Between partnersâ€™ shared social media campaigns and press our model will attract, tens of thousands more Angelenos, will be activated to join ongoing efforts to build a model community-led food system as we move towards 2050. ","We will rely on formative assessments, getting feedback in real time and redirecting when necessary. Summative assessments will use both quantitative and qualitative measurements - such as the increase in knowledge and confidence of trainees, increase demand and access to healthy food, and the number of graduates who secure employment, stay connected to the farm or launch their own food business. Unlike other garden projects, success isnâ€™t in the number of gardens we install, but in the sustainability of the farms we are cultivating, producing a high yield and creating long-term impact in the community.

Traditional metrics often overlook the unmeasurable community impact of connecting people to their food and the changes that happen when we empower youth to take on leadership roles. We will consider how many more people are eating healthier, through supporting social venture, youth empowerment, workforce reentry efforts, and locally grown food. This activation lays the foundation for L.A. Kitchen to transition from solely purchasing produce for its Strong Food contracts from larger suppliers who have less investment in social impact outcomes for Angelenos, towards supporting local community-led food systems. Including this new production site as well as existing urban farms, such as Alma Backyard Farms. By 2050 we hope to grow this coalition, increase the percentage of locally grown produce in our existing supply chain and the food dollars reinvested into our communities.","The future for LA is not relying on big corporations, but instead building a connected network of small businesses. In five years, we want to build a city-wide web of gardens that are thriving because they are linked by a business relationship that is profitable for all. We picture a network of community led gardens that collaborate on crop plans, harvesting schedules and production/distribution coordination. Most importantly, we want to empower a cadre of young LA residents who have been trained to think about how to make, manage and reinvest profit...and who will dare to dream of opening their own business someday.

We want to build a collaboration with health care agencies so we can begin to track how changes in our community led food systems may be impacting the health of LA residents who struggle with diet related illnesses. In five years, we will be actively engaged in powerful research projects with partner universities such as UCLA, Cal Poly Pomona and Keck Medical School at USC, to merge social enterprise, agricultural and  clinical research dedicated to better health outcomes, more equitable income opportunities and stronger intergenerational collaborations.

As the network grows, L.A. Kitchen wants  to increase the amount of locally grown produce featured in its contracts and other L.A. Kitchen / Strong Food branded products. Our goal is to prove that the power of market forces and everyday commerce IS the future fuel for philanthropy. We want to show, through the power of a simple sandwich purchase, that consumers can create a more deliberate system for authentic change by supporting companies that purposely set out to serve their communities. 

Of course, we want to increase our hours of operation, and the number of L.A Kitchen culinary graduates we employ. In equal proportion, we want to increase awareness about the coalition partners, as well as the income that they can count on when they develop their annual budgets.

From the nonprofit side of our business, we want to engage more intergenerational volunteers who, through their experience at L.A. Kitchen, standing side by side with L.A. Kitchen students and chefs, will be exposed to the folly of food waste, the civic toll of hunger and the compelling need to support and engage our elders, young people exiting foster care and our returning citizens.

As they work side by side, these volunteers will be creating more ethnically diverse, plant forward meals for seniors throughout Los Angeles, or participate in our Super Senior Site programs, where meals are served alongside health and wellness programs that will help participants stay active, live independently and feel included and engaged.

Our activation will vigorously promote LA as a city that champions innovation,celebrates inclusion and commits itself to building resilient communities. Through our highly visible outlets at LAX, and the media our model will attract, we want to inspire people to take our ideas home with them, and consider how they can use existing resources the way our coalition has, and generate similar job growth, economic opportunity and  community engagement.

It has been said that LA is the city where the future comes to happen. We want to prove that this axiom is true by revealing how the power of food and community can be maximized by the daring of dedicated partners who are committed to each other, their communities and the city we all call home.","[""Access to healthy food"",""Obesity rates"",""Resilient communities""]","Seed To Sky is L.A.

Capitalizing on their love of eating and sharing, we will involve them in the creation of â€œA Recipe for A Great City: Home Cooking.â€ This â€œcookbook,â€ to be available at local libraries, will highlight our diverse city and solutions generated by millennials at restaurant dialogues and neighborhood food and culture events.
","Our project will increase the participation of millennials in voicing their concerns and participating in the conversation around the future of their city through a creative process that first gets them involved in city planning around housing issues, and ultimately, participating in their local Neighborhood Councils. Entitled â€œA Recipe for A Great City: Home Cookingâ€ the project uses the popularity of food, music, art and digital tools among this group as the foundation for engagement.  
 
The strategies for increasing participation will include: 

Utilize New Tools for Greater Civic Engagement -
We will create a digital survey and a digital toolkit targeted at millennials specifically for use with this activation.
 
Influence Individual Behavior - 
We will entice millennials to become civically engaged by leveraging their passion for eating, art and digital sharing.
 
Policy Advocacy/Digital Organizing for Activism - 
A digital survey will specifically enable participants to weigh in on the issues of homelessness and housing in the city and how they would like to get involved in addressing the problem.  A digital toolkit will support the organizing effort by supporting participants in leading their own engagements or â€œkitchen tableâ€ conversations.
 
In-Person Engagements -
Digital toolkit will serve as the basis for people to engage their friends in â€œkitchen table conversationsâ€ focused on homelessness and housing in local restaurants and other popular gathering places.  In addition, food, art and music happenings called â€œOur Neighborhood Cooksâ€ hosted in conjunction with Neighborhood Councils (NC) and popular local artists and performers serve as platforms to weigh in on the best ideas coming out of the digital survey.  Our Neighborhood Cooks will include a cooking/eating competition for the recipe that best represents the neighborhood.  People would vote on the recipe that includes migration stories and oral histories about the recipes.  The selected recipes are incorporated into the final recipe book along with a road map on replicating the activation in other communities and cities.

By developing community compost hubs and a network of enthusiastic composters, we can reevaluate our food system and work with nature to value soil, and in doing so, connect to the vibrancy of our urban space.  
","We aim to strengthen the social fabric of LA by connecting Angelenos to their vibrant and diverse ecosystems. Weâ€™re challenging the people of Los Angeles to experience the world as a holistic, interdependent living exchange of energy that exist through people and the soil we live on . Compost is the process of returning natureâ€™s materials to the earth through decomposition, turning what was once discarded into a valuable resource. 
LA Compost hubs are spaces where kitchen scraps are turned into the ammendment needed for healthy soils. All hubs exist in partnerships with incredible organizations to support their thriving communities - from Monrovia to Elysian Valley,  DTLA, to Venice. These compost hubs are established in shared spaces-places where we coexist. The hubs create a space for people to connect to the natural world existing within our urban landscape. Angelenos will have the opportunity to  participate in various ways: learning food waste awareness and methods of composting, correctly sorting household food scraps, â€œdepositâ€ food scraps at their community hub, join a workshop to learn about soil health, turn a compost pile at an urban farm, learn about vermicompost, interact intergenerationally, and create social connections to support healthy neighborhoods. We see these shared spaces as a bridge to connect individuals to their surrounding community. We live in a society full of disconnection, within communities there is isolation, between age groups it difficult for people to relate. This issue of disconnection has contributed to the increasing rates of mental suffering, lack of social support, lack of intergenerational activities, low rates of volunteerism, and less time spent interacting with the vibrant natural world and all of its wonders. Each of the LA Compost hubs is a space to reconnect, a platform to begin building these social bridges for us to nourish our environments. It is a space to share, volunteer,  and engage in our civil society, broadening our horizons to meet outside of a coffee shop or board room, or our computer screens. 
There are significant environmental benefits to both reducing food waste and using finished compost- ultimately completing the story of food from farm to table to compost and back to the soil. The environmental benefits of compost include increased water retention, reduce erosion, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and increase nutritional value of food. These environmental benefits help stabilize and protect our changing climate, making LA more resilient. Our goal is to strengthen the social fabric of LA by amplifying shared spaces for connections, with each other, our food system and the vibrant ecosystems of LA- while diverting food waste from landfill, generating healthy compost to nourish LAâ€™s landscapes, protecting LA from drought and erosion, and celebrating diversity within soil and people. ","Compost adds value to the spaces where people are growing, living, and learning.Individuals across Los Angeles can be united with their neighbors around a topic we are all connected to, food.  Engaging with healthy food often leads to meals shared, stories told, and Angelenos interacting in a way beyond the typical text message. 

Our strategy is to influence behavior change through hands on sensory learning about compost, shifting away from the mindset of disposable habits. Our tactics to do this are increase activities for volunteering, hosting public gatherings for workshops, inviting neighborhood councils to turn days to meet outside, working to reduce residential segregation through active shared spaces.

This work is happening throughout the county, from scales as small as apartment balconies to regional urban farms. 
","-Increase mailing list: access to compost hubs
-Increase number of workshops held
-Grow participation in community gardens
-Increase locations for household food scrap drop off
-Measure invitations and participation from/in neighborhood councils
-Connections made, increase opportunity and value of small businesses and non profits in gardening, landscaping and urban farming. 

Our workshop surveys gather information about the individuals participating, and we report anecdotal and qualitative stories about connections made within the communities.  We measure the success of the program through access: access to local compost sites and access to information and educational programming. 

","We envision healthy soils in LA- where Angelenos are more connected to nature than concrete. Where people have access to healthy soil, water, air and food. 
In five years we envision local composting hubs in all of LAâ€™s neighborhoods, on our way to a cohesive composting system working with municipalities to promote individual, community and regional composting sites. We see an LA with more green spaces and need for compost to be applied to landscapes for homeowners and public space, working to sequester carbon. We'll work to increase access for those who cannot compost at home but want to contribute and support their local agriculture system. With increased access to food scraps drop locations -farmers markets, parks and libraries with garden programs. These three tiers- individual, community, regional- can collectively impact waste diversion while creating behavioral changes in our disconnected disposable economy. The tiers will work to support each other- with advanced workshops that incorporate outreach programs for learning at regional sites, and the education from the hubs translating to individuals confidently managing their own compost at home, connecting to the soil and each other.

8102062,8102062,"Connecting Angelenos to the Coalitions Shaping a Fair, Vibrant, and Sustainable Los Angeles ","LA Forward connects Angelenos with the organizers, policy experts, and coalitions based in disadvantaged communities in order to build a movement for a just, democratic, and sustainable Los Angeles. ","LA Forward will expand its civic education programsâ€”ballot guides, the LA Forwards & Backwards podcast, collateral like civic trading cardsâ€”to reach more than 100,000 Angelenos. These media will draw thousands to live actionsâ€”election parties, podcast events, classes, and trainings. Hundreds will grow as leaders through our campaign taskforces, policy research committee, and teams that use art, events, video, and media to raise consciousness of our regionâ€™s challenges and coalition efforts. ","We have amazing coalitions working on some of our biggest problems but people donâ€™t know about their work, donâ€™t know how to get involved, and there is not an easy entry point to participating. Without a sense of a viable path toward solving our problems and creating solutions, itâ€™s no wonder that voting rates are low and government isnâ€™t as responsive to residentsâ€™ needs as it should be.  LA is incredibly fragmented and at this key junction, is grappling with how to deal its increasingly post-suburban reality. We need an intentional effort to publicly and civilly debate these challenges and bridge these divides so Angelenos can enjoy affordable housing, transit connectivity, economic opportunity, and a healthy environment in a region that is increasingly resilient.

LA Forwardâ€™s approach to increasing voting rates is not premised on the common concept of exhorting people to vote based on civic spirit or any kind of gimmicks. Our theory is that people will vote when they understand whatâ€™s at stake in the decisions made by LOCAL elected officials. When they comprehend the regionâ€™s big picture challenges and how those relate to their own interests and values, Angelenos will be far more motivated to participate. Thatâ€™s the purpose of our popular and growing civic media, e.g. ballot guides, the LA Forwards & Backwards podcast, essays, collateral like civic trading cards, digital live steams of eventsâ€”which aims to reach more than 100,00 Angelenos by 2020.

Second, the path to deeper and enduring involvement requires a transition from the less active form of engagement with media and digital actions like petition-signing to participating in the interactive experiences of events, especially connecting with other people face-to-face. On its own, media can increase government responsiveness by letting officials know their actions are being tracked, but mediaâ€™s greatest power can be as a funnel to draw people into hands-on work. Thatâ€™s the purpose of our growing number of live actionsâ€”election parties, podcast events, classes, trainings, â€œtake actionâ€ fairs, and neighborhood hangouts in places like parks, bars, cafes, & co-working spaces.

Third, as community organizing experts like Marshall Ganz have shown, the only way to sustain mass involvement is by building organizations that enable individuals to take on increasing leadership responsibilities toward common purposes. We know that people are satisfied by participating in different ways and that the best way to be involved is with a group small enough that they can form meaningful relationships with each other. LA Forward is cultivating volunteer-led teams specific to various issues and methods of engagement. The main job of LA Forwardâ€™s staff and top leadership will be to act as organizersâ€”coaching volunteers to step up into leadership roles, providing guidance, and facilitating connections and trainings as necessary. 
","LA Forward engages our young, educated, and multiracial constituency with high-quality media, events, and digital activation of our 7,000 person email list. We empower newcomers to get involved in this work directly. Our Investing in Our Communities Taskforce is working to increase school funding through canvassing for signatures. Another groupâ€”Equitable Urbanistsâ€”represents us in housing and transit-related coalitions such as ACT-LA and speaking up in public forums of all kindsâ€”social media, periodicals, government hearings. Weâ€™re working with Metro to achieve impact at the County scale and pushing for the spread of affordable housing, especially for the homeless. We have small groups actively participating in coalitions to ban oil drilling near homes, to legalize street vending, and to redirect spending from incarceration and policing to community-based interventions.

Our growing Policy Committee, made up of experts from our board as well as newly activated participants, is responsible for our ballot guides, which reach more than 50,000 people each electoral cycle. We're growing a team of creative professionals who will use their talents in art, design, video, and other forms of media to raise consciousness of our regionâ€™s challenges and coalition efforts, on the model of our podcast has more than 30,000 downloads. And we have an expanding group of budding leaders who have already planned neighborhood hangouts, election parties, and Live Podcast events.  ","We will first define success through qualitative assessment of our programs by our internal leadership, program participants, and peer organizations. This first happens informally because weâ€™ve built an organizational culture that prizes asking questions and soliciting feedback. We will explore how to create meaningful but unobtrusive assessments of programs through practices like surveys.

Second, we will measure success by the number of people involved at each level of our workâ€”as viewers of our media (emails, podcasts, ballot guides, etc), as attendees at our live actions, as creators of our programs, and as leaders of our volunteer teams. We aim to reach 500,000 downloads of our podcast(s) by 2020, with at least 50,000 distinct listeners. We aspire for our ballot guides to reach at least 60,000 people each electoral cycle, with at least 20,000 of those being direct downloads of the full guide. By 2020, we plan to have engaged 3,000 people at in-person events and to have involved 250 people in the work of our volunteer teams. Finally, we intend to have recruited and coached 50 people as leaders of our various teams.

Two years is a short time frame to gauge systemic changes in civic engagement, much less for issues such as residential segregation. However, we will search out other indicators to evaluate the success of our work such as increases in down-ballot voting on propositions and the number of people whoâ€™ve attend city hearing and contacted their elected officials.","By 2023, we aspire for LA Forward to be a universally known and widely respected hub for connecting people across the county to coalitions based in disadvantaged communities that working for a fair, vibrant, and sustainable LA region. As part of this, we will be a genuinely welcome presence and good partner in these coalitions. We will consulted in advance by decisonmakers for our views, just as much as other major groups such as labor, business, developers, and neighborhood associations. And the civic media we produce will be a go-to source for people around the region and across sectors. The LA Forward model of civic media and organizing will become a template for bringing together and engaging people in other regions and cities.","[""Government responsiveness to residents’ needs"",""Residential segregation"",""Voting rates""]","We have amazing coalitions working on some of our biggest problems but people don’t know about their work, don’t know how to get involved, and there is not an easy entry point to participating. Without a sense of a viable path toward solving our problems and creating solutions, it’s no wonder that voting rates are low and government isn’t as responsive to residents’ needs as it should be. LA is incredibly fragmented and at this key junction, is grappling with how to deal its increasingly post-suburban reality. We need an intentional effort to publicly and civilly debate these challenges and bridge these divides so Angelenos can enjoy affordable housing, transit connectivity, economic opportunity, and a healthy environment in a region that is increasingly resilient.
 
 
 
 LA Forward’s approach to increasing voting rates is not premised on the common concept of exhorting people to vote based on civic spirit or any kind of gimmicks. Our theory is that people will vote when they understand what’s at stake in the decisions made by LOCAL elected officials. When they comprehend the region’s big picture challenges and how those relate to their own interests and values, Angelenos will be far more motivated to participate. That’s the purpose of our popular and growing civic media, e.g. ballot guides, the LA Forwards & Backwards podcast, essays, collateral like civic trading cards, digital live steams of events—which aims to reach more than 100,00 Angelenos by 2020.
 
 
 
 Second, the path to deeper and enduring involvement requires a transition from the less active form of engagement with media and digital actions like petition-signing to participating in the interactive experiences of events, especially connecting with other people face-to-face. On its own, media can increase government responsiveness by letting officials know their actions are being tracked, but media’s greatest power can be as a funnel to draw people into hands-on work. That’s the purpose of our growing number of live actions—election parties, podcast events, classes, trainings, “take action” fairs, and neighborhood hangouts in places like parks, bars, cafes, & co-working spaces.
 
 
 
 Third, as community organizing experts like Marshall Ganz have shown, the only way to sustain mass involvement is by building organizations that enable individuals to take on increasing leadership responsibilities toward common purposes. We know that people are satisfied by participating in different ways and that the best way to be involved is with a group small enough that they can form meaningful relationships with each other. LA Forward is cultivating volunteer-led teams specific to various issues and methods of engagement. The main job of LA Forward’s staff and top leadership will be to act as organizers—coaching volunteers to step up into leadership roles, providing guidance, and facilitating connections and trainings as necessary.",Connect,2018062,https://activation.la2050.org/connect/la-forward/la-forward.jpg,https://youtu.be/iK1p6nJf5bg,8102062

","The Art Barge is a pop-up event, a public art installation, and a living archive of the cultural history of the LA River. Transported by truck, with 6-week â€˜dockingsâ€™ at a proposed 12 river sites, its arrival will be the catalyst for coordinated site-specific arts and educational events. Together with local arts organizations, neighborhood councils, and community arts activists, the Art Barge will collect, present, and activate a new wave of 'localismâ€™ and a deepened cultural heritage for all.","Gather, Collect. Activate, Connect. 

The Art Barge is a traveling, interactive, living archive. It is, in itself, an activation. Its unique design and dual function as an archive will attract people of all ages and backgrounds. The activities around the barge 'dockings' will invite people to connect to each other and to their community. 

As a living artifact for the collection of diverse stories that weave together to form a multi-faceted public place identity, these stories of public art and culture will contribute to the meaning of the Riverâ€™s communities, reconstituting â€œcommunities of memoryâ€ that bridge and preserve historical with contemporary public art and cultural projects. 

The LA River Public Art Project can serve as a facilitator; the communities will lead, explore, and add their stories and recollections of art events along the River. Arts and cultural activities will be presented, discussed, reviewed, and selected in conjunction with individual site partners. 

Each of the proposed 12 docking sites will consider how to best tailor events, programs, and coordinate with neighborhood community organizations, businesses and residents. 

Our team's art historian and curator will bring additional perspective to the art installations, events, speaker/music series, and educational activities. While the barge will draw its county-wide audiences, local dockings will provide local residents unique access cultural events and volunteer opportunities.

The Art Barge will be designed to increase awareness of the cultural history of the River, entice people to go a park they may have never visited before, have a picnic along the River, engage with neighbors and community members at events and activities, encourage local and neighborhood organizations to develop associate events to coincide with Art Barge dockings, and enhance awareness of the cultural history of the LA River.

Connection? Think about the rock travelling through LA before it got to LACMA, or the first landing of the Airbus 380 at LAX: spontaneous and unexpected crowds showing up to see something great. No programming, no community directed announcements: just joy.  

Our â€˜connectâ€™ activation strategy is mobility in reverse. To quote a well-worn phrase by Francis Bacon, â€œIf Mohammed wonâ€™t go to the mountain, bring the mountain to him.â€ The Art Barge is envisioned as a temporary public art installation, docking at local sites, an event, a moment in history.

Activation is a local strategy.

Our â€˜connectâ€™ tactic is to provide a resource - and a stimulus. The interactive archive housed in the Art Barge will be content flexible: less data crunching, more hands-on, more connective. As cultural history is collected, viewed, and recorded, the breadth of the heritage of the River and its communities will strengthen the Riverâ€™s cultural value to the community.

Our â€˜connectâ€™ tool is the Art Barge. To be custom-designed by Ball-Nogues Studio, it will not only be public art, but will also house on-site WiFi, interactive activities, archival intake, and site-specific curated activities for all-ages. Working with local organizations and art constituencies, steeped in the knowledge and networks of each community, a diverse array of events and activities will emerge for each site.
","Each of the three metrics we have selected will have its own measurement tool.

We will impact the first metric â€“ attendance at cultural events â€“ though an increase in numbers of attendance in each community by 1-2% of the current County-wide figure of 12% who have attended a museum and 18% who have attended live performances. As visitors come through to the venue, volunteers will distribute and collect a unique numbered survey and ask them to take a 3-question survey.  
 
The second metric â€“ attendance at public/open street gatherings â€“ is a dream metric that we have identified a way to quantify. We propose utilizing city licenses issued for public events in the previous three years for establish a baseline for number of days there were public/open street gatherings in each community. We will add the number of Art Bargeâ€™s days of operation/public events to the current yearâ€™s city licenses issued to ascertain increase in percentage of in public/open street gatherings for that year.  
 
The third selected metric â€“ rates of volunteerism â€“ will be increased in each community by 1-2% of the current countywide figure of 20% who have volunteered formally. We propose creating a survey at volunteer intake/orientation days to quantify the numbers of participants.","In 5 years, we hope the Art Barge living archive will have a permanent home along the River, that Angelenos come to the River to view and participate in art installations and events, and are inspired by the legacies of the River's diverse communities. We envision a future river of curated public spaces, visitors arriving by bicycle or kayak or Metro, enjoying a break at a reclaimed and revitalized River.

We envision the LA River Public Art Project actively engaged in cultural development, and funded and staffed with paid employees and enthusiastic volunteers. We hope to have an established mentoring program to expand cultural and art awareness as we reach across local, regional, and global audiences.","[""Attendance at cultural events"",""Attendance at public/open streets gatherings"",""Rates of volunteerism""]","Gather, Collect.

Afterschool staff will facilitate an innovative learning experience in which students work together to code and build LEGO Education robots. Students will learn 21st century engineering and computer science skills, and even more - they will develop growth mindset, create collaboration and work as teams to innovate and compete.","Through the proposed project, LAâ€™s BEST will expand KidBot, an afterschool robotics program for Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) elementary school students--at no cost to parents. Created in 2013, KidBot offers children the opportunity to engage with computer science and engineering through hands-on learning experiences that introduce them to the basic components of robot technology and elements of robot design. 

LAâ€™s BEST KidBot is hosted on elementary school sites during the afterschool hours in the schoolâ€™s computer lab. The KidBot program currently serves 320 students in 16 schools. Through the LA2050 activation, we can reach all 25,000 students in close to 200 elementary schools across LA!

LAâ€™s BEST provides high-quality training to program staff â€“ young adults with deep connections to the communities we serve â€“ to facilitate KidBot effectively, while also supporting the development of skills coveted by todayâ€™s workforce. â€œKidBot coachesâ€ guide students through the process of utilizing LEGO Mindstorms kits to work in teams to design and program their own robot.

Over the course of a 12-week period, KidBot participants explore the three areas of STEM learning--mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and computer science--increasing their knowledge of robotics engineering and robot functions. This process takes place as students practice collaboration skills when building and designing their teamâ€™s robots and problem-solving skills when programming robots. As students begin interacting with the robot parts, coaches encourage participants through the process of engaging with their work as â€œengineersâ€ in a robotics laboratory or workshop. With support from i.am.angel foundation, each KidBot site participate in regional competitions with other robotics clubs from surrounding schools. These competitions offer children the opportunity to learn how friendly competition and mutual gain are not separate goals; helping each other is the foundation of teamwork.

A key value of organization is student choice, so children select the activities or clubs in which they take part. With all activities offered at no cost to parents, children who would otherwise not have opportunities for quality out-of-school time learning experiences are afforded important, often life-changing computer science and engineering education through KidBot.

In fostering critical thinking skills, KidBot empowers students to flourish creatively and view competition as another way to learn from and teach others. Further, the integration of social and emotional learning in programming encourages students to cultivate higher-thinking skills such as responsibility, empathy, teamwork, problem solving, emotion management and initiative. These components empower students as they develop strong, positive relationships with peers and adults through their journey to becoming young leaders in the STEM field.","The LAâ€™s BEST KidBot program is innovative in how it offers ways for children to use technology strategically in a workshop-like environment. For many students served by LAâ€™s BEST, engagement with technology at home is limited to game-play. At school, computer use is often limited to test preparation or reading and math intervention programs. KidBot offers the opportunity to explore technology creatively through the collaborative process in programming, designing and building their own robots.

LA's BEST will engage students, staff and supporters across Los Angeles through the proposed activation. All LAâ€™s BEST sites--Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) elementary schools--are located throughout Central, East and South Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley. On average, 90% of LAâ€™s BEST students quality for free or reduced-price lunch. For 44% of students served by LAâ€™s BEST, English is a second language. Additionally, LAâ€™s BEST employs more than 2,000 young adults--many whom reside in the same neighborhoods as the service demographic--to teach, coach and mentor the 25,000 children who attend the afterschool program every day.. In addition to cultivating 21st century skills among the children served by LAâ€™s BEST, LAâ€™s BEST provides comprehensive training to program staff, supporting the development of a local workforce prepared for success in todayâ€™s world.","LAâ€™s BEST will measure changes in knowledge and attitudes among KidBot participants. As with any new learning, a studentâ€™s assessment of their performance capabilities influences their motivation to continue; students need to feel that they can engage and be successful in the endeavor. To encourage that engagement, LAâ€™s BEST students have the ability to self-select the activities in which they take part in. Student self-efficacy is examined through a pre- and post-surveys that measure studentsâ€™ critical thinking, collaborative learning and persistence.","In the next five years, LAâ€™s BEST hopes to engage the 25,000 children we serve with KidBot through locating more funding in supplying computers and hardware for each new program, along with more high-quality training to equip program staff with the necessary tools to support KidBot successfully. By expanding robotics programming to more sites, more children from under-resourced neighborhoods will have the opportunity to explore their interests in science, technology, engineering and math through an innovative, hands-on learning experience. Moreover, facilitating KidBot at more sites enables students to compete against their LAâ€™s BEST peers during regional competitions in addition to non-affiliated schools.","[""Students’ immersion in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math content""]","Through the proposed project, LA’s BEST will expand KidBot, an afterschool robotics program for Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) elementary school students--at no cost to parents.

How would you feel? How would people treat you? Would you be able to keep your job or apply for one? Access to hygiene is essential to paving a path out of homelessness. No one can lift themselves out of poverty if they canâ€™t get clean. Lava Mae will mobilize 100,000 Angelenos to help us deliver mobile showers and make it possible for our unhoused neighbors to restore their dignity, maintain their health + well-being and get clean so they can access jobs + housing.","â€œLava Mae saved my life. I feel like a million bucks after one of their showers, and I can walk down the streets with my head held high. Theyâ€™ve become my Tuesday family.""  
~ Luis, Lava Mae guest

â€œProviding mobile showers to those in need has been inspiring. Iâ€™ve made long lasting connections with our shower guests and consider them my friends. I have a much better understanding of why people are homeless, and I have so much love and compassion for them. Seeing the impact on the people of the LA neighborhood where I volunteer is a blessing, and itâ€™s given me much more of a sense of connection to my community.â€ 
~ Jennifer, Lava Mae volunteer

While Lava Mae provides critical access to showers and toilets for people experiencing homelessness, our work is about much more. Itâ€™s about connection. We reconnect our guests with their sense of self-worth and dignity, and with staff and volunteers who treat them with the utmost care and attention. 

Through our volunteer program, we engage individuals from all walks of life to deliver our service. In doing so, we give them the opportunity to connect with our guests and acknowledge and honor their shared humanity. Since launching our service in 2014, weâ€™ve created transformative connections for thousands of guests and volunteers alike. 

Lava Maeâ€™s vision for LA2050 is to mobilize 100,000 Angelenos to dramatically expand mobile hygiene across Los Angeles to restore hygiene, dignity and hope to our unhoused neighbors. Hereâ€™s how weâ€™ll do it:

1. Replication. Weâ€™ll begin by helping individuals and organizations across LA replicate our service by providing the resources, guidance, and hands-on help they need to launch mobile showers in their communities. The best and strongest services come from the communities where the need exists.

2. Education. Lava Mae will execute a robust campaign to educate neighborhood groups, schools and universities, businesses, nonprofits, social entrepreneurs, philanthropic organizations, faith-based groups, and other organizations/networks about access to hygiene and its link to dignity/opportunity, with the goal of mobilizing a volunteer force of 100k Angelenos.

3. Transformation. Weâ€™ll also launch a visibility raising campaign to inspire citizens to consider what a shower really means, what it means when you cannot shower, and what they can do to help provide hygiene, dignity, hope and opportunity for their unhoused neighbors. 

For exampleâ€¦

The Power of a Shower. Did you shower today? If youâ€™re living on the streets, you probably didnâ€™t. Lava Mae delivers mobile showers to help people experiencing homelessness rekindle dignity and maintain hygiene so they can seek employment and housing. If you can take a shower, you can help give a shower to a neighbor in need. Visit lavamae.org and learn how you can give a shower and the dignity + opportunity that come with being clean.
","1. Replication. Lava Maeâ€™s Replication Support program will assist communities across LA to bring mobile showers to their neighborhoods through our comprehensive online toolkit, training program, and one-on-one consultations. 

2. Education. Through public meetings, and visits to neighborhood groups, schools and universities, businesses, etc. Lava Maeâ€™s LA team will educate, inspire and invite people to take action by volunteering and engaging 1:1 in the effort to create transformative relationships that heal, seed hope, deliver dignity and make it possible for our houseless neighbors to build the resilience needed to move up and out of homelessness.

3. Transformation. Through earned media, social media, digital marketing and pro bono partnerships with advertising agencies and PR firms, our â€œPower of a Showerâ€ campaign will inspire citizens to help give showers to our unhoused neighbors by volunteering in one or more of the following ways:

- Launch new mobile shower services
- Volunteer at existing shower sites
- Organize group volunteer activities
- Lead volunteer trainings
- Collect travel-sized toiletries, towels, socks, underwear, clothing and other essentials
- Assemble and distribute hygiene kits for shower guests 
- Host small fundraisers  ($10 provides one shower)
- Secure in-kind donations (towels, t-shirts, etc)
- Recruit new volunteers from their personal and professional networks, and through digital organizing and speaking engagements
","We will define and measure success via engagement, from those providing showers, to those volunteering to support shower service, to our houseless neighbors receiving showers.  The success metrics fall into the following areas.  

Via our Replication Support Program:
The number of new mobile shower services launched (replicators in LA) 

Via Lava Mae education:
Number of public/educational meetings hosted by Lava Mae
Number of volunteers that are inspired to take action as a result of those meetings

Via Lava Mae transformation campaign:
Number of volunteers who are helping to run mobile shower sites, creating hygiene kits,  securing in-kind donations and hosting fundraising events
Number of volunteers that are organizing group volunteer activities
Number of volunteers who are recruiting and training new volunteers
","Five years from now, our highest hope is that homelessness has been dramatically reduced across Los Angeles. But wherever there remains a need for mobile hygiene, Lava Mae will have inspired and supported neighborhoods across LA to bring hygiene, dignity, and opportunity to their unhoused neighbors. Mobile showers will be readily available to people experiencing homelessness in every community where there is a need. Hundreds of thousands of Angelenos will have volunteered to help dramatically expand access to hygiene and other critical services for those living on the streets. Giving hundreds of thousands of citizens meaningful opportunities to connect with their unhoused neighbors, person-to-person, will have shifted perceptions and shattered stereotypes about people who are experiencing homelessness, seeded greater empathy, and galvanized action. And we will have mobilized hundreds of thousands of Angelenos to advocate for more innovative solutions to alleviating Los Angelesâ€™ homelessness crisis.","[""Adults getting sufficient social & emotional support"",""Government responsiveness to residents’ needs"",""Rates of volunteerism""]","“Lava Mae saved my life. I feel like a million bucks after one of their showers, and I can walk down the streets with my head held high. They’ve become my Tuesday family."" 
 
 ~ Luis, Lava Mae guest
 
 
 
 “Providing mobile showers to those in need has been inspiring. I’ve made long lasting connections with our shower guests and consider them my friends. I have a much better understanding of why people are homeless, and I have so much love and compassion for them. Seeing the impact on the people of the LA neighborhood where I volunteer is a blessing, and it’s given me much more of a sense of connection to my community.” 
 
 ~ Jennifer, Lava Mae volunteer
 
 
 
 While Lava Mae provides critical access to showers and toilets for people experiencing homelessness, our work is about much more. It’s about connection. We reconnect our guests with their sense of self-worth and dignity, and with staff and volunteers who treat them with the utmost care and attention. 
 
 
 
 Through our volunteer program, we engage individuals from all walks of life to deliver our service. In doing so, we give them the opportunity to connect with our guests and acknowledge and honor their shared humanity. Since launching our service in 2014, we’ve created transformative connections for thousands of guests and volunteers alike. 
 
 
 
 Lava Mae’s vision for LA2050 is to mobilize 100,000 Angelenos to dramatically expand mobile hygiene across Los Angeles to restore hygiene, dignity and hope to our unhoused neighbors. Here’s how we’ll do it:
 
 
 
 1. Replication. We’ll begin by helping individuals and organizations across LA replicate our service by providing the resources, guidance, and hands-on help they need to launch mobile showers in their communities. The best and strongest services come from the communities where the need exists.
 
 
 
 2. Education. Lava Mae will execute a robust campaign to educate neighborhood groups, schools and universities, businesses, nonprofits, social entrepreneurs, philanthropic organizations, faith-based groups, and other organizations/networks about access to hygiene and its link to dignity/opportunity, with the goal of mobilizing a volunteer force of 100k Angelenos.
 
 
 
 3. Transformation. We’ll also launch a visibility raising campaign to inspire citizens to consider what a shower really means, what it means when you cannot shower, and what they can do to help provide hygiene, dignity, hope and opportunity for their unhoused neighbors.

8102067,8102067,LawMaker.io: A Collaboration Between Angelenos and LA Elected Officials to Solve Homelessness in LA,"LawMaker.io is launching a public, yearlong project for Angelenos & elected officials to collaboratively discuss solutions for homelessness & build grassroots political support for tangible change.","LawMaker is planning a 1-year collaboration between elected officials and residents to tackle homelessness in LA. This 12-month discussion will be divided into phases to 1) identify problems, 2) propose solutions, 3) analyze risks, 4) evaluate proposals, & 5) develop tangible resolutions. The process will be open to the public both on and offline to maximize participation and transparency as stakeholders and politicians work to develop programs and build support to effectively help the homeless.","Homelessness is the most pressing issue afflicting Los Angeles today. Over 57,000 people are without a home each night â€“ 5,000 are children, and 4,000 are senior citizens. There is public consensus that something must be done, but a plurality of us has yet to agree on solutions, so little progress has been made. With the passage of Prop. HHH and Measure H to fund homeless housing and services, LA has an opportunity. How do we build the political will for tangible policies that lift the homeless, and Los Angeles, out of this crisis?  Political will is entirely rooted in unity, consensus, and collaboration â€“ in a word, connection. 

LawMaker proposes building this connection with a 1-year public activation that brings LA residents, homelessness leaders, and elected officials together to answer one question: â€œWhat programs to help the homeless can you support in your neighborhood?â€ The public dialogue will focus on increasing awareness of key levers impacting homelessness and building support for tangible policies to help individuals and families off the streets. 

LawMaker is an online platform, but not everyone has equal access to technology. To ensure broad participation, LawMaker will work with the Cityâ€™s neighborhood councils to hold public events in each of LAâ€™s city council districts. These meetings will be advertised well in advance, shared through LawMaker's partners and the NCs, and will be streamed/transcribed online at LawMaker.io. In collaboration with the City, LawMaker will publicize these neighborhood council events as a way to truly connect and constructively discuss issues around homelessness. 

To guide this public conversation toward a productive and tangible resolution, LawMaker will convene a Leadership Board of six elected officials, six leaders from the homeless service sector, and six civic leaders. This board will guide the various phases of the conversation and provide feedback to stakeholders at regular intervals. For example, problems identified in Phase 1â€™s open call for problem statements, will then be segmented by the Board into distinct verticals to be addressed in Phase 2, for example: affordable housing, homelessness prevention, mental health services, drug rehabilitation services, veterans programs, and safe parking zones. The elected officials and other board members will also be responsible for consolidating community feedback into draft proposals to help the homeless with programs distributed across the city. See the budget for an outline of the phased process.

The policies developed will be presented to LA residents for review and comment via public government meetings, neighborhood council meetings, and via the online voting/discussion platform at LawMaker.io. The public nature of these discussions, and the commitment made by the participating elected officials, are designed to build public support and pressure for concrete legislative action based on stakeholder input in the following legislative cycle.","Connection around political issues should lead to civic progress. Yet these days, violent collision seems more common than connection, and resentment and division are left in its wake. LawMakerâ€™s proposes to connect three large communities to spark productive civic action.  

First, we hope to activate the homeless community through its many service & advocacy organizations. For too long, the homeless have been kept out of a process that directly impacts them. In concert with the City, EmpowerLAâ€™s Homeless Liaisons, and city homeless service organizations, LawMaker intends to activate the homeless community to speak to their own experiences, present a more accurate narrative around homelessness, and propose solutions that would truly benefit them. 

Second, LawMaker intends to activate the residential community of homeowners and renters who have strong feelings about homeless solutions in their communities. By asking them the question, â€œwhat programs to help the homeless can you support in your neighborhood?â€ we will engage them in an ideation around solutions that can earn support and mitigations that can limit negative impacts. 

Third, we hope to activate the quiet majority of LA that is often unheard in civic meetings but would like to see support for our homeless neighbors. By providing an online venue to participate and share, LawMaker will reduce the barrier for many Angelenos who canâ€™t show up to public hearings to weigh in on policies proposed for their communities.","The LA Times quantifies the adversaries to homelessness solutions as a â€œsmall but vocal and implacable group of opponents.â€ It is not uncommon for a vocal and extreme minority to sway politics when the moderate majority doesnâ€™t feel involved in the discussion or have easy avenues to participate. LawMaker aims to change this dynamic on the LA homelessness debate. 

By providing a year of publicly posted community discussions, both online and offline, our activation will make it easier for Angelenos to weigh in on homeless issues that impact their neighborhoods. LawMaker will measure the success of this effort with two key metrics. 

First, we will quanify how many people participate in the yearlong discussion. This will include how many people attend public meetings, propose solutions in person or online, comment or propose amendments, and upvote/downvote ideas on LawMaker. Each of these people will have participated in the civic discourse on solving homelessness in LA. Our goal is to activate 100,000 Angelenos. 

Our next success metric will focus on the results of this public discussion. Civic action should result in civic change. The success of this activation should measure that change by the housing and services created as a result of this process. A year after this activation, LawMaker will gauge the success of our endeavor by how many units of housing and dollars of services are proposed by elected officials to address homelessness in the LA area. ","LawMaker has proposed this activation to show how building proactive political engagement from the grassroots can lead to tangible political solutions at all levels for government. While this activation only focuses on homelessness in LA, we built our platform to scale beyond this topic and geography. In five years, LawMaker intends to be a national online platform that allows Americans anywhere to propose ideas for policies they want to see at the city, county, state and federal levels. It is our hope that 1% of all policy discussed on the floors of government originate with a civilian authored proposals on LawMaker.","[""Government responsiveness to residents’ needs"",""Participation in neighborhood councils""]","Homelessness is the most pressing issue afflicting Los Angeles today.

8102068,8102068,Invest in Parents & Connect Families Across Socioeconomic Barriers to Break the Cycle of Poverty,"LIFT-LA will transform the lives of 4,000 community members and influence 100,000 Angelenos to break the cycle of intergenerational poverty for parents and children. ","LIFT-LA will launch the #upLIFTingLA campaign to change the perception of people living in poverty in order to build social and financial capital. The campaign features an event called LIFTopolis, which brings together 250 philanthropists, elected officials, and thought leaders to influence social service systems change. We will share stories from the 4,000 parents and children living in poverty to break down the barriers that divide us and lift all Angelenos across social and economic divides.","The cycle of poverty is perpetuated by stereotypes and stigma. Everyone has experienced the need to reach out for help.  Imagine if, when you do so, you are constantly turned away because you donâ€™t have the right documents, you donâ€™t speak the right language, you donâ€™t qualify for services. Your situation is desperate and you know your children are being adversely affected every day. This is the grim reality for millions of hard-working Angelenos.

Los Angeles County ranks seventh in income inequality out of the nationâ€™s 150 largest metro regions. While Los Angeles County has the highest number of millionaire residents in the country, 21.5% of our cityâ€™s residents are living in poverty. LIFT-LA actively builds bridges and provides opportunities for people within these communities â€“ the top 5% and the bottom 21.5% - to connect. This is an intentional and radical approach as part of our four-year strategic plan to build bridged social capital between communities, and to allow our members and supporters to be in relationships with one another. We know from experience that the power of social networks can make or break our ability to achieve goals. LIFT-LA not only shines the light on the achievements of our members, we shine the light on the value of networks, compassion and the ability that the philanthropic community has to directly affect the well-being of others. 

Through this activation, LIFT-LA will break down the barriers that divide us, and show Angelenos the real faces of people living in poverty: the faces of fierce and determined parents who are working hard to create opportunities for themselves and their children. LIFT-LA offers so many ways for people from different communities to connect. Through our Member2Member (M2M) network we facilitate direct transfers of cash and resources between supporters and members in times of crisis. Through our Holiday Fiesta, LIFT-LA connects supporter and member families during the holidays to be in relationships with one another that span the course of the year. This facilitation of bridged social capital not only has direct impacts for the member and supporter families involved, it helps to change the narrative of division and separation between communities.
This innovative model of social capital is like no other work taking place in Los Angeles, and it is making our city a better place to live for everyone. We are directly impacting families by reducing adverse childhood experiences and lifting up families to reach a place of self-sufficiency.

Due to the wealth disparity, what we have accomplished at LIFT-LA is a microcosm of what is possible for the rest of the nation. If bridged social capital is possible in LA, it is possible anywhere and LIFT is leading the way in creating resilient communities. 
","LIFT is actively building bridges and providing opportunities for people within these communities â€“ the top 5% and the bottom 21.5% - to connect. We will run an event called LIFTopolis, an empathy-inducing simulation illuminating how difficult it is for those who are poor to navigate the social services system. The venue is transformed into a bustling city â€œLIFTopolisâ€ where participants take on the identity of a LIFT member and the space is filled with social service and government agencies. After the simulation, an expert panel leads a conversation on what participants can do to create change. We share LIFTâ€™s insights on solutions, and invite participants to join #upLIFTingLA. We will build bridged social capital throughout the year through: 1) Quarterly skill-building workshops for LIFT parents around career pathways with supporters invited to serve as volunteers and mentors; 2) Outings and experiences (i.e. hiking, back-to-school drives) that put families in relationship with each other across socioeconomic barriers; 3) Digital and in-person invitations to join our network called Member2Member, that delivers responsive financial resources to families in need from those who are well-resourced; 4) Holiday Fiesta which offers the opportunity for sponsor families to invest in families participating in LIFT with traditional gift exchange acting as a nontraditional spark to bring families together past the holiday season.","LIFT believes that in order to break the intergenerational cycle of poverty, it is critical for people who are wealthy and people who are poor to be in mutually beneficial relationships with one another. It is by bridging this social capital that LIFT parents will be able to experience accelerated access to financial stability. It is the transformative power of bridged social capital that gets families to better solutions faster, and in the process build stronger communities. In fact, at LIFT weâ€™ve actually proven it works by tracking growth in our membersâ€™ social capital and comparing it to their progress against economic outcomes and found an undeniable correlation between the two. In short, the more social capital you have, the more likely it is you achieve your goals. We will use the following metrics to measure the success of #upLIFTingLA: 80% of LIFT families reporting progress on one or more of the below three measures: 35% of families increase income; 50% of families decrease debt or increase savings; 70% of families persist in or improve education or employment; 250+ attendees at LIFTopolis; 500+ high-net worth individuals and community member families at Holiday Fiesta; 20% increase on average over the course of the year in social media impressions using #upLIFTingLA hashtag; we will activate Angelenos to vote with their wallets raising $7M for LIFT-Los Angeles to serve 4000 LIFT members directly and impact over 100,000 Angelenos by 2021.","Long-term, LIFT seeks to position itself as a leading action tank for the anti-poverty field. Our movement towards this goal is evident in our invitation to participate in a Health and Human Services Department evaluation that will help the HHS Administration for Children and Families assess if and how coaching can better support parentsâ€”particularly those receiving TANFâ€”in reaching their economic security goals. This is an exciting opportunity for LIFT to have broad sector influence by elevating coaching as a meaningful investment, alongside the biggest social service provider in the US, the federal government. 
However, we know that data and research alone do not bring about systems change. It is the voices, faces and stories of individuals and families that bring clarity and authenticity to the issues that shape our city. Through our Member2Member network, LIFT is a trust broker executing on not just successful moments of bridged social capital, but putting people in relationship with one another who would otherwise never meet. People who come from wholly different backgrounds and life experiences. Acts of generosity and connection do more than just mitigate homelessness. It allowed that member to persist in the pursuit of their long-term goals to self-sufficiency. LIFT is in the unique position of offering an effective researched-based model to combat poverty, while also offering compelling, real stories of our hard-working members and our empathetic and committed donor network. As an organization, we can demonstrate how an agency can facilitate relationships between people who are different from one another and we know that in order to move the needle on poverty, bridged social capital is integral. These stories are not just a feel-good blog post, but rather a key component to our systems change strategy in the sector. By lifting up the voices of these people, LIFT has the ability to shape culture and perception, creating compassionate, resilient communities, and making Los Angeles the best place to live.

LOLA empowers young residents by explaining local issues and elections in a concise, nonpartisan way.","Many young Los Angelenos are disengaged in local elections, and theyâ€™re not alone. In LAâ€™s 2017 mayoral race, only 12 percent of registered voters cast a ballot. 

In the midst of an important midterm election year, LOLA will create a nonpartisan digital platform where young, busy people can learn, discuss ideas, and help tackle some of LAâ€™s stickiest issues. Our goal is to support community projects and double the number of young voters participating in local elections by 2020.","Would the average Los Angeles resident be able to explain the role of an LA superior court judge or county assessor? Unfortunately, the answer is probably not. Itâ€™s not surprising that civic participation and voter turnout is low. Local politics is designed for insiders. LOLAâ€™s mission is to change that. 

LOLA is a website where young, busy Los Angelenos can quickly and easily learn how their city works. In a midterm election year, weâ€™ll demystify everything from LA city councils to ballot initiatives. So if residents are voting on who should be the next county assessor, LOLA will explain what they do and why they matter. LOLA is the first step for residents to engage in local politics. As they become more familiar with local issues, weâ€™ll have a moderated community forum for people to discuss ideas, candidates, and propositions. We want to replace comment sections with conversations. We believe this is how we start to build momentum for connecting Los Angelenos and empowering them to contribute to civic life.

Beyond local election coverage, LOLA will have ways for residents to discover people and organizations tackling important issues like homelessness, housing, and public transit. There are hundreds of incredible local initiatives seeking support and volunteers. LOLA will be the place where people can learn about their work and sign up to help. We believe collaborations create communities. Similar to our local political information, weâ€™ll apply human-centered design to design a place that makes it easy for people to trust, discover, and get involved in local projects.
","A 2015 Knight Foundation study found that 88% of millennials consume news through Facebook. Today, that number has only grown as more young people rely on social media platforms as their primary source of news. This is a massive challenge when it comes to local politics and election information. While down-ballot resources are available, local politics isnâ€™t optimized for mobile consumption and social media sharing. Instead, election coverage is often boring and riddled with political jargon and biased opinions. 

By creating concise, easy-to-understand, nonpartisan summaries of candidates, elected offices, and local issues, LOLA will activate young Los Angelenos so they can re-engage in local issues and their communities. Our goal is to reach young, busy Los Angelenos of all socioeconomic backgrounds, and we plan to translate LOLA into other languages like Spanish and Mandarin.","At LOLA, our definition of success is to make residents feel empowered and engaged in their local communities. Weâ€™ll measure success in three ways: 
How many voters between the ages of 18-34 participate in local elections and how does that compare to previous midterm election years
How many people return to LOLA to learn about local issues
How many local projects successfully find collaborators and volunteers

Rather than track the number of impressions or social media shares, itâ€™s important for us to build a lasting relationship with Los Angelenos. Measuring impact, trust, and loyalty, respectively, are essential benchmarks for LOLA.","By 2023, we hope LOLA will be the go-to digital platform where LA residents, organizations, and businesses learn about local issues, discuss new ideas, and collaborate on community projects.

Goals: 
Engage and educate community members on how to understand and support people who struggle with learning.
Expand the Los Angeles network of  K16 educators and leaders who have a knowledge base and the tools to work with people with learning differences toward a goal of independence.
Include all stakeholders in our LA community in the process of building healthy self-esteem for those who guide side-by-side with those who learn.","The creation of Lola evolved from the urgent need to give K-16 students, with learning differences, tools that he/she needs in order to perform tasks necessary to everyday functioning and learning, in/out of the classroom, regardless of demographics. Users include: school Districts, service provider agencies and behavior interventionists, parents and adults who self-assign utilize Lola software to best provide support that fosters not only growth in learners but independence as well.
 
As this is the fundamental purpose of Lola, when guides such as teachers/support personnel/parents utilize all that Lola offers, classrooms and other settings see an increase in ALL student engagement, in promotion of students with below proficient and/or higher skills, along with an increase of teacher effectiveness on classroom management and delivery of instruction in general and access to rigorous curriculum, no matter where the teacher is in his/her career or school address.
When Lola software helps leaners  with learning differences access rigorous curriculum and stay focused by: breaking routines into manageable tasks, providing visual timers, and enabling a messaging system for support, community realizes the value because the learning environment becomes more efficient/effective. 
Executive functioning, commonly thought of as organizational skills, are something that typically developing students acquire over time, but students with various types of learning differences find especially difficult to overcome when reaching for academic success. Approximately 13% of the 55 million preK-12 students in the United States are diagnosed as needing special education services; 64% of these students are categorically labeled as having a Learning Disability or Specific Learning Disability (NCES, 2015). Learning Disabilities and/or Specific Learning Disability can include Dyslexia, Dyscalculia, Auditory and Visual Processing Disorders, and Dysgraphia.  Additionally, students with Traumatic Brain Injuries, Other Health Impairments, Attention Deficit Disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, and Autism Spectrum Disorder also struggle with executive functioning. Since 2000, categorical areas such as Other Health Impairments and Autism Spectrum Disorders have seen more than 400% increase in diagnosis (NCES, 2015). Supporting the executive functioning of students diagnosed with Learning Disabilities, Traumatic Brain Injuries, Other Health Impairments, and Autism Spectrum Disorders has plagued educators and families alike. Arguably, the most frustrating situations for educators and parents alike include: not being able to support children by giving each child the tools he/she needs to navigate through his or her day with confidence and independence.
","Successful modern societies require broad participation from all citizens to thrive and evolve. With technology immersion, participants need better learning systems to develop basic and advanced skills in processing information and developing creativity. Leaving many behind is not an option for our society. Lola helps everyone build skills and confidence needed by all citizens in the modern world.


Through demos and awareness we will reach more guides and learners in Los Angeles who do not know that with just the right amount of support we can transform a struggling learning into an independent confident learner.Our research team will inform next steps, to make sure we continue on the best path.

Our team will coordinate marketing, organizing volunteers and a research project. We will target our already existing schools network, both LAUSD, non-charter, charter schools, LA higher Ed Institutions and regional centers serving people with disabilities. With a get the word out and providing that Lola is here to help- activating 100,000 learners is doable. 

Funding for special education and for providing accommodations for learners in higher education can be used, and actually saves money, on Lola.

Offering volunteer opportunities, especially for eager high school students, to help explain and board users will be a win-win for the volunteers and new Lola users. These activities with develop growth mindsets and an understanding of differences both in/out of the classroom.
 



 ","We have secured a research project:
Sample Research Questions:
For Learner Task Completion: Do students using Lola complete more tasks during classroom time than without Lola?
For Learner Time in Task: Do students using Lola complete more tasks on time, than without Lola?
For Impact on Overall Classroom Disruptions: Do classrooms using Lola have fewer disruptions than classrooms not using Lola?
For Usability: Does Lola function appropriately across various types of devices,  various academic content areas, various student ability level, and various instructional activities?
For Initial Feasibility: What are teacher and studentâ€™s  perceptions and satisfaction with Lola as a technological support for individual student time on task, student task completion, and impact on overall classroom disruptions.
 
Measures:
Surveys: Surveys focused on guide and learner perceptions of the user friendliness of Lolaâ€™s Messaging System and Visual Timers will be implemented at both pre and post stages of the study.
 
De-Identified Data Points: De-identified data points focused on students and teachers frequency of use of Lola Messaging System and Visual Timers, individual student task completion, and overall classroom task completion will be collected from Lola data system.

Are at risk students on a stronger path towards graduation?
 
Additionally: monitor how does volunteer work impact getting Lola into the the hands of those who need support. Along with impact on the volunteer experience.","With all we know and are able to study about the brain, activation now within LA 2050 will lead us to healthier options for people in Los Angeles with and without cognitive disabilities.

As mentioned, broader societal needs will be met when Lola is customized for use by parents (already in pilot),  Teacher Ed Institutions (of which UCLA has rolled out 2017) and  therapists working with Brain Trauma ( a pilot in the works). ","[""College and community college completion rates"",""District-wide graduation rates"",""Proficiency in English and Language Arts and Math""]","The creation of Lola evolved from the urgent need to give K-16 students, with learning differences, tools that he/she needs in order to perform tasks necessary to everyday functioning and learning, in/out of the classroom, regardless of demographics. Users include: school Districts, service provider agencies and behavior interventionists, parents and adults who self-assign utilize Lola software to best provide support that fosters not only growth in learners but independence as well.
 
  
 
 As this is the fundamental purpose of Lola, when guides such as teachers/support personnel/parents utilize all that Lola offers, classrooms and other settings see an increase in ALL student engagement, in promotion of students with below proficient and/or higher skills, along with an increase of teacher effectiveness on classroom management and delivery of instruction in general and access to rigorous curriculum, no matter where the teacher is in his/her career or school address.
 
 When Lola software helps leaners with learning differences access rigorous curriculum and stay focused by: breaking routines into manageable tasks, providing visual timers, and enabling a messaging system for support, community realizes the value because the learning environment becomes more efficient/effective.

8102072,8102072,Retail Workers â€œRâ€ LA,"The project will enable LAâ€™s 150,000 retail workers to connect with each other across LAâ€™s vast size, learn their rights, register to vote, and become effective, civically engaged advocates. 
","We aim to enable retail workers all over LA to connect with each other using social media with a purpose-designed digital app as well as in- person events.  Through this connection, retail workers will have the combined power to advocate for policies that improve their lives and expand their participation in city life. We will use this process and the lessons it teaches about power, advocacy and policy making to motivate retail workers to register and vote in local and state elections
","The nearly 150,000 retail workers in LA are subject to erratic and unpredictable scheduling and lack of access to full time work. Based on a survey of over 800 workers led by the Fair Workweek team and volunteers, and a UCLA study based on that survey and other research, 80% of retail workers lack a set schedule each week, 72% work different days every week, 77% receive one week or less notice of their schedules, and 62% of workers are expected to have â€œopen availability.â€
This practice creates insurmountable obstacles to planning for childcare, attending classes, obtaining a second job, or being active in their communities.  To overcome this problem, workers need to connect with each other and advocate for themselves.
Retail workers are discouraged from civic engagement due to the difficulty of connecting with each other in a city the size of LA.  Through use of social media including Facebook and Twitter, we will enable workers to connect on line from Sylmar to Wilmington.
We are enhancing on line connectivity by designing a customized app accessible to all retail workers in the city through which they can learn about their rights, enforcement of wage and hour rules, and the problems they share with other workers.
The Retail Workers App, in addition to enabling connection among workers, will ask workers to enter their work schedules so that the Fair Workweek team can collect data and determine if those schedules violate any rules.  They will be able to share their problems and, by connecting with each other, become activated to work on solutions by joining the campaign to win a policy that will regulate scheduling practices.  Retail workers can also engage with each other to share strategies to manage their lives and join together to advocate for a better city and job quality.  
Through advocacy for a policy, workers will become civically engaged and can learn how to push the city government to be responsive to their needs.  This will provide an opening to promote voter registration and turnout.
Based on face to face meetings with workers and connecting on line, we can identify potential leaders who will be trained in leadership skills and can volunteer to take leadership roles in the campaign.
Once the policy is adopted, workers will be better able to connect with each other through scheduled meetings and events and to participate more actively in civic life.  Their lives will be fuller as they are able to spend more time with their children, attend school, and other activities that require having a predictable schedule.
We will also test which platforms and apps are most effective in connecting and activating workers.

","The Fair Workweek (FWWLA) activation engages non-food retail workers and customers. Retail workers look like LA: they are all agesâ€”from teens to seniorsâ€”and all ethnicitiesâ€”primarily Latinx like the city, and a majority are women.. 
Strategies and tools employed:
Engage workers in using social media tools and the FWWLA app to connect with each other across the city.  Use Twitter and â€œwe are retailâ€â€”a private national Facebook group for retail workersâ€”to promote actions, inform workers and build solidarity.  
Register retail workers to vote and use social media to increase turnout.
Train workers in public speaking and encourage them to speak at hearings, press conferences, and meetings.
Mobilize workers to turn out at hearings and city council meetings or to send emails and social media messages to decision-makers.
Recruit workers to join the FWWLA coalition and contribute to decision making.
Train workers to reach out to their co-workers and neighbors about scheduling issues.
Place cards with infographics about data from the study in clothing and shoes at stores to inform workers and customers about scheduling issues. 
Use creative actions such as clothing racks with stenciled clothing bearing messages about scheduling data.
Produce a monthly newsletter about minimum wage, sick days, and policies elsewhere and telling personal stories.  
Contact workers in stores, talk with them about the campaign, and get contact info so they can be included in online outreach 

","WE WILL MEASURE SUCCESS QUARTERLY BY:
The number of workers using the FWWLA app and/or Facebook and/or Twitter to connect.
The number of workers who turn out in person or via social media or email to make their views known at hearings, press conferences, council meetings, and other events.
The number of workers who join the coalition and participate actively.
The number of workers who report their scheduling issues and/or their personal stories via social media or email.
The number of workers who volunteer to participate in actions, meetings and events.
The number of workers who use of an intake form on the app to report violations of labor laws. 
WE WILL MEASURE SUCCESS AT THE END OF TWO YEARS BY:
Passage of a Fair Workweek policy that includes: At least 2 weeksâ€™ notice of schedules, no on-call scheduling, no â€œclopenings,â€ penalty for changing schedules at the last minute, and giving current employees opportunities for increased hours before hiring new part-time workers.
Through the app, beginning discussion with workers about forming a dues-paying membership organization. 
WE WILLMEASURE SUCCESS AT THE END OF FIVE YEARS BY:
A steady decline in reports of violations of the Fair Workweek policy to 10/year. 
The number of workers using the app and/or social media to connect will be 20,000.
The number of workers registering to vote for the first time will be 5,000.
The number of workers voting will be 50,000.

","THIS ACTIVATION:
The Fair Workweek policy is adopted and fully enforced in the city and, given the number and size of California cities that have similar policies, a statewide policy has been adopted.
Through the use of on line organizing retail workers have:
Connected with each other across the city and with other workers around the country.
Learned about their rights to fair scheduling, the minimum wage, and sick days and know what to do when their rights are violated and are protected by a retail workersâ€™ bill of rights.
Have a shared identity and sense of connection with each other and with other retail workers around the country
Created a space and membership body to build power, get educated, and get activated for themselves and other workers.
A retail program at community colleges has been initiated for employed and potential workers to learn, get trained and move up in the retail industry. 
OUR ORGANIZATION:
Based on the experience of the Fair Workweek activation, the sponsoring organization, LAANE:
Has expanded its community organizing and developed strategies to organize workers outside of unions.
Has developed experience in the use of purpose-driven apps, social media, and creative tactics to engage workers and community members.
LAANE has developed a multi-purpose app as a means of education, communication and connection within campaigns.
Has tested techniques to engage workers and residents to vote in elections

8102073,8102073,Voting Solutions for All People: Engaging Voters Through a Mock Election ,"As LA County prepares to revolutionize the voting experience, voters will participate in a countywide mock election to interact with new voting technologies and get excited about future elections. ","LA County is modernizing the voting experience. In order to educate the community about this new voting experience, the County will engage Angelenos through a mock election. This mock election will allow voters to interact with the new technologies that will be used in future elections, and experience firsthand the exciting changes.The mock election will  encourage voters to be more engaged in their community and the democratic process.","The Countyâ€™s current voting system has served the voters of Los Angeles County with accuracy and integrity since 1968, the design of the systems and the age of their technology do not offer the technical and functional elasticity necessary to continue to accommodate our growing and increasingly diverse electorate. Additionally, the existing voting systems market is limited and inadequate to meet the needs of our region. We are overdue for solutions that are transparent, publicly owned and that ensure the security and integrity of our elections. In 2020, the Los Angeles County will introduce a new voting experience that will address many of these concerns. To prepare Angelenos for this change, we will conduct a mock election in September 2019 at 50-100 locations throughout the County.   

 

By providing Angelenos the opportunity to become civically engaged through this mock election, the Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk (RR/CC) will get voters excited to try a new and improved voting model that addresses their needs. We also hope that this activation will increase the rates of voting in Los Angeles County. This new voting model, and the mock election, will support LA2050â€™s goal to make â€œLos Angeles the most civically engaged region in the U.S. During the Presidential Primary Election in 2016, only roughly 42% of registered voters cast a ballot.  For the Presidential General Election on November 2016, 69% of Los Angeles County voters turned out to vote. LA County sees much lower turnout rates for off-cycle election. As is the case of the CA 34th District Representative election; turnout for the Primary Election in April, 2017 as well as the General Election in June, 2017 was just 14% of registered voters. With the mock election, we hope to activate Angelenos to vote in all elections, not just Presidential Elections. We also want to increase the number of registered voters, and make voting easier and more accessible to those voters. This mock election will provide eligible voters who are not yet registered the opportunity to register on-site the day of the mock election.  

 

The mock election will serve as a way for the RR/CC to gather feedback from voters about their thoughts on the new modernized voting system. This will ensure that the RR/CC, a government entity, is responsive to the needs of LA residents when it comes to exercising their right to vote. An increased responsiveness to the voting needs of Angelenos will in turn make Los Angeles a hub for innovation, policy changes, and government transparency. 

 

Like the efforts of LA2050 to â€œ#PartyatthePolls,â€ the mock election is a county wide event that is all about voter engagement, activation, and education. At the various mock election sites, the RR/CC will ensure that the changes to the voting experience and the new voting system are perceived as fun and exciting. ","This activation will target all demographics of voters, but in particular those who traditionally have low-participation rates in elections. These include young adults (ages 18-29) and communities of color. LA2050â€™s goal is to have Los Angeles be the best place to connect is to have the â€œvoting population reflect the diversity of the region,â€ and to have â€œ75% of Angelenos report voting often in local elections.â€ With this mock election, the RR/CC will push towards ensuring that those goals are met and that all eligible Angelenos participate in all elections, including local, state, and federal elections. 

 

One strategy that the RR/CC will employ will be working with local community organizations to engage the voters and disseminate information about the election. Also, we plan on having a multiplatform mass media campaign surrounding elections which will include multi-lingual promotional materials on buses, bus benches, billboards, and street banners placed throughout LA County. Also, we will engage voters via social media through interactive Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter posts, as well as placing promotional material on those sites highlighting the mock election. Lastly, our efforts will include on-air TV, and radio interviews broadcast in a variety of languages to ensure voters of all ages, and demographics throughout the entire LA County know of this mock election.  ","To successfully measure the success of our mock election, we will look at three different metrics: voter impression and successful interaction with new model, voter turnout for the day of the mock election, and voter turnout at elections post-mock election.To measure the first metric, an in-person survey will be administered by an election volunteer after voters interact with the various components of the new voting experience. This survey will measure the voterâ€™s first-impressions, as well as gather feedback as to how LA County can continue improving the experience, and how accessible and easy-to-use the new model is. To measure the second metric, the RR/CC will track the number of Angelenos who visited any of the available Vote Center locations during the mock election. Registered voters will be able to check-in utilizing the new ePollbooks, and eligible voters who are not registered will have the opportunity to register to vote on-site and cast a ballot, a new option for eligible voters. The further measure effectiveness, we will track our social media interactions and mentions on the day of the mock election to see how Angelenos are talking about this activation on their various platforms. To measure the metric of â€œpost-mock election voter turnout,â€ the RR/CC will track voter turnout rates for the election occurring from 2020-2022, and compare those figures with those of previous elections to analyze whether the mock election sparked greater interest in civic engagement. ","In 5 years, LA County will have a modernized voting system utilized for all elections that will cater to all county demographics by being accessible to all. We will strive to ensure that the number of voters turning out for elections keeps growing, and that we can demonstrate increased voter awareness and participation in all elections. Lastly, in 5 years we hope that other counties will utilize this new voting model and provide their respective constituents with a modernized voting experience, and that they would be able to tailor it to the specific needs of their communities.

","Through Dodgers Dreamfields, we create vibrant spaces for communities to play and provide ample opportunities for community involvement at these sites, through the Dodgers RBI program, fitness clinics, baseball/softball skills clinics, mini-festivals and more! We are confident that we will reach over 15,000 kids each year, along with their families, across 55 Dreamfields in the LA area by 2020! With the help of sponsors, partners and volunteers, we will activate 100,000 Angelenos to play in LA!","We promote play to a level that will increase the number of residents that access a vibrant park, increase enrollment of kids in after-school programs, and increase opportunities for inter-generational play in LA.

We refurbish fields across LA County to support community play in underserved communities through Dreamfields. At these fields, we set the stage to play baseball/softball by adding stadium aesthetics to existing fields, planting new sod, and upgrading backstops, dugouts and benches to make parks a safer place to play baseball/softball in the community. Our data shows that these revitalized fields have the power to create vibrant play spaces, as well as cultivate safe and centralized environments for communities to play.

Through Dodgers RBI, fitness clinics, skills clinics, workshops and community events, we promote programs that are necessary to sustain park activity and ensure these spaces remain vibrant parks for the community. With RBI, we provide underserved communities with equipment and program resources that are necessary for youth ages (5-18) to play baseball/softball in LA. Here, youth are able to participate in a positive recreational activity after-school, alongside their peers. To engage adults in RBI, we provide training to coaches, parents and park administrators to empower them to be better role models and leaders for their community. We encourage them to share their experience with us, and each other, to inform program design and improvements. We also provide them access to LeagueApps, an online sports registration and communication platform, to stay informed of program activities at Dreamfields, within RBI, and in the community. LeagueApps allows park staff to share announcements of upcoming events at their local park so as to drive digital organizing efforts in the places where they live. Collectively, these efforts engage the community to be active in play and to participate in inter-generational programming at Dreamfields and RBI.

We also provide a breadth of volunteer opportunities for corporate and community volunteers at Dreamfields sites and RBI activities. Volunteers participate in registration and coordination of special events, such as community service days to further promote their involvement in the community and invest in play-related programs. Additionally, we collaborate with numerous fitness, sports, and play-oriented organizations to promote play in the community through fitness clinics, skills clinics and coach development workshops.  These collaborations further engage youth in after-school programs, build cohesive community identity, reinforce play in our programming, and contribute to the vibrancy of the park that supports a play-active LA.

Lastly, we engage over 3 million Dodger fans each season to support play and donate to our cause. At  Dodger games, we interact with fans to enhance awareness of our mission and to get them activated for play in LA through individual giving opportunities.","Within our Dreamfields and RBI programs, we engage youth, families and communities that are underserved and under-resourced. Our focus is on communities with low median household incomes and high poverty levels (compared to California) which demonstrates economic need. The ethnic/racial demographic make-up of the area is also evaluated to ensure diversity and inclusion in our programming. With these measures, we strategically identify underserved and diverse communities that could benefit from Dreamfields and RBI.

We promote Dreamfields and RBI programs to these communities through use of our social media accounts, which reaches over 35,000 followers. Dodgers baseball branding is also placed on program uniforms, equipment, promotional materials, scoreboards and banners, to engage the community and appeal to the Dodger fan in everyone. We are able to further promote this activation to Dodger fans by marketing it through Dodger events, flyers, videos, in-game announcements and merchandise. Events that we will market are: RBI festivals, fitness clinics, skills clinics, Dreamfields dedications, community service days, volunteer and donation opportunities. With such a prolific brand, we are able to elevate our programs and social media presence to activate the community for play.

To make this activation a success, we will also encourage community partners, sponsors,  volunteers, and organizations to promote these events, so as to serve as activators for play.","We administer a comprehensive evaluation system for Dreamfields and RBI, which allows us to better understand participants, program elements, and community needs. We will conduct surveys, focus groups, and interviews with program participants, partners, volunteers, and community members to evaluate this activation.

We will measure success in after-school enrollment by observing increase attendance in RBI, community events, fitness clinics, skills clinics, trainings and workshops. We will measure access to vibrant park by observing positive trends in park attendance, surrounding neighborhood, park safety, park atmosphere, park usage, park activities through recreation center, community service, sports program recruitment, and field maintenance. We will measure success in inter-generational opportunities for play with positive trends in coaches attendance at training, coaches certified in coaching, attitude towards coaches and adults in program, satisfaction of program among coaches and parents, and parental involvement. Success with Angeleno engagement will be observed by increase in individual donations from in-stadium fundraising, corporate and community volunteerism, and use of LeagueApps. Positive attitudes and satisfaction from program supporters will also be evaluated as a metric of engagement. 

Current Dreamfields and RBI data indicates positive trends within all these measures, giving us the confidence to continue this success throughout our activation.
","This activation award will be the catalyst that propels our work forward and increases our ability to bring play to all underserved communities in Los Angeles by 2023. With the help from LA2050, county and city officials, community partners, organizations, and families, we set our sights on serving over 50,000 kids each year and their families through Dodgers Dreamfields and Dodgers RBI.

With this award, we will change the landscape of Los Angeles for play and activate a community effort that is dedicated to fostering, building, and promoting infrastructure, as well as opportunities for play in Los Angeles. Within the next five years, we hope to not only get 100,000 Angelenos involved in play, but to remain committed to play initiatives in their community, by supporting the play movement of the future. 

Our programs are truly bigger than baseball, and with the support of dedicated collaborators and community partners, we will promote PLAY in LA, for years to come!

Adding 200 new members to the Los Angeles LGBT Centerâ€™s mobilization and resistance squad will help inspire and raise the collective voice of Los Angeles to fight back against direct policy and legislative attacks on our collective well-being and to advance the long-term work needed to build a more perfect union.","As goes California, so goes the nation. In Los Angeles, we are uniquely positioned to improve the lives of millions of our neighbors while leading our state, changing a nation, and inspiring the world. But, there are no days off in a democracy. The Los Angeles LGBT Centerâ€™s Resistance Squad will connect people from across Los Angelesâ€™ diverse communities, giving them a place to channel frustration into action. From fighting back direct policy and legislative attacks on our collective well-being to doing the long-term work needed to move us towards a more perfect union, this expansion of the Centerâ€™s mobilization and resistance squad will connect people in the fight to protect, ensure, and advance equality.

Soon after the 2016 presidential election, we learned several things very quickly. Attacks on our community would be rooted in fear and bigotry at a level not seen in decades (and that our youngest LGBT generation has not experienced in their lifetimes). Attacks leveled against other vulnerable populations, including immigrants and people needing to access affordable health care, would also touch LGBT people who were part of those communities. There was an immediate need to band together in solidarity. People wanted, and needed, to DO something.

The Resistance Squad was formed to mobilize Angelenos in response to attacks by the new Administration. Now with LA2050, we will recruit and train 200 more volunteers in grassroots organizing to carry out effective phone banking, letter writing, social media and web-based mobilization campaigns, as well as demonstrations. Activations are designed to yield immediate results â€“ ranging from a constituent in another state agreeing to call their congressional representative to affecting the outcome of a bill or policy. 

As an organization and community rooted in activism and a decades-long battle for equality, fighting for justice and winning is what our community knows how to do. In fact, itâ€™s one of the things we do best. Our goal is to build on this experience and empower Angelenos to lead social and political activations in their communities, and by so doing, amplify our collective voice so that politicians take notice. 

Those who have joined the Resistance Squad come away feeling empowered:

 â€œYou hear all these terrible things on the news about our government and what they are allowing to happen and you can feel so powerless. Itâ€™s been really great coming here doing the phone banking and writing the letters and knowing that youâ€™re actually making a positive impact on peopleâ€™s lives and putting your money where your mouth is. Rolling up your sleeves and not just yelling at your Facebook friends.â€ - Laura Wu

 â€œThere was just this need I felt to do something other than crying into the wind. Itâ€™s been a very easy way to get involved and to feel like youâ€™re doing something that benefits other people. You donâ€™t feel like everyoneâ€™s got good intentions but nothing is really getting done.â€ 
- Jason Black
","The Resistance Squad advances meaningful civic engagement by amplifying Angelenosâ€™ collective voice to protect and advance the values we hold dear â€“ freedom, equality, upward mobility, civil discourse, access to healthcare and quality education. These values are under siege by politicians at the national level who promote divisiveness, intolerance, and curtailment of civil liberties. The Trump Administration is making every attempt to diminish Californiaâ€™s political power. We must hit back, and the Resistance Squad connects and trains Angelenos in the art of effective community organizing and activism with the goal of making our collective voice more powerful and influential at the national level.

Strategies include power analysis (analysis of decision makers and best tactics to exert influence), storytelling, and how to organize letter-writing, phonebank, social media or web-based mobilization campaigns, public protests, legislative visits and more. 

Activism comes with the risk of rejection and failure. By creating exciting and affirming group experiences focused on obtaining concrete results, the Resistance Squad leaves participants with a great sense of accomplishment and pride that keeps them motivated. Moreover, the Resistance Squad model grows the pool of volunteers and skilled team leaders, providing the structure and tools to sustain engagement, not only under this current federal administration, but indefinitely. 
","The Resistance Squad will measure success based on the decisions that ultimately are made by targeted elected officials. In addition, the Resistance Squad will track:
1)  The accuracy of our power analysis and mapping, aiming for 95% accuracy; 
2)  Number of active volunteers trained through peer-to-peer calling and social media with a goal of 200; 
3)  Number of Resistance Squad Leadership Council members recruited and trained with the goal of 50; 
4)  Growth rate of Resistance Squad volunteer pool tracked by our database with the goal of doubling over two years; 
5)  Retention rate of volunteers returning for new actions, with the goal of 80%; and 
6)  Number of commitments by constituents to engage elected officials, regardless of the policy vehicle, with the goal of 2,000 over the 2-year period.
","Our long-range vision is to create a strong community of activists that will be at the ready to mobilize and advocate for protection of civil liberties and a civil society that embraces diversity, equality and opportunity for all.  We envision a continually growing community of politically educated activists that creates a welcoming and affirming place for LGBT advocates that want to learn and grow their skills as organizers to protect and expand the rights of the LGBT community.  After five years, we hope to have thousands of trained organizers to fight against the attacks on LGBT people and to also lead change on a range of issues impacting communities across Los Angeles. A continuous cycle of activism will engage ever growing numbers of new volunteers, sustain our current ones, and develop a new generation of leaders that will keep the entire system activated.

8102076,8102076,Big Sing LA,Big Sing LA is a free multi-generational event that invites everyone regardless of ability or background to come together to learn new songs and sing familiar ones at selected parks in Los Angeles.  ,"Big Sing LA 2019 will bring together thousands of individuals and families at selected parks throughout Los Angeles to join and play music through a shared singing experience.  Music is a universal language that invites everyone regardless of ability or background to unite in peace to activate our parks in a fun, joyful, and multi-generational activity.","Los Angeles Master Chorale will provide the opportunity for thousands of Angelenos to express themselves and connect with others through a free, shared singing experience at parks throughout Los Angeles.  It is the Master Choraleâ€™s goal to inspire people to tap into a gift each person is born with, namely, the ability to sing in a safe, fun, non-competitive environment.  Through Big Sing LA, we are reclaiming our public parks as a place where artistry and creativity can flourish and play music alongside the soccer fields, picnic tables, and baseball diamonds.  

Participants will have the opportunity to learn and rehearse the pre-selected choral repertoire in advance of the event through online educational tutorials featuring our Artistic Director Grant Gershon and the Master Choraleâ€™s Swan Artist-in-Residence and Grammy Winner Eric Whitacre.  A Grammy-winning composer and conductor, Whitacre is very well-known among choral music enthusiasts.  However, we are considering engaging conductors that reflective of the diverse communities we want to serve at the various parks.
A dedicated website will be created for Big Sing LA and provide a central location where participants can access the video tutorials, connect with each other, and share their experiences. It will contain all the information participants will need to know to get involved, such as which parks will serve as hubs for the Big Sing LA events and how to create gatherings of their own should they wish to.  After the event, the website will serve as a conduit for participant surveys, and tracking and evaluating data to determine impacts. However, no prior knowledge or registration are required, and people can simply just show up and sing along with the crowds.

Taking part in Big Sing LA is truly a multi-generational endeavor that will significantly reduce barriers to involvement in singing by inviting people from all walks of life to join in at a location that is more convenient than traveling to Grand Park in Downtown LA. Anyone who loves to sing or enjoys live music will connect on a deeper level by experiencing a powerful and transcendent moment that only through singing together as an ensemble provides.  We will work with local neighborhood councils and local organizations to determine the park that is geographically the most accessible and therefore, we will create more access points for increasing inter-generational play opportunities and making parks more vibrant. This event will also create indelible memories linked to their experience with Big Sing LA at their park.          ","The targeted participants are adults, children, and families from diverse and eclectic backgrounds throughout Los Angeles who love to sing. Although parks are often used for concerts, these are often passive affairsâ€”spectators & performers. Big Sing LA places the spotlight on the audience members, who are also the performers, as the conductor guides and brings it all together. These events will also activate parks as a place to play sports as well as playing music and connects people from all walks of life.

A dedicated website will be created for Big Sing LA and provide a central hub where participants can access the video tutorials, connect with each other, and share their experiences. Emphasis will be placed on engaging participants in person and in areas that have been identified as having populations that have the least access to live music, such as Northeastern San Fernando Valley and South Los Angeles. 

The Master Chorale will engage community coordinators that are local to the areas who can partner with local leaders, networks, and neighborhood councils. These coordinators will take the lead in promoting the event because of their in-depth familiarity with the area. We will pay these coordinators to compensate them for the time and energy including organizing volunteers, and help manage the logistics at the park on the day of the event with support from the Master Chorale, including tracking demographics and contact information to be used in post-event evaluations.","This will be our third incarnation of the Big Sing initiative and with each event we are learning. The Los Angeles Master Chorale will track participant demographics to determine to what extent we were successful in reaching stated goals of who and how many participants were served.  The coordinators will help collect demographic information about the people in attendance at each park.  Participants themselves will have numerous outlets for expressing their level of satisfaction through online surveys created by the Master Chorale as well as the more informal feedback gained through social media, informal conversations of participants, and observation over the course of the event.  

Success will be determined by several factors:  Did we reached our stated goals and desired impacts?  Were the numbers of participants as high as we expected?  What was the quality of experience reported in surveys?  And the experience itself, did the event go smoothly?  Did the community grow and interact as much as we hoped?  We will also be looking at more long-term effects to see the impact of this program from the community and how they interact and engage with their local parks.  These are all the questions, and more, the Master Chorale will be asking in post-project evaluations.","In five years, it is the goal that the Master Chorale will have created a revenue model and the organizational staff capacity that allows for Big Sing LA to be sustainable.  However, it is also a goal to craft this program with the purpose of it being replicated and self-organized by more communities at their local parks in Los Angeles, which is aligned with the metric of increasing the number of parks with inter-generational play opportunities and increase attendance at cultural events.","[""Attendance at cultural events"",""Attendance at public/open streets gatherings"",""Total number of local social media friends and connections Angelenos have""]","Los Angeles Master Chorale will provide the opportunity for thousands of Angelenos to express themselves and connect with others through a free, shared singing experience at parks throughout Los Angeles.

These are the groups that do gang prevention/intervention, wraparound services to youth in foster care and probation systems, legal and educational services for undocumented immigrants, primary health and dental care to low-income people, and supportive housing for those without homes. Their front-line staff, organizers, and volunteers often share some of the same vulnerabilities of the people they serve, and the work itself is challenging and draining. Although it is well known that vicarious trauma and significant burnout are commonplace, funding challenges prevent organizations from providing the support their people need to make programs and initiatives effective and sustainable. If the people supporting the community are stumbling under the weight of their work, the community itself suffers and does not have the bandwidth to engage with large-scale change efforts. To activate community level resilience, we need to take a foundational step; we need to grow the resilience of the people on the front lines of the safety net. By resourcing and connecting the professionals, peer specialists, and community members, the people who are needed to make systems change will have the needed social-emotional support and actually be change-ready.  
Our project begins by bringing committed partner organizations together into two regional community focus groups (South Bay/South LA and Antelope Valley), where we will learn more about their specific challenges and strengths. Based on this information, we will develop and deliver 30 compassion fatigue and resilience-building workshops using a curriculum based on The Resilience Toolkit, a holistic evidence-informed practice and process with a demonstrated track record in the LA area. Trauma-informed and culturally competent perspectives will be woven into the entire program. We will certify 24 key community partner representatives and provide technical assistance to organizations to develop ongoing programming for staff and volunteers. As the organizationsâ€™ worker capacity and internal resources increase, we will mentor them in establishing similar programming for their clients, students, or members. We will conduct a comprehensive program evaluation. The program will culminate in a series of regional convenings of partner organizations, other community stakeholders, and funders to discuss how the outcomes of the program can leverage their increased personal/organizational resilience to the community level.","Our activation targets the LA County Service Planning Areas with the highest rates of housing instability and poverty: Antelope Valley (Lancaster, Palmdale), South Bay (Long Beach, Wilmington, San Pedro, Harbor City) and South LA (Watts, Compton, South LA). These areas have a population of 3 million residents, the majority of which are people of color, primarily Latino and black. 
Through community-based direct services, education, and activism, our partner organizations have 849 workers, comprised of licensed professionals, peer specialists, organizers, and volunteers. They currently serve 123,200 people annually and outreach to thousands more, focusing on particularly vulnerable populations, including foster youth, LGBTQ individuals, justice system-involved individuals, immigrants, and gang members. The workers in these organizations have requested strategies and resources to grow their personal resilience in the face of the difficult nature of their work. They are hungry for effective tools that they can in turn share with their constituents. Onsite training will facilitate participant engagement, and ongoing individualized and cohort-based technical assistance will provide sustained commitment.
For the culminating dissemination and planning meetings, we will conduct targeted outreach to local community-based organizations, funders, and community members to join with participants in a series of three convenings to review the program results and discuss possible next steps.","Our activation will be successful when:
1. At least 100,000 Angelenos involved with and receiving services from our partner organizations are recipients of care and contact with workers who are stable, engaged, and present as the result of completing the activation program. 
2. There is decreased burnout and vicarious trauma in partner organization workers as measured by a validated research instrument (Professional Quality of Life Scale 5).
3. There is increased resilience in partner organization workers and a representative sample of their constituents as measured by a validated research instrument (Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale 10) and qualitative program evaluation
4. There is improved community effectiveness scores in partner organization workers and a representative sample of their constituents on the three subscales of the ""people"" cluster (social networks and trust; participation and willingness to act for the common good; and norms and culture) of the Prevention Instituteâ€™s Tool for Health and Resilience in Vulnerable Environments.
5. Each culminating dissemination/planning meetings is attended by participant organizations and at least eight additional local organizations and/or funders.
","In five years, we hope this activation will:
1. Have demonstrated the importance of resourcing community organizations and members before and concurrently with any large-scale change efforts.
2. Have deeply embedded worker wellness in the culture of community-based organizations.
3. Inspire an organizational resilience and wellness funding initiative trend by the majority of the major LA-based funders.
4. Kindle a community-wide interest in learning personal resilience-building skills to expand capacity for wellness and large-scale change efforts that address place-based factors and structural inequities.
5. Inspire replication projects.

In five years, we hope our organization will:
1. Have used this activation evaluation data as a starting point for in-depth exploration studies on the impact of The Resilience Toolkit on workers and volunteers experiencing burnout and vicarious trauma.
2. Continue to research, test, and implement frameworks, approaches, and tools for holistic transformation of individuals, organizations, and systems.
3. Deepen our current community-based and systems level involvement with county-wide efforts to ensure the health and wellbeing of Angelenos.
4. Cultivate a community of practice comprised of practitioners, strategists, innovators, and activists.

They begged for more, so we will sustain and replicate the experience in maker hotspots around the region (DTLA, El Segundo, Long Beach, Vernon). So doing, weâ€™ll raise consumer awareness of locally-made brands, identify and cultivate champions for manufacturing, and encourage creators to partner with local factories to fully unleash the creative potential of the city.","Los Angeles is the largest center for manufacturing in the country, with half a million jobsâ€”thatâ€™s nearly four times as many jobs as film and televisionâ€”yet most Angelenos donâ€™t fully appreciate its importance to our economy. More important than jobs, manufacturing is a critical piece of innovation infrastructure that, if activated, could better unleash Los Angelesâ€™ creative potential. 

Maker walk engages thought leaders and the creative public for a unique look behind manufacturing in the city. Our pilot run attracted more than 500 participants. They checked in for this free event at the Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator and received a map for a self-guided walking tour of the Arts District neighborhood. Participants enjoyed visits to a dozen different factories and businesses, including Hyperloop, Angel City Brewery, La La Land Production and Design, HIVE lighting, the LADWP substation, the Advanced Prototyping Center, Blue Bottle, Greenbar Distillery, and Oblong Industries. It ended with an after party, featuring mini maker workshops and locally crafted cocktails at locally made shoe brand, COMUNITY. You can watch a video here: http://makeitinla.org/makerwalkvideo 

Our attendees were impressed and surprised by the diversity of industries that are manufacturing in LA and they asked us for more. To build on Maker Walkâ€™s success and expand its impact, we want to engage new neighborhoods and manufacturers and become a monthly event. We have yet to finalize the neighborhoods, but we have begun to scout venues in El Segundo, Pasadena, Vernon, in DTLA, and Long Beach.

We have partnered with Artisanal LA and the LA Food Fest to bring a pop-up market aspect to enhance the event. The markets will raise awareness of consumers and inspire them to purchase locally made goods. 

Because the tours are so visual, we expect many attendees to share on social media and we will add playful encouragements for sharing like photo stations. We will highlight many of the makers and manufacturers on social media and on our website to drive traffic and awareness. We will also implement an extensive PR campaign to attract media coverage.

We anticipate repeating our Arts District Maker Walk in October 2018, and ramping up to a total of 18 events in the grant period.  We expect to grow by 10% each month and attract more than 2,500 attendees per event by the second year, for a total of 25,000 attendees to date. 
","Maker Walk will help make connections and inspire founders and aspiring entrepreneurs to consider â€œmaking itâ€ in Los Angeles. We will use the events to uncover new creators to engage in our events and our Catalyst program and new manufacturers that we can support. 

We will use the events as opportunities to reach the public with the message â€œmanufacturing is sexyâ€ through the media, social media, and our attendees. The events will be visually appealing to make it easy for people to share with their friends and raise awareness among the public. We will highlight manufacturers and brands hosting tours and selling at the market on our website.

The pop-up markets will inspire and enable consumers to buy locally-made.

We hope as these rotating events move, each neighborhood and city will start organizing additional events to involve their local residents, to expand our impact even further. 
","We will measure our impact through the number of attendees (projected 25,000+). This is the most important metric because by taking part they will become champions for local manufacturing. We will also track the number of website visits and profile views (100,000+), social media shares, and qualitative responses to surveys.","We aim to make Maker Walk will be a monthly institution, part of the cultural fabric of Los Angeles, attracting thousands of people from diverse parts of the region and beyond to celebrate manufacturing and locally made.

8102080,8102080,The Youth New A.G.E Initiative ,"The New A.G.E Initiative coaches low-income youth on how to Abate waste, Generate revenue, and Educate communities about recycling to engender environmental sustainability and social responsibility. ","MVFC seeks support to launch its Youth's New A.G.E Initiative, a campaign designed to mobilize communities around environmental issues to inspire sustainable living and encourage community-driven and based enterprise. The purpose is three-fold: to alleviate the environmental burdens for low-income families, who often bear the brunt of environmental damage, to deliver environmental education, and to develop sustainable and innovative models of revenue for community-serving organizations. 
","The city of Los Angeles sends over 3 million tons of waste to landfills or incinerators annually. Much of this waste could be recycled or composted if residents had sufficient access to disposal systems. Many Angelenos however lack access to recycling services in their apartments or workplaces. Low-income neighborhoods and communities of color are disproportionately affected by the unequal distribution of municipal services. Hindered access to responsible disposal systems can increase exposure to environmental hazards and health problems that emanate from poor air and water quality. Lack of access to environmental education is another contributing factor. Only 10% of the students enrolled in our youth program for example, recalled receiving environmental education in their schools. The environmental impacts for marginalized communities and gaps in environmental education are causes for significant concern. These concerns are addressed by Mar Vista Family Centerâ€™s (MVFC) Youth New A.G.E. Initiative. The Initiative aims to create a more sustainable and conscious relationship between Angelenos and the environment while introducing creative strategies for community fundraising. 

MVFC youth want Los Angeles to be an environmental justice leader--that is, a zero waste city that protects its low-income residents from environmental health hazards through community-driven initiatives. The Youth New A.G.E Initiative coaches low-income youth on how to Abate waste, Generate revenue, and Educate communities about waste management in order to engender environmental sustainability, creative fundraising, and social responsibility. The Youthâ€™s Recycling Campaign and â€œGreen-Givingâ€ strategy has encouraged local residents to donate their recycling to MVFC leading to the collection of thousands of plastic bottles and aluminum cans that our youth will cash in. The campaign has raised significant awareness about plastic pollution in the community. 

Our activation will support LA2050â€™s efforts to decrease the acres and miles of polluted waterways. Plastic trash from consumer goods makes up the majority of what becomes marine debris which significantly affects the environment, wildlife, and human health. The Initiativeâ€™s focus on waste reduction, environmental education, and community fundraising encourages Angelenos to mobilize in favor of cleaner waterways. By educating Angelenos on the benefits of waste reduction and by linking this advocacy to Green Giving, or community fundraising campaigns, we believe that we can clean up the city, protect our waterways, and provide children the environmental quality and sustainability they need to lead healthy and environmentally conscious lives thus decreasing adverse childhood experiences. Our activation also creates and supports resilient communities. Our enterprising approach to the Initiative empowers ecologically fragile communities to reclaim their space and develop financially sustainable models in the process.  ","Our target audience are marginalized communities impacted by environmental hazards, environmental leaders, schools and other community-serving organizations, waste management service providers, youth, and everyday Angelenos. The goal is to motivate community-based prevention and innovation strategies so that Los Angeles may be at the forefront of community-driven efforts that yield greener, more creative, and financially viable plans. The initiative is collaborative with the potential to engage all levels of contributors: from individuals with a passion for environmentalism, to corporate sponsors seeking to develop their social responsibility efforts, to fellow youth-serving organizations looking for diversified streams of revenue or strategic partnerships.

The Initiative applies entrepreneurial approaches to social justice issues. Our youth identified earned income as an effective way to reduce pollution in their immediate area by offering prize incentives: â€œcollect the most recycling and win a pizza party.â€ In applying this same positive reinforcement model to neighboring community serving organizations--be it a school, a church, a shelter, an after-school program, etc., we believe our youth can support the cityâ€™s zero waste goal with a series of campaigns: Recycling, Compost, Zero-Waste Days, E-Waste. There will be opportunities for Angelenos to participate in beach and community clean-ups, to serve as sponsors, and to share resources. 
","Success of our activation would be measured in the following ways: 

Waste Reduction: With the support of the EPA, LA City Sanitation, and environmentally-driven organizations we will monitor the cityâ€™s waterways, recycling efforts, and consumer practices. 

Environmental Literacy: Surveys will be administered to test environmental literacy before our workshops and thereafter. 

Youth Engagement: As the Initiative derived from our By Youth for Youth teen program, we want youth to remain the cornerstone of this project. As such, we will track the number of Initiative youth participants as well as those impacted by the program--that is, any youth attending Initiative related events by closely monitoring attendance and participation in community events. 

Funds raised: We want our model to be one that other community-serving organizations can replicate and find monetary success with. The metrics under this category would calculate the funds raised by MVFC under the New A.G.E Initiative and all funds raised by adopting organizations. 

Collaborations: We want Angelenos to feel more connected to their elected officials, local governments, and service providers. As such, we will measure the number of collaborations with the public, private, commercial, and manufacturing sectors as well by documenting the number of community volunteers. This will be captured by our websiteâ€™s â€˜How did you hear about usâ€™ section.  ","In 5 years time we expect  MVFC Youth to be recognized as leaders in the pursuit for environmental justice and equity in the city of Los Angeles, we expect to have transformed MVFC into a reliable and well-known recyclables drop-off site which includes pick-up services to ensure that vulnerable communities--like our own--have access to proper and sustainable disposal systems for recyclables including plastic, aluminum, e-waste, and paper. We expect to contribute to a small percentage of MVFCâ€™s earned income and stimulate local job creation by hiring youth alumni to assist with waste disposal and pick-up services. We would like to see this entrepreneurial and environmentally charged model adopted by local schools and neighboring non-profits and amplification of the â€œGreen-Givingâ€ Model. We would expect to see an increase in environmental literacy among local residents and youth. 

In five years time, our efforts would shift to focus on advocating for a policy that requires environmental education in LAUSD public schools with preference for elementary and middle school.

","VolunteerLA will connect Angelenos to volunteer opportunities available in communities across the region through an online platform powered by a mobile volunteer app. Using the Mayorâ€™s influence, VolunteerLA will inspire Angelenos who are hungry for ways to take action to get more civically engaged. By providing a curated list of quality opportunities, VolunteerLA aims to make volunteering easy and to ensure that a meaningful experience will lead to ongoing volunteering and deeper engagement.   ","Mayor Garcetti, in partnership with the Mayorâ€™s Fund, formed the Mayorâ€™s Office of Volunteer Engagement (MOVE) in late 2017 to lift and strengthen volunteerism in the city and region. MOVEâ€™s mission is to strengthen L.A.â€™s culture of service by making volunteer opportunities accessible and meaningful, by building collaborations that inspire citizen engagement, and by creating long-lasting change around issues that Angelenos care about.
 
Benefits of volunteering can include higher overall civic engagement, improved health, skills development, and lower criminal activity. Volunteering makes our communities stronger and more resilient.  Corporate-based volunteerism builds employee culture and is a key component to corporate social responsibility efforts.  

In May, MOVE will launch the ActivateLA platform, an online resource that includes a curated list of volunteer opportunities in order to easily connect Angelenos to opportunities that are available in local communities across the region and that build on a diverse collection of skills. The volunteer opportunities featured on the site will represent the best of Los Angeles with MOVEâ€™s vetted nonprofit partners posting opportunities as they become available. The platform will be powered by Golden, the leading volunteer mobile app. The Golden app features technical capabilities that will allow MOVE to capture valuable data to best inform how to grow volunteerism in the city and the region. Golden aims to solve one key challenge of volunteering â€“ recruiting and converting volunteers â€“ by making signing up easy and fun with clear, engaging descriptions and real-time logistics (like automated sign-in). In addition, Golden includes a backend dashboard that tracks key metrics and analytics, including economic value of volunteer time logged, percentage of new versus returning volunteers, interests and search terms, and a zip code heat map. 

The platform will also serve as a place to tell the story of the great work being done by volunteers from nonprofits, corporations and institutions across the city and region, and will provide space to acknowledge and thank partners.  

MOVE has also convened a Nonprofit Council and Corporate Council of leading nonprofit organizations and companies from across the city to come together to support ActivateLA. These groups serve as key advisors and give input on how MOVE can best support corporate programs and the needs of nonprofits in the region. Going forward, the Nonprofit Council and Corporate Council will partner with MOVE to launch other programs to strengthen the cityâ€™s culture of volunteerism.

Through VolunteerLA, we can establish Los Angeles as the national example of how government, nonprofits, foundations, and companies can partner to productively address our local issues together.
","VolunteerLA will tell the story of whatâ€™s unique about LA â€“ highlighting the organizations that benefit and contribute to the fabric of the city. Our partners represent the best of the nonprofit sector and provide opportunities across a diverse range of issue areas and communities. VolunteerLA will appeal to all Angelenos, aged 5 to 95. The platform and accompanying campaign will be optimistic and engaging, with compelling imagery and big calls to action.

Our Corporate Council, which will be key partner in raising awareness about VolunteerLA, is made of up leaders from a diverse range of industries. 

In addition to the Nonprofit and Corporate Councils, we will leverage additional partners and networks to engage Angelenos in VolunteerLA including the Department of Neighborhood Empowerment, the Mayorâ€™s field representatives, city departments like Recreation and Parks and the Central Library, the Mayorâ€™s Youth Council, LA City employees, including retired public servants and more.     
","VolunteerLA will inspire Angelenos to engage through its brand and will make volunteering easier by creating the infrastructure to connect, but it will also allow us to track real-time data and create a robust city-wide volunteer recognition program by leveraging the power of the Mayorâ€™s Office alongside social media tools. 

Our goal is to drive both the quantity (total Angelenos engaged) and consistency (multiple instances of engagement per year) of volunteering in the city and region to not only meet but to exceed the national average. To help reach LA2050â€™s goal of a 65% volunteer rate by the year 2050, we aim to raise the volunteer participation rate from 19% to 26% over the next 5 years.

The key performance indicators we will use to evaluate our progress and track our success, include:  
â€¢	Total number of volunteering opportunities available per week
â€¢	Total number of open volunteering slots per week
â€¢	% of open volunteering slots filled
â€¢	Total volunteers per month
â€¢	Total unique volunteers per month
â€¢	Retention rate
â€¢	Virality - how many volunteers each volunteer invites to join them

VolunteerLA will also strive to support the nonprofit community by helping to ensure that its needs are met through meaningful volunteer engagement. We will look at the percentage of available spots filled and monitor the â€˜take rateâ€™ of posted opportunities to give organizations feedback on how opportunities are presented.
","VolunteerLA will grow to be the central hub for volunteerism in the region and will offer a variety of programs to support service in the city, such as nonprofit capacity building, centralized training around relevant issues, service learning projects in partnership with LAUSD and a mayoral volunteer recognition program. With the Olympic and Paralympic Games coming to LA in 2028, VolunteerLA will also be a key partner in helping to train and recruit the thousands of volunteers that will be needed to power the Games.

As we grow the VolunteerLA platform, we can establish Los Angeles as the model of how government, nonprofits, foundations, and companies can partner to productively address our local issues together using technology and collaboration.

8102083,8102083,"Welcome, Neighbor: Making LA the most welcoming place in America","""Welcome, Neighbor"" is a campaign to activate Angelenos across the city through their Neighborhood Councils to welcome and support their newest neighbors, refugee families resettling in Los Angeles. ","â€œWelcome, Neighborâ€ will activate people across LA to welcome and support their newest neighbors -- resettling refugees. Working through the Neighborhood Councils, we will give Angelenos useful tools and actionable steps they can take to reach out to and support these individuals and families. We believe that a Los Angeles where neighborhoods come together to  welcome refugees with open arms will be a better, more compassionate, and more engaged place for all Angelenos. ","â€œWelcome, Neighbor,â€ a collaboration of Miryâ€™s List and the LA Department of Neighborhood Empowerment (DONE) with support from other city departments, will activate 100,000 Angelenos over the next two years to work through their Neighborhood Councils to help resettling refugees. Designed to bring people together in neighborhoods across the city, the program will provide simple, meaningful, and impactful ways to support our newest neighbors while promoting volunteerism and Neighborhood Council participation. 

The program will have four stages:

1. LEARN:  In June 2018 (prior to the grant period), we will kick off with a New Arrival Festival at Grand Park in Downtown LA cosponsored by Miryâ€™s List, DONE, and other city departments and elected officials. This free, public event celebrating the cityâ€™s designation of June as New Arrival Month will feature educational panels, music, and food from around the world. Speakers will include representatives from the refugee community, experts, advocates, and city elected officials. 

2. RESOLVE:  Neighborhood Councils across the city will vote on and adopt the Neighborhood Welcoming Resolution written by Miryâ€™s List founder Miry Whitehill and adopted by the Eagle Rock Neighborhood Council and the City of Los Angeles in 2017. You can read the resolution at www.miryslist.org/neighborhood-welcoming-resolution 

3. COMMIT: Each participating Council will form a Welcoming Committee to foster refugee and immigrant inclusivity. The Welcoming Committee will oversee and lead the Welcoming Actions detailed below. 

4. ACTIVATE: Led by the Welcoming Committee, each participating Council will take Welcoming Actions -- tangible steps, curated by Miryâ€™s List, to support resettling individuals and families. Each council can choose actions that align with its goals and capabilities. In addition to supporting resettling refugees, these Welcome Actions will help increase participation in the Neighborhood Councils. The menu of possible Welcoming Actions includes:

--Make Council board meetings a drop-off zone for donations 
--Invite someone experiencing resettlement to a meeting to share their experiences
--Host a town hall on refugee resettlement to educate neighbors 
--Host a community dinner party to introduce community members to the incredible foods and cultures of our newest neighbors
--Adopt a resettling familyâ€™s wishlist of needed items and activate neighbors to send them welcome gifts and notes 
--Assign a Welcoming Committee chairperson to provide regular, monthly board meeting updates about immigrants and resettling neighbors in the community

Through these stages and actions, â€œWelcome, Neighborâ€ will provide resettling individuals and families with social and emotional support, promote participation in Neighborhood Councils, and boost volunteerism. Ultimately, we believe that an LA where neighbors come together to welcome refugees will be a better, more compassionate, and more engaged city for all its residents. ","Miryâ€™s List, DONE, Neighborhood Councils, and other partners will activate Angelenos as follows:

The New Arrival Festival in June, which falls prior to the grant period, will enable us to introduce â€œWelcome, Neighbor,â€ sign up thousands of volunteers, and generate enthusiasm.

This will be followed by a kickoff meeting hosted by DONE to educate Council board members about the program and invite them to participate. There are 96 Neighborhood Councils and 1,500+ board members: this group of leaders is the first that we must activate. Each Council represents an average of 38,0000 people, and about 25,000 voted in the latest Council elections.

Participating Councils will then use meetings, email lists, and social media to recruit Angelenos to join Welcoming Committees and take part in Welcoming Actions. These actions are the primary form of activation and the heart of the program.

Miryâ€™s List and DONE will also promote â€œWelcome, Neighborâ€ in the following ways:
--15,000+ subscribers/week via DONE email newsletter
--15,000+ listeners/week via EmpowerLA podcast 
--5,000+ followers of DONE on social media
--13,000+ followers of Miryâ€™s List on social media 
--1,800+ supporters/month via Miryâ€™s List emails
--1000s of Angelenos through respective websites 
--Earned media
--Outreach to other community organizations
--Online/social media advertising

We are also in conversation with several other city elected officials and departments about how they can help us with the activation. ","We will track the following quantitative metrics to help us gauge our success: 

--The number of Neighborhood Councils enrolled in the â€œWelcome, Neighborâ€ program
--The number of Neighborhood Welcome Resolutions adopted
--The number of Welcoming Committees formed 
--The number of Welcoming Actions completed 
--The number of volunteers who sign up
--The number of event attendees
--The number of resettling individuals and/or families served 
--The increase in Neighborhood Council participation -- for instance, increased attendance at board meetings, increased voting in Council elections, and/or increase in social media followers
--The number of city elected officials and departments engaged as partners

We will also seek qualitative feedback from the Neighborhood Councils, the individuals and families served, the Department of Neighborhood Empowerment, and other partners.","In five years, we hope that â€œWelcome, Neighborâ€ will be an ongoing program that continues to engage hundreds of thousands of Angelenos and makes a tangible impact on the lives of new arrival/resettling  individuals and families. 

We hope that by bringing Angelenos together with resettling individuals and families, they can get to know one another, learn about each otherâ€™s experiences, and build mutual trust and respect. 

We hope the individuals and families touched by the program will feel safe, secure, and welcome in their new neighborhoods and will have become part of the fabric of their communities -- including as active and engaged members of their Neighborhood Councils. 

We hope to connect the Angelenos who volunteer, attend events, or otherwise participate with one another and with their Neighborhood Councils, and to foster broader and deeper participation in the Neighborhood Council system.

We hope that DONE and other city leaders and departments will continue to lend us their support, and that this partnership will help inform them about the needs of resettling refugees and spark new ideas for serving this community. 

And we hope that LA -- this diverse city of immigrants -- will serve as a model for other cities in our region, our state, and throughout the nation that want to stand up, in the best traditions of America, to welcome immigrants and refugees as valuable additions to their communities.

8102084,8102084,"Vision 2020: An Achievable Plan to Save Us All from Air Toxins, Diesel Pollution & Climate Change!",Move LA is building a broad coalition and championing a grand bargain to achieve the audacious goals of cleaning our air of diesel toxins and greatly advance the fight against climate change. ,"Move LA will activate LA County and Southern Californians to address the â€œelephant on our roadsâ€ - transportation accounts for 90% of toxic air pollution and 50% of greenhouse gas emissions. We will build a broad coalition of diverse supporters towards a grand bargain to dump diesel, accelerate deployment of zero and near-zero emission vehicles, and fund regional transit infrastructure, like Metrolink. This ""Vision 2020"" plan can achieve the LA2050 goal on exposure to air toxins by 2031.","In 2007, LA County Metro had no money to address its soul-crushing traffic. Move LA was created to build a broad coalition to support a grand bargain on transformative change: Measures R and M will now fund the largest public infrastructure investment in the country. 

We now face an even greater threat from exposure to air toxins, diesel pollution and climate change. Transportation accounts for 90% of our NOx emissions, 80% from heavy-duty vehicles, most powered by diesel engines, resulting in the dirtiest air in the country. The heaviest exposure to diesel exhaust is experienced by low-income communities of color who live along the goods movement corridors of Southern California. It is a public health and an environmental justice imperative that we seek to replace diesel with clean technologies.

In addition, transportation sources in Southern California account for 50% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions known to cause climate change.  Rising seas and worsening droughts threaten our community and our world, today and for future generations.  

But we now have a chance to save the world from climate change and clean our air because of decades of California leadership, leadership which has resulted in a growing array of zero-emission and advanced hybrid light-duty vehicles and the imminent deployment of zero and near-zero emission trucks. We are now poised to play a powerful role in the worldwide efforts to abate climate change while helping free our region from exposure to air toxins; all we must do is find the strategies to accelerate the deployment of these clean vehicles significantly.

Move LA has a plan: â€œVision 2020: A Plan to Clean Southern California's Air and Abate Climate Change,â€ and we have launched a regional dialogue to build a coalition capable of addressing these two most significant challenges.

Move LA will activate 100,000 Angelenos and Southern Californians to finish our clean air and climate change mission, utilizing our innovative and successful civic engagement model to build the coalition and develop the strategy to do it. 

Help us fund a two-year public outreach and coalition building effort that will: 

- Identify and champion a grand bargain to win the funding needed to implement the South Coast Air Quality Management Districtâ€™s mobile sources plan, which would dramatically accelerate the deployment of zero and near-zero emission light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicles to abate climate change and end air pollution in fifteen years.

- Implement an all-electric regional Metrolink commuter rail system and create a much more efficient goods movement system.

This effort will, we hope, culminate in legislative or ballot initiative action in 2020 (hence ""Vision 2020""); when joined with the efforts of the State of California, it could create the economies of scale needed for clean transportation to be cost and performance competitive with gasoline and diesel vehicles in markets around the world.","There is little doubt that all of Earthâ€™s communities, including and especially the coast of California, are now at risk from climate change. There is little doubt that diesel air pollution is toxic and that disadvantaged communities living along our goods movement corridors bear a devastating burden. A program and strategy will, without a doubt, make Los Angeles, and many other communities, a healthier, more just and far better place to live.

Our method of activation is both old-fashioned and innovative. It is both face-to-face and makes use of advanced social media tools. It was successfully used to engage constituencies from across the county that represent business, labor, environmentalists, environmental and social justice advocates, affordable housing organizations, faith-based groups, seniors, students, and people with disabilities for the passage of Measures R (2008) and M (2016) with support from over 2/3rds of the population. As part of our activation, we will do it again by:

- Building broad-based coalitions throughout the county, especially with environmental justice constituencies and leaders in the Inland Empire and Southeast LA County.

- Organizing regional events focused on specific issues related to clean air and climate change (one is already planned on April 19).

- Communicating electronically with hundreds of thousands of Angelenos and Southern Californians to discuss, debate, and provide input through online groups, blogs, and social media sites.","We will define and measure outcomes by:

- Success in the creation of a broad-based coalition that brings together business, labor, environmental and social justice advocates, faith, health, student, senior, persons with disabilities and under-represented groups from disadvantaged communities to the policymaking table on air pollution and climate change strategies.

- Recognition by appointed and elected leaders that we can clean our air and abate climate change while enhancing our economy by supporting the right public investments in clean technology and modernized infrastructure.

- Identification of a preferred strategy to raise the $15 to $20 Billion needed over 20 years to address the transportation-related emissions challenges at the core of this effort. This could entail legislation in Sacramento and/or going to the ballot in 2020. 

- The number of people, either through their vote, in-person advocacy, or other means of engagement (such as online) who expressed their support for Vision 2020, the regional coalition or legislative/ballot initiative.

We will also measure our success by the inspiration for this project â€“ our Executive Directorâ€™s 22-year-old son who believes that we are too late to turn back the tide on air pollution and climate change. If we can convince him that local change can have a global impact, then maybe he and we will all be able to breath easier.","In five years, we believe that leaders in California and voters across the region will have agreed on a transformative effort to finally clean our air and abate climate change. The legislature will have approved legislation and voters will have gone to the ballot in 2020 to approve funding at the level needed to accelerate the deployment of zero and near-zero emission vehicles. The agencies tasked with addressing toxic air pollution and greenhouse gases will be allocating money to accelerate deployment of clean vehicle technologies to where economies of scale enable these technologies to out-compete gasoline and diesel counterparts in the marketplace without subsidy. Our regional transportation authorities and Metrolink will be building electrified regional rail and clean truck-only lanes to further reduce toxic and GHG emissions.

While the benefits will not be immediately apparent, Southern Californians will be dumping diesel and making the transition to non-polluting vehicles. The deployment curve for zero emissions will bend ever upward to where the end of petroleum-based transportation can be seen in our skies. Move LA will continue to engage supporters to advocate for the policies necessary to further reduce emissions caused by transportation. We believe change starts locally and if we can model it here in Los Angeles, we can do it across Southern California, throughout California, around the country, and around the world.

Rise up!â€ uses popular education and arts activation to build community resilience towards a future where there is no loss of life from traffic collisions, state violence, or displacement.","Two â€œStreet Beatsâ€ events will celebrate community history, people, and place through music, food, storytelling, safe street simulations, and communal art making. A series of smaller â€œRise and Shineâ€ events (leading up the the big events) will focus on building relationships with the residents and include bike rides/walks, educational film projections, and tenant/legal rights popular education. We will focus on neighborhoods surrounding Slauson/Broadway and Slauson/Western in South Los Angeles.","Root down! Rise up! will seek to establish a model for resilient community development at the neighborhood scale by improving community connections and awareness. We will document the tools and methodology that will be developed to increase civic engagement and provide resources and services to equip community members to remain in place and help shape the future of planning in their community. Through a strategic media advocacy campaign we will share this model throughout Los Angeles and beyond. 

In addition to eliminating the loss of life due to car collisions, we believe that equitable and just improvements to the community must also ensure that there is no loss of lives due to state violence, or loss of residents in the neighborhood due to displacement. An intersectional approach to improving the quality of life of residents will provide:

- A platform for local artists and community members, to help shape the local landscape to reflect their identity;
- Opportunities for creating open space through open streets and cultural events in park deficient communities so that  residents can  connect with one another in an intentionally intergenerational and cross cultural spaces;
- Pop-up examples of built environment improvements to get feedback and support from the community to improve biking, walking, and accessing public transportation in the area;
- The ability for residents to build resilience by shaping their own narratives to better be able to influence decision makers through storytelling documented in portraits and curated audio; 
- Protection against displacement, gentrification, and state violence by connecting residents with local resources and providing popular education to help inform them of their tenant and legal rights.

There will be in-person engagement at various scales with large â€œStreet Beatsâ€ events and â€œRise and Shineâ€ mini-events. Street Beats is a community-led, collaborative effort to bring safety improvements and engaging activities at the intersections of Slauson/Broadway and Slauson/Western. â€œStreet Beatsâ€ events will feature creative designs on the streetscape that educate the public on the importance of street safety and our need to claim public spaces. â€œRise and Shineâ€ events will use popular education to teach the community about the inequities they are facing and increase knowledge and awareness of tenant and legal rights for community members of color. Additionally, we will use storytelling as a tool for building resilience; we believe that the documentation of community images and stories is one way  to honor current and past residents and combat displacement by ensuring that histories are not erased. All of these activities and events will be able to connect cross-cultural and intergenerational volunteers (particularly youth and elder volunteers) from the neighborhood. These volunteers will help design the events, conduct outreach, coordinate activities, and be active participants in the events.","We will prioritize direct engagement to residents who live within a quarter of a mile from the main corridor. This diverse community, with new Latin American immigrants, indigenous communities, and historic Black communities (of diverse ethnicities), will be reached through door knocking and mini pop-up events in the corridor where we will  share information and build relationships to invite them to the larger â€œStreet Beatsâ€ and smaller â€œRise and Shineâ€ activiations. Each event is likely to bring around 150-300 active participants and all participants will have interactions via social media hashtags with prizes as incentives to tag us to help bring attention to their stories and the project. Our secondary audience will be Angelenos at large, public agencies, and community based organizations doing similar work who will be reached through indirect means listed below.

Activations will be highly visual on two very busy intersections (day of activities and a mural that gets left behind) and is likely to be seen by 65,138 drivers and 7,704 transit riders daily.

Social media plan will highlight events and activities. 

Documentation of community stories through the production of videos with portrait stills and audio that will be shared in the corridor and online.

Article placements in hyper-local publications like the Sentinel to highlight community stories and promote and cover events.

Develop partnerships with Streetsblog and KPFK to feature the community stories and events.
","Our achievable goals for the duration of this project will help lay the foundation to make zero loss of life for this community a reality. Rates of volunteerism will go up in this corridor by 50% using a baseline of membership that each group currently has in the corridor through providing public and open streets events that are multicultural and multilingual. This will foster opportunities to reduce racial segregation amongst the diverse population in the community. Our goal is to reach 2,500 community members in the corridor to receive social and emotional support through resources and education regarding the complexity of law enforcement and rentersâ€™ rights. Cultural events will include the development of a community-shaped narrative about the communityâ€™s identity, values, and needs through the documentation and curation of 30-50 diverse community stories. Additionally, images of the community and their history is present in the built environment through communal art making. Lastly, through this effort our goal is to increase government responsiveness to residentsâ€™ needs around the built environment and housing policy.","We hope that the communities that reside on and near the corridor have a better quality of life through built environment improvements, and are equipped with knowledge, resources, and the power of their stories and presence to be better rooted in the community and combat displacement. We also hope that the intersectional approach we implement becomes an example for others on how to revitalize neighborhoods and build community resilience in partnership with the community.","[""Adults getting sufficient social & emotional support"",""Government responsiveness to residents’ needs"",""Rates of volunteerism""]","Root down! Rise up! will seek to establish a model for resilient community development at the neighborhood scale by improving community connections and awareness. We will document the tools and methodology that will be developed to increase civic engagement and provide resources and services to equip community members to remain in place and help shape the future of planning in their community. Through a strategic media advocacy campaign we will share this model throughout Los Angeles and beyond. 
 
 
 
 In addition to eliminating the loss of life due to car collisions, we believe that equitable and just improvements to the community must also ensure that there is no loss of lives due to state violence, or loss of residents in the neighborhood due to displacement. An intersectional approach to improving the quality of life of residents will provide:
 
 
 
 - A platform for local artists and community members, to help shape the local landscape to reflect their identity;
 
 - Opportunities for creating open space through open streets and cultural events in park deficient communities so that residents can connect with one another in an intentionally intergenerational and cross cultural spaces;
 
 - Pop-up examples of built environment improvements to get feedback and support from the community to improve biking, walking, and accessing public transportation in the area;
 
 - The ability for residents to build resilience by shaping their own narratives to better be able to influence decision makers through storytelling documented in portraits and curated audio; 
 
 - Protection against displacement, gentrification, and state violence by connecting residents with local resources and providing popular education to help inform them of their tenant and legal rights.
 
 
 
 There will be in-person engagement at various scales with large “Street Beats” events and “Rise and Shine” mini-events. Street Beats is a community-led, collaborative effort to bring safety improvements and engaging activities at the intersections of Slauson/Broadway and Slauson/Western. “Street Beats” events will feature creative designs on the streetscape that educate the public on the importance of street safety and our need to claim public spaces. “Rise and Shine” events will use popular education to teach the community about the inequities they are facing and increase knowledge and awareness of tenant and legal rights for community members of color. Additionally, we will use storytelling as a tool for building resilience; we believe that the documentation of community images and stories is one way to honor current and past residents and combat displacement by ensuring that histories are not erased. All of these activities and events will be able to connect cross-cultural and intergenerational volunteers (particularly youth and elder volunteers) from the neighborhood. These volunteers will help design the events, conduct outreach, coordinate activities, and be active participants in the events.",Connect,2018085,https://activation.la2050.org/connect/multicultural-communities-for-mobility-a-project-of-community-partners/multicultural-communities-for-mobility-a-project-of-community-partners.jpg,https://youtu.be/4gShI4Plo2I,8102085

","There is no room for Tommy, the spaceman, and many more people in LA. But in our backyards may lie a great opportunity to make an extra rental income while increasing housing in LA. If only LA knewâ€¦","There is lack of affordable housing in LA. 
We propose to use machine-learning and publicly available data to create a free database for homeowners to easily find out if they can build an additional living unit in their backyard. 
We will also create an awareness campaign to help educate homeowners on this new opportunity right in their backyard! ","LA will be the best place to LIVE when it has enough affordable housing to be considered a truly inclusive place. We plan to activate Angelenos to build more housing units in Los Angeles: one unit - per backyard - at a time, to accomplish this goal.

Our activation will create an easily accessible database that identifies which properties in Los Angeles County can have secondary units (also called Accessory Dwelling Units or ADUs) on their lots. We will also create an awareness campaign to educate homeowners on the opportunity that lies in their backyards: an additional housing unit that can create rental income while helping with efforts to increase affordable housing in LA.

Los Angeles is struggling with lack of affordable housing and an increase in its homeless population. ADUs are a significant way to increase the housing stock in Los Angeles.

LA County and the City of LA have relaxed zoning regulations in order to allow for construction of more ADUs. The number of permitted ADUs has grown this past year. However, if we are to make a dent in the affordable housing crisis we have to build many more ADUs per year.

Nowadays, a process to determine if a lot is eligible for an ADU addition requires the design consultantâ€™s or homeownerâ€™s investment of time to read and interpret complicated zoning code constraints.

We propose to streamline this process by generating quick answers for homeowners on their possibilities regarding ADUs on their properties. To accomplish this task our database will use machine-learning and existing Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to predict with good certainty the likelihood of a property being allowed by zoning codes to have an ADU. 

After the database is generated, we will develop a user-friendly website where anyone can search for their property and see if they can build an ADU. We will be able to reach out more people in less time and hopefully contribute to engage more homeowners in building ADUs.

We will also create an awareness campaign targeting homeowners of South LA, Central LA and East LA.

Our activation will eventually contribute to the addition of affordable units in communities impacting Housing Affordability Metric and Homelessness Metric. We also believe that it will impact the Resilient Communities Metric since it will boost much needed housing opportunities.

","Our activation will educate Angelenos to contribute to the solution for the affordable housing challenge in LA: by adding a secondary unit on a single-family residential lot. 

We will focus our awareness efforts in South LA, Central LA and East LA. By focusing our awareness efforts on low-income communities close to downtown LA, we are hoping to increase the affordable housing supply in a sustainable way. For example, as a consequence of additional ADUs in these areas, the increased population will have easy access to existing public transportation and proximity to schools and jobs. 

We hope to empower these communities in ways that will generate more community participation in solving its challenges. Renters educated on the potential addition of ADUs can spread the word to their landlords and neighbors. They might have family members or friends in need of housing that could benefit from ADU additions to their street. This can be an opportunity to enrich and better connect these neighborhoods.

As the fringes of Downtown LA redevelop, low-income communities are most at risk for displacement. This organic increase in affordable units can be taken as an opportunity to steer change in the direction of strengthening communities.
","We will measure success by the amount of single-family lots searched in our database/ website and we will ultimately measure success by matching searched addresses in our website to permits obtained for ADU construction in LA County.

Through collaborative efforts of organizations located outside and inside the city of LA and LA County, efforts are increased.  Neighboring counties and organizations know about the challenges that exist in LA County and want to help in the efforts to ""Carry Forward"" their communities.

The University of Southern California and the Los Angeles Veterans Collaborative did a study of California Veterans, finding and concluding the following: 

Each year, approximately 12,000 military veterans will settle in Los Angeles County as they transition out of the military, joining the 325,000 veterans who currently reside here. For the most part, veterans in California and Los Angeles County reflect the larger national demographics, with the exception that the local population has more Hispanic and Asian veterans than the national average. 

The findings from the Los Angeles County Veterans Study have revealed several overarching issues that deserve attention:
â€¢ 1st, many service members leaving the military are not prepared for the transition.
â€¢  2nd, many military veterans have a wide range of needs that cannot be easily provided by a single organization.
â€¢  3rd, veteran support organizations are not organized to provide holistic support to current and returning veterans.
â€¢  4th, most veteran support organizations are focused on meeting acute and chronic needs of veterans, such as homelessness, immediate or severe health issues, or acute or chronic unemployment. Very little attention is given to preventing these conditions or intervening early to prevent them from becoming chronic.

Additionally, relocating homeless individuals to locations like Lancaster, Apple Valley, and Hesperia which have available jobs, lower rents, and price of properties.

The Center will help low-to-moderate income families in Compton access a full range of services and programming related to regional housing, transit, economic development, and urban agriculture that make communities stronger and more resilient.","NHS' Center for Sustainable Communities serves hundreds of low income families annually in a region that has endured many of the worst impacts of the economic downturn. Of primary concern is how to deal with the growing challenges among these neighborhoods regarding chronic unemployment/underemployment, reduced capital access for small business development, the ongoing threat of food insecurity, substandard transit options, skyrocketing housing costs, educational disparities, and youth disengagement. 

In response, the Center for Sustainable Communities provides the people of Compton and South Los Angeles County a facility that serves as a hub to build a solid foundation for creating neighborhood sustainability over the next decade. Specific impacts include: 1) Improving the job readiness and overall skills base of local workforce; 2) Providing healthy living resources,health and vision clinic services to residents; 3) Reaching and training residents through the CSC Neighborhood Revitalization Institute; 4) Increasing access to business incubator services and originating loans for small business owners; 5) Engaging youth in on-site workforce and mentoring programs; 6) Assisting families through our Financial Empowerment Center; 7) Establishing community garden projects on the property and urban gardens in surrounding neighborhoods; 8) Sharing educational resources through an on-site library and technology center; 9) Providing green education and conservation programs; 10) Promoting community safety with a Public Safety Drop In Site - Fire, Paramedic, Building & Safety; and 11) Building 300 units of affordable housing and increasing home-ownership. In addition to meeting crucial resource access needs for families, the Center will allow its partners to share sustainability concepts that drive planning approaches in other impacted communities throughout South Los Angeles and LA County.

As the facility grows, the Center will expand to help hundreds of small business owners, neighborhood non-profit groups, and residents through on-site services and regional partnerships with community service groups, faith-based organizations, green organizations, health providers, technology professionals, schools, and municipalities. At least 50% of our tenants will be service-driven. 
","The residents of Compton are primarily made up of low to moderate income families and individuals; the per capita income is $13,847, which is less than 50% of both the state average of $29,906 and the national average of $28,555. The city's poverty rate is double the state average. Rents and home prices have risen to the point that lower-skilled and lower-wage earners must live further away from their jobs. As a result, the lack of affordable housing has closed off the access to health and wellness, education and other benefits associated with a strong workforce.

NHS intends to continue to engage the community through the CSC by increasing the programs offered and the depth of those programs. Specific strategies include: building more affordable homes, hosting farmer's markets to support community wellness; workforce training and placement in agriculture, construction, and culinary jobs; and hosting financial empowerment workshops.","Our expected outcomes will make a vital difference for families and small businesses looking to increase access to neighborhood resources in South Los Angeles County. Annual goals include:
- Providing financial education and affordable housing services to 750 residents;
-Building 300 affordable homes and providing affordable mortgage opportunities; 
- Expanding Neighborhood Revitalization Institute programming to engage 150 residents with community leadership training; 
- Improving job readiness by 20% among 100 youth through PCR and METRO CDC job training programs; 
- Expanding small business growth by 25% and creating incubator programs to serve 10 entrepreneurs/businesses, while lending to 20 small businesses;
- Enhancing healthy food options and outcomes by building 5 gardens and providing 300 residents with healthy living education;
- Providing job training to 60 residents;
- Hosting 8 farmer's markets to provide fresh nutritious food.

Gauging the success and impact of the project will require tracking data among partners and service providers that utilize the facility. NHS will work with partners to consolidate and filter impact data. Affiliated groups working through the Center will share all relevant statistics and deliverables data with NHS. NHS will serve as the central filter for evaluating the impacts and status of job training, homeowner education, financial education, and small business education programs.
","With an activation from LA2050, NHS positions itself to create strong neighborhoods over the next five years. Our hope is that every community we serve will have access to healthy, affordable food; financial literacy and economic opportunities; and affordable housing.  Our Sustainable Communities Initiative will host 40 farmer's markets, develop 3.7 acres of agricultural space across five developments, train 750 community members in various trades with a 50% placement rate, train 1,250 residents in healthy living, and encourage financial literacy with our ongoing poverty prevention programs. 

The vision driving our Initiative involves addressing a broad spectrum of issues. At the center of this focus is our commitment to promote strategies that create systemic, trans-formative change in under-served neighborhoods. This initiative will serve as a catalyst for broader goals to help low-to-moderate income families achieve economic prosperity, secure affordable housing, broaden access to resources, and incorporate green living.

The simple solution to providing ready-to-eat and healthy meals to those struggling with food insecurity proves that Angelenos are concerned about their local communities and strive to discover innovative solutions for them. This program is human-centered and intends to work with a breadth of local organizations in order to provide a comprehensive program of self-development. Rather than be a ""hand out"" initiative, it is a hand-up approach to creating self-sufficiency in each and every Angeleno.

LA is thus proving that it is a welcoming and solutions-driven community where each individual is valued and supported in his/her ambitions to lead a healthier, more fulfilling life that allows him/her to become a higher contributing member of the community.

But food insecurity can also have surprising faces: single, working mothers; veterans; students; seniors. HNI supports LA's efforts to eradicate food insecurity and its foundational causes. 

Hunger: Not Impossible will feed millions of food insecure Americans by leveraging a ubiquitous technology and mode of communication â€“ cell phones and texting.

With convenient and regular access to food, H:NI participants are able to reinvest their time into strengthening the foundation of their lives, which ultimately disrupts the perpetual cycle of hunger.

This initiative will work collaboratively with other LA-based organizations working to end poverty and hunger in LA. Together, they will improve LA's reputation as being the homeless capital of the United States. It will show that Angelenos care about their communities and are actively discovering and utilizing breakthrough approaches to improving everyone's situation.","Initially success is measured by individuals impacted. How many food insecure individuals register for the program and how often do they access meals via the platform? Partnering with local organizations provides additional resources for individuals who can also access skills development, education, life coaching, health services and other necessary forms of support in order to comprehensively improve each individual's situation now that regularly accessing food is no longer a concern and distraction.

In order to measure this success, it is a months-long process of data tracking--via the ordering platform--of individuals to understand increase in qualitative life components. Surveys provided to all participants at the beginning and end of the program will inform the success of the program.","HNI's longterm goals include becoming part of a comprehensive system that supports individuals in their journeys to improve their living situation. Without food, a person is incapable of achieving anything else as it becomes an obsessive thought: where will I find my next meal? HNI can take this distraction out of the equation by providing this basic need via accessible, healthy, ready-to-eat meals. This creates space in the individual's live to pursue other means of self-improvement including employment opportunities, skill development, education, health services, etc. 

If HNI can partner with organizations around the country, it will revolutionize the ability of NGOs and their communities to dramatically escalate and accelerate the work of each organization.","[""Access to healthy food""]","HNI activation includes:

 Partnering with local organizations to pinpoint the individuals who can most benefit from the program.

 Onboard participants into the program

 Participants will text ""hungry"" whenever they would like to order a meal (the number of meals / days will depend on budget and scale)

 Participants will be directed through a series of SMS prompts that will build a food order at a participating restaurant that is nearby (geo-location technology selects the nearest locations)

 Participants will pick up their meal and eat!



 The simple solution to providing ready-to-eat and healthy meals to those struggling with food insecurity proves that Angelenos are concerned about their local communities and strive to discover innovative solutions for them. This program is human-centered and intends to work with a breadth of local organizations in order to provide a comprehensive program of self-development. Rather than be a ""hand out"" initiative, it is a hand-up approach to creating self-sufficiency in each and every Angeleno.



 LA is thus proving that it is a welcoming and solutions-driven community where each individual is valued and supported in his/her ambitions to lead a healthier, more fulfilling life that allows him/her to become a higher contributing member of the community.",learn,2018090,https://activation.la2050.org/live/not-impossible-foundation/not-impossible-foundation.jpg,0,8102090
8102091,8102091,Mobile application to make parking easier,A mobile application to make sure you never get a parking ticket ever again!,"NoTow will help Angelinos save nearly $150 million(govtech.com) in parking fines. Our application uses image recognition and a proprietary algorithm to parse text from signs and determine one's ability to park. Simultaneously, we proactively save the sign's rules and coordinates to make a comprehensive parking map of LA so one does not need to aimlessly seek allowable parking.","Our mobile application (app) helps users find and secure parking quickly by utilizing intelligent software to read parking signs and determine if users can park in a specific location on a residential or commercial street. 

The benefits of this application are numerous.  Firstly, it has the potential to drastically reduce the amount of time users need to spend on finding parking, which can in turn reduce traffic in a city already known for it's abundant traffic problems.  

In addition, it will reduce the number of parking tickets issued to people throughout the city. This has the potential to make residents and commuters happier in their daily lives, and allow tourists and visitors to enjoy their visit in the city to a greater capacity.  Time not spent looking for parking is time spent in local stores, restaurants and businesses. These effects have positive economic implications, but will also benefit the city of Los Angeles beyond monetary reasons. Our app's image recognition and text analysis will make life easier for non english speakers so they can park, knowing they will not suffer the burden of a ticket. Simply stated, it will make the notorious parking problems rampant throughout the city more manageable, thereby making the city a happier and more productive place to live.","NoTow targets commuters driving in metropolitan areas with restricted parking marked by parking signs. We intend to insert ourselves as a tool for reminding commuters where they parked and for how long they are able to stay. Facebook advertising for will be our primary paid user acquisition and shareable viral content platform. We will use social media platforms such as twitter, instagram, and youtube to produce free viral content using the help of professional colleague in viral marketing.","In our eyes, success for this project is defined through its ability to make a meaningful and tangible impact on the state of parking in Los Angeles.  

Because our activation is by nature highly technological, it should be relatively straightforward to measure success through the following mediums:

1) Acquisition of users and monitoring their daily activity (provided through iOS App Store and Android Play Store analytics).
2) Number of parking spots examined and ultimately committed to through the app.
3) Number of parking tickets reported through the app.

With the success of this app, we'd expect downloads and number of parking spots examined and committed to increase and a decrease in parking tickets reported.  

Additionally, as we accumulate data for latitude/longitude coordinates pertaining to specific parking signs, our application will eventually be able to make specific map-based suggestions to users utilizing the app, even further decreasing number of tickets issued and the amount of time users spend looking for parking.","In five years, NoTow hopes to have 1 million monthly users across Los Angeles users. We hope reduce parking search time and prevent millions of dollars in avoidable fines. We also hope to augment our text parsing and rules engine with Machine learning (AI) capabilities to increase development speed for accounting for all possible sign rules.

-- Highly scalable and targeted digital advertising
-- In-person trainings and tabling at community centers, neighborhood festivals, and other gatherings across L.A. County with help from our collaborators
-- Partnerships with community based organizations (CBOs) to arm them with marketing materials so they can help spread the word and encourage their staff and clients to use One Degree","We will measure success by how many L.A. County residents not only use the platform to find resources, but utilize them to improve their lives.

8102093,8102093,"Entrepreneurs, Advocates, and Lenders Mobilize to Protect the Rights of L.A. Small Business Owners. ",The Responsible Business Lending Coalition (RBLC) will educate and empower L.A. entrepreneurs and Angelenos to advocate against predatory lending practices for themselves and their communities. ,"The activation will build awareness among entrepreneurs who are often prone to predatory lending and strategically create/advance a policy agenda that advances responsible lending.  Angelenos and LA-based business owners will help drive these efforts through active storytelling and advocacy. Predatory lending is harmful to business owners, their families and communities, and our City of Angels,  and we are activating a movement to lift up the voices of Angelenos and fight back.   
","Entrepreneurship is vital to a thriving Los Angeles, but access to the capital necessary to start and grow a small business continues to be a serious problem. Research from Small Business Majority finds that 91% of small business owners identify this as a top area of concern. When small business owners are denied a traditional loan, many turn to high-cost alternative financing sources. Opportunity Fund research has found Los Angeles business owners face APRs of an average of 94%. These high-cost products can jeopardize businesses, homes, and families and leave a vacuum in communities should these businesses fail. This is particularly true for women and minority entrepreneurs, who are less likely to be approved for traditional loans than their white male counterparts.

To address this issue, the RBLC formed in 2015 to support responsible practices in the small business lending sector. We have created the Small Business Borrowersâ€™ Bill of Rights (the Rights)â€”a set of practices lenders and brokers adhere to when financing small business ownersâ€”and are now planning an intensive LA-focused campaign to activate Angelenos around responsible lending through education and policy advocacy. By creating momentum among the countyâ€™s small business and entrepreneurial community, we can push for stronger protections against predatory lending and better support those most affected by discriminatory and predatory lending practices, in particular, women and minority entrepreneurs working to start and grow their firms.

In our education campaign, we will create and disseminate materials to ensure that entrepreneurs know the following: 1) their rights when searching for a loan, 2) which responsible lenders operate in their area, and 3) which questions to ask to ensure they find a responsible loan. We will compile an LA-specific online toolkit with this information and share it with our networks and with local business organizations for distribution to their networks. We also will conduct in-person educational events for local entrepreneurs. These events will be open to all, but we will focus our outreach on engaging women and minority entrepreneurs to better support their ability to protect themselves from predatory lenders.

We also will create and advance a policy agenda informed by feedback from LA entrepreneurs. To advocate for stronger legal protections, we will collect stories from small business owners who have been trapped by predatory lenders, and we will share these stories widely. We will train small business spokespeople to speak with the media and send opinion pieces to local outlets. We will meet with local government leaders to elevate the issue, and we will connect our spokespeople with their elected representatives to ensure that policymakers understand the detrimental impact of predatory lending on local business. These activities will raise public awareness about this issue and push for reforms to current lax lending laws.
","To make LA the best place to create, we will engage Angelenos in building a large-scale movement to fight for fairness in small business lending. We will create an LA-focused website that connects all strategies used during our campaign. The site will house our resource toolkit on avoiding lending traps, provide referrals to local responsible lenders, detail how to speak out against predatory lending and connect Angelenos with their elected officials.

Our educational events, held at accessible locations across the county, will provide practical information on how to obtain responsible capital. Whenever possible, we will include representatives from local responsible lenders to present with us, and we will provide referrals to local business assistance organizations for entrepreneurs who need additional support.

We will raise public awareness about predatory lending and our available resources through a strategic traditional and social media campaign. We will widely distribute the personal stories of our spokespeople, and we will activate Angelenos to contact their elected officials to advocate for greater lending protections via lobby days and campaigns. To further extend our reach, we will create a marketing toolkit to help our business partners share this information with their members.

Through this combination of practical education, increased public awareness and advocacy for sensible policy, we will make LA a national leader in the fight against predatory lending.
","Our ultimate goal is for all entrepreneurs and small business owners to have access to responsible capital and protection from predatory lenders. To work toward this goal, we aim to raise public awareness of the problem, increase the number of lenders who support the Rights, and advocate for beneficial policies at the local, state and federal levels.

To measure our progress, we will track the new resources we create, including our educational and marketing toolkits, LA-focused website, and other appropriate materials. We will track outreach and educational event dates, locations, cosponsors and attendance numbers. We will compile a list of business and advocacy agencies with which we partner, and we will track how many partners distribute our materials to their memberships. We also will track the number of visitors to our website, media placements and spokespeople engagement, along with the number and type of social media campaigns we launch and how many engagements we receive through review of clicks, tweets and other channel-sponsored data-capturing systems.

We will track our media activity around relevant legislative issues, participation in public discussions and educational meetings with policymakers. We will track whether policies are introduced or debated at the local or state levels. We also will track the increased number of Rights signatories and endorsers we engage over the course of this campaign.","In five years, we hope that every Angeleno small business owner can easily access affordable, responsible capital to start and grow their business, regardless of where in the county they are located or what language they speak. Individual business owners and their advocates will be well-informed about their options and their rights when seeking financing. Lenders will face significant market pressure to deliver quality products or face declining business. Policymakers will recognize and act on their knowledge that small business owners deserve basic consumer protections. 

We believe Los Angeles will be leading the way nationwide in demonstrating why and how a healthy financial ecosystem for entrepreneurs creates good jobs and thriving communities. The Small Business Borrowers Bill of Rights will be well known and used by business owners, their advocates, lenders, and policymakers across the nation.","[""Gini coefficient"",""Jobs per capita"",""Minority- and women-owned firms""]","Entrepreneurship is vital to a thriving Los Angeles, but access to the capital necessary to start and grow a small business continues to be a serious problem.

8102095,8102095,COMPAS for Park Equity: co-powering & mobilizing communities to expand Community School Parks in LA,"COMPAS is a movement of parents, neighbors, friends, and staff collectively activating LAâ€™s potential to transform neighborhood schools into community hubs with the power of Community School Parks","PFP is mobilizing for more play in LA. Through digital and grassroots activism, we launched COMPAS, a movement of school staff, parents, neighbors and other stakeholders who commit to 1) cultivating vibrant neighborhood hubs at local CSPs 2) promoting the benefits of CSPs, and 3) advocating for innovative shared use policy. COMPAS centralizes information about these needed hubs and it brings people together around the common goals of play, connection and community building.  ","In LAâ€™s most densely populated and socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods, children and their families do not have access to safe parks and plays spaces that are critical to leading healthy lives and building stronger communities.

PFP focuses on tackling park inequity through our Community School Parks program (CSPs), which opens school playgrounds to the public on Saturdays and provides youth and adult enrichment programming in partnership with the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD).

CSP-goers experience the benefits of increased park access and play spaces with improvements in overall health, physical fitness, obesity rates, nutrition, academics, crime, and social connectedness neighborhood-wide.

In order to expand these kinds of positive results and bring about systems change that advances park equity, PFP will mobilize community members and activate Angelenos to help make LA the best place PLAY. We will do so in the following ways:

1) Operate three CSPs in dense,under-resourced LA neighborhoods, giving thousands of residents easy access to vibrant parks
2) Foster residentsâ€™ sense of ownership of CSPs through our community engagement program, COMPAS
3) Mobilize COMPAS members to advocate for shared-use policies
4) Educate and engage decision-makers to advance shared-use policies
 
COMPAS is a field-based community-organizing program and a movement of parents and neighbors with two shared goals:
1.	Supporting recreation hubs that are safe, welcoming, and responsive to each neighborhoodâ€™s unique interests, and
2.	Opening Community School Parks at every school in LA

Through COMPAS, parents, neighbors, and friends come together to build relationships, assess recreation needs, create action plans, build skills, volunteer, and receive recognition for CSP related contributions and innovations.

To complement PFPâ€™s in-person relationship-building work, COMPAS will use digital activism to bring together Angelenos from different neighborhoods so that they can build a strong, collective voice supporting CSP expansion.  As community members learn about the benefits of CSPs, they will become advocates for play, and galvanize their communities to move decision-makers towards city-wide shared-use policies.

With LA2050â€™s support, PFPâ€™s COMPAS will:
â€¢	Activate 300 hundred parents per school at existing CSPs to become parent volunteers and vocal supporters of CSPs and shared-use
â€¢	Activate 5,000 neighbors per school at existing CSP sites to build awareness of CSPs and shared-use.
â€¢	Activate parents to recruit and engage their community members through COMPAS, with a goal to register supporters at 20 schools (total potentially activated: 100,000)
â€¢	Advocate for LAUSD to authorize low-cost or no-cost shared-use options so that communities across LA can access school playgrounds during non-school hours.

Through COMPAS we will activate parentsâ€™ & neighborsâ€™ civic power to advance shared-use policies that can improve parks equity in LA.","We will engage:
1)	Parents, principals, teachers, neighbors, friends at existing CSPs, and community members living in dense regions of LA who wish to open CSPs. All CSPs are at Title I schools, where average park acreage per 1,000 people is .09 (LAâ€™s average is 4.2).
2)	LA supporters of expanded park access through CSPs and shared use.

Our strategy includes in-person engagement at neighborhood and parent resource centers to present COMPAS and install â€œCOMPAS Point Stationsâ€ where visitors can learn more about CSPs/shared use, become COMPAS members, and sign up as volunteers. 

COMPASâ€™s interactive online â€˜parentsâ€™ portalâ€™ is easily accessed on desktop and mobile devices. Portal visitors can: 
â€¢	Register as COMPAS members & movement supporters
â€¢	Register to become CSP parent volunteers in ongoing activities, special events and shared use advocacy 
â€¢	Recruit other advocates
â€¢	Register for public events to support shared use (e.g. school board, city & neighborhood council meetings)
â€¢	Publicize community events
â€¢	Share challenges, best practices
â€¢	Connect to PFP/COMPAS social media to post photos/videos, stories & goals for neighborhood.

Parents without access to the internet can text a keyword to sign up. This lowers barriers to entry and enables us to collect and organize participant information so that we can recruit, communicate updates and elevate emerging and existing leaders in their communities. The portal is supported by the digital community platform, NationBuilder.","In collaboration with LA Countyâ€™s Dept. of Public Health and digital community platform, NationBuilder, PFP will evaluate quantitative and qualitative outcomes related to the following objectives:

For 300 COMPAS members to become active parent volunteers at CSPs: NationBuilder tracks the number of registrants and the progress and frequency of those registrantsâ€™ volunteer activities. 

For 100,000 Angelenos connect through COMPAS: NationBuilder tracks COMPAS online registration.

To expand community use of existing CSPs: We will use geographic mapping and demographic data to understand how many and what types of people we are creating access for (eg, age groups, income) and systematic observation and tracking tools to measure how many and what types of people use CSPs and to understand barriers and facilitators to parks access, resources we can provide, and needed changes in community capacity. We aim to serve 500 parkgoers per month/per park and 500+ for special events. Outreach and park attendance data will be linked to understand what activities increase park use.

For coalition building & shared use advocacy: Using digital tracking and interviews, we will measure progress along this measure through frequency of communication with key community partners and policy makers as well as COMPAS member visits to public forums such as Neighborhood Council and School Board meetings to voice support for shared use. Conduct semi-annual review of shared use provider agreements.","CSP Sustainability and Expansion -  for CSPs to exist at every public school in Los Angeles; for parents and neighbors to have taken ownership over CSPs to define and achieve place-specific goals and to have secured long-term support for CSPs through advocacy and collaboration with LAUSD and other government and community groups; for â€œCommunity School Parkâ€ to be a household name.

Shared Use Expansion - for major stakeholders, including LAUSD, LA City and related departments, the LAPD and LA county to have partnered with the common goal of providing safe open spaces across LA that create access to health and wellness amenities in high-need communities; for this collaboration to have resulted in an innovative municipal park system that incorporates CSPs into its service model, permitting public access to school playgrounds.  

Community Health and Development â€“ for CSPs to serve as vibrant neighborhood hubs, spaces that neighbors consider safe, welcoming, interesting and their own; for populations surrounding CSPs to experience overall physical and emotional wellness, neighborhood connectedness and park equity through regular visits to CSPs and participation and leadership in CSP activities.","[""Access to open space and park facilities"",""Number (and quality) of informal spaces for play"",""Number of residents with easy access to a “vibrant” park""]","In LA’s most densely populated and socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods, children and their families do not have access to safe parks and plays spaces that are critical to leading healthy lives and building stronger communities.
 
 
 
 PFP focuses on tackling park inequity through our Community School Parks program (CSPs), which opens school playgrounds to the public on Saturdays and provides youth and adult enrichment programming in partnership with the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD).
 
 
 
 CSP-goers experience the benefits of increased park access and play spaces with improvements in overall health, physical fitness, obesity rates, nutrition, academics, crime, and social connectedness neighborhood-wide.
 
 
 
 In order to expand these kinds of positive results and bring about systems change that advances park equity, PFP will mobilize community members and activate Angelenos to help make LA the best place PLAY. We will do so in the following ways:
 
 
 
 1) Operate three CSPs in dense,under-resourced LA neighborhoods, giving thousands of residents easy access to vibrant parks
 
 2) Foster residents’ sense of ownership of CSPs through our community engagement program, COMPAS
 
 3) Mobilize COMPAS members to advocate for shared-use policies
 
 4) Educate and engage decision-makers to advance shared-use policies
 
  
 
 COMPAS is a field-based community-organizing program and a movement of parents and neighbors with two shared goals:
 
 1. Supporting recreation hubs that are safe, welcoming, and responsive to each neighborhood’s unique interests, and
 
 2. Opening Community School Parks at every school in LA
 
 
 
 Through COMPAS, parents, neighbors, and friends come together to build relationships, assess recreation needs, create action plans, build skills, volunteer, and receive recognition for CSP related contributions and innovations.
 
 
 
 To complement PFP’s in-person relationship-building work, COMPAS will use digital activism to bring together Angelenos from different neighborhoods so that they can build a strong, collective voice supporting CSP expansion. As community members learn about the benefits of CSPs, they will become advocates for play, and galvanize their communities to move decision-makers towards city-wide shared-use policies.

8102096,8102096,Safe Place for Youth by Podshare,"PodShare has built over 190 affordable housing units across Los Angeles and SPY serves 1,100 homeless youth each year, connecting them to jobs, schools, housing, healthcare, and basic necessities.","This grant money would secure a property and build 20 pods in West LA within 6 months. Once built, we will jointly fund raise to secure ongoing rent and maintenance costs for the facility, apply for Measure H funds to for basic services and staffing, and use other private funds for additional programming. This activation will decrease the number of homeless Angelinos on our streets and make temporary housing affordable and scalable, helping hundreds of young people find affirming community.","Currently, there are thousands of young people on the streets of LA fighting to survive. They are creative, resilient, generous, powerful and represent immeasurable untapped talent. County-wide efforts to address homelessness are critical to systemic shift, yet community level interventions have tangible impact on neighborhood culture, connectedness, safety and health. By taking a local approach to addressing youth homelessness and leveraging key organizational skill sets, Podshare and Safe Place for Youth (SPY) are poised to take on youth homelessness in West LA, improving the lives of housed and unhoused Angelenos alike.

The vast majority of homeless adults, first experience homelessness in their teens and early 20â€™s. If stabilized early, time spent on the streets can be brief and non-recurring. However, without intervention, todayâ€™s homeless youth go on to become tomorrowâ€™s chronically homeless adults, with deeply exacerbated medical, mental health and emotional scars due to extended trauma of life on the streets. This activation seeks to break that pipeline to chronic homelessness by meaningfully engaging young people in safe, youth- friendly, easily- accessible temporary housing. In doing so, we will show impact along the following metrics:

Homelessness. With enough pods to shelter 20 young people each night, â€œSPY by Podshareâ€ will move 50-250 individuals off the streets each year. This provides immediate safety and respite while significantly decreasing the likelihood that those individuals will become chronically homeless adults, impacting ~1,600 to ~8,000 people by the year 2050.

Mental Illness. Youth experiencing homelessness deal with complex mental health concerns related to disconnection from family, histories of abuse and neglect, grief, isolation, and criminalization. Yet less than 6% of SPY youth report mental health concerns as a contributing factor to their homelessness. With onsite staffing and services available, guests will receive the care they need, preventing them from becoming part of the nearly 30% of chronically homeless adults with serious mental illness in LA County. 

Resilient Communities. Engaging the housed community in local responses to homelessness allows for deeper social connectedness, greater feelings of community pride and ownership, and humanization and empathy-building for those living outside. We will measure community resilience year over year through the number of volunteers participating in our programs and pre and post questionnaires regarding measures of connectedness for both guests and volunteers.

Youth unemployment/underemployment. After housing, connection to jobs is the most requested service from youth at SPY. With a strong track record of engaging hundreds of youth in employment programming each year, this activation will ensure that guests are provided ample opportunity to find meaningful work and are offered metro passes and bus tokens to increase work transit accessibility. 
","The Podshare and SPY LA 2050 Activation will focus on engaging housed Angelenos around issues of youth homelessness. The crisis of youth homelessness is currently largely unknown to the broader community. SPY knows from experience that in order to implement successful and lasting strategies to mitigate youth homelessness, it is critical to garner the active support and participation of your surrounding neighbors. Safe Place for Youth has a Street Outreach team that goes out five times a week to places where homeless youth sleep, develops rapport with the young people, and works to connect them to SPYâ€™s on-site programming. In that same way, so too does our plan to engage housed Angelenos focus on building of personal connections that are motivated towards action, whether thatâ€™s donating, advocating, or volunteering. These connections will be catalyzed through a host of outreach strategies, including flyers in public spaces, implementing a robust social media campaign including a compelling LA2050 video, hosting community presentations on the issue of youth homelessness, and empowering youth to tell their own stories. Through these different interactions, Angelenos will gain deeper insight into the crisis of youth homelessness, and will in turn be motivated to support crisis housing for youth both financially and with their time, in order to make LA the best place to live.","Within 3 months of funding, â€œSPY by PodShareâ€ will be fully operational with SPY filling the pods and providing services to guests. Over the first 2 years, â€œSPY by PodShareâ€ will maintain an average nightly occupancy of 95% (19 pods) maximizing our ability to provide immediate night-time shelter to young people in need. SPY Housing Case Managers will work with guests to identify their long-term housing plan and provide supportive day services at the SPY Drop-In Center. Additionally, an on-site case manager will help guests address needs that arise at â€œSPY by PodShare.â€ Through this coordinated care, a minimum of 80% of guests will exit â€œSPY by PodShareâ€ to a higher order housing intervention (i.e. bridge, transitional, rapid rehousing, or permanent supportive housing.) While mental health services will not be mandated for guests to support each personâ€™s right to self-determination, SPY will strive for at least 50% enrollment in wellness supports through youth friendly language and staffing. Similarly, education and employment supports through the SPY drop-in center will be made available to all guests, aiming for 65% enrollment. Community engagement and goodwill will be measured through volunteerism, striving for a 10% increase in the number of volunteer hours donated each month during the first year, and a 25% increase in political support for homeless youth over year one, measured through community feedback surveys and questionnaire.","After the successful opening of this first â€œSPY by PodShareâ€ location, we hope to garner support to continue our shared mission of moving homeless youth off the streets. Our goal in the next 5 years would be to open 4 more locations, each with 20-40 pods, expanding our impact from 50-250 individuals to providing temporary housing to 200- 2,000 individuals each year. In doing so, we will enhance the lives of each guest, intervening in their lives at a critical time and improving their long-term mental health, employment, and housing stability prospects. Additionally, we will engage housed Angelenos in the process, creating a deeper sense of community ownership and connectedness to their city and unhoused neighbors. These dual processes will enhance individual and community well being, and move us towards the LA we all want to achieve. We must act fast if we are going to outpace the rise in the homeless population each year. The LA2050â€™s goal of having fewer than 1,000 homeless people on the streets by the year 2050 is achievable. PodShare and SPY are here to help get it done.

Once trained, the promotores will conduct community outreach and education to help their fellow neighbors access much-needed health and wellness resources, reaching 4,500+ residents. By being truly resident-led, the promotora model will not only improve health outcomes, but also increase community empowerment and social connectedness.","We will make LA a better place to CONNECT by ensuring that the community of Boyle Heights gets sufficient social and emotional support. We will do this by improving the health and social connectedness of families by training and supporting 25 promotores from within the community to reach out to over 4,500 residents over two years to:
o	Increase familiesâ€™ awareness of health and wellness resources, and
o	Help families connect to and navigate health and wellness services. 

Below are details of the activities to achieve this goal:
1. Promotores Training â€“ increase participation in community problem-solving by training promotores in the community. Trainings will include:
o	Foundation-building training sessions â€“ for the promotores to developing skills in areas such as listening, connecting with others, and public speaking. We will conduct four sessions up to three hours each. 
o	Content-specific training â€“ in areas such as understanding and navigating wellness resources, trauma needs/issues, community wellness needs, and impact and coping tools for community and individual stress. 

2. Promotores Support â€“ ensure continual participation in community problem-solving by offering ongoing support to promotores. Promesa Boyle Heights will offer in-person engagements to support and coordinate promotores as they begin their work in the community through:
o	Monthly promotores meetings 
o	Building a strong peer-to-peer support system, including â€œLead Promotoresâ€. 

3. Promotores community-level work once trained will include: 
o	Influencing individual behavior in the community around health and social connectedness through:
â–ª	Resident outreach
â–ª	Wellness referrals 
o	Conducting in-person engagements with community members through presentations and workshops 
o	Increasing participation of the residents in community problem-solving by offering residents volunteer opportunities to get involved in community organizing efforts to advocate for policy e.g. connecting them to the Comite de Lideres and other organizing and system-level efforts.

The improved health outcomes and increased social connectedness will ultimately contribute to enhanced educational and life outcomes for the families served.","The activation will engage the community of Boyle Heights, which is in the top 10% of LA Countyâ€™s 272 communities with high income and educational risk factors. The community is at high risk of not receiving sufficient social and emotional support as shown by two factors:
o	Race: 94% of Boyle Heights residents are Latino â€“ the least likely race to receive sufficient social and emotional support, when compared with White, African-American or Asian. 
o	Education: 54% of Boyle Heights residents over the age of 25 do not have a high school diploma â€“ the least likely to receive sufficient social and emotional support when compared to those with a high school, college or post-graduate degree. 
In addition, 1 in 3 families live below the federal poverty line, and more than half of residents are foreign-born, and for the majority, Spanish is their primary language. 

Promesaâ€™s core approach underlying all our strategies for change is to foster local leadership and civic engagement so that residents become agents of change in their own lives and community. The promotora model will involve extensive training and support for 25 residents to become agents of change in their community. Once we have developed their leadership and capacity, the promotores will reach out to over 4,500 fellow residents to help them access health and wellness resources. The residents themselves will lead the transformation process to reach the LA2050 goal of 95% of adults receiving social and emotional support","The success of the promotores (1) training, and (2) support will be defined by the growth of the promotores themselves. This will be measured by their:
o	Leadership development
o	Confidence
o	Connection to each other
o	Employability.

The success of the promotores (3) community-level work will be defined by the increase in familiesâ€™ awareness of health and wellness resources, and familiesâ€™ increased connectedness to those resources. This will be measured by the following indicators:
â€¢	Number of resident contacts made by promotores
â€¢	Number of referrals made by promotores and percentage of referrals completed
â€¢	Number of residents who receive a referral and percentage who follow through on the referral and connect to health services
â€¢	Number of presentations and workshops given by promotores and number of residents attending 
â€¢	Percentage of presentation/workshop participants reporting increased knowledge.","Within Boyle Heights, we plan to scale up the number of promotores year-on-year in order to expand reach to residents over time. Moreover, we see our model being replicated by other low-income communities within Los Angeles that, though each facing their own unique issues, share a common need to raise the voices of local residents.We are building a model in which we catalyze â€œeverydayâ€ peoplesâ€™ passions, lived-experiences, and creativity to support comprehensive solutions that build on one anotherâ€™s assets. Promesa Boyle Heightsâ€™ mission and reason for being is not simply to transform Boyle Heights.

Our garden education programming starts under our feet through compost education that rebuilds soil one invisible microbe and fungi at a time. Our gardens and compost hubs at high schools and public parks are a proof of concept for entrepreneur empowerment education and job training benefitting 16-24 year old youth. ","We intend to co-create with our partners learning environments that transform people, place, and community through collaborative efforts directed to healing our city soils, growing good food, and designing educational experiences that lead to meaningful work, career exploration, and entrepreneur empowerment. 

DISTRICT-WIDE GRADUATION RATES improve when students and families feel connected to their school, teachers, and other personnel. Our school-based healing gardens and compost hubs connect young people and their families with the earth and her bounty, providing almost immediate tangible rewards for their physical effort, routine attendance, and mindful presence. The collective effort required to manage a school builds social cohesion and acts as the glue that holds together a community of learners together that support and care for one another as they support and care for their plants. Gardening and compost curriculum aligned to academic content in science, technology, engineering, art and math creates ""Aha!"" moments with promising potential to the bridge learning gap, motivate learners, and promote success in school. In sum, academic success, meaningful connections to school and peers, and strong community of learners can drive up school graduation rates.

PROFICIENCY IN ENGLISH, LANGUAGE ARTS, AND MATH are supported by Proyecto Jardin's gardening and composting curriculum. Participants maintain garden journals and compost logs to track inputs, outputs, record observations, and summarize outcomes. They measure, weigh, illustrate, and write to describe, reflect, analyze, synthesize, report, and share. Proyecto Jardin works closely with a school site teacher(s) to align the organization's garden/compost education program to the specific needs of participating classroom(s) and school-wide goals and objectives.

YOUTH EMPLOYMENT & UNDEREMPLOYMENT are addressed through meaningful education that can lead to meaningful work as a Certified Compost Maker or a community/school garden coordinator. Our Compost Academy is a comprehensive 8-week course that prepares individuals for entry-level employment as a compost hub manager, compost associate, or vermi-culture (worm farm) practitioner. 

In addition, classes and workshops offered at Grand Park in collaboration with the Grand Park Foundation in conjunction with their Grand Park Rangers program provide a gateway to stewardship of the earth and promote individual commitment to care for, protect, and engage more deeply with their urban parks, green spaces, and nature. ","Our new garden installations and compost hubs at schools and public spaces (i.e. parks) engages teachers, students, parents, and administrators in building healthy, robust communities of learners.  

Through gardening, people connect with the earth and build common ground as they learn to care for one another, love their school, and pursue academic greatness because they know their education will lead to good job while simultaneously healing their city soils and producing fresh delicious food. 

Our strategies leverage cross-sector partnerships through sharing of resources, knowledge, and social networks to promote sustainability, resilient communities, and learning across disciplines. 

We take expand the learning environment beyond the four walls of a traditional classroom and conventional instruction practices to address the wholistic needs of learners who carry historical trauma and experience daily stressful living environments. 

","We define success as:
(1) The degree to change in personal and community knowledge about gardening, composting, and career options in these fields.
(2) Social cohesion and participation in school and/or community activities and events, 
(3) Successful installation of 3 new school gardens and compost hubs, and reactivation of an additional 3 gardens/compost hubs that fallen into disrepair and neglect due to lack of funds, resources and/or interest. 

Our measures of success include: 
1. Participant Attendance: sign in sheets; school attendance records. 

2. Change in knowledge, attitude, beliefs: Pre- and post surveys and quick writes about gardening knowledge, composting knowledge, 

3. Career Options Awareness & Aspirations: Focus group before and after participating in the Compost Academy and one season of gardening. 

4. Personal Efficacy: Pre- and post survey of personal power to affect change in their personal, academic, and social life.

5. Collective Efficacy: Pre-post survey of collective efficacy (community power to affect change)

6. 3 new gardens installed and 3 existing underutilized gardens reactivated.

 DISTRICT-WIDE GRADUATION RATES improve when students and families feel connected to their school, teachers, and other personnel. Our school-based healing gardens and compost hubs connect young people and their families with the earth and her bounty, providing almost immediate tangible rewards for their physical effort, routine attendance, and mindful presence. The collective effort required to manage a school builds social cohesion and acts as the glue that holds together a community of learners together that support and care for one another as they support and care for their plants. Gardening and compost curriculum aligned to academic content in science, technology, engineering, art and math creates ""Aha!"" moments with promising potential to the bridge learning gap, motivate learners, and promote success in school. In sum, academic success, meaningful connections to school and peers, and strong community of learners can drive up school graduation rates.

","

RaiseAChild will conduct state-of-the-art outreach campaigns and utilize best business practice technology to find loving homes for children languishing in LAâ€™s foster care system. 
","We seek to ignite true innovation within Los Angeles County's foster care system, the largest child welfare system in the nation, through a radically different approach to improve public awareness and civic engagement. This will be accomplished with the expansion of our successful multi-media outreach campaigns, strategic collaborations in the development and roll-out of a new Customer Relationship Management technology system, and the application of best business practices and principles. 

","RaiseAChildâ€™s pioneering multi-media recruitment campaigns have been steadily growing. With last yearâ€™s state-of-the-art events generating well over 1,750,000 impressions and directly reaching thousands of people, we anticipate successfully connecting with more than 100,000 Angelenos over the next two years and mobilizing them for the greater good of children in foster care. Through Activate L.A., we plan to expand by 50% the scope of these events and continue to create, produce, and manage unique outreach campaigns that promote family building to a broad spectrum of prospective families. Using radio, television, digital media, social media, and street-light banners, campaigns will be scheduled twice a year throughout Los Angeles. The spring campaign will coincide with National Foster Care Month, Mother's Day, Father's Day, and Gay Pride Month and the fall/winter campaign will take place during National Adoption Month and the holiday season. Each will prominently feature the LA2050 name on all related materials and its logo on 100 % of the street-light banners.  Our innovative Parent Advocate Program, which combines the attention of a mentor with the technological support of a cloud-based case management system, will also expand to track and facilitate the progress of all identified prospective parents. Inspired by our participation in the 2017 #HackFosterCareLA event (to engage the technology sector in improving the lives of children and families involved with the foster care system), we will also embark on a unique retention collaboration designed to improved methods of communication and support services to thousands of prospective and current parents. By simultaneously developing and implementing this technology, we will have the capacity to incorporate this additional flow of prospective parents into our database, and also more effectively and efficiently meet their needs to assure their retention.







","Our sensational outreach campaigns will feature compelling messaging in English and Spanish about the dire need for loving homes for foster children. Building on our success of inclusivity, these messages will continue to target both the LBGTQ and heterosexual communities, along with further expansion into the Spanish language speaking neighborhoods throughout the city, representing approximately 48% of L.A.â€™s population. Additional bi-lingual staff will enable RaiseAChild to make additional inroads into the Hispanic community.  We also plan to expand discussions with several inclusive and welcoming faith-based organizations to further engage Angelenos and promote our mission. Fostering and adoption are slow processes, but our goal is to motivate and engage 100,000 Angelenos through social media, targeted outreach campaigns and solid business practice technology, to help to solve the foster care crisis in Los Angeles.  

","Our technical partners and staff will closely monitor and track the number of prospective parents who come to us through campaigns, events, websites, word of mouth, etc. and the number of prospects who have begun the necessary orientation, training and certification steps -- or where they are in the process. Using the newly-created best practice business technology, we will be able to further customize each subsequent interaction. Analyzing information from the existing pool of possible resource parents will allow us to identify the best current prospects and allocate staff resources strategically to maximize returns. As the survey and messaging results are obtained, collected, and aggregated, the information will afford staff greater efficiencies in managing its thousands of prospective parents and enable them to provide more effective one on one attention. By using this information to proactively make system-wide improvements aimed at preventing drop-out, we will be able to increase and improve our retention success rates for potential parents who in turn will ultimately be able to positively impact the safety and well-being of the children in their care.

","RaiseAChild has a program that has been tested and proven unlike any in the country, which provides measured and ongoing support and guidance to all its prospective parents as they navigate the foster/adoption process. Since our inception, we have slowly introduced innovation and groundbreaking approaches into the child welfare system and are now beginning to see the positive results of our efforts. In five years, we hope to see the system completely overhauled and the process for fostering and adoption taking half the time for prospective parents to be vetted. We anticipate increasing our retention rates by an additional 40%, and the foster care crisis, now fueled in part by the opioid epidemic and new federal policies on immigration, be significantly diminished. Ultimately, we look forward to finding forever homes for 15,000 children who are the innocent victims as there is a severe shortage of foster homes in L.A. When we look at todayâ€™s children, we see tomorrowâ€™s leaders, but for foster children to thrive in Los Angeles, we must engage Angelenos to help support their development, help build them loving families and promote public policies that work for both. In order for communities to come together cohesively to create a prosperous Los Angeles by 2050, we must invest in these children now.

Red Hen will transform this building into an artistic hub for the surrounding community, equipping the stage with lighting and sound equipment for local artist performances; furnishing the community space with computers, desks, chairs, and instruments for workshops; and providing a space for underserved youth to practice the arts.","Through the LA2050 Activation Challenge, Red Hen Press will make capital purchases in preparation for the launch of the Hen House Workshop Series in its new community arts center. The workshop series will provide low-income youth with free arts education in the fields of literature, music, and dance, as well as offer writing master classes taught by renowned Los Angeles poets and writers. 

Funds will support the purchase of equipment, including laptops, desks, chairs, instruments, music stands, audience seating, sound system equipment, lights, and other staging equipment. Red Hen has much of the infrastructure for this project already in place, including a performance and workshop space and a rotating team of about 20 volunteers to perform programming and administrative duties. The press also has a strong relationship with local artists who will be hired to instruct workshops.

The purchase of basic workstations will allow Red Hen Press to host 20 free one-hour youth arts workshops per category (writing, music, and dance) for a total of 60 workshops annually. The press will conduct 60 workshops; serve 1,000 elementary, middle, and high school students; and employ 6 teaching artists. Through the program, students will be encouraged not only to emulate great art, but create and share original works, thus building improved artistic skills, deepening appreciation for the diverse landscape of art, and increasing confidence in peer-to-peer sharing and public presentation. The series will also provide low-income students a safe space to spend time after school.

Additionally, Red Hen will program a writing master class workshop series for adults. Workshops will be offered in a range of prices and durations (one-off workshops and multi-week series) to increase accessibility for aspiring writers. The press anticipates hosting 30 master class workshops annually, to be instructed by lauded Los Angeles poets and writers. 

The purchase of staging equipment and audience seating will also enable Red Hen Press to host its own events. Currently, the press primarily programs literary events at arts venues, museums, art galleries, and theaters throughout Los Angeles, and such events often incur space rental costs. By programming literary events at our own performance space, the press will eliminate venue rental costs, allowing for free entry for audience members and higher honoraria for performing artists. Support for this project will also support Red Henâ€™s efforts to increase attendance from low-income populations by providing free tickets to students, their families, and faculty at Title I schools in Los Angeles.","As Red Hen Press expands its programming, we will need our local community to step up and aid us in carrying out our mission. We will tap into our local community of artists for instructors for our new workshop series. We will reach out to local arts venues, educational institutions, and collectives to seek performers to populate our events. We will recruit volunteers from local colleges and universities to help plan and promote our new programs and services.

","Success for Red Henâ€™s new programming will be defined by renovation goals met, number of workshops and events planned, attendance numbers at events and workshops, and percentage of capacity at each event.

Renovation will be considered a success when the performance space is equipped with lighting, sound, and staging equipment; when tables and chairs are purchased for workshops; and when the building's facade, currently a solid cinder block wall, is adorned with large windows. 

Red Hen Press aims to host 15 events and 60 workshops annually, filled to 90% capacity each, and anticipates 1,500 attendees over the course of the year. This data will be collected from event reports written by press staff and survey questionnaires filled out by event attendees. Surveys also provide the press qualitative feedback about attendeesâ€™ perceptions of an eventâ€™s success. These measures allow us to continue to create and improve upon spaces where ideas can be shared among members of the literary community. ","Our dream is to build a literary center in Los Angeles that will rival the other four literary centers in the country: Poets House in New York City, the Poetry Center in Tucson, the Loft in Minneapolis, and the prime literary space in the country, the Poetry Foundation in Chicago. Funding from the LA2050 Activation Challenge will make this dream a reality. In five years, our programming will have expanded significantly. The press would be hosting events or workshops three times a week; during the day, the event space would be used as a writing space for authors who wish to work collaboratively with other creatives; our youth outreach programs would be expanded to include after-school programs in addition to our current in-school programs; we would be able to increase staff compensation to match industry standard. The press is at a turning point in its history.

Work will consist of in-person outreach and ongoing software development, starting with neighborhood councils and branching out to ultimately include all levels of government. 
","Information exchange between government and residents is disjointed and one-way, with each agency or body employing its own broadcast channel.

A tool is needed that allows residents to gather all of these streams into a single flow and also to add their own voice in the dialogue.

REGIONAL.LA is a social media tool that allows residents to find and connect with their civic community according to local geography: cities, neighborhoods, service areas.

By bringing these parties together, REGIONAL.LA allows residents to obtain better response from their local governments, participate more meaningfully in their neighborhood councils and other bodies, and form more & deeper social media connections with other residents through shared participation.

Regional.LA works as follows:
(a) PLUG-IN: Create an account and link it to your other social media so that you may consume the experience in your preferred environment (Regional.LA means to work with other social media platforms rather than compete).

(b) GEOGRAPHIC DISCOVERY: Identify your  address or neighborhood and be presented with a list of gov't agencies & bodies operating in your area (this is accomplished by analyzing intersections between your area and the service areas of the gov't entities).

(c) EXPEDITE SERVICES: Browse from available services listed by local gov't entities and submit any requested info that would expedite these services (Gov't can serve you better if they know you better). This can apply to utility initiation, emergency response, volunteer opportunities, etc. 

(d) STAY INFORMED: Subscribe to news feeds from gov't entities in your area.

These software capabilities have already been deployed in early form in select pilot areas, and over the course of the grant life cycle deployment will be expanded ultimately throughout all of Los Angeles County. In addition, deployment will be accompanied by a robust ""ground game"" of local ambassadors, drawn from local communities, and funded to actively promote adoption of the platform in their areas.

This activation will enhance GOVERNMENT RESPONSIVITY by providing a venue for direct citizen/government connection: residents can discover and make themselves known to their local government agencies, facilitating better interactions. Furthermore, governments can post surveys & questionnaires and also advertise volunteer opportunities and services --residents can respond & register online to enhance government response.

This activation will enhance CITIZEN PARTICIPATION (voting) in Neighborhood Councils by providing (a) a means for the Councils to have a higher profile amongst residents and deliver more value to residents, and (b) a means for Councils to actively advertise and facilitate voting opportunities.

This activation will deliver more and deeper SOCIAL MEDIA CONNECTIONS among residents by providing new ways for them to participate together in activities of common interest, thus promoting direct residents-2-residents discovery. ","This activation is aimed at all civic-minded social media using residents in LA County, likely numbering far above the 100,000 person goal set by LA2050.

This activation will reach out directly to the 2000+ governmental entities operating in LA County (starting with Neighborhood Councils and moving ""up"" from there) and utilize these entities as a vector to reach as many of the 10 million+ residents of LA County as possible. 

Although the history of the Internet is replete with cases of endeavors that enjoyed instant success from viral adoption with no marketing required, this activation makes no such assumptions and instead includes a strong ""ground-game"" based upon in-person action at the Neighborhood Council level. 

Ground-level Ambassadors will work to ensure that government responsivity to residents' needs is being positively impacted by dialoging with gov't agencies to discover their needs and assisting them in utilizing the tool for best effect. 

Ambassadors will work to ensure that voting rates and general participation in Neighborhood Councils is positively impacted by similarly interfacing with Council Boards to understand needs and share best practices culled from other Councils. 

Finally, Ambassadors will also reach out online to the residents themselves via online forums in order to monitor and understand how the tool is being adopted by individuals, and make recommendations back to Management towards improving end-user experiences.

","Three Angelenos traverse LA in a green RV to interview professionals in the creative, high-tech and manufacturing industries, introducing millions of TV viewers and students to new career pathways.","Roadtrip Nation helps people from all walks of life find career pathways that match their interests through its public TV series and educational resources. A group of Angelenos will hit the road in a green RV to gather stories of inspirational professionals who have overcome obstacles and are thriving in careers in high-tech startups, manufacturing, and the creative industry. Millions of PBS SoCal viewers and students across the region will discover career opportunities shaping the future of LA.","There are a lot of career opportunities in the LA area that many Angelenos are unaware of and lack access to. At Roadtrip Nation, we want to change that. Our goal is to give everyone access to the same information and opportunities. 
 
Roadtrip Nationâ€™s Beyond the Red Carpet Roadtrip will make LA the best place to CREATE by sharing with Angelenos the inspiring stories of individuals who have overcome obstacles and are thriving in careers in high-growth industries seeking a skilled and diverse workforce right here in our own backyard. The stories will be gathered by three Angelenos who hit the road in a green RV to interview a diverse group of professionals in the high-tech startup, manufacturing, and creative industries. Highlights will be featured in a documentary special on PBS SoCal and the content will be incorporated into Roadtrip Nationâ€™s educational resources for middle school, high school, and college students.

High-tech Startups
LA has become a leading destination for high-tech startups. Silicon Beach, located in the Westside region of metropolitan LA, is home to more than 500 tech startup companies and is considered to be one of the hottest tech hubs in the world. Venture capital in the billions is flowing into the city, thanks in part to efforts by Mayor Garcetti and a council of entrepreneurs, venture capitalists and community leaders which introduce investors with local tech funds. 

Manufacturing
From aerospace and medical supplies to food and furniture, the Los Angeles area is the biggest manufacturing hub in the country with more than half a million jobs here. There is space to build factories and runways, the weather is ideal for testing planes year-round, the huge ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles let companies quickly ship products to a global market, and a massive logistics region east of Los Angeles is the first stop before products get on trucks to go across the country. Skilled workers are in high-demand, and business are working with local educational institutions  to help students obtain training and skills for these jobs, many of which do not require a four-year college degree.

Creative Industries
Los Angeles is one of the most diverse cities in the world, but the entertainment industry remains a very small, largely white, male â€œclubâ€. This year offered hope that the industry may have reached a tipping point. With the Grammyâ€™s long overdue recognition of hip hop as the dominant genre in music, and with the critical and box office success of films like The Shape of Water, Get Out, and Black Panther, the hope is that the industry is finally changing to better reflect the diversity of our country and the world at large. The challenge ahead is to build from these successes. Beyond the Red Carpet will highlight writers, directors, producers and other creative talents who are forging new ground so that the entertainment industry continues to nurture and attract the best creative talent from all cultures and walks of life.
","RTN will launch a digital application to recruit Angelenos to participate in the Roadtrip. RTN and its partners will conduct promotional activities and outreach to encourage Angelenos to apply. RTN will select three roadtrippers, help plan their route, and coach them in how to book the interviews. A RTN camera crew will help facilitate the experience and capture video footage  for television, online, and classroom purposes.
 
RTN will create a hub dedicated to the Beyond the Red Carpet Roadtrip to serve as a resource, marketing tool, and landing page for all Angelenos. The hub will introduce the selected roadtripper team, enable people to follow the roadtrippers on their journey through social media, and showcase the content.
 
RTN will collaborate with its partners and LA2050 to host a screening event to celebrate the Roadtrippersâ€™ experience and showcase the produced content, inviting local media, government and business leaders.
 
Roadtrip Nation will disseminate the LA2050 content through: 
* A documentary special broadcast on PBS SoCal; LA2050 will be provided with on-air credit 
 
* Partner channels and networks including LA2050, UCLA Extension, LA OC Regional Consortium of Community Colleges  

* RTNâ€™s Interview Archive of 5,000+ videos containing edited segments from each interview from the trip
 
* Roadtrip Nationâ€™s Project-Based Learning Modules enabling participating middle school, high school, and college students in LA to explore the career pathways featured ","We will define success by the number of people who have exposure to the project and access to the content.

There are four main metrics we will use to measure the success of the Beyond the Red Carpet Roadtrip:

1.	We will track the number of visitors to the LA2050 Roadtrip hub from launch to close.
2.	We will track the number of applicants for the roadtripper positions.
3.	We will track the number of households that view the PBS SoCal broadcasts of the documentary special.
4.	We will track the number of middle school, high school, and college students in the LA area who have access to this content through RTNâ€™s educational resources.
","It is our hope that 1) hundreds of thousands of Angelenos will be inspired to pursue high-growth, high-demand careers in high-tech startups, manufacturing and the creative industry within the LA area bringing together their interests, talents and innovative ideas, 2) there will be a robust and sustained pipeline of skilled, qualified, diverse job applicants for companies of all sizes in these industries, and 3) these industries will continue to flourish and make LA the best place to CREATE.","[""Employment in the creative industries"",""Manufacturing activity"",""Number of high-growth startups""]","There are a lot of career opportunities in the LA area that many Angelenos are unaware of and lack access to.

This will be a pre-test and post-test at the end of the year. We will also measure parent's improvement in parenting style with pre-post testing (including measuring parent's discipline style). 

To assess improvement in the school, we will measure school-wide reports of bullying and teasing in the beginning and end of the year, and look for changes in suspensions and truancy over the year.

8102107,8102107,SeedLA: Empowering Environmental Leadership,SeedLA is a group of professionals from different industries that provide pro-bono consulting to boost the impact of local environmental non-profits within the LA community.,"We will partner with 12 local environmental nonprofits and provide free support with marketing strategy, data analytics or new program development. Each organization will be paired with a dedicated team of five skilled Angelenos. Over the course of a 10 week project we will help catalyze their work and accelerate their impact on Los Angeles. Our project will bring high quality analytical support to further empower the extraordinary environmental nonprofit organizations of Los Angeles.","From our golden beaches to our parks and mountains, Los Angeles has a natural beauty that is unrivalled, and it is one of the best aspects of living and working here.  However, air pollution was once so bad that people were forced inside. Our oceans were unsafe to swim in. Through the tireless work of environmental nonprofit organizations Los Angeles we overcame these challenges, and while we have come a long way, there is a lot more that needs to be done. We need a sustainable energy infrastructure, oceans free of plastic pollution and clean air to breathe. We rely on organizations like the Coalition for Clean Air, the Surfrider Foundation and the US Green Building Council to advance these changes. Yet while we rely on the nonprofit environmental sector for transformative change, they operate in an extremely resource-limited field. Only 3% of charitable giving in 2015 went towards environmental issues. That is where we come in.

SeedLA is an innovative solution to empower the environmental nonprofits working towards a healthier more sustainable Los Angeles. We started from the realization that there is a large untapped resource in LA â€“ our very own Angelenos. Our city is home to many highly skilled, motivated and sustainably minded people who want to make a positive impact. By recruiting LAâ€™s brightest young minds we facilitate their ability for real, tangible impacts accelerating the work of environmental nonprofits. We build and train project teams specifically tailored to needs of a particular organization and help them work solve critical issues. Whether it be air quality, water pollution public transportation or energy efficiency, we provide free skilled resources to tackle the major issues facing LA by working with the most influential organizations in Los Angeles.

Ultimately, SeedLA will make Los Angeles the best place to LIVE not only by enhancing the impact of organizations already pioneering a healthier and more sustainable Los Angeles, but also by fostering the next generation of environmental leaders.
","SeedLA will make Los Angeles the best place to LIVE not only by enhancing the impact of organizations pioneering a healthier and more sustainable Los Angeles. We offer a high engagement volunteer opportunity for leaders from a wide range of academic and professional disciplines and cultivate the next generation of environmentally conscious leaders.
 
Each of our teams donates a total of 600 hours per project over 10 weeks. Our proposal will directly support the advancement of numerous LIVE metrics and will be spread over 12 different nonprofits partners. We believe that LA can become a model of sustainability and health by 2050, and we want to be a part of it.

The impact of the SeedLA's projects in turn affect thousands of Angelenos through the improved programs offered by environmental non-profits we work with. For example, a recent project from Fall 2017 was with Food Forward. Food Forward engages thousands of volunteers each year to collect food that otherwise would have been wasted, and redistribute to communities of need within Los Angeles. SeedLA's project supported Food Forward with their marketing strategy to improve the processes by which they engage their stakeholders, which in turn will lead to increased volunteer hours and donations.","SeedLA defines the success of our project based on the tangible environmental impacts our work has on Los Angeles. We will measure our success by tracking the number of hours donated and establishing custom metrics for each of our 12 partner projects. The process outlined below is how the impact of our partner projects is tracked and measured.
 
Prior to starting a project we will establish a statement of work with our partners outlining their expectations and goals. Each project manager is responsible for tracking the week to week progress towards these goal. An experienced senior advisor is dedicated to each team to provide advice and oversee quality control.
 
After the completion of the midterm and final deliverables, the SeedLA chapter president will check in with each partner to ensure projects are on track and exceeding expectations. Once the project has ended the president will follow up 4-6 months later to determine the tangible impact resulting from the project. This is how we ultimately define the success of our project. At SeedLA we serve to make an impact, not a report.

Shoes are so much more than shoes. The gift of new shoes can be a transformative experience for young children, many of whom have never received a new box of anything before, certainly not expensive shoes. With the support of their community, children grow to be better citizensâ€”better Angelinos. This sentiment is best captured in the following thank you note: â€œThank you so much for the shoes you are giving me. This is amazing what you are doing... You are going to make a lot of kids happy and you are showing me what kind of person I want to be when I grow up.â€ 

Our program provides a meaningful, concrete way for individuals, businesses, and community organizations to make a real difference in what can often seem an overwhelming problemâ€”child poverty. We believe that most people want to make a difference but feel overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the problems we face. Shoes That Fit offers a solution by connecting people to schools in their own backyards; we operate wherever we have people who want to make a difference.  Year after year, our volunteers return to help schools in their own neighborhoods, often increasing their support and buying more shoes for more kids. Helping children empowers our volunteers, provides a sense of pride in their community, and empowers them to make a real impact on the daily life of children in need. Ultimately, it creates a more engaged community, and a better LA. 

Unfortunately, the inner city of LA is so large and has such high poverty rates that it does not have the number of local support groups we find in other communities.  Yet Southern California has an enormous concentration of wealth and social conscience. Being based in Southern California, our number one goal is to increase the number of children we reach in Los Angeles so that we create a more thriving community now and for future generations. Together, we can inspire the next generation of Angelinos through the simple gift of a new pair of shoes. 
","We need Angelinos to have a direct hand in helping the children of LA. To accomplish this, we will be working with educators from the over 900 schools in the LAUSD. Our staff will work with teachers, school nurses, counselors, staff and volunteers to identify, measure, and deliver shoes for children most in need. 

We will engage Angelinos and provide the opportunity for groups of any kindâ€”churches, businesses, book clubs, families and friendsâ€”to start their own Shoes That Fit chapters. By starting a local chapter, groups can work with Shoes That Fit staff, who will liaise with local schools in the community so those groups can get shoes to the kids that need them most. Angelinos want to helpâ€”we know there is a problem with child povertyâ€”but often donâ€™t know where to begin. We offer that opportunity for those who want to make a difference.

Shoes That Fit actively publicizes major events and shoe deliveries. With the help of celebrities, professional athletes and coaches, and the many sponsor groups we work with, we have received local and national media coverage. These efforts have helped inspire new sponsor groups to fund shoes for schools in their own neighborhoods, wherever that may be. We will continue to work with local media outlets, like KTLA, to broadcast the work that so many Angelinos are doing to make the difference in the lives of children through a new pair of shoes, so that they attend school with their classmates with dignity, able to learn, play and thrive. ","Success is providing more shoes to more kids who need them throughout Los Angeles.
We track the number of new kids we reach, the impact on their wellbeing, and our ability to activate sustained groups within the community to work on behalf of children well into the future. We survey the teachers and volunteers who identify the children, and observe how transformative a new pair of shoes can be.
The results speak to the power of investing in our youth. When kids get new shoes, teachers report improved attendance, increased participation in the classroom and in PE; but above all, over 84% of the teachers report increased self-esteem in the kids who receive new shoesâ€”sometimes the only new thing they have ever received. For kids, shoes are so much more than shoesâ€”they give hope, self-confidence, and dignity. This is reflected first hand in the thank you notes we receive year after year, one student writing: â€œThank you so much for donating shoes to me. I feel really goodâ€¦ because the other pair I have hurts when I walk. Your gift to me will help me play games better and do better in school because I wonâ€™t go into school feeling bad about how dirty my shoes are.â€
In 2017, we provided over 21,000 pairs of shoes and other necessities to 15,000 children at 420 schools in Los Angeles County alone. With LA 2050 funding we can immediately serve another 10,000 kids in LA and build an infrastructure for years to come.","Last year we were able to provide over 21,500 shoes, socks and other necessities for 15,000 children in Los Angeles County. Last year, we adopted a strategic plan to double our yearly impact over the next five years.

8102109,8102109,Supporting the entrepreneurs who create a vibrant Los Angeles,"This project will provide LAâ€™s entrepreneurs with education and resources to start and grow their own businesses, helping them revitalize their communities and create new local opportunities.","With a focus on reaching and supporting women and minority entrepreneurs in Los Angeles County, we will provide education and resources that small business owners need to launch and run a successful business. Small businesses are anchors of their communities. As they grow, they create local jobs and opportunities, contributing to vibrant and sustainable local economies.","Entrepreneurs are a crucial component of a vibrant and thriving California; they employ nearly half the private sector workforce and create two-thirds of all new jobs. As anchors of their communities, they create opportunity in disadvantaged communities, strengthen local economies and revitalize neighborhoods. They are critical partners in the work to reduce inequality and expand opportunity for all.
To make LA the best place to create, we will support local entrepreneurs through our Entrepreneurship Program, which delivers education and resources that small business owners need to launch and run a successful business. Focused on supporting women, minority and other underserved entrepreneurs, the program has quickly expanded throughout the LA area, accompanied by national webinars and educational websites. The program includes seminars and resources in English and Spanish on topics such as access to capital, healthcare, retirement security and asset-building. 
Key elements include:
â€¢ Access to capital: One of the biggest challenges facing entrepreneurs and small business owners continues to be the inability to access credit and capital. We provide education on how to find responsible lenders, avoid predatory lending traps, improve a credit score and access capital through non-traditional methods like crowdfunding. This education is particularly important for women and minority entrepreneurs, who are more likely to be denied a traditional loan than their white male counterparts. 
â€¢ Access to healthcare: We believe that every person has the right to quality, affordable and equitable healthcare. We help small employers explore their options to access affordable healthcare coverage for themselves and their employees.
â€¢ Women entrepreneurs: Despite many gains, gender inequality continues to heavily impact women entrepreneurs. LA is the pilot city for our new Womenâ€™s Entrepreneurship program, specifically designed to educate women business owners about their networking, mentorship and procurement options. We educate women on obtaining certification as a woman-owned business, resources to meet their childcare needs and accessing the capital necessary to start and grow their businesses.
â€¢ Venturize.org: This online platform provides education and resources for small business owners seeking loans, while also offering more in-depth resources such as business planning and financial management tools. We are expanding this platform to LA, engaging partner organizations to share its resources, and developing a feature to connect entrepreneurs with local, in-person support to help them grow their businesses and create good jobs in their communities.
â€¢ Ecosystem mapping: A small business ecosystem comprises the local organizations that offer low- or no-cost assistance to small businesses. Our in-depth mapping of LA-area lenders and business assistance organizations allows us to easily refer small business owners to trusted partners for in-person assistance.
","This activation will engage current and aspiring LA entrepreneurs and the organizations supporting them through free educational events, our Venturize platform, and traditional and social media campaigns. Although we support all small business owners, we specifically target financially and geographically underserved Angelenos, who are more likely to face additional challenges in accessing the resources they need to thrive. We have 12 years of experience reaching underserved small business owners, and we partner with organizations that serve them, including minority chambers of commerce, community groups and womenâ€™s business associations.
For this project, we will host events in English and Spanish across LA County, with a focus on East and South LA, Boyle Heights and Van Nuys. Events will explore important issues like access to capital, healthcare and other topics that help small firms grow and create quality jobs. We will invite representatives from partner organizations to co-present, connect attendees with representatives directly and provide referrals to trusted organizations for further assistance. We will provide partners an opportunity to co-brand Venturize and share it with their members, and we will distribute educational materials to our network and our partnersâ€™ networks. Our communications team will launch traditional and social media campaigns designed to promote our events and the other resources available to support entrepreneurs creating a vibrant LA.","We define success as entrepreneurs and small business owners receiving the education and resources they need to start and grow their businesses and to create good jobs for their employees. Through our events, media outreach, network and partnersâ€™ networks, we expect to reach at least 20,000 Angelenos over the next two years.
We measure our progress by tracking educational event dates, locations, co-sponsors and attendance numbers and demographics. We survey event attendees to assess increased knowledge, and we follow up to determine whether they were able to apply this information successfully (e.g. receiving a loan) or whether they need further education and resources. We also track how many entrepreneurs access our online resources. When our online referral system is completed, we will assess how many people use it to connect with local lenders and business assistance providers.
We expand our reach through partnerships with groups like small business organizations, business assistance providers, responsible lending institutions and other groups that help small employers grow and create good jobs. We track how many partners co-host events with us or distribute our materials to their memberships. As the Venturize platform expands to LA, we will examine how our partners use this technology and its resources to enhance their ability to serve their small business networks.","To date, we have reached more than 250,000 entrepreneurs through direct educational outreach, our online Entrepreneurship Program resource portal, and our social media and partner channels. Over the next five years, we will deepen our reach in the LA area and expand our resources and services nationwide, continually refining and revising our work to best support the thriving small business ecosystem that is central to a dynamic and inclusive economy. 
Specifically, we plan to grow in the following areas:
1. Venturize: Bringing Venturize to LA is the first step in our build out of this platform. We are currently bolstering the Resources section of the site to include more in-depth assistance tools for entrepreneurs, including business plan and financial statement templates, marketing and business development tools and resources, procurement and licensing advice for minority and women business owners, and other expert advice from our partners. We also are developing a user-friendly referral service and engaging partners to use the siteâ€™s resources with their own clients. Over the next five years, we expect to continue refining this platform and expanding it to serve entrepreneurs nationwide.
2. Minority entrepreneurship: While our work already targets entrepreneurs in underserved communities, we are increasing our focus on assisting minority small business owners and entrepreneurs. In particular, we are expanding our Spanish-language outreach, including translating our educational presentations and materials into Spanish, sharing our existing resources with organizations that serve Spanish-speaking audiences and developing Spanish-language videos and Facebook Live events for wider distribution. We are also translating portions of our Entrepreneurship Program offerings into Mandarin, Cantonese and Korean. 
3. Womenâ€™s entrepreneurship: Womenâ€™s business ownership has stagnated at 30% for decades and women business owners lag their male counterparts in the crucial business indicators of revenue, number of employees and funding. To address this issue, we recently launched our Womenâ€™s Entrepreneurship pilot project in LA. We plan to expand this project nationwide within the next two years.
4. Expanded geographical reach: Our current work is focused on eight metropolitan areas nationwide, including Los Angeles, where we have offices and staff on the ground. Our goal is to expand our reach into additional geographic areas where there is significant need for our education and resources.
5. Community portal: A long-term goal for our online Entrepreneurship Program portal is to incorporate a community feature that can facilitate peer-to-peer connections and offer expanded news and information. This will boost small business owner engagement, foster strengthened relationships among small business owners, and develop peer-to-peer mentorship opportunities going forward.
6. Expanded products and services: We are exploring the development of project-based advisory or consulting services that can help larger organizations better understand, serve and support small businesses. 
Over the next five years, we will use these strategies, among others, to continue building and strengthening the community of small business owners in LA and nationwide.","[""Minority- and women-owned firms""]","Entrepreneurs are a crucial component of a vibrant and thriving California; they employ nearly half the private sector workforce and create two-thirds of all new jobs.

8102110,8102110,SmartAirLA ,SmartAirLA deploys â€œSmartâ€ Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to empower communities to reduce the effects and prevalence of asthma in Los Angeles County,"Our targeted outcome is to improve health equity of underserved children.  SmartAirLA will establish a Citizen Science Data Repository that includes a real-time dashboard that tracks the location, frequency, and environmental conditions of the asthma attacks.  This will:
â€¢ enable undeserved asthmatic children to control and improve their condition.
â€¢ equip government agencies and community organizations with actionable data to implement targeted mitigations that reduce the risks of asthma.","SmartAirLA seeks to:
â€¢	Improve asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) outcomes among residents by providing actionable information to support self management
â€¢	Identify hotspots of respiratory disease in the community, better understand how environmental drivers are influencing these patterns.

SmartAirLA is modeled after Air Louisville, in which the city of Louisville and a coalition of private, community health, and philanthropic organizations provided more than 1,100 smart inhalers to asthma sufferers. 

Within 12 months of the smart inhaler deployment, AIR Louisville participants reported:
â€¢	Average of 82% reduction in asthma rescue inhaler use
â€¢	Doubled their symptom-free days
â€¢	Better sleep, with an average of 19% increase in symptom-free nights
â€¢	29% of uncontrolled participants gained control of their asthma

The data collected by the smart inhalers empowered Louisville City to:
â€¢	Identify buffer zones around pollution emitters and set pollution limits
â€¢	Build greenbelts to reduce particulate matter pollution by 60% in high asthmatic neighborhoods
â€¢	Reroute freight routes from high asthmatic neighborhoods

To achieve our outcomes, SmartAirLA will deploy smart inhalers through partnerships with local environmental health organizations and health care providers to educate patients on the health benefits of the smart inhalers.

SmartAirLA will design and execute a pilot project to deploy the smart inhalers to underserved asthmatic children (age 5 to 17) in the Wilmington neighborhood of Los Angeles County.    

The targeted outcomes from the SmartAirLA Pilot include:
â€¢	Improve quality outcomes for patients
â€¢	Reduce health care costs 
â€¢	Identify potential hotspot locations where increased asthmatic events may occur 
â€¢	Provide the collected data to public and nongovernment organizations to implement preventive actions.
","SmartAirLA seeks to be a sustainable smart Intenet of Things (IoT) platform that improves health equity for underserved communities by focusing on preventive care and wellness.  To achieve this, SmartAirLA:
â€¢	Brings together technology, environment, health, and community experts from the academic, private, and public sectors to develop and implement innovative approaches.
â€¢	Engages stakeholders early in the development process to ensure feedback and buy-in.   SmartAirLA is guided by an Advisory Committee of our partners and will establish Health Care, Data and Pilot Community Working Groups to provide strategic direction to achieve our pilot project objectives.
â€¢	â€œLearns by doingâ€ by designing the pilot scope through the â€œMinimum Viable Productâ€ approach.   The pilot is focused within the catchment area to achieve two outcomes: 1) measure health care benefits; and 2) identify environmental factors that cause asthma. These learnings will be applied to scale-up deployment.

The SmartAirLA data repository will serve as the connective tissue between asthma patients, health care providers, community organizations, and government agencies to adopt preventive measures to reduce exposure risks to asthma incidence and exacerbation in community populations.   

Key features of the SmartAirLA Data Repository are:
â€¢	Open platform to maximize outcomes  
â€¢	Targeted to stakeholders who take action
â€¢	User-Centric
","SmartAirLA will measure success based on whether the community we serve has ownership in our work.   SmartAirLA believes that the successful deployment of the smart inhalers requires community stakeholders, such as community leaders, parents, and teachers, to actively contribute to the design and execution of the smart inhaler deployment.   By mobilizing community support, SmartAirLA can effectively deploy the smart inhalers to the asthmatic children with the most need.  Community ownership will be measured by the frequency and number of community members participating in SmartAirLA events and the actions taken by SmartAirLA based on the recommendations of the Pilot Advisory Group. 

SmartAirLAâ€™s has already gained enthusiastic stakeholder support.   
â€¢	Wilmington community representatives have recommended three schools as catchment areas and that the pilot initiation begins as soon as possible.
â€¢	City of Los Angeles Information Technology Agency has coordinated intra-agency cooperation to use the SmartAirLA data to identify measures to reduce asthma risk exposure.
â€¢	Los Angeles County Department of Public Healthâ€™s Chief Science Officer, Director of the Division of Assessment, Planning, and Quality and Director of the Maternal, Child, and Adolescent Health Division, will mobilize health care providers to participate in the pilot.
","SmartAirLAâ€™s vision is to become the smart IoT technology platform to improve health equity for underserved communities.   In five years, our objective is to deploy 5,000 smart inhalers to underserved asthmatic children throughout Los Angeles County through multiple partnerships with community and health care organizations.  This deployment will be financially sustainable through health care shared savings from the significant decrease in asthma hospitalizations (target of 50% reductions) as a result of improved patient care and reduction of asthma risks exposure.

Based on the data collected by the smart inhalers, the SmartAirLA Citizen Science Data Repository provides real-time forecasts of asthma hotspots throughout Los Angeles county through interactive social media platforms.  As a result, 
â€¢	Government agencies take policy and enforcement actions to reduce the exposure risks of asthma.  For example, Los Angeles regional air quality agencies utilize the SmartAirLA asthma hotspots data to assess potential pollution hotspots and identify possible locations for closer inspection, monitoring, and mitigation action; the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health could fine-tune/re-focus elements of its health outreach and education programs in identified areas.
â€¢	Community organizations that advocate initiatives reduce the exposure risks that could lead to asthma events, including education campaigns among community residents, preferential walking or exercise routes to reduce exposure risks in hotspot areas, or local campaigns for greenspace in the areas of identified hotspots. 
â€¢	Local health organizations work with asthma patients in the identified areas to integrate possible personal protection and avoidance patterns of behavior to reduce the likelihood of triggering events, through the referral of patients to community-specific education programs that help manage asthma in the local neighborhood.
â€¢	Businesses use the asthmatic hotspot data to target the environmental mitigation measures. For example, freight companies from the Port of Los Angeles combine the asthmatic hotspot data with WAZE mapping data to time and reroute deliveries from the high risks asthmatic neighborhoods or use electric vehicles when traveling in those areas.  Utilities and businesses use the data to deploy clean energy technologies, such as solar and wind energy to reduce air pollution emissions.

Trails make regional assets available to populations that otherwise might not derive benefit. Physical activity becomes accessible to the widest range of people, including persons with disabilities and others who are known to be less physically active. Trails provides an amenity open to residents of every age.

Walking, Running and Biking are fun and green, curbing our carbon footprints, reducing air pollution and our reliance on fossil fuels. The momentum for active transportation is building, thanks in no small part to completion of the South Bay Bicycle Master Plan. Active transportation is perceived by more and more as a safe way to get outdoors and have fun!

For example, if by answering the call to join in on the fun ACTIVATE SOUTH BAY LA TRAILS! residents begin to support City infrastructure that supports pedestrian and cycling activities, then when an issue comes up in a City related to that, they are empowered to speak out in the public forum.

Expanding uses of linear paths will help us meet our primary goal of augmenting access to space to PLAY in the our urban environment. Since we suffer from a low ratio of park acres per thousand residents (critically underserved in some South Bay Cities), trails are a component of the solution. Seniors, adults, families and children need the benefit of playtime. Having greater access to trails will expand available play spaces, regardless of age. The importance of intergenerational connections is generally acknowledged. Although not defined as park space, trails will help to increase the opportunities for residents of all ages to meet in their pedestrian and cycling activities.

Activating the trail system will bolster the walk/bike/transit scores for every neighborhood along the way. The Walk Score offers an answer to two important questions. ""What can I do to improve my personal health?"" and ""What can I do to improve the health of the planet?"" Furthermore, living a walkable or bikable lifestyle means rush hour traffic becomes less relevant. It is well documented that real estate values are higher in neighborhoods with higher scores.

We require financial assistance to continue our efforts, stabilize our operations and scale to provide other necessary items.  We are looking to inspire other kids to start-up their own organization or movement to help combat homelessness in their community.","The homelessness crisis in Los Angeles is profound. In every neighborhood and every community, from the beaches to Riverside 55,000 of our fellow citizens sleep on the streets of our city. And as the political tide turns for the right, less and less resources are being made available to them. Through our social media, website and monthly Sock Seshâ€™ Community Meetups, we engage people all across Los Angeles.  Sock sessions inspire kids and families to get involved and connect with their community. From Venice Beach to Skid Row, We motivate young families to â€˜give backâ€™ and make our city spectacular. Inspiring Angelinos to work together for the greater good of the city and their struggling neighbors living on the streets. The experiences our volunteers, young & old, have had is something we want to expand. Weâ€™ve had kids out at 8am on Venice Beach, barely awake and partially upset they have to be up so early on the weekend and by the end of our sock session everyone is laughing, having a great time and interacting with our homeless population, because they often are the ones who get overlooked and sometimes feel invisible. Angelenos of all economic backgrounds need to work together to make our communities thrive and we hope with Stellaâ€™s Socks that we can be that bridge.  ","Not only does Stellaâ€™s Socks provide opportunities for Angelenos to participate in a fun, exciting activity helping the homeless, but we like to think that by engaging with our homeless neighbors we provide them an opportunity to have human connections as well. It is amazing to bridge the gap between our communities (those doing well and those not) because we are all human and we want children to realize that at a young age. Homelessness can happen to anyone and without help these people cannot get back on their feet! Kids need to know there is more to life than social media and burst out of the bubble and their comfort zone (at first) to experience this humbling opportunity!","Our success will be measured in several ways:
1. Our ability to consistently provide new socks to the homeless
Increasing the amount of unique individuals that engage in our monthly sock sessions
2. Continue to develop new sock/clothing partners to procure additional inventory
3. Solidify a scalable, replicable process for distributing 10,000 Socks/month to 25+ organizational partners
",I definitely hope that Stellaâ€™s Socks spreads across the country. I Would like to have Stellaâ€™s Socks in 5 of the major cities battling homelessness. I think this is a very achievable goal.

Maybe we can do the barefoot run we mentioned earlier and get all of the branches together to participate! The possibilities are endless.

Inspiring Angelinos to work together for the greater good of the city and their struggling neighbors living on the streets. The experiences our volunteers, young & old, have had is something we want to expand. We’ve had kids out at 8am on Venice Beach, barely awake and partially upset they have to be up so early on the weekend and by the end of our sock session everyone is laughing, having a great time and interacting with our homeless population, because they often are the ones who get overlooked and sometimes feel invisible. Angelenos of all economic backgrounds need to work together to make our communities thrive and we hope with Stella’s Socks that we can be that bridge.",connect,2018112,https://activation.la2050.org/connect/stellas-socks/stellas-socks.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClzWZnnOiJA,8102112

Our activities will impact health disparities which make diabetes in areas like South LA 25% higher than West LA.","More healthy Angelenos makes LA the best place to live because people empowered to eat well are in an excellent position to take charge of their lives and communities in other ways. 

LA is already esteemed as a health capital, and our initiatives present a great opportunity to spread that culture to people from all ethnicities and socio-economic backgrounds.

A fund for up to 1000 free deliveries for those who demonstrate need.","We will measure our impact using social media metrics, by counting customers and subscriptions, by event engagement, and by counting cases of food. 

We will also collect data, document, and quantify customer reports of eating more produce because of our service, changing their diets, and clearing medical conditions such as obesity while using our service. 

This project validates the viability of healthy and helpful businesses in low income areas and helps create strong wellness-driven presence across disadvantaged areas in LA county. We intend to become brand ambassadors for health empowerment for underserved audiences, creating excitement and new mindsets about eating in the popular discourse.

8102114,8102114,"Surf Bus and partners present: Splash Force LA, a comprehensive guide to beach access and ocean play","Splash Force: The quantum effect of exposure to one droplet of surf stoke, rippling through and transforming LA's legacy of lack of access to swimming pools, ocean play/sports, and ocean education.","""Splash Force LA"" is a multi-level solution to the lack of inner city park space available across Los Angeles.  We seek to energize and mobilize elementary aged students and their immediate and extended families to claim their place at the shore. We use the ocean as a tool of assimilation for immigrant communities, as an expansive and connective force for shifting demographics, as a healthy antidote for stress, and as economic driver toward new job markets.","â€œThe sea, once it casts its spell, holds one in its net of wonder forever.â€ -J. Cousteau

LA is home to over 2.2 million children. We have so much space to play--mountainous wilderness, vast desert/prairie plains, over 200 park & rec. depts., and 57 miles of coastline. Yet, there is a legacy of segregation of swimming pools and ocean spaces in LA that has led to what we term a ""crisis of blue culture."" Our children are not learning how to swim (in 2017 64% of African American children, 45% of Latino children, and 40% of caucasian children cannot swim) and they are not visiting their beaches to play (50% of middle school aged children in LA Co. have never seen the beach). For young Angelenos to realize their full potential, we have to transform our legacy. Like the ocean, we must afford our youth equal opportunity by bridging gaps in access to swim lessons, ocean safety and surf lessons, and a fun and interactive marine science curriculum to buttress their physical experience. We must focus on involving entire families/communities in the solution. We seek to measure the quantum impact of their inclusion and support on the whole of Los Angeles.

Surf Bus and partners have created a multi-level plan to activate 100,000 Angelenos to claim coastal spaces through play. Our program, â€œSplash Force LAâ€ is a collaboration with AltaSea and Los Angeles Maritime Institute.  Together, our focus is on measuring the following three LA2050 metrics: 

1. Number and quality of informal spaces for play: Where do water lovers hang out between sessions, how come, what is happening there? Beach parking lots, pool decks, port hangarsâ€¦
2. Number of parks with intergenerational play opportunities: pools and beaches provide open and creative play opportunities for all generations. Our program integrates entire families into various levels of ""play"" and we have a plan to encourage and measure family involvement.
3. Number of residents with easy access to a â€œvibrantâ€ park: ""Vibrancy"" to us means amount, quality, and creativity of use. Beaches provide tons of open space--both structured and unstructured. Vibrancy is impacted by the ability to travel with ease, the confidence to start the trip, a feeling of support, and a sense of belonging upon arrival.

Our plan combines our reach to achieve the following:

1. Teach 3rd graders (100,000+) in LAUSD how to swim as part of their in-school pe experience. 
2. 40 field trips a school year for elem/middle/high school LAUSD students that include a Surf Bus lesson in Santa Monica, lunch, a visit to AltaSea/Cabrillo Aquarium, and a sail on a LAMI tall ship. 
3. We will host two urban luaus a month at LA Park and Rec facilities to build relationships with families and community.
4. Each partner will host a quarterly â€œohana day:"" visits to the beach/altasea/lami for family/friends.  
5. Perfect attendance earns eligibility for end-of-year trips: 2 voyages to Catalina for 30 people on each ship and/or 1 surf camping trip for 20 groms.","We are experiencing a quantum impact of last summer's county wide LA2050 TOES project. We will follow the lead of this organic wave of continued engagement, fortifying what does work and strengthening areas of perceived challenge: 

-We hosted our first of many planned Urban Luaus in South LA with members from all impacted groups in attendance: volunteers, surf students from 4 of 8 parks, family members, park staff, Surf Academy staff, and community members in proximity at the time of our party.  Attendees were outfitted with Surf Bus tshirts/sweatshirts/hats/pins to help build brand recognition--we want Surf Bus to be synonymous with ""safe ocean family fun.""

-the beach games we taught the kids are played on a daily basis during after-school programming and shared with new friends.

-we've expanded our upcoming summer reach from 8 parks to 16 parks. Lateral job shifts/promotions have moved park coordinators to new areas. We weave these new parks into the program and continue our relationship with past partners. 

-requests by our westside advanced surf students to participate in a volunteer capacity have doubled.

-the City of Santa Monica is helping us develop a swim curriculum for all 3rd graders in Los Angeles.

-our continued collaboration with AltaSea/LAMI is on paper. The kaleidoscope of angles we offer youth to engage with the sea allows each organization to more fully realize our mission to activate LA for the health of residents and our ocean.","1. before and after surveys for the students (beginning/middle/end of school year) that include measures of inspiration, action, learning, and engagement.

2. short answer surveys for the teachers (beginning/middle/end of school year) that question the perceived impact of this programing on their students.

3. repeat attendance by individual students.

4. number of applications for incentive trips (based on attendance and â€œfree willâ€ to apply for the camping trip or the ocean voyage to catalina).

5. staff participant observation journals.

6. daily job site logs with basic info: number of students, timeline adherence, perceived level of interest, actual number of staff and how/what they did on the fieldtrip.

7. urban luau participation and popularity among immediate and extended family and friends.

8. engagement by family and friends with quarterly ""ohana days"" offered by Surf Bus and partners.

9. increased social media engagement and quality of that engagement--do likes and comments turn in to in-person visits
","In five years, we will continue to measure the quantum impact of this initiative on the legacy of blue culture inclusion in Los Angeles and make alterations and course corrections as we are met with challenge and success.  

Surf Bus summer programming will continue to grow--by including more park partners and more beach locations.  We will have supported surf bus students to positions of leadership among their peers, inviting them claim their place in a legacy of a diverse surf line up and supportive inclusion at the beach.

Urban Luaus will be highly anticipated monthly events at LA park and recreation departments in every LA City district.

""Splash Force LA"" high school graduates will seek additional training and/or jobs in the blue economy and feel like every day of work is a day of play.

Surf Bus students will start surf clubs for their schools with regular weekly practices and meet ups at the beach, independent of their weekday field trips and monthly surf bus lesson days.

True to surfing's roots in ""counter culture,"" our surf bus families will start to see any and all open spaces as the possibility for an impromptu playground, similarly to how we ask them to see open ocean space as a wave playground of possibilities. The urban luau format lends itself to ""pop-up"" events that will have an organic feel--based on the unique communities where they occur--and will be used to claim informal open spaces and turn them into into vibrant intergenerational community gatherings. 

Surf Bus, AltaSea, LAMI, and Cabrillo Aquarium will be household names, as recognizable to Angelenos as ""starbucks"" or ""the dodgers.""

A face to face and online program that engages NCs in how this platform helps them efficiently engage with large numbers of constituents and build trust without being overwhelmed.
 ","In 2016 25,571 Angelinos voted in their neighborhood council elections. That's less than 1%.  Nothing will happen.

People see their government as disconnected from them.

People feel progress is stymied by politics and  polarization.

People fear politics on social media is making things worse.

Angelinos - CONNECT in Civil  Pursuit of making your world awesome! 

It seems impossible, it seems like nothing will happen, BUT with new tools for connecting, your participation, and a big LA2050 campaign to welcome everyone, LA is going to be awesome! 

There are new tools for connecting online.  They are not like social media, they are based on time tested best practices of face to face deliberative discussion. 

""Deliberative discussion"" is a structured conversation allowing a group of people to receive and exchange information, to critically examine an issue, and voice their conclusions in a way which will inform decision making. 

These new tools are designed to enable deliberative discussion on line, like a professional facilitator would in person. They make it possible for people, who may disagree, to collaborate in investigation of the issues they confront, to understand the many concerns involved, to be heard and counted, and once in a while to find a new idea that no one had thought of before.  And online, very large numbers of people can participate. 

With everyone CONNECTED and engaging with each other, their neighborhood council, their city council, their state and US representatives, LA is going to be the best place to connect, and it's going to be awesome!

Now a council (or rep.) can hear from constituents their answers to questions like:

""What are the biggest concerns you have for your neighborhood""
or 
""How can we all make our neighborhood an even better community together?""
 
And instead of getting overwhelmed with individual comments, they will receive a prioritized list of answers, as rated by the community, with their most important reasons why and why not, again rated by the community.  And these aren't just the top of mind ""answers"" like from a poll, these are thoughtful answers the community has discussed and reconsidered.

And then the top answers can be turned around into new questions for the community to discuss. Thus the engagement can continue and become a norm.

The community and council will see the numbers, understand the competing viewpoints, and find affinity for those who have them, and 'politics' will evolve into working toward solutions that work for the community as a whole. The polarization will reverse.

This form of problem solving is what face to face deliberative discussion is good at - but it has always been constrained by space, cost and time.  Now, online, we do not have those constraints!

Our metric is voter turn out, and deliberative engagement has been shown to increase that. And with everyone in LA connecting and working together deliberatively, awesome, impossible things - will happen.
","The people in LA are too busy to participate in council meetings.  It's not just the time it takes to get there, arrange a sitter or get off work, it's also the time wasted at the council waiting through the stuff that's not relevant. And all that for 3 minutes to speak! 

With less than 1% turn out, it makes the most sense that: to make the biggest impact you focus on the biggest segment of LA - the busy people!

And we will reach them where they are - on line through social media, and in traffic through signs along their commute, and at home. Specifically we will employ Facebook and Instagram, and test other channels. We will use yard signs, post cards, and organize grass roots door knocking.

And we will monitor participant sign ups and their demographics to learn what works best and dynamically adjust our outreach campaigns to seek representative demographics. 

And after we get them engaged, we will keep them coming back with more topics, and we will invite them to invite their neighbors.
","Our LA2050 metric is to increase Neighborhood Council turnout at the next election by 100,000 people.  So we will look for that in 2019. 

And ... long before that, Angelinos will be able to engage online, in on going discussions with each other, and with their neighborhood council so that when elections come in 2019 voters will know about the neighborhood councils, know their neighbors, and know the impact they can have through their vote for neighborhood council. 

We will count the number of people who sign up in each neighborhood, and their growth rate, and the amount of repeat participation and we will work to keep those numbers growing. 

And this platform isn't just about making things more efficient for constituents, we will also work with neighborhood councils themselves and demonstrate how this helps them and track how many of them are making use of the platform in their council.

And ultimately the success we seek is outcomes. Faster results because more people are engaged up front and support the solution. Better decisions because of broader engagement.  We will be watching for these and reporting on them when they happen.

And this isn't just about NC's. Angelinos will also be simultaneously connected to the same discussions with their State and US representatives and constituencies and we will follow those metrics as well.
","In 5 years we hope to see the majority of Angelinos connecting productively, regularly, with each other, and their neighborhood council, and their city, state and US representatives and making their community and the world awesome!

We also plan to see more communities across California and the US using these tools to engage with each other, and their governments to make our country awesome!

8102116,8102116,Los Angelenos Resilient in the Face of Natural Disasters,"At Team Rubicon, disasters are our business and veterans are our passion. We unite the skills and experience of our nation's military veterans to provide efficient, local, and rapid disaster relief.","The frequency and cost of natural disasters has steadily increased the past 40 years. Los Angelesâ€™ ability to react to the changing nature and magnitude of disasters will impact our community's future. FEMA estimates every $1 invested in disaster preparedness saves an average of $4 in future losses, protecting at-risk populations and fostering resiliency. Team Rubicon's Resilient Cities Initiative will build volunteer capacity, training and equipping Los Angelenos to respond to local disasters.","Team Rubicon utilizes technology to effectively provide relief to the most vulnerable populations during a disaster. A recent review of studies on the relationship between poverty and disasters in the U.S. by Fothergill & Peek revealed that socio-economic status is a significant predictor of the physical and psychological impacts in the pre- and post- disaster stages. Using a platform developed by Palantir, Team Rubicon maps neighborhoods that are most vulnerable from a socio-economic standpoint by overlaying tax records, insurance information, and census data. In many cases these communities lack the tax-base to provide professional, community based disaster services, or are overshadowed by wealthier areas impacted by the same disaster. Within urban areas, Team Rubiconâ€™s focus is often on communities of color and non-native English speakers. These communities are disproportionately impacted by disasters, lack the personal or community-based resources to fend for themselves, and cannot agitate for government support as effectively as their affluent neighbors. 

Team Rubiconâ€™s Resilient City Initiative will create greater volunteer density in Los Angeles, training local residents to provide disaster relief. Our initiative tackles three pressing issues: Los Angeles' preparedness for and ability to respond to disasters; the challenges of veterans reintegrating into our communities; and the lack of civic engagement in local communities today. The recently released Veterans Civic Health Index reveals veterans consistently outperform civilians in volunteer hours contributed and are more apt to work with neighbors to fix community problems. 

Leveraging the power of the militaryâ€™s diversity can help our country and city heal and respond in new (yet proven) ways, bringing a new sense of social cohesion to Los Angeles. The military is one of the most diverse institutions on the planet today. However, most veterans return to their less-diverse origins upon discharge and the value of inclusion and understanding dissipates over time. Yet, if inspired to come together once again in service, engaging and empowering veterans builds bridges across the divides that are tearing at the fabric of our country. 

Team Rubicon believes that Los Angeles County's veterans can and should be a force of change to help those most vulnerable. According to the USC School of Social Work: Los Angeles County Veterans Study, California is home to over 1.8 million former service members, with approximately 12,000 military veterans settling in Los Angeles County every year, joining the 325,000 veterans who currently reside here. One in five veterans suffer from post-traumatic stress and over two-thirds report difficulties adjusting to civilian life. Team Rubicon seeks to merge veteransâ€™ military identity with civilian life by establishing a community network of volunteers supporting communities affected by disaster in Southern California.","Team Rubicon aims to increase civic engagement in Los Angeles. 

Team Rubicon developed a training pipeline to guarantee professionalism, consistency, and safety on operations by training to nationally developed standards. 

In order to maximize effectiveness in disaster response, Team Rubicon regularly engages and trains our volunteers in between disasters. Engagement is any activity planned and executed by Team Rubicon personnel that convenes volunteers for an activity. Team Rubicon has recovery and mitigation operations, as well as robust training initiatives to prepare our volunteers through continued engagement. In addition to trainings, Team Rubicon offers a variety of volunteer-led regional and local engagements that are specifically designed to increase the quality, quantity, and frequency of volunteer interactions.

Maintaining safety and providing quality training and engagement for our members is a top priority. Our Field Operations Team, which is comprised of Response, Membership, and Training, does a phenomenal job on the ground when disasters strike and in the time between deployments to train, engage, and coordinate interaction with volunteers from signing up to deploying. 

Team Rubicon utilizes a number of cloud-based technologies to achieve our stated mission. The organizationâ€™s growth is based on the continual evolution of the needs of our volunteer base and the communities we serve.","Team Rubicon understands the value of collecting both qualitative and quantitative data when conveying the impact of our programs on the community. We measure our impact two ways: impact we have on the communities experiencing a disaster and impact on the lives of our volunteer members. Metrics we regularly track include number of training competitions, training events, deployments, volunteers deployed, days deployed, hours logged, damage assessments conducted, and work orders completed.

Team Rubicon will measure Los Angeles' community resiliency by number of trained volunteers in the area. To best measure resiliency in Los Angeles, Team Rubicon developed the concept of â€œCommunity Resilience Unitsâ€ (CRUs). Community Resilience Units contribute to Team Rubicon's goal to recruit, organize, equip, and train veteran-led relief teams who will respond, in coordination with emergency officials, to natural disasters that strike Southern California. Another goal of building volunteer capacity in the Los Angeles area is to better integrate returning military veterans with their families in Los Angeles, empowering them through their volunteerism. 

In addition to saving lives and property, investing in resilience and readiness helps families, communities, and local economies recover faster in comparison to cities that are under-prepared.","Team Rubicon strives to recruit and train thousands of new volunteers in Los Angeles and throughout the country. By focusing on localized preparedness, we hope to build more resilient communities that will be prepared for disasters whenever they strike. Team Rubicon's ultimate goals are to empower volunteers to responsibly and cost-effectively respond to disasters, serve vulnerable communities affected by disasters, and create a more resilient Los Angeles.","[""Number of households below the self-sufficiency standard"",""Rates of mental illness"",""Resilient communities""]","Team Rubicon utilizes technology to effectively provide relief to the most vulnerable populations during a disaster. A recent review of studies on the relationship between poverty and disasters in the U.S. by Fothergill & Peek revealed that socio-economic status is a significant predictor of the physical and psychological impacts in the pre- and post- disaster stages. Using a platform developed by Palantir, Team Rubicon maps neighborhoods that are most vulnerable from a socio-economic standpoint by overlaying tax records, insurance information, and census data. In many cases these communities lack the tax-base to provide professional, community based disaster services, or are overshadowed by wealthier areas impacted by the same disaster. Within urban areas, Team Rubicon’s focus is often on communities of color and non-native English speakers. These communities are disproportionately impacted by disasters, lack the personal or community-based resources to fend for themselves, and cannot agitate for government support as effectively as their affluent neighbors. 
 
 
 
 Team Rubicon’s Resilient City Initiative will create greater volunteer density in Los Angeles, training local residents to provide disaster relief. Our initiative tackles three pressing issues: Los Angeles' preparedness for and ability to respond to disasters; the challenges of veterans reintegrating into our communities; and the lack of civic engagement in local communities today. The recently released Veterans Civic Health Index reveals veterans consistently outperform civilians in volunteer hours contributed and are more apt to work with neighbors to fix community problems. 
 
 
 
 Leveraging the power of the military’s diversity can help our country and city heal and respond in new (yet proven) ways, bringing a new sense of social cohesion to Los Angeles. The military is one of the most diverse institutions on the planet today. However, most veterans return to their less-diverse origins upon discharge and the value of inclusion and understanding dissipates over time. Yet, if inspired to come together once again in service, engaging and empowering veterans builds bridges across the divides that are tearing at the fabric of our country. 
 
 
 
 Team Rubicon believes that Los Angeles County's veterans can and should be a force of change to help those most vulnerable. According to the USC School of Social Work: Los Angeles County Veterans Study, California is home to over 1.8 million former service members, with approximately 12,000 military veterans settling in Los Angeles County every year, joining the 325,000 veterans who currently reside here. One in five veterans suffer from post-traumatic stress and over two-thirds report difficulties adjusting to civilian life.

8102117,8102117,Inspiring Community Action to End Gun Violence in L.A. by Stopping â€œBad Appleâ€ Gun Dealers,The Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence will educate and empower Los Angelenos to take meaningful action to stem the flow of crime guns and end gun violence in the community. ,"Gun violence is a serious threat to Los Angelenos, and most agree that keeping guns from those who would use them to do harm is a critical step in ending gun deaths. One way that dangerous people acquire guns is through â€œbad appleâ€ gun dealers â€“ the 5 percent of dealers that sell 90 percent of all crime guns. Through our campaign, Brady engages communities to take meaningful action in the fight to stem the flow of crime guns by shutting down or reforming â€œbad appleâ€ gun dealers. ","Bradyâ€™s strategic campaign to stop â€œbad appleâ€ gun dealers engages local residents, local Brady chapter members, and community-based organizations to take meaningful action to end gun violence in Los Angeles. 

Chronic gun violence has a devastating impact on community health. There were 470 gun homicides in Los Angeles County over the past 12 months, according to the Los Angeles Times. Such tragedies are often the result of guns getting into the hands of people who should not have them, such as gun traffickers, convicted felons, domestic abusers, and people with a dangerous mental illness. Though these prohibited purchasers are not able to pass a Brady background check as required by law at federally licensed firearm dealers, they may obtain guns through â€œbad appleâ€ gun dealers. These gun dealers knowingly ignore the law and engage in irresponsible business practices just to make a profit. The most recent Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) data shows that nationally, 90 percent of crime guns are sold by only 5 percent of gun dealers. These â€œbad applesâ€ supply nearly the entire U.S. criminal gun market. 

While California has some of the strongest gun laws in the U.S., the safety of Californians is dramatically compromised by the impact of â€œbad appleâ€ gun dealers. Most California crime guns come from â€œbad appleâ€ dealers in-state. Out of the 39,034 crime guns recovered in California in 2016, for which the source was identified, 67 percent were traced to California dealers. 

â€œBad appleâ€ gun dealers facilitate the flow of crime guns into vulnerable communities. These dealers knowingly or negligently skirt the law and endanger communities. For example, they may allow someone to â€œstraw purchaseâ€ a gun on behalf of another person, typically someone who cannot pass a Brady background check. Or they may sell dozens or hundreds of the same type of gun to the same person in a short time. These purchasers are often trafficking guns to criminals. â€œBad appleâ€ gun dealers may also sell guns â€œoff the booksâ€ that they then claim were lost or stolen. These purchasers are often people who could not pass a Brady background check or do not want a record of the sale. 

We take a city-based, supply-side approach in stemming the flow of crime guns into vulnerable Los Angeles communities by reforming or shutting down the â€œbad appleâ€ gun dealers who knowingly or negligently sell guns to prohibited purchasers. Brady convenes and coordinates a wide array of partners including law enforcement, the legal community, researchers, the media, and community-based organizations to: 1) identify and name â€œbad appleâ€ gun dealers, 2) wage public, legal, and economic pressure to shut down or reform â€œbad appleâ€ gun dealers, and 3) encourage sensible practices by responsible gun dealers.

Ultimately this work will reduce gun violence and increase public safety by reducing access to guns by those who would use them in crime. ","Bradyâ€™s campaign to stop â€œbad appleâ€ gun dealers leverages our unique expertise in community engagement, advocacy, media, and legal action to create awareness and intense public scrutiny of â€œbad appleâ€ gun dealers; increase public and economic pressure for them to reform; advance policy changes at the local, state, and national levels to force them to shut down or reform; and bring impactful litigation against â€œbad applesâ€ to force change.

There are three primary activities related to our work to stop â€œbad appleâ€ gun dealers: 
1)	Identify and publicly name the â€œbad applesâ€ through a crime gun trace report or by collaborating with local stakeholders â€“ including law enforcement, crime labs, and community members; 
2)	Build a local coalition to wage public, legal, and economic pressure to shut down or reform â€œbad appleâ€ gun dealers; and
3)	Encourage sensible practices by responsible gun dealers.

The engagement of Angelenos is essential to the success of this work. With a local community organizer with deep ties to the Los Angeles community, we will recruit and empower a cadre of local community activists to wage public pressure against â€œbad appleâ€ gun dealers in their communities through protests, boycotts, and public education and awareness raising events. We are particularly enthusiastic about engaging local youth activists in this work, and we will prioritize community outreach in neighborhoods most heavily impacted by gun violence, including neighborhoods in South L.A. ","Ultimately, we want to save lives. This focus on the supply side of crime guns will reduce gun crime in Los Angeles. It will, however, take time to see the reduction in the supply of crime guns translate into lives saved. In the first two years of the project, we will define and measure success through:  

1.Identifying the gun dealers that disproportionately supply guns to criminals. 

2.Increasing community awareness of the disproportionate effect of BAGDs. The number of community meetings, church programs, youth awareness events, and programs at local community colleges/universities will be measured, as will number of participants.  

3.Increasing legal action against â€œbad appleâ€ gun dealers to hold them accountable and force change. This includes convening discussions with local prosecutors about criminal prosecutions of illegal gun purchases as well as bringing civil lawsuits. 

In years one and two, we will collect baseline data to help us measure these outcomes. In years three through five, we will engage an external researcher to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the activities and outcomes of the city-focused intervention and assess the effectiveness the program.","The Brady Center aims to launch a community-driven campaign to stop â€œbad appleâ€ gun dealers in Los Angeles, throughout California, and across the U.S. The five-year state-wide goals of this campaign are to:

â€¢ Identify California â€œbad appleâ€ gun dealers through greater collection, publication and sharing of crime trace data and other key investigative information; 

â€¢ Shut down or meaningfully reform at least 10 of the â€œbad appleâ€ gun dealers affecting California; and 

â€¢ Reduce gun crime by at least 20% in three California cities.

Through our work in Los Angeles and throughout California, our goal is to build a model for city-based implementation that is scalable to other cities disproportionally affected by gun violence. In five years, it is our aim that Los Angeles and the Bay Area will have measurably reduced gun violence and can serve as models for other cities. Ultimately, we aim to stem the flow of crime guns into vulnerable communities across the U.S. to reduce gun violence and save lives.

8102118,8102118,The Burg: LA's Community Platform,"The Burg is the community's platform, a digital public square that funnels local news and local representatives directly to the verified voters (and nonvoters) of Los Angeles.","We envision people using The Burg as the interactive, online home for their community. There is one common ground all people have: we care about where we live- even those who arenâ€™t necessarily â€œengaged.â€ Nobody wants to reside in an uninformed, underserved, & neglected area. People do care about their community, they just donâ€™t have the access or know-how to address issues or get involved.We have so many great spaces to cultivate online communities, but no online space for our actual community ","The Burg is the community's platform, a digital public square that funnels local representatives and local news directly to verified voters. By building a Burg for each district and hosting unique features such as online town halls, we're lowering the barriers to give people access to the city of LA in a brand new way, and it is out now for iOS and Android. Download links on our website! 

We operate on 3 pillars: 1. Connect the community 2. Properly inform the community 3. Make it easier for representatives to actually represent the community.

1. We have built our own voter verification infrastructure working with the CA Sec. of Stateâ€™s office that verifies voters and places them in their correct city or city council district (depending on the size of the city). All we need is a userâ€™s name and birthdate, and we can cross reference to check their voter status and place them within their city/district. Verified voters are given unique access and an â€œI Voteâ€ sticker that acts as a badge that indicates their status in the community (slightly similar to a Twitter checkmark).

2. As Pew Research Group and Mark Zuckerberg have stressed, local news is directly correlated with local civic engagement. If we can better inform communities with relevant local news, they will be more likely to civically engage. Our answer: we pick up RSS Feeds of Local Newsrooms (e.g. here in LA we use the local section of the LA Times and Daily News, Curbed.LA, etc.) and streamline them to Burgs across the city. We optimize this for every Burg depending on their area. 

3. Local Representatives now have a never before seen direct tap into the pulse of their community, and not just to a data file but real access to their constituents. They can interact with verified voters directly in real-time and can host Online Town Halls (combo of a Reddit AMA/Quora Session) where voters can submit and upvote questions in a democratic system for reps to answer. 

We started The Burg is because of the clear need and the widespread lack of technology and innovation in this space. Simply put, there is no purpose driven platform that solves this problem. 
","Local is our bread and butter, and weâ€™re launching exclusively in LA County so we can focus our resources and connections in this area. Our goal is to get the layperson back involved into their communities, and as a result, local politics. A key feature we have implemented is having RSS feeds refresh daily to provide the latest local news specific to each area, so there will be content even in the beginning. 

We have a 3 pronged approach to get users. 1. We have a community organizer onboard whoâ€™s total focus is on working with advocacy/community groups in the greater LA area, and demonstrating The Burg as a tool that can catalyze their missions. We have already partnered with Rock the Vote, Represent.US, City Fabrick, & Hacker Fund, among others, and begun organizing the specifics of how we can onboard their audiences. In addition, speaking at community meetings and getting in front of the people will be huge to earn the trust of community organizers across the city and build out our network. 2. We have a long list of reps in the LA area that have become supporters of ours because of the Conference of Mayors and our public speaking. We will onboard them and have them launch Town Halls on The Burg. This is a â€˜stickyâ€™ feature and we already have a commit from the Mayor of Long Beach to host and invite his 80k listserv. 3. We will have constant content marketing that documents the latest from The Burg, including blogs, social media & podcasts to show real change is happening.
","Speaking broadly, we will consider The Burg a success if we can inspire a renewed interest and engagement in local politics, local news, and community engagement. A flourishing city is made up of informed and engaged citizens; however, civic engagement at the local level is at an all-time low. In the â€˜60s turnout for a municipal election in Los Angeles was at 76%, compared with sub 20% last election. Our major goal is to have local turnout reverse its recent downward trend, and get people interested and informed about their city and state elections. We used to civically engage on a very local level, and it is our mission to do it again.  

The LA area is one of the most economically and ethnically diverse places in the United States. Currently, those engaging in local politics and local issues are predominately the older, whiter, wealthier demographics. Our goal is to improve community engagement by targeting the populations that havenâ€™t traditionally engaged with local issues, specifically millennials and the 27-45-year-olds from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. We see The Burg as the new online space for communities as different as Historic South Central and the Westside. For the first time an people will be connected Affordable housing project that their city councilman pushes through, will connect with that neighbor is looking to collaborate for a yard sale that runs down the whole block, and will finally get to know who the heck represents them. 
","In five years, we hope The Burg will be online home for their community. There is one common ground all people have: we care about where we live-- even those who arenâ€™t necessarily â€œengaged.â€ Nobody wants to reside in an uninformed, underserved, and neglected area. People do care about their community, they just donâ€™t have the access or know-how to address issues or get involved.

Our organization's mission is to make it easier for citizens to engage with each other and with
their local government. In five years we believe The Burg will help inspire a community renaissance and serve as the interactive Front Page of your city. We believe that if The Burg succeeds, we will see signs of higher civic engagement across the board, including voter turnout, community participation, volunteerism, trust in local government, etc. Additionally, we believe The Burg will be the home of political/opinion polling ushering in a new era of responsive government and more accurate measure of public opinion. Down the line, we see local elections being hosted on The Burg given that many local level many governments are already experimenting with online voting.

Pedestrians (footed, wheeled and otherwise) are woefully neglected by mapping apps. Until now.

Using OpenSidewalk data schema, The Glue will develop an app for LA residents to crowd source the location and condition of sidewalks. With enough data, we will help users plan a trip that produces the best way forward for pedestrians of all types.","Using a schema called OpenSidewalk in partnership with The University of Washingtonâ€™s Taskar Center for Accessible Technology, The Glue proposes developing an app for LA residents to crowdsource data on the location and condition of sidewalks during â€œmapathonâ€ events as well as every day. This data will include accessibility concerns (width, incline, barriers, etc), general attributes (cleanliness, potholes, weeds, etc) as well as add local-specific attributes, shade hours for example. With enough data, we can help users plan a trip that produces the best way forward for pedestrians of all types.

We currently have a proprietary interactive prototype that we will use to build out into a fully functional initial app. In collaboration with the University of Washington we will establish a baseline pedestrian network, and then invite participants to validate and adjust individual areas. Functionality will include GPS tracking of data including barriers, incline, curbs, lighting, ramps, tactile paving, wheelchair access, amenities such as water fountains, benches, shelter, toilets and others. Additionally, we may implement camera width measurement and exact incline measurement by gyroscope. 

Using this initial product, after thorough testing, we will design and hold â€˜mapathonâ€™ events centered around high density transit areas to gather data in initial large bursts. Using those learnings, we will refine the app if needed, as well as our incentivisation approach, and hold more mapathon events, as well as release the app for use in peopleâ€™s everyday lives. 

The data we generate will serve two important purposes. It will allow citizens to plan the best routes, end to end. It will also allow us to collect open-source information to add to LAâ€™s on the condition of pedestrian access in and around the most dense and trafficked transit areas. This will help both public and private organizations to prioritize issues that may keep citizens from walking and using transit to its fullest. 

The end result will have benefits that tie directly to improving LAâ€™s walk, bike and transit score. If physical access to transit is easier to understand, as well as in better repair, that will increase transit use and ridership. Allowing citizens to find the most accessible route for them, especially for those in wheelchairs, with limited mobility, or simply pushing a stroller will enhance overall safety, making people feel better about getting outside and enjoying Los Angeles. Finally, simply the knowledge that â€œsomeone is listeningâ€ when citizens report problems goes a long way to instill faith and trust in civic organizations. These all contribute to our shared goal of a more livable and sustainable city.

Our prototype: https://invis.io/F2C8XR4HW#/239912225_Load","For all of us who have walked around LA, itâ€™s impossible not to notice the poor condition of our sidewalks. From buckled concrete, to lack of shade, to missing curb cuts to whole neighborhoods that donâ€™t even have sidewalks, weâ€™ve surrendered transportation to motorized vehicles. It is simply unpleasant to walk in many of LAâ€™s neighborhoods. This steers people away from healthy walking lifestyles, as well as away from using transit because getting to the bus or rail station is difficult or unpleasant.

Multiply the above by ten for those with disabilities, older residents and people pushing strollers. They know that a buckled sidewalk can be anything from an inconvenience to a major catastrophe. And often these are the people who need our sidewalks the most. 

In order for Eyes on the Street to gather good data, we need people to use the app! Once EotS is built, we hope LA2050 can help us encourage use of the app through Mapathon events, incentives and publicity. We want to reach out to a breadth of communities to gather data on their neighborhoods, especially those in â€œHigh Injury Networks.â€ Those areas often need the most infrastructure investment and the first step is understanding the current state of the sidewalks. Where The Glue brings the design and technical chops, we hope to partner with LA2050â€™s extensive community outreach and strategic partnerships to populate data.","Upon launch of the app we will choose five Los Angeles neighborhoods to hold Mapathon events, where we collect a lot of data together, and have fun doing it. Anyone with a smartphone will be able to download the app and get mapping, but itâ€™s more effective if a large group targets particular neighborhoods.

Hereâ€™s a possible set of five. These locations are based on cross-referencing High Injury Network Spotlight Streets with Metro ridership data:

Koreatown: along Red Line and near MacArthur Park and Safe Routes to School designated areas
Highland Park: along Figueroa
Downtown LA: Historic Core, Jewelry District, Little Tokyo
South LA: alongI Main and Avalon and Safe Routes to School designated areas

Success will be achieved if we have collected enough data on these initial five neighborhoods to map safe pedestrian routes for each neighborhood.","In five years we hope our app is ubiquitous in gathering info for LA sidewalks, and mapping the best walking route is as easy as mapping a route by car. We'd like to also deploy the app for cities all over the US, and even the world, to help create a truly global way to way-find while walking.

By making it easier for any Angelino to locally sell their craft, we aspire to formulate a strong regional economy where millions of people in Los Angeles can have access to and support locally made products.","Creators in Los Angeles have never struggled in being creative. However, it has become increasingly hard for creators to derive wealth out of their creative value.

There are many barriers for creators to economically succeed, especially creators from underprivileged communities. These barriers include financial resources, experience, business resources, marketing apparatuses, connections, and the increasing challenge of oligopolies monopolizing every industry.

Creators find it difficult to sell the things they create, because there are startup costs, and it takes infrastructure. Generally one needs to have a facility, which means high rents, and this does not favor well for small businesses or non high earners looking to economically move up. It is increasingly hard for these mom and pop shops to compete with big businesses as well.

Natch wants to remove many of these barriers by making the business industry more accessible for creators. Supporting local businesses is currently hard for both shoppers and sellers. By creating our online marketplace we create a network of local businesses, where shoppers can more easily find and receive locally made products. So we make it easier for these creators to market their products. But we also make it easier and cheaper for them to deliver their products too. By handling the fulfillment and delivery, sellers do not need to rent out retail space, nor hire expensive drivers to transport their goods. They also do not need to worry about developing their own website and driving traffic. We simplify many of the difficulties behind creators starting their own business, and we make it cheaper. 

By enabling sellers to sell directly to consumers we also ensure that they receive the financial value from most of what they produce. By removing middle men when it comes to manufacturing, distribution, and retail, the creator can once again become an owner of what they produce.

Natch believes that by empowering creators, and giving anybody in LA a chance to compete with bigger businesses, local spending will be channeled away from the hands of bigger corporations and directly into the hands of the people in the city.

This engages LA in multiple ways. It helps spread wealth across the city. It helps empower diverse communities of creators to play a part in the everyday lives of all Angelinos. And it gives access to people around Los Angeles to the different things creators produce. We aim to improve the quality of life for Angelinos by giving them the opportunity to connect directly with other Angelinos through the food they create. ","Historically, economically underprivileged communities have been left out of the entrepreneurship ecosystem. As bigger companies began to consolidate, it became increasingly difficult for small businesses to compete and many were wiped out. 

We aim to regrow the small business ecosystem, by giving local individuals a mechanism to compete. We are giving individuals a way to sell the products they make, and we are making it easier and cheaper for them to sell and deliver those products. In this new internet age, this will make small businesses competitive once again.

By running our app across LA, we give a chance for locals in communities of all economic backgrounds to engage in the entrepreneurship movement. So far not a lot of tech has emerged that has created economic opportunities for diverse communities. With Natch, starting your own business will be more accessible, and these business will get more visibility as opposed to traditional brick and mortars which are limited by geographic barriers. Also by delivering these products, we give access to Angelinos from across the city to a diverse range of healthy and locally made goods. 

The aim is create an economic environment where most of our money is spent locally and goes directly to the creators. By diverting our spending from big to small businesses, we might be able to have an impact on income inequality.","2 metrics: how many shops have been created in our marketplace, and how many local monthly shoppers there are. 

We aim to have over 1000 Angelinos running a shop to sell their products on our app within 2 years. We also aim to have 50,000 local shoppers within that time.","We hope that thousands of Angelinos have started their own business on Natch. We also aspire to have these sellers become a pivotal fragment of the food industry, and hope that these local products can secure a large share of the food market where millions of Angelinos can be engaged in the local food shopping economy.

By moving local spending into the hands of smaller business, we hope that can make an impact on local wealth inequality.","[""Employment in the creative industries"",""Jobs per capita"",""Minority- and women-owned firms""]","Creators in Los Angeles have never struggled in being creative.

We are currently making great strides in the past three years,we are now also aiming to activate more community residents to help inspire our HIP Through Science Kids to purse STEM jobs.","HIP Through Science will make LA the best place to learn by bringing relatable, fun, science programs to youth in Watts, Compton, and South Los Angeles.  Partnerships with local parks, housing projects, and auxiliary school programs allows the lab to travel to where the students are. Tapping into a network of local tech companies, entrepreneurs, engineers allows HIP Through Science to bring culturally relevant curriculum and connections to youth who would otherwise not have these opportunities. Youth in the HIP Through Science program are able to participate in year-round learning courses that expose them to [CA education standard] based projects. The lab increases exposure to STEM careers, provides one-on-one learning opportunities, and inspires the next generation of STEM leaders to grow in their local communities. The program provides an opportunity for local youth to start STEM learning in Kindergarten and stay with the program through high school at no cost and no travel obligation. Activities like the HIP Through Science, bowling fundraisers, the Annual HIP Through Science Fair, and Our Annual Galas are additional opportunities for community members, youth, to participate in the development of the HIP Through Science Program. HIP Through Science Kids interact with honor students, local leaders, and their peers outside of an academic setting. By doing these action items we are immersing students in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math content. We are encouraging matriculation in to college and we are also hoping to improve proficiency in English and Language Arts and Math. ","HIP Through Science will engage Angelenos to make LA the best place to learn by continuing to create STEM education platforms such as our Weekly HIP Through Science Sessions, our Annual HIP Through Science Fair, and partnering with local agencies at community health events. In South LA we will continue to bring quality learning to students in a relatable way. The population of students in grades K-8 lacks sufficient STEM education resources and educational programs. Our weekly HIP Through Science lessons generally revolve around a theme for the month, for example Robotics. We then have a 30 minute lecture on the subject which may include written assignments and/or reading materials, helping develop literacy skills and word association. Following the lecture is a fun, interactive experiment thatâ€™s memorable and appeals to students who are more hands-on learners. 
Our annual HIP Through Science Fair has been growing the last 2 years and were heading into our 3rd, which will surpass the two previous in terms of participation and community support. The Science fair in South LA, particularly Watts community allows students the platform to be recognized for their academic ability in the STEM field. We've have had projects such as creating  plasma, breaking down the chemical reaction of a smoke bomb, air propulsion devices and alternative energy methods. This event showcases children with a passion for science and those who witness an opportunity to be engaged and gain interest.  
","The measures of our success will be quantified through a variety of methods. We will have quarterly quizzes that will be assigned and given out to each site to find out what educational points need to be improved on. We will track the improvements and our goal will be to have each child improve test scores and be STEM ready to meet state-wide testing requirements. HIP Through Science surveys will be given out also quarterly to determine and measure the interest gained while attending sessions. Information will be provided on such topics as what are the STEM field careers that they are familiar with before and after, what type of STEM careers relate to what they would like to do in life. Our Annual HIP Through Science Fair has been gaining more interest and more participants; we have doubled our number of participants and community attendance since our first. We will continue to measure the attendance of our future science fairs. Our success will also be measured by our youthsâ€™ willingness to participate in sessions and having the confidence to read in front of other peers in each session. ","In five years I would hope that this activation is able to inspire children from inner cities to pursue STEM careers. We hope to eventually expand this program from city-wide to county-wide, to serve and inspire more youth to chase their dreams in STEM fields.","[""College matriculation rates"",""District-wide graduation rates"",""Students’ immersion in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math content""]","HIP Through Science will make LA the best place to learn by bringing relatable, fun, science programs to youth in Watts, Compton, and South Los Angeles.

","The Trust for Public Land, along with the Los Angeles Neighborhood Land Trust and Community Nature Connection, will host a participatory park access and equity event that includes a large-scale play day galvanizing Angelenos to get out and enjoy parks and open spaces. Play LA! combines community organizing, participatory workshops, and interactive play to raise awareness of the importance of equitable access to parks and open space. Collectively we will create a Play! Vision for LA County.","Play LA! is a three-day participatory event focused on activating LA County residents of all races, incomes, and neighborhoods to play and be engaged and informed in advancing LAâ€™s park equity issues. Without addressing our park and open space inequities, we cannot make LA the best place to play by 2050.

The first two days of the event will bring together between 500-700 community residents, designers, educators, innovators and policy-makers representing a range of multi-disciplinary issue areas including parks and open space, health, housing, transportation, and design to create a Play! Vision for LA County that ensures everyone has access to free and safe places to play by 2050. The event will conclude with a county-wide play day that includes opportunities for residents from around the region to get outside and play in our parks, streets and open spaces! 

The event will start with a Park Equity Summit led by community members highlighting the racial and environmental injustices that have led to LAâ€™s inequitable park access. Inequalities in the allocation of park and recreation resources will be shared through the perspectives of community leadersâ€™ lived experiences. Elected officials, CBOs, academics, and school districts, including LAUSD and agency staff, will be on hand to hear community members outline problems and define solutions for park equity. Day one will conclude with a community vision for a healthy and equitable LA County and offer ideas to inform discussions on day two.

The second day of workshop sessions will engage leaders from cities around the globe in participatory conversations with local stakeholders. These sessions will draw on successful park equity solutions, with participants working across sectors, backgrounds, and experience to generate new solutions to advance park equity and help inform the conversation and shape best practices for LA County. Participants in these sessions will be accountable to community-identified problems developed in day one. 

The final day of the event is a countywide celebration of the power of play, including hundreds of play-based events throughout greater LA County. The three lead partners will work with agencies, institutions, businesses, and CBOs to inspire and organize play-based events in parks and public spaces around the region, transforming greater LA into a veritable playground. Residents will be welcomed and encouraged to participate in guided activities in local parks, and will experience the reimagination of public spaces into vibrant and safe informal spaces for play (street closures, sidewalk events, activities in plazas, etc.). Park access will be highlighted throughout the day as our team arranges and encourages alternate modes of transportation, including transit to trails programs that provide free transportation from park poor areas to open spaces.","The three-day event will engage community members (primarily those living in historically underserved and park poor communities), nonprofit partners, academics, policymakers, and agency staff on park equity issues, as well as their intersection with other equity issues, including housing, transit, and food access. Outreach for the event will be conducted primarily through direct community organizing within the park-poor communities where our organizations are working as well as a social media campaign. The social media campaign will include direct e-blast invitations to potential participants around the county. We anticipate between 500-700 participants over the first two days of the event and 100,000 participants in the play event on the third day.

Engagement for the play day will include social media and flyers, as well as yard signs in neighborhoods throughout the county. We will leverage LA2050â€™s financial and marketing support to recruit and team up with numerous stakeholders, including city and county park agencies, universities, businesses, and other CBOs to host hundreds of community focused events. Additionally, each partner organization will tap our respective social media networks. We will create event specific hashtags and encourage check-ins at each event to track headcount. Residents will have the chance to carry the movement forward, pledging their commitment to play regularly through a dedicated #PlayLAEveryday social media campaign.","There are several ways we plan to define and measure success. The focus of the three-day event is to raise awareness of the critical role that parks and the built environment play in the health of communities in LA County. A key goal of the event is to increase local capacity of agency and CBO stakeholders working in LA County to understand and advance park equity by bringing them together along with key urban design and equity leaders. We expect the policy and design workshop to be a critical step in creating a shared vision and expanding on innovative ways policy and design can shape how we play in LA by 2050.

Success for the three-day Play LA! event will be determined by:
â€¢	Number of community members who participate in the Park Equity Summit 
â€¢	Number of partners involved in the policy and design workshop 
â€¢	Shared understanding of the problem and policy solutions as demonstrated by the 2050 Play! Vision for LA County developed as part of the Equity Summit and policy and design workshop
â€¢	Identification of critical policy elements to be included in both LA City and LA County planning efforts, including those currently being developed in the LA County Sustainability Plan
â€¢	Number of community-focused events during Play LA!
â€¢	Number of partners hosting events during Play LA!
â€¢	Number of participants in the county-wide day of play
â€¢	Buy-in from cities and agencies as demonstrated by their participation and sponsorship of events within their communities","Over 50% of residents in LA County donâ€™t have a park or open space within a 10-minute walk of home. Without an adequate investment in parks, many of our residents go without access to any green or recreation spaces, particularly in high-density low-income communities and communities of color. We envision a Los Angeles where all residents have high quality, clean, safe, and sustainable parks and open spaces within a ten minute walk of where they live. Play LA! is about building a sense of activism and solidarity as well as awareness of the importance of park access. More than that, itâ€™s about getting outside, being together with your fellow Angelenos, and having fun! Through this LA2050 opportunity, we intend to harness the power of the community, stakeholders, and thought leaders to help push an interdisciplinary approach to advocacy, policy and design. The Play LA! team hopes it will become an annual event supported in future years by businesses, schools, CBOs and others to celebrate LA by getting outside.","[""Access to open space and park facilities"",""Number (and quality) of informal spaces for play"",""Number of residents with easy access to a “vibrant” park""]","Play LA! is a three-day participatory event focused on activating LA County residents of all races, incomes, and neighborhoods to play and be engaged and informed in advancing LA’s park equity issues. Without addressing our park and open space inequities, we cannot make LA the best place to play by 2050.
 
 
 
 The first two days of the event will bring together between 500-700 community residents, designers, educators, innovators and policy-makers representing a range of multi-disciplinary issue areas including parks and open space, health, housing, transportation, and design to create a Play! Vision for LA County that ensures everyone has access to free and safe places to play by 2050. The event will conclude with a county-wide play day that includes opportunities for residents from around the region to get outside and play in our parks, streets and open spaces! 
 
 
 
 The event will start with a Park Equity Summit led by community members highlighting the racial and environmental injustices that have led to LA’s inequitable park access. Inequalities in the allocation of park and recreation resources will be shared through the perspectives of community leaders’ lived experiences. Elected officials, CBOs, academics, and school districts, including LAUSD and agency staff, will be on hand to hear community members outline problems and define solutions for park equity. Day one will conclude with a community vision for a healthy and equitable LA County and offer ideas to inform discussions on day two.
 
 
 
 The second day of workshop sessions will engage leaders from cities around the globe in participatory conversations with local stakeholders. These sessions will draw on successful park equity solutions, with participants working across sectors, backgrounds, and experience to generate new solutions to advance park equity and help inform the conversation and shape best practices for LA County. Participants in these sessions will be accountable to community-identified problems developed in day one. 
 
 
 
 The final day of the event is a countywide celebration of the power of play, including hundreds of play-based events throughout greater LA County. The three lead partners will work with agencies, institutions, businesses, and CBOs to inspire and organize play-based events in parks and public spaces around the region, transforming greater LA into a veritable playground. Residents will be welcomed and encouraged to participate in guided activities in local parks, and will experience the reimagination of public spaces into vibrant and safe informal spaces for play (street closures, sidewalk events, activities in plazas, etc.). Park access will be highlighted throughout the day as our team arranges and encourages alternate modes of transportation, including transit to trails programs that provide free transportation from park poor areas to open spaces.",create,2018123,https://activation.la2050.org/play/the-trust-for-public-land/the-trust-for-public-land.jpg,0,8102123

For three hours, twice a week, student-senior pairs play games, participate in artistic activities, and deliver the research-backed Brain Boot Camp to help address cognitive decline. If our program reaches 17% of Angelenos with dementia and allows them to age at home for just two more months, we will save the healthcare system five-billion dollars.","One of the most difficult realities of a dementia diagnosis is that there are no effective treatments for the disease, nor is there a cure. We do, however, have the opportunity to mitigate the difficulties of its decline. As the rates of this disease double in the next twelve years, effectively bankrupting our healthcare system, cities that implement avant-garde solutions to address its care will be ones that stand out in the international challenge to solve what is likely to be the greatest public health crisis of modern history. 
Traditionally, the effort to seek solutions for this disease has been limited to the elderly generation, but we are rapidly bringing the realities out of the shadows and injecting intergenerational innovation.
The Youth Movement Against Alzheimerâ€™s (YMAA) offers a novel, inexpensive solution to provide respite care services to the Los Angeles Community: YouthCare. YouthCare is an intergenerational respite-care program that partners trained college student volunteers and older adults with early-stage dementia in a community-based setting. For three hours, twice a week, they play games, participate in artistic activities, and deliver the research-backed Brain Boot Camp, developed by the UCLA Longevity Center to help people compensate for age-related cognitive decline. Students and seniors are paired based on similar interests and hobbies, creating a unique mentor-mentee relationship.
YouthCare has been recognized by MIT, UCLA, and the Clinton Global Initiative. Most recently this model won openIDEOâ€™s care for dementia challenge, which received 250 applications from around the world, and Social Venture Partners LA Fast Pitch 2018.
YouthCare is built on a 2 year pilot with UCLA Geriatrics. Our caregiver waitlist was at more than four times capacity, with more applying to volunteer than we could accept, and most importantly, three-quarters of caregivers said this program alone was all the break they needed - a key finding in our efforts to reduce caregiver depression rates. One hundred percent of students reported that they would recommend this program to a friend, and many seniors with Alzheimerâ€™s provided anecdotal evidence that they had found purpose once again in their lives. With just six hours a week, we found a winâ€“winâ€“win for older adults with dementia, their caregivers, and students, who now have a skill development opportunity to work with our growing aging population. 
YouthCare is the least-expensive respite-care option. Research shows that respite is critical to keeping loved ones at home longer. In fact, 2-4 years of YouthCare costs are comparable to just one month of nursing home costs. If YouthCare reaches 17% of Angelenos with dementia and allows them to age at home for just two more months, we will save the healthcare system five-billion dollars. YouthCare has launched our pilot program at USC. With an investment from LA2050, we can bring this model to several other colleges and communities in LA county.","Our program provides positive benefits for Angelenos affected with dementia, their family members, and students. Our ability to reach the maximum number of Angelenos requires three key steps, all of which we are working towards addressing already.
	First, our program must become an insurance waiver program. We are currently applying become a Medicaid waiver program and speaking directly to major care partners in LA - AltaMed, LA Care, Care1st, and Kaiser.
	Second, we must have a robust referral system. We have secured relationships with several LA nonprofits and city entities to spread the message into the community and we will continue to grow the depth of these relationships.
	Finally, we are working on a mobile based technology which will allow students and caregivers to know about when and where programs are held, serve to hold our training modules, and create an easy payment system. We have started developing the scaffolding of this application, which is being developed at industry standards to meet HIPAA compliance.
	We are confident that these three strategies are the most important to succeed because we have personally surveyed over 130 caregivers, from various ethnic backgrounds and income levels, asking pointed questions about what factors in relation to our program are most likely to convince them to use our services.","Our program addresses three key demographics: students, older adults with Alzheimerâ€™s or dementia, and their caregivers. We plan to measure our success based on the qualitative feedback from these three groups, as well as our quantitative impact. 
We plan to measure success  qualitatively through the use of surveys that indicate participant satisfaction and feedback. We currently provide students and caregivers entrance, mid, and exit surveys in order to assess the quality of the program and to see if we are effectively engaging students. For caregivers, these surveys include questions such as: Do you feel the programming in our model is effectively engaging your loved one? How can we improve this programming? How significantly does participating in our program lead to a reduction in your stress levels? With these surveys, we can gauge how well our program is meeting the needs of our participants, as well as discover ways to improve and further serve our community.
We plan to measure our success quantitatively by addressing several factors: the number of hours of care provided to seniors as well as respite provided to caregivers, the amount of money we are saving Medicaid/Medi-Cal, and the amount of money we are saving the individual families. We also plan on creating a research committee to assess how many months YouthCare increases aging at home to offset the cost of long-term care costs. Through this, we can prove how our program is improving our community.","In 5 years, we plan to transform access to care in Los Angeles to seed it as the worldâ€™s leader in respite care provision. Our organization is connected with national and international leading Alzheimerâ€™s nonprofits, and all of them have remarked that our organization has been the first to create this unique intergenerational social enterprise. We believe we can scale rapidly to at least forty of the one hundred and one colleges in LA county -- servicing over 1000 Angelenos annually. For each senior that we service, we will also be inspiring another student to enter fields of Alzheimerâ€™s and Aging. Our confidence stems from our development of a strong referral system that expands into all parts of the county and because we are investing in the development of mobile-based technology that will seamlessly bring together students and seniors and lower our cost-to-client by 33% in the next three years. 
The success of our activation is also directly tied to the success of our organization as a whole. The extra revenue which we drive from our social enterprise can go on to fund our other initiatives. In just the past three years, our almost all volunteer team has designed the first ever study to assess the effect of dementia care on high schoolers (IRB Approved), drafted bipartisan legislation to create a CA Care Corps (AB 2101 - in committee), become the national leaders in high school and college Alzheimerâ€™s advocacy, and created our own research scholarship program. Imagine what we can do with even more developed infrastructure. 
YMAA is uniquely aligned to bring this expansion to care access because no other for-profit care company can ever match our cost, and no other traditional Alzheimerâ€™s nonprofit has our ability to reach the younger demographic. Weâ€™ve spent the time developing a grant funded model, weâ€™ve learned lessons from our social enterprise pilot, and now we are ready to change the world of Alzheimerâ€™s care. With your investment, and our teamâ€™s passion, together, we can create a future worth remembering.","[""Healthcare access"",""Rates of mental illness"",""Residents receiving coordinated healthcare services""]","One of the most difficult realities of a dementia diagnosis is that there are no effective treatments for the disease, nor is there a cure.

8102125,8102125,Create Above the Radar Program â€“Â Think Tank Gallery Spotlight on Creative Opportunity,"Your art is better when you don't have to hide it. 

#CreateAboveTheRadar makes permitting your production less daunting, & provides opportunities for your show, mural, or event to find a scene in LA","Create Above the Radar is an online & live program sharing gatekept permitting information with creators in a responsible but emancipating way. It continues our professional consultation efforts to make Los Angeles the worldwide epicenter of immersive art. LA is uniquely suited to this growing field but our creators need guidance if it is going to thrive. As an added benefit, it consolidates information for our governing bodies to better know how regulations are applied by the artists using them","Artists invent new ways to do things, & we all benefit from that exploration. Because most creatives buckle at bureaucracy, starting with ideas rather than legal feasibility, regulation tying up cultural opportunity acts as a hidden landmine that takes a big ideaâ€™s legs out before seeing the light of day. If more creatives could produce compliant work, they could empower their practice & employ collaborators more often; we believe collaboration is fuel for creation. We aim to pull such projects up from hiding spots below the radar, benefiting economic leadership in the process.

Bringing underground & unregulated productions that we all know exist out of the shadows removes fear to advertise or engage with the community. It also provides local economic impact by tapping a wider audience, allowing for open dialog between artistsâ€™ audiences & the City, free of hiding their art from regulation.

Weeks before Oaklandâ€™s Ghost Ship Fire, we submitted a similar LA2050 application, provided an honorable mention by judges. Since then, weâ€™ve been offering free consultations to DIY productions coming to us after compliance speedbumps. We also co-directed Bringing Back Broadwayâ€™s annual festival spearheading use of nontraditional spaces for 3 years, with 90k+ attendees. Now weâ€™ve been invited to join LEIA (below) to form a permitting committee with governing bodies that regulate safety for artistic creation in LA.

With them, this project institutes a catch-all website, a repository for regulatory measures & how to smoothly work through them. This resource is assembled by our experts, with a large survey of problems from local creators & solutions to those problems. It will be sent to various governing bodies for feedback, but will exist as a standalone asset for creators to explore. While it will not automatically send users directly to agency inboxes or applications (using up limited government resources for such consultation), it will provide creators with a checkbox & drop down menu system that bounces them out to informative pages on how to create compliant events & artworks. The resource will culminate with hyperlinks to application forms & office contact information, once they reach the point that agency outreach is appropriate.

LA is the epicenter for artistic creation. Our mayor called it â€œthe most creative city in the history of the world,â€ but its permitting process has been convoluted, & many large projects have been chopped off at the knees. The vast sprawl & diverse creative industry of our city allows for boundary pushing work, matching our cityâ€™s constant flux of neighborhood boundaries, & we have witnessed a group of artists eager to know what the city wants from them. At the moment, the largest projects that these creators produce are fleeing to cities that have less intimidating processes (recently, the massive â€œTensionâ€ showâ€™s move to Vegas), & it's time to regain LAâ€™s place as the most vibrant, immersive region for artistic monetization","Our project creates a tool for creative, civic engagement in LAâ€™s diverse neighborhoods.  Access to information is a huge limitation for low-income, independent creators. We expose hidden approval processes needed to activate unique spaces in LA, & provide a forum artists in marginalized neighborhoods without access to cultural funding. This shows success in navigating the bureaucracy, & as greater awareness grows with more successfully permitted work, we will offer tools to advocate for policy changes enabling smoother approval processes. Through them artists will be more comfortable advertising publicly, exposing audiences to diverse work across genres, something priorly accessible only to a small, private community of enthusiasts.

Further, programming themed around the web portal (hyped parties, workshops with City officials, panel discussions) will build case studies to navigate approval processes & share data with the City. Such activations will be documented on this web portal & social media outlets, sharing opportunities to engage in these events and lessons learned from the discussions. Locals will have a new opportunity to engage directly with officials in a productive, transparent way.

Our project encourages cultural producers to work within the system to appropriately stage events & experiences by providing access to relevant information & processes. The website will be a resource for all seeking City approval for unique art & cultural events & experiences.","This portal is a resource for artists to create short-term experiences in their hoods. To be effective we must be a product of shared learning. Events & panels inform the creation of website functions, which contain case studies & examples of successful events. Participants share experiences, informing possible outcomes, providing material for case studies, leading to replicable solutions documented on the site.

A primary metric of success will be that engagement. Partner organization LEIA already represents a broad swath of artists working in immersive spaces, & partnership of the DCA reaches a much broader range of artists. A broader diversity of cultural experiences informs the guidance our project is able to provide in this growing cultural segment.

As a web portal, metrics are easily monitored, easily setting goals for engagement from both the project & the DCA.

LEIA has been collecting information about such work in LA & can capture hard data to measure the success of the project including stats about production numbers year over year. They can also drill down specifics of companies unable to launch work in LA & use this program to turn these failures into success stories.

We aim to provide a forum for creators to better engage with policy regulating art production. An obvious metric is the increased occurrence of short-term, site-specific, immersive art & events. Vegas has seen immersive investments top $100MIL this year; itâ€™s time for LA to take some of these back","In five years, Create Above the Radar will be an active, ongoing resource for cultural producers, artists, & creators to navigate City approvals. This will promote successful events & experiences that engage Angelenos in innovative, site-specific, temporary & long-term installations & activations.  The resource will live on with case studies & success stories, informing future creators in their endeavors to engage with City policy regulating art, structures, & place.

With the Olympics hitting LA at the halfway point between today and the projectâ€™s goal of artistic revitalization of the region by the year 2050, a good benchmark will be how supportive our platform will become for outside producers visiting our city â€“ one theyâ€™ve heard described as the entertainment capitol of the world. 

Ideally, the web resource & process will engage Angelenos & policymakers to update policy that has limited the growth of this young, growing segment of arts & culture in LA.  Create Above the Radar will be positioned to be a forum to host & advance such policy discussions.

LEIA will continue to be a central organizing entity in this new & growing segment of art & cultural production, working toward helping members successfully create permitted events & experiences.The platform can also connect permitting professionals (including our own) to the creators who need their services as their projects grow larger & larger.

Los Angeles is Americaâ€™s capital city for the homeless. Thousands of families with young and teenage children find themselves on the streets for a variety of reasons. Every family has a different story ranging from addiction to a fluctuating job market Partner all of that with an overpriced rental market that has little relation to the average earnings of many Angelenos and the combination of factors is a perfect storm for growing a large homeless population.

The Community Circle Project has two key components: (1) a strong, volunteer outreach program and (2) developing relationships with supportive local housing authorities.

By sharing 15 years of successful metrics from Topanga Womenâ€™s Circle (TWC) we will create a guide detailing aspects of our 100% volunteer organization. The guide will include storage, purchases, maintenance of a volunteer base, fundraising and strong communications with volunteers. 

Helping other city service group transform bare-bones, bridge housing into comfortable, welcoming homes for the homeless, a sense of pride is established for both the volunteer and the homeless client, often carrying forward as the client moves into their permanent housing. By being a part of every aspect of creating a welcoming home for these families, the volunteer develops a better understanding of the challenges the homeless population faces and can feel confident that their time spent setting up a home is appreciated beyond measure. 

We will cultivate a relationship with Los Angeles Countyâ€™s supportive housing authorities and develop a comprehensive database of those groups in need of CCPâ€™s services.

â€¢	Each organization committing to the CCP will be given a micro-grant to help them establish a storage facility and initial shelf-stocking.
â€¢	We will develop a website that will host each service groupâ€™s project and give them individual opportunities to fundraise and develop their pathway to volunteerism.
â€¢	We will develop a social media campaign including a film with images of volunteers at work and appreciative clients.

","The Community Circle Projectâ€™s goal is to create a new city-wide partnership between public/private housing authorities and service groups to help the homeless as they transition into housing. We will define our success by:

â€¢	The number of CCP chapters in each city of Los Angeles County;

â€¢	The number of supportive housing authorities that have partnered with CCP; and

â€¢	The number of homeless CCP has helped.

Hereâ€™s how:

1) We will activate our Advisory Council, a group of local experts in gender, LGBTQ and race-related issues, to help us responsibly curate a variety of real experiences in our VR narratives. We will conduct a cross-sectional survey to collect data on the current social and emotional needs of women in LA across all demographics, and use these stories to impact our content.

(When Going Gets Tough: Barriers and Motivations Affecting Arts Attendance) The 51% exhibit will capitalize on VRâ€™s transportability, hosting traveling exhibits throughout the LA metropolitan area in order to provide more communities with access to cultural eventsâ€”particularly focusing on transportation-deserts and low-mobility populations such as retirement homes. The exhibit will also be free to all and a shortened experience will be available online.

3) Guests at the exhibit can share their experiences via social media, using the hashtag #51percentLA, which will be collated on a dedicated website for the exhibit. Additionally, citizens can visit the website and add their own experiences, photos, stories and strategies to make LA a better place for all women.

1) We will collect data and stories of at least 10,000 women throughout Los Angeles during our cross-sectional survey. 
2) We will organize and engage female filmmaking talent during the writing, production and editing of our VR films. We anticipate a crew totaling 500 locals. 
3) This virtual reality installation aims to reach 50,000 LA citizens through an initial launch space that anyone can visit and 200 pop-up events in various communities throughout LA county. Participants can choose between three VR films that tackle different female perspectives, and discuss their reactions afterwards with other guests.  
4) At each event, we will provide opportunities for attendees to volunteer and donate to women-oriented organizations in Los Angeles. Our goal is to encourage at least 500 people to donate or volunteer over the two year period. 
5) We will use social media as one of our main forms of digital activation in order to make #51percentLA a viral and shareable hashtag in the community. Angelenos will be encouraged to join in the conversation online via our activation hub and Facebook group, where they can discuss opportunities to improve the female experience in Los Angeles, as well as contribute their experiences to our time capsule. We aim to employ Google Analytics and YouTube metrics to gather demographic data on our social media and digital engagement. We plan to engage at least 40,000 people in online participation.  ","In order for this project to succeed, as many intersections of womenâ€™s experiences need to be explored and represented throughout the process as possible. This is to ensure that we accomplish two objectives: 1) as many women as possible feel represented and celebrated through 51%: Our Reality, and  2) every participant leaves with a new perspective on womenâ€™s experiences in LA. To measure success in this, we will actively compare the demographics of our sample survey participants and event guests against LAâ€™s most recent census data. We have developed an internal timeline which includes several touchpoints in which we will pause to evaluate and consistently challenge ourselves to be MORE inclusive. Our Advisory Council will also help us measure this process by establishing criteria by which to critically assess all our narratives.","We hope this activation inspires communities worldwide to take a critical look at their own citiesâ€™ gender experiences and create similar tools for empathy.

Weâ€™d love to revisit this project in 5 years to explore what shifts have occurred that would change our cityâ€™s gender narratives. 
","[""Adults getting sufficient social & emotional support"",""Attendance at cultural events"",""Total number of local social media friends and connections Angelenos have""]","51%: Our Reality will explore the diverse perspectives, experiences and trials of women in LA through three virtual reality narratives, allowing participants to “walk” in different women’s shoes. Our goal is to showcase the true, the challenging, the positive, the subtle & hidden—stories from which men, women, boys girls and those who are gender-fluid can learn. Our strategies for implementation will target key LA2050 metrics, including providing emotional support, expanding access to cultural events and increasing local social media connections. 
 
 
 
 Here’s how:
 
 
 
 1) We will activate our Advisory Council, a group of local experts in gender, LGBTQ and race-related issues, to help us responsibly curate a variety of real experiences in our VR narratives. We will conduct a cross-sectional survey to collect data on the current social and emotional needs of women in LA across all demographics, and use these stories to impact our content. 
 
 
 
 2) The National Endowment for the Arts has cited location as a major barrier to arts attendance. (When Going Gets Tough: Barriers and Motivations Affecting Arts Attendance) The 51% exhibit will capitalize on VR’s transportability, hosting traveling exhibits throughout the LA metropolitan area in order to provide more communities with access to cultural events—particularly focusing on transportation-deserts and low-mobility populations such as retirement homes. The exhibit will also be free to all and a shortened experience will be available online.
 
 
 
 3) Guests at the exhibit can share their experiences via social media, using the hashtag #51percentLA, which will be collated on a dedicated website for the exhibit. Additionally, citizens can visit the website and add their own experiences, photos, stories and strategies to make LA a better place for all women. All of these submissions will be collated into a time capsule for future Angelenos to explore LA’s current gender climate. Through this we will connect our city’s future and present.",connect,2018127,https://activation.la2050.org/connect/twigg-how-to/twigg-how-to.jpg,0,8102127

Young inventors in South Los Angeles step right up!","Our STEAM Carnival invites children to look at the world of play from the perspective of their studies and future careers. We immerse the child in the world of robots, lasers, and fire to excite their interests and direct them into science, technology, engineering, art, and math through play. Every video game the child engages with has many careers behind it. We just help them make that connection.","Our STEAM Carnival opens the door to students understanding that the games they play every day are filled by a variety of careers. Coders, narrative writers, musicians, and film-makers all take part in the creation. We engage students in hands-on play and 'making' without letting them know the purpose is to learn. 
If we tell students we are going to teach them how sound is created, and we supply a lecture with all the correct information, they will take notes and remember some of what was said. If we have them take apart a speaker, and then make a working headset, they will remember forever how they made sound come out of that headset. 
We supply the games, the opportunity to code, and prototype. We supply tons of random materials and give prompts to what they might make, but we don't supply directions. By doing this we build critical and creative problem solvers.
Most of the children in school today, (65% according to government statistics) will work in jobs that don't yet exist. The only way to prepare them for those jobs is to make sure they can think their way out of a problem, have confidence that they can solve those problems, and in this way, build their self-image as creative problem solvers ready to take on whatever is thrown their way.

Indeed, most of our schools are between 75% and 100% ethnically diverse, low/moderate income.  Title I schools and teachers remain chronically under-funded and under-resourced in materials that are needed for Project Based Learning with few support groups to fill the gap.  Overall, 2BCFâ€™s students are 10% African American, 74% Hispanic, 1% American Indian, 6% Asian, and 9% Caucasian.  2BCF delivers its STEAM resources (affordable recycled materials, tools, sample curriculum) directly into the schools we service via special assemblies, Resource Carts, and, most importantly, STEAM Labs and STEAM Carnivals.  The LAUSD District South leadership is committed to building their schools into STEAM campuses and we have partnered wtih them to accomplish this goal","We have created pre-then-post surveys for the STEAM Labs and would use a similar survey for the STEAM Carnival. 
It is our hope that students will become less fearful of the STEAM disciplines by first experiencing them through artistic expression. It is hoped that these exercises will translate into greater confidence and, ultimately, improved performance on standardized tests.
STEAM Labs have been enormously well received by school personnel, credited with improving student engagement. Our evidence for this is from those pre-then-post surveys in which we asked the following two questions and received these responses:
What I learn in science class doesn't have much to do with the real world.
Pre  -  58% Strongly agree
Post - 15% Strongly agree

I believe I am going to fail science this year.
Pre  -  52% Strongly agree
Post - 10% Strongly agree

We would be using this survey to inform our own work and make it available through open-source sharing platforms.

Educators we work with credit the STEAM Lab with increasing their students' interest in practical research as an avenue into STEAM principles, as one principal described:  â€œStudents created marble runs, musical instruments, trebuchets, and catapults while exploring potential vs. kinetic energy and inertia.  Students moved forward in creating simple machines and experimenting with magnets.  At the end of the year the students worked together to meet the Rube Goldberg Challenge, creating an invention that pops a balloon.â€

","UCLA Center for Health Services and Society collaborated with Healthy African American Families to develop B-RESILIENT, a resiliency-based mobile intervention for depression self-management using the Community-Partnered Participatory Approach to enhance mental health quality of life and to help improve patient engagement and outcomes for individuals living with mild to moderate depression. The B-RESILIENT texting intervention was born out of community and patient partnersâ€™ requests to increase the availability of coping resources used in Building Resiliency in Communities for Health (B-RICH)--a manualized, 7-week class led by lay health workers to introduce CBT concepts--that emerged as a key innovation in Community Partners in Care (CPIC). Consistent with tracking and building on community input and engagement in interventions, the present study uses the same community engagement approach to expand access and availability to core coping and symptom self-management resources as well as information on and encouragement to receive needed services, through a mobile platform (Chorus). Our B-RESILIENT intervention introduces and reinforces principles of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) in order to support personal resiliency and reduce the risk for and impact of depressive symptoms and promote symptom self-management in response to multiple stressors in under-resourced communities of color. This app is a 30 day program where users will receive daily affirmations to start off their day and education on how to improve their mood (""boost""), reward themselves/enjoy activities (""break"") and how to ask for support (""buddy"") through interactive texts. After the 30 days, a user can convert to the mobile app to refer to as a guide if still needed. We then created a mobile web application in which participants followed-up on their experience with B-RESILIENT through surveys and also monitored their depression over one month to see the impact the B-RESILIENT app had. For this new iteration, we would like to expand the app to include content 7 days a week for one month instead of just doing the week.  We would also like to make this app accessible to more populations in Los Angeles, especially under-resourced communities (ages 18 and over), in improving the mental health of more communities and how a person can better manage depressive symptoms.  We would also like to add more features, such as creating professional videos to complement the text messages and provide more encouragement.  We plan to add interactive features, such as fun games as a way to provide ""breaks"" and a simple distraction, daily mood ratings and tips for boosting low moods, and activity schedules.  The previous piloting of the app made a positive impact on users, especially the daily affirmations and our biggest feedback was that users wanted more content.","A healthier LA is a happier LA.  Individuals living with depression have been presented with many barriers, from lack of resources, access to care (psychiatrists/therapists) to the cost of medications and therapy along with the uncertainty of their effectiveness, not to mention the time it takes to find the right therapist and medication.  One of the biggest challenges, though, is fighting through the stigma and getting the support from family and friends to aid in the recovery.  It is this challenge that makes it difficult to get help and treatment.  We want to change this with the B-RESILIENT app.  We have spent many years working with under-resourced communities and improving depression care in those communities, specifically South Los Angeles and the Hollywood Metro area.  After the success of our Community Partners in Care study where we worked with over 95 agencies in the community and gained the trust of the community, we used this expertise in developing the B-RESILIENT texting app which we have piloted twice to positive results which included positive reinforcement for those experiencing low moods, educated clients on resources available for depression, provided mentorship on how to reach out to family and friends for support (â€œDo You Need a Buddy?â€), and encouraged clients to reward themselves with pleasurable activities and breaks. We believe this app will continue to make an impact on more populations and communities in Los Angeles.
","Success will be measured through data obtained through using the App on: 1) number of users; 2) frequency of use and of interactions with specific features; 3) a measure of how people are doing on days of use; 4) a daily mood measure on days of use.  Independent of use of the App, we will also field monthly brief mental wellness measures such as a three-item measure from prior studies (Wells et al., 2013).  We will track how many users are ""core"" and use the App at least 5-6 times and how many are familiar with the App (used at least once) to be a resource for future needs.  In addition, for the adapter work group, we will have more extensive measures of user feasibility, accessibility and effectiveness.  We will also examine feasibility on first use of brief demographic measures that maintain confidentiality (e.g., age, gender, race/ethnicity) to allow review of uptake, reach, response and effectiveness for different demographic groups. In addition, we will track the number of people who visit the webpage about the overall project to understand basic awareness of the program.

8102130,8102130,To see well is to live well. ,"It is challenging to fill out applications or navigate the streets without being able to see, which the UCLA Mobile Eye Clinic proposes to remedy for people experiencing homelessness in L.A.","In partnership with the MCP, UMEC seeks to activate the people of LA to improve eye care access, change eye health behavior, and provide individuals experiencing homelessness the opportunity to see well so they can start to live well. Many of the homeless individuals that UMEC-MCP have seen are middle-aged adults, which is when almost everyone needs a pair of reading glasses. This simple solution will allow them to fill out job applications, read medication labels, or create detailed drawings!  ","At a UMEC summer library clinic in 2015, one of the homeless patients to whom we had given free eyeglasses reported back excitedly that because of his new eyeglasses, he could fill out job applications.  As a result, he was able to get a full-time job in the education field and was no longer homeless.

What a great impact!

By giving those who are experiencing homelessness in L.A. the ability to see well, we give them the opportunity to start to live well. MCP and UMEC services go where individuals live and work, which improves access to our free care. In fact, 81.3% of clients report that the UMEC-MCP Night Clinic improved their access to other healthcare resources in L.A. In addition, UMEC provides educational packets to give patients more information about their eye conditions and available resources they can utilize. We have found that 69% of patients we examine have a treatable eye condition and that over 90% of them need eyeglasses. Those 69% were treated for refractive error, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, pinguecula, pterygium, and cataracts and were provided access to ophthalmic care at UCLA Olive View and Harbor County hospitals which alleviates strain on emergency rooms. An estimated 18 billion dollars could be saved annually if â€œnon-urgentâ€ clinical problems such as correcting refractive error with glasses were treated outside of the emergency room through programs like the UMEC-MCP Night Clinic.

Satisfaction in our services is as high as 86.9% of clients that prefer our clinic to other free clinics in the L.A. area and 89.6% that prefer the Night Clinic to a hospital emergency department for non-emergency care. Thus, our services have an incredible impact on the quality of life for those experiencing homelessness in L.A.

In addition, our services will improve the understanding of the demographics and eye health problems of L.A.â€™s homeless populations, as knowledge of these is scarce. The last study addressing ocular disorders among the homeless in L.A. was published decades ago in 1990. Not only will our findings improve our clinics, but it may also guide future organizations to address the vision health needs of the L.A. homeless population.  We share LA2050â€™s goal to ensure that 100 percent of L.A. residents have access to affordable healthcare services, including vision care.

This project also engages Angelenos to understand the health care equality issues in their communities and help people experiencing homelessness in L.A. To engage more Angelenos, we will advertise our free eye care to undertreated patients who visit MCPâ€™s multiple clinic sites and use the Night Clinicâ€™s services. In one study (in Hawaii), 49% of the homeless did not know where to go to seek eye care and 68% did not know where to go to obtain eyeglasses. By reaching out to the homeless in the areas we serve, we can reduce these statistics and offer our health services to more people. ","To address the lack of understanding of the demographics and health problems of L.A.â€™s homeless populations, we will collect data and give follow-up patient questionnaires. Our findings and evaluations will contribute to addressing the vision health needs of L.A. By providing pro-bono vision care to the homeless, we will engage three different groups of Angelenos: 
1. People experiencing homelessness in L.A.
With our mobile eye exam unit and dedicated staff, UMEC has the advantage to mobilize our clinic to areas where the needs are greatest in the L.A. community.  This will also increase awareness and accessibility of vision care for the homeless.  
2. Individuals working with people experiencing homelessness in L.A.
It is crucial that individuals and organizations that work to provide services for people experiencing homelessness are aware of the great need for access to vision care and education on vision health. To help this group of Angelenos working with the homeless understand the extent and details of this health concern, UMEC & MCP will share our evaluations and data findings from our screenings, exams, and questionnaires. 
3. UCLA Health Community and Students
Recruit and employ highly motivated and dedicated undergraduate/graduate students with an interest in the field of medicine and public health through an interview and thorough training process. By activating these communities, we can expand our efforts to affect more people with the UMEC-MCP services offered.","Success is defined as the reduction of visual impairment in people experiencing homelessness in L.A. It will be measured by the number of free eye exams and eyeglasses that will be provided. Our goal with the funding is to examine 500 homeless individuals and to provide 450 free eyeglasses to these individuals. We  hope to have a follow-up questionnaire on how the new eyeglasses have helped facilitate the daily activities of these individuals.

UMEC has also been looking into various strategic tools to evaluate the program effectively. UMECâ€™s goal with a USC professor, is to conduct a Social Return of Investment Analysis (SROI) to leverage the impact of the Night Clinics. SROI is a process for understanding, measuring, and reporting on the social, environmental, and economic value created by the UMEC program. Evaluating programs properly will lead to the following impacts: more informed decision-making, ability to strike a balance between investments, and determining the best value for the budget. SROI will help guide internal performance management, attract funding, and lead to stronger relationships with stakeholders. This tool encourages accountability, transparency, and sustainability in decision-making. This tactic places stakeholders at the center of the process, including beneficiaries of aid whose voices are often ignored in the evaluation process.  From this inclusive process, more Angelenos will become engaged with the planning and executing of the night clinics. 
","In five years, UMEC hopes increase the frequency and locations of the MCP-UMEC Night Clinics and their locations to ensure that more people in L.A. County have adequate access to high-quality eye and health care. In order to reach this goal we plan to increase the frequency of the Night Clinics in Hollywood and Santa Monica. LA2050 would be a terrific catalyst for MCP to launch their new Santa Monica clinic and for UMEC to begin providing services there as well. This is an important endeavor as Santa Monicaâ€™s homeless population is growing.

Furthermore, it is our goal to spend the next five years strengthening the long-standing partnership with the MCP. To achieve this goal, UMEC would like to host more regular planning and evaluation meetings to nurture this collaboration with the MCP. Outside community, members and advisors will be invited to these meetings so that all stakeholders are consulted. The LA2050 grant will help support these endeavors to sustain and even expand the frequency of the Night Clinics and their locations to help people experiencing homelessness in L.A. 

Over the next five years, UMEC-MCP will collect data at these clinics and will utilize them for patient evaluations and studies. These evaluations will allow UMEC, MCP, and other organizations to tailor health services to best fit the needs of the L.A. homeless population. UMEC-MCP will also use the data for research purposes. The research conducted from this project may have the power to influence public policy and determine the best way to deliver care to the under-served population in the L.A. area.

8102131,8102131,United Parents and Students: Developing Cultures of Civic Engagement Across Los Angeles,"United Parents and Students will activate 100,000 people across South LA, East LA, Compton, and Inglewood to raise their voices regarding community concerns and demand a rebalance of political power.","UPAS envisions Los Angeles as a city where political power accurately reflects the populationâ€™s diversity. UPAS will continue to train and empower low-income community members to voice their concerns, engage city officials, and mobilize 1000s of students and families to vote. It will also launch a broader activation strategy to raise awareness among Angelenos of the scale and impact of poverty, homelessness, underemployment, violence, and lack of access to healthcare.","Los Angeles has the the most rapidly rising rents in America, the highest rates of homelessness, and the fourth highest rate of income inequality among the countryâ€™s largest metropolitan areas. These issues hit low-income communities of color the hardest. But while 84% of the countyâ€™s eligible voters are registered, turnout in the cityâ€™s municipal elections is notoriously low, resulting in measures getting passed with fewer than 200,000 votes in a city with a population of almost four million.

Democracy grants power to individuals. It affords every American the opportunity to be heard and to hold elected officials accountable. But democracy only has power when itâ€™s active. Many Americans, particularly those Americans who have historically been ignored or marginalized, are disengaged from the political process, their power to improve their lives and their communities untapped. UPAS seeks to address the glaring inequity apparent in the cityâ€™s civic life and engagement.

Too often, grassroots advocacy groups approach organizing as a part-time or volunteer endeavour; built on a belief that if you can get enough people out onto the streets then things will change. But thatâ€™s not how power transitions. Organizing individuals with little personal history of civic engagement is a full-time job that requires professional experience and knowledge of the formal skills necessary to mobilize diverse groups of people around a common cause. It then requires that those same professionals relinquish their own power, step aside, and allow the individual to take the reins and lead. 

United Parents and Students (UPAS) fundamentally believes that in order to secure long-lasting community progress and revitalization, community organizing must be recognized as a profession requiring vital and identifiable knowledge and strategic skills. UPAS uses a training model successfully used by the Industrial Areas Foundation since the 1970s, built on the iron rule of organizing: â€œNever do for others what they can do for themselves.â€ Nowhere is this mindset more important than in activism; UPAS organizers ground training on an understanding that systemic change must be pursued by the community itself rather than through the efforts of others.

UPAS builds the capacity of grassroots coalitions by fostering vibrant community hubs in many of Los Angelesâ€™s traditionally politically silent neighborhoods. In these hubs, individuals identify the root causes and socio-political context of the challenges they face, persuasively communicate on a wide range of issues, and organize friends and neighbors to take collaborative action. Schools are a natural partner for such work; they are multi-generational centers of learning with a built-in, responsive audience of families acutely aware of community challenges. UPAS is a 501(c)(3) non-profit that partners with existing organizations to leverage their communities to civic action.","UPASâ€™s activation will develop the social and political capital of individuals in the communities we currently serve through three main strategies that tier engagement: 

Educating & Supporting Parents: UPASâ€™s Parent Academy offers free adult education workshops at partner school sites to enable parents to act with core understanding of issues that most affect their communities.

Organizing: UPAS offers a structured training in the theory and practice of leadership and political engagement. The Leadership Institute trains leaders in how to prioritize issues, draft solutions, and develop strategies to engage representatives in meaningful and informed dialogue. Leaders organize public actions where community members surface issues to local representatives and officials.

Registering & Mobilizing: UPAS leaders, school-based parent outreach workers, and canvassers continually work to register eligible voters through an ambitious schedule of door-to-door visits, non-partisan voter registration events, and phone banking. UPAS also holds events to mobilize voters to the ballot box.

An integral part of UPASâ€™s work is to garner maximum community buy-in. UPAS maintains an active online presence that: 1) provides additional touchpoints for community members to connect, learn from and support each other online; and 2) allows UPAS to expand the scope of its work regardless of geographic boundaries to demand a rebalance of power in Los Angeles and attract potential partner organizations.","Over the next two years, UPAS will successfully activate 102,755 Angelenos by engaging in a four-pronged strategy of structured organizing:

1. Digital Engagement
Reach 30,000 people with compelling content on social media with the goal of 5% engagement (liking, commenting, sharing, or clicking) with each post to grow the number of people who interact with UPAS on social media.
Move 8,400 people to read stories about UPAS successes on Green Dotâ€™s blog.
Attract 20,000 people to UPASâ€™s website. 
Inspire 1,000 people to regularly read UPAS emails each month. 
Achieve 5-10 press mentions over two years.

2. Education and Collaboration
Educate 13,000 parents through Parent Academy Workshops or other courses.
Facilitate service and community organizationsâ€™ meetings and events attended by 7,000 people.

3. Organizing and Mobilization
Train 1,400 participants in the foundational skills of professional organizing through the Leadership Institute and 30 students in the Young Organizers Institute.
Train 95 Parent Leaders to become community leaders and organize 80 public actions attended by a total of 3,000 people.
Build attendance of 3,700 people at UPASâ€™s annual ForwardLA Assembly.
Educate 3,200 people in UPASâ€™s mission through door knocking visits conducted by UPAS organizers.

4. Voting
Register 6,342 community members to vote.
Activate 5,588 new registrants to vote.","Over the next five years, UPAS will help drive a massive redistribution of political, social, and intellectual power across Los Angeles so that low-income communities have greater representation in the conversations and decisions that directly impact them. UPAS will facilitate the empowerment of local communities to raise concerns and drive action related to the issues they believe are most critical to their success and well-being, including job creation, quality schools, public safety, and access to healthcare and affordable housing. UPAS, and those who graduate from its training program, will host forums for open and authentic discussions that lead to effective collaborative action on racial and economic disparities, bringing people from historically underserved neighborhoods together with elected and public officials. In the long-term, UPAS activations will generate more elected officials from places like Watts and West Athens, officials that will bring a genuinely deeper understanding of their communitiesâ€™ needs and vision to institutional centers of power. These voices, supported by informed community action, will redistribute power and resources to frequently marginalized neighborhoods, eventually attracting good businesses with high paying jobs into these communities, strengthening Los Angeles by diversifying local economies and tapping into the enormous intellectual capital and drive that exists in low-income communities.

Over the past 7 years, the team that leads UPAS has built a highly professional foundation and process for the activation of thousands of students and their parents in communities across Los Angeles, where very little such organized action previously existed. Given the distributed leadership model UPAS directs, and the collaborative nature of its work with many local CBOs, the next five years will see a massive acceleration of this activation across LA County. A My LA2050 Activation Challenge grant will help catalyze this vision over the next two years by driving a far greater collaboration between UPAS, the comms resources at Green Dot, and within the LA2050 community. 100,000 people engaged is a deeply ambitious and exciting number for UPAS to embrace and our hope is that this becomes a new framework for reaching the millions of people who seek empowered and successful participation in the future of Los Angeles.","[""Attendance at public/open streets gatherings"",""Government responsiveness to residents’ needs"",""Voting rates""]","Los Angeles has the the most rapidly rising rents in America, the highest rates of homelessness, and the fourth highest rate of income inequality among the country’s largest metropolitan areas. These issues hit low-income communities of color the hardest. But while 84% of the county’s eligible voters are registered, turnout in the city’s municipal elections is notoriously low, resulting in measures getting passed with fewer than 200,000 votes in a city with a population of almost four million.
 
 
 
 Democracy grants power to individuals. It affords every American the opportunity to be heard and to hold elected officials accountable. But democracy only has power when it’s active. Many Americans, particularly those Americans who have historically been ignored or marginalized, are disengaged from the political process, their power to improve their lives and their communities untapped. UPAS seeks to address the glaring inequity apparent in the city’s civic life and engagement.
 
 
 
 Too often, grassroots advocacy groups approach organizing as a part-time or volunteer endeavour; built on a belief that if you can get enough people out onto the streets then things will change. But that’s not how power transitions. Organizing individuals with little personal history of civic engagement is a full-time job that requires professional experience and knowledge of the formal skills necessary to mobilize diverse groups of people around a common cause. It then requires that those same professionals relinquish their own power, step aside, and allow the individual to take the reins and lead. 
 
 
 
 United Parents and Students (UPAS) fundamentally believes that in order to secure long-lasting community progress and revitalization, community organizing must be recognized as a profession requiring vital and identifiable knowledge and strategic skills. UPAS uses a training model successfully used by the Industrial Areas Foundation since the 1970s, built on the iron rule of organizing: “Never do for others what they can do for themselves.” Nowhere is this mindset more important than in activism; UPAS organizers ground training on an understanding that systemic change must be pursued by the community itself rather than through the efforts of others.
 
 
 
 UPAS builds the capacity of grassroots coalitions by fostering vibrant community hubs in many of Los Angeles’s traditionally politically silent neighborhoods. In these hubs, individuals identify the root causes and socio-political context of the challenges they face, persuasively communicate on a wide range of issues, and organize friends and neighbors to take collaborative action. Schools are a natural partner for such work; they are multi-generational centers of learning with a built-in, responsive audience of families acutely aware of community challenges. UPAS is a 501(c)(3) non-profit that partners with existing organizations to leverage their communities to civic action.",connect,2018131,https://activation.la2050.org/connect/united-parents-and-students/united-parents-and-students.jpg,https://vimeo.com/205438757,8102131

We will empower participants to say â€œyesâ€ to supportive housing for the most vulnerable people experiencing homelessness, preservation of existing housing so tenants facing eviction can stay in their homes, and creation of housing that is affordable. By activating 100,000 Angelenos this project will help tens of thousands of our neighbors stay housed and prevent homelessness before it occurs.","While we have proven we know how to end homelessness through permanent housing and services, we havenâ€™t made a significant impact on the flow of people into homelessness.  By some estimates, monthly in LA County more than 10,000 people fall into homelessness but less than 20% ends their homelessness. 

We will activate 100,000 Angelenos to advance short-term prevention- the need to make sure vulnerable residents stay housed- and longer-term prevention that increases the supply of housing to make more housing affordable to low-income Angelenos. We will inform and mobilize residents to:

UNDERSTAND THAT OUR HOMELESSNESS CRISIS IS A HOUSING CRISIS. According to recent focus group research, most people don't understand that the cost of housing is the number one driver of our homelessness crisis.  People especially don't understand that if we make housing more affordable, we can solve homelessness for most people. In fact, 2/3 of homeless people donâ€™t need supportive housing, they just need housing they can afford. Lifting this issue up will be a core focus of this partnership.

SUPPORT TENANTS AT RISK OF EVICTION TO STAY IN THEIR CURRENT HOMES. Historically low vacancy rates have created an environment where landlords often force families out of their homes, by legal and illegal means, so they can rent to higher income tenants.  Displaced families must quickly find replacement housing or risk becoming homeless.  But without enough affordable housing, and with an eviction on their record, it is an uphill battle.  

Inner City Law Center established a pilot program for keeping families in their homes.  Lawyers help tenants resolve differences with landlords, and if necessary, fight evictions.  In addition, short-term rent subsidies are available to keep tenants current on rent.  Social workers help tenants resolve underlying issues that have placed them at risk. We will spread the word about these programs and advocate for doing more.

But the work these programs can do is limited by existing legal frameworks that make it too easy to put tenants on the street. We will activate Angelenos to support meaningful tenant rights reforms. For instance, more cities in LA County could pass rules for just-cause evictions, meaning families can only be evicted if they violate the lease.   

SAY YES TO MORE HOMES AND BETTER RULES. Building more housing that is affordable is critical to helping people avoid homelessness. We will activate Angelenos to support new housing in their communities.  Elected officials who decide whether to approve new homes are very attuned to input from local residents. People who turn out for hearings on these projects have traditionally been opposed to new housing, often when it's for lower income and homeless people. Supportive messages and in-person testimony from residents who believe we need to address LAâ€™s homelessness and housing crisis can make a huge difference in allowing more homes of all types to be permitted and built. 
","A core component of making L.A. the best place to live is having enough places for people to live. Our activation will target L.A. County residents who voted â€˜yesâ€™ for both Prop. HHH and Measure H, which is nearly 1.5 million people combined. More specifically, we will target: 

Angelenos, especially renters, who typically havenâ€™t taken part in the housing planning discussion and sympathetic homeowners, landlords and community leaders who can be visible supporters

Our three core strategies to activate 100,000 people are: 

Digital Communication & Calls to Action

We will leverage high quality digital communications through the EVERYONE IN, Abundant Housing LA, and Inner City Law channels to educate people on the causes of homelessness and how we can prevent it by working together. 

Community Based Pop Up Engagement Events

We will leverage community specific pop up events to include conversations around housing production (of all types) as well as renter protections. We expect to conduct at least 10 of these events over the grant period, with approximately 500 people at each eventâ€”or 5,000 total people. 

Old Fashioned Community Organizing 

EVERYONE IN has developed a robust community organizing strategy that will be driven and advocated by experienced organizers, volunteers, and a coalition of over 50 community based organizations throughout Los Angeles.","In the context of activating 100,000 people towards this goal, we will measure: 

Digital key performance indicators of our digital content (core strategy component):
â–ª Impressions, shares, clicks, likes

â–ª People who attend community pop ups
â–ª People who attend organizer trainings

By empowering civic actors to better tell their stories of neighborhood-level shifts, changes, and challenges, NDSC will activate nonprofits, advocacy groups, government agencies, neighborhood councils, and other stakeholders to make data-informed decisions to improve the quality of life for low-income residents and families.","LA County is home to 10 million people with unique stories and circumstances, each of whom strives to make their communities the very best version of what they can be. Neighborhood Data for Social Change (NDSC) will make LA the best place to connect by equipping civic actors with information needed to contribute meaningfully in civic processes. 

NDSC serves neighborhoods throughout LA County with high-quality and policy relevant data at the neighborhood level. It enables local nonprofits, government agencies, neighborhood councils, advocacy groups, and civic institutions to make data-informed decisions to improve the quality of life within their neighborhood. NDSC directly impacts the LA2050 metrics that help measure and support efforts to make LA the best place to Connect. In fact, multiple metrics for the Connect goal exist as distinct indicators within the platform, including: travel time to work, number of public transit riders, social connectedness, and voter registration. NDSC allows users to understand, measure, and track these indicators across the entire County, or by specific neighborhoods. Data can be viewed down to the census tract level, making NDSC a powerful tool to understand how connectedness varies across different neighborhoods. Users can even create their own custom neighborhoods by joining census tracts and tracking aggregated data.

However, NDSC is not only about producing data. The platform empowers civic actors to better tell their stories, voice their opinions, and influence key decision-makers through the production of bi-weekly data stories produced in partnership with community based organizations and published by NDSCâ€™s official media partner, KCETLink. Data stories incorporate maps, visualizations, photos, and rich narrative that highlight trends, opportunities, and challenges facing communities in the LA region. These data stories offer a powerful vehicle to advance additional Connect metrics, offering a platform to advocate for a number of key policies and investments that will make Los Angeles the most civically engaged region in the U.S. by 2050. 

Lastly, NDSC activates Angelenos to make LA the best place to CONNECT through its ongoing series of community trainings, which are held monthly at USC and in the community. NDSC has launched a partnership with the Department of Neighborhood Empowerment, which supports the Cityâ€™s 97 neighborhood councils in promoting public participation in government and improving government responsiveness to local concerns. Together, NDSC and Empower LA provide ongoing community workshops to train Angelenos on how to use data to activate change within their neighborhood. This partnership directly supports participation in neighborhood councils â€“ a specific metric within the Connect goal. 

Through these activities, NDSC helps the region work to become a place where every resident has the opportunity to engage, interact, and contribute to the regionâ€™s civic vitality.   ","NDSC activates nonprofits, government agencies, neighborhood councils, businesses, and other civic actors to make LA the best place to CONNECT through storytelling and trainings that help people use data to advocate for their communityâ€™s needs. Since the platform launched in October 2017, the platform has been viewed over 30,000 times. NDSC will scale up current activities to reach a total of 100,000 Angelenos over the next two years. Working with a range of community organizations, we will increase the number of trainings within LA County neighborhoods, to ensure that all Angelenos are able to locate the neighborhood data needed to activate change within their communities. NDSC will strategically partner with Neighborhood Councils, ensuring that we reach the full diversity of neighborhoods across the region â€“ big and small, urban and rural, wealthy and under-resourced. A webinar will also be created to reach people that cannot attend a training. Training content will be promoted on the NDSC platform, in a monthly newsletter, and on the NDSC Twitter handle, which shares training schedules, new datasets and new data stories. Lastly, additional outreach will be conducted to engage more community partners in co-developing biweekly data stories published in partnership with KCETLink. Through these strategies, NDSC will provide a ladder of local data engagement for all Angelenos â€“ from attending a single community training to participating as a full partner on new data stories. ","NDSC has a number of built-in metrics that help define and measure success. Increased visibility and community engagement will be the primary metrics that we use throughout the two-year year. Monitoring visibility will include an ongoing analysis of online traffic to the platform, an analysis of media coverage and social media engagement, and engagement with the bi-weekly data stories published through KCETLink. By 2019, we plan to have 50,000 Angelenos using the platform. By 2020, we anticipate that number climbing to 100,000 users. Increased community engagement will be measured by analyzing the number of individuals who are registering for, attending, and being waitlisted for our community training workshops. By 2019, we plan to reach 1,000 Angelenos through these trainings. By 2020, we plan to reach 2,000 participants. We will also record how much platform-related feedback we receive from the community, and how often individuals are downloading data and/or creating a login with the platform. Additionally, we will track inquiries from community groups requesting collaborations on data stories, as well the number of community partnerships to support NDSC training workshops. At all community trainings, we will gather user testimonials on how NDSC is helping to activate change in their community. Testimonials will be shared via social media, in our newsletter, and on the platform itself.","In five years, Angelenos from all neighborhoods, with different backgrounds, goals, and aspirations for their neighborhoods, will use NDSC to activate change within their community. Civic actors will recognize NDSC as the go-to resource for accurate, timely, and policy relevant information about the challenges, opportunities, and trends facing local neighborhoods. Civic actors will have the information needed to generate informed and evidence-based policies and programs that address the unique needs of their communities. And, they will have a platform to share stories relevant to their community, using NDSC data stories to voice their opinions, influence policymakers, and advocate for their needs. NDSC will remain free to all users retaining its commitment to democratizing data; NDSC is the byproduct of a community-owned vision for accessible, transparent neighborhood data, and it is the community that will continue to shape the evolution of the platform. By working directly in partnership with nonprofit organizations, businesses, advocacy groups, neighborhood councils, and other civic actors, NDSC will activate a new era of civic engagement in Los Angeles, helping Angelenos build and track progress toward a shared vision for the future of Los Angeles.","[""Travel time to work"",""Number of public transit riders"",""Participation in neighborhood councils""]","LA County is home to 10 million people with unique stories and circumstances, each of whom strives to make their communities the very best version of what they can be.

Through the LA2050 Activation Challenge, we aim to train at least 10,000 women by 2020 through online and in-person events, helping to motivate underrepresented leaders, and ultimately ushering at least 50 women to run for offices in L.A. County by 2020. Women not running will also catalyze positive change by voting, speaking out on issues, and organizing their communities. ","A recent poll showed that LA is one of VoteRunLead's ""hotspots,"" with a huge demand for our trainings coming from LA County. With relatively low voter turnout and a city council that is 77 percent men, LA is an ideal location to connect and engage through civic participation and women's leadership training. VoteRunLead would be honored to help residents connect through our tried-and-true strategies:  
- In-Person Trainings and Engagements. Our signature training, called ""Run As You Are,"" is a six-point curriculum covering key ways for women to develop and execute their public leadership skills, including 1) Confidence & Qualifications; 2) Campaigns & Elections; 3) Government & Civic Literacy; 4) Practice & Feedback Cycles; 5) People & Networks; and 6) Reputation & Impact. Evaluations of these award-winning trainings show that women emerge with greater knowledge and confidence, committed to the path to lead. 
- Digital organizing and activism. VoteRunLead's online trainings and workshops provide an opportunity for leaders to learn from anywhere, on their own schedules. In 2017, 6500+ views of our curriculum demonstrate that women are willing to partake in online experiences, and our social media network of nearly 20,000 individuals is active, engaged, and supportive. 
- Increasing participation in political processes. VoteRunLead targets women to run for office between now and 2020; specifically, those who are underrepresented: women of color, younger women, women with lower incomes -- and they are eager to lead. Our data shows that our trainings are effective: In November 2017 elections, we had 49 women on the ballots across the country (a similar organization, 6x the size of VoteRunLead, had 55 women running). Nearly 70% of our candidates won their elections, including 70% of *first-time* candidates (statistics show that usually, first-timers win 10% of the time) and 39% were women of color. And, even if trainees don't run, they vote. 
- Advocating for policy. Studies show women are more likely than men to pass a bill and work in a bipartisan manner. Our alumnae pass pay equity bills, bring long-ignored issues to the fore, and advocate for vulnerable populations. Nonpartisan VoteRunLead welcomes women of all backgrounds and beliefs, speaking to all parties and millennials who often claim no party affiliation.
- VoteRunLead creates new tools and technologies for greater civic/political engagement. As mentioned above, VoteRunLead has an engaged online community and aims to expand online tools. 
- Influencing individual behavior. VoteRunLead's message of empowerment and collaboration impacts women not only on a systemic level, but also on an individual one, which opens new doors in their everyday lives. 

Through this work, VoteRunLead will deliver specifically on the LA2050 metric to increase participation in neighborhood councils, training and propelling women into office to create a more responsive governance that addresses residents' needs. ","Since its inception in 2014, VoteRunLead has maintained a population of trainees that is at least 60 percent women of color, with approximately 25 percent coming from lower-income households and 30 percent of our trainees starting their leadership trainings with us at age 35 or younger. No other leadership training organization for women is so diverse or so intent on finding and connecting the untapped, unheard voices that are so necessary to making our democracy an inclusive, effective one. 

Moving forward, VoteRunLead will continue our commitment to diversity and inclusion, ensuring that the next waves of leaders are truly representative of the population. To do so, we will continue the strategies and tactics that have been so effective to date, partnering with like-minded organizations that focus on recruitment of diverse voices, such as Higher Heights, IGNITE, 9 to 5 Working Women, Gamma Phi Delta sorority, MomsRising.org, and more. We will also bring in additional partners to reach women from different backgrounds, races, ethnicities, sexual orientations, and political affiliations, to bring the full perspectives and power of women leaders forward. 

Additionally, creative partnerships with corporations such as WeWork, wherein space is donated for trainings and workshops, connect VoteRunLead to reach entrepreneurs, movers, and shakers in communities across the country.","Measuring success through the following goals and outcomes, VoteRunLead will:  

VoteRunLead aims to tap into the potential of women in LA, across party lines, who are motivated to and ready to lead. By 2020 (during the grant term), the organization aims to: 
- Train 1,000 women in LA through in-person trainings and workshops; 
- Reach 9,000 women in LA through online experiences; 
- Propel at least 50 women to run for office in their communities, whether through elections on the school board, city council, etc. and through appointed positions; 
- Activate all women to step into their unique leadership roles in their communities, joining the ranks of motivated citizens who connect and improve their city and county; and 
- Propel women into public leadership so that representation reflects the actual population (currently, 51 percent of the U.S. is women; about 40 percent are women of color, but approximately 80 percent of government is led by men, and they are overwhelmingly white men). 

We believe that our activation crosses over into the LEARN, PLAY, CREATE, and LIVE areas as well. Through VoteRunLead trainings, women are encouraged to articulate what they value and explore how they can realize those values in their communities. Thus, even if an alumna doesn't run for office, she may take it upon herself to become an entrepreneur, engage with her child's school, and/or advocate for green spaces and healthy environments. ","In five years, VoteRunLead as an organization hopes to have trained more than 1.2 million women nationwide, with approximately 10,000 of them hailing from LA. We know this is possible, because the excitement and motivation are happening now, with no signs of slowing down. We cannot miss the opportunity to align our tools and training with the the enthusiasm women are showing through marches, protests, and social media movements! VoteRunLead has the expertise, the proven program, the team, and the model to activate the next wave of activated citizens. 

Ilhan Omar is a great example of who we attract and what we do. VoteRunLead was founded in Minnesota and works regularly there to provide trainings. Omar is currently a MN State Representative, who trained with VoteRunLead for years, solving work/life challenges as we provided scholarships and child care--because we know thatâ€™s what it takes for women to be able to run. With training, personal meetings with our experts, and our nationwide support network, Omar has become a nationally recognized leader, the first Somali-American legislator, and a trainer for VoteRunLead. Weâ€™re shifting the story that women cannot or should not lead, and making it possible for women to do so en masse. We would love to create this kind of success in LA. 

VoteRunLead is fortunate to have a growing media presence, supported by an active network of trainees, alumnae, and experts who live our message of empowerment and inclusivity. These women sit on school boards and in state houses across America, are racially and ethnically diverse, and come from both rural and urban areas. Recent media coverage includes: 
- The aforementioned alumna Ilhan Omar, a former refugee, Muslim, and mother of three was profiled in Time magazineâ€™s â€œFirstsâ€ series. She was also featured by NPR, BBC, and NBC (all searchable online); 
- VoteRunLead was recently featured in ABCâ€™s Nightline; and
- Politico is talking about how VoteRunLead trainees are changing the game. 

Your support is critical in ensuring our success. We are nimble and tech-savvy, well-known for the racial and ethnic diversity of our leaders and alumnae. We have a proven curriculum, a track record of significant â€œwins,â€ a network of powerful individuals and partnerships, and an engaged, diverse group of 10,000+ new women ready to vote, run, and lead. We are eager to make a seismic impact on the political practice and policies in LA, to include all voices and create equal opportunity. Yet we need innovative opportunities such as LA2050 in order to make this happen.

This is not a moment, itâ€™s a movement. It leads the way for generations of women and girls who will be civically minded and politically active, and this movement includes all of us. We are ready to activate LA!","[""Government responsiveness to residents’ needs"",""Participation in neighborhood councils"",""Voting rates""]","A recent poll showed that LA is one of VoteRunLead's ""hotspots,"" with a huge demand for our trainings coming from LA County. With relatively low voter turnout and a city council that is 77 percent men, LA is an ideal location to connect and engage through civic participation and women's leadership training. VoteRunLead would be honored to help residents connect through our tried-and-true strategies: 
 
 - In-Person Trainings and Engagements. Our signature training, called ""Run As You Are,"" is a six-point curriculum covering key ways for women to develop and execute their public leadership skills, including 1) Confidence & Qualifications; 2) Campaigns & Elections; 3) Government & Civic Literacy; 4) Practice & Feedback Cycles; 5) People & Networks; and 6) Reputation & Impact. Evaluations of these award-winning trainings show that women emerge with greater knowledge and confidence, committed to the path to lead. 
 
 - Digital organizing and activism. VoteRunLead's online trainings and workshops provide an opportunity for leaders to learn from anywhere, on their own schedules. In 2017, 6500+ views of our curriculum demonstrate that women are willing to partake in online experiences, and our social media network of nearly 20,000 individuals is active, engaged, and supportive. 
 
 - Increasing participation in political processes. VoteRunLead targets women to run for office between now and 2020; specifically, those who are underrepresented: women of color, younger women, women with lower incomes -- and they are eager to lead. Our data shows that our trainings are effective: In November 2017 elections, we had 49 women on the ballots across the country (a similar organization, 6x the size of VoteRunLead, had 55 women running). Nearly 70% of our candidates won their elections, including 70% of *first-time* candidates (statistics show that usually, first-timers win 10% of the time) and 39% were women of color. And, even if trainees don't run, they vote. 
 
 - Advocating for policy. Studies show women are more likely than men to pass a bill and work in a bipartisan manner. Our alumnae pass pay equity bills, bring long-ignored issues to the fore, and advocate for vulnerable populations. Nonpartisan VoteRunLead welcomes women of all backgrounds and beliefs, speaking to all parties and millennials who often claim no party affiliation.
 
 - VoteRunLead creates new tools and technologies for greater civic/political engagement. As mentioned above, VoteRunLead has an engaged online community and aims to expand online tools. 
 
 - Influencing individual behavior. VoteRunLead's message of empowerment and collaboration impacts women not only on a systemic level, but also on an individual one, which opens new doors in their everyday lives. 
 
 
 
 Through this work, VoteRunLead will deliver specifically on the LA2050 metric to increase participation in neighborhood councils, training and propelling women into office to create a more responsive governance that addresses residents' needs.",live,2018134,https://activation.la2050.org/connect/voterunlead/voterunlead.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJlhdh9rWgs,8102134

","Walk With Sally is LAâ€™s premier voice on connecting volunteers to the most impactful opportunities as well as to each other.

We propose three pillars of engagement and asks for your help to see them grow across the city!

Engaging Young Professionals
Creating Young Leaders Who Give Back
Recruitment & Engagement Management

We have long been the hub for young professionals to find a place to give back while connecting to a network of like-minded individuals. With the new FTK Social Club or our For The Kids Young and Young at heart professionals group that was recently formalized, we have created a community service platform in which these young volunteers can give of themselves and become a resource for other young professionals as well as the organization as a whole. Membership in FTK requires a minimum of 15 hours of volunteer service to WWS within the year and in exchange they receive networking events and speaker series aimed at the issues they care most about. They have their own governing board and create their own content and events! It is a unique formula that crosses all ages and creates a regular stream of volunteers for the organization. With this working model, we aim to replicate FTK in another part of the city.

With so many youth that we are investing in long term, many of them find are looking for something that can help guide them into secondary education and civic engagement. WWS heard the call and created our Junior Mentors Program, Mentees ages 14 â€“ 17 that are ready to begin their path towards volunteerism and leadership. This group also agrees to a certain amount of minimum volunteer hours at WWSâ€™s Friendship Activities or Fundraisers and in return they receive curated content from Advisory Board, FTK and other resources as well as special opportunities and a chance at not only WWSâ€™s Fredâ€™ Future Young Leaders Scholarship but also other community scholarships within our Hub of resources.

For the first time since our inception, Walk With Sally has hired a Volunteer Recruitment and Manager to specifically create the pathways to engagement for prospective volunteers through Walk With Sally. While the pathway to find our beneficiaries is predominantly and clearly 85% through our schools, the one to find the many mentors we need to fulfill the need in the city is not. Therefore, this personâ€™s responsibilities include searching for opportunities to find and recruit not only WWS mentors but also WWS Ambassadors that can help WWS leverage growth much faster than we can relying solely on our own internal resources by attending Outreach events when a staff person cannot, or volunteering for one of our special events committees, or Friendship Activities where they are able to interact directly with our Mentees.

And lastly, we will hire a 5th Program Coordinator to work remotely and along side our current Program Dept. in order to expand these as well as our mentoring program throughout DTLA, East LA, The Valley, Pasadena and beyond","Within the FTK Social Club, WWS intends to engage young professionals within a multifaceted array of other networking events. WWS will use the same bylaws and board structure to create the FTK Social Club North Branch. This will engage adults 25 - 40 to think about civic engagement and what it can look like. We will thereby connect hundreds of like minded young citizens throughout the city.

Through our Junior Mentor program we will be engaging youth between the ages of 14-17 impacted by a parent, guardian or sibling's cancer not only through their own one on one mentoring but also through a series of volunteer activities. In addition, we will be exposing them to opportunities, bonding them closer to each other, and training them to be leaders within our city.

And finally through new recruitment avenues and a healthy engagement system we will be connecting volunteers of all ages and paths of life with each other and with the children who need them, in every corner of LA!","We will define success through the following:

1. Recruitment of 50 FTK North Branch members and 4 consecutive FTK events
2. Matching 100 new Friendships, a match of one child between the ages of 7 -17 and one adult who has experienced the trauma of cancer within the areas outlined.
3. Recruitment and Maintenance of 100 new WWS Ambassadors within our database for all outreach and fundraising events.

8102136,8102136,We Are Enough: Women Investing $$$ in Women... the Way to Change the World!,"A global, multi-year campaign, starting in Los Angeles, to inspire and empower women (and girls) of every economic level to commit to investing in women-owned businesses and/or with a gender lens.","For the FIRST TIME, through a multi-year campaign, thousands of women in LA and millions around the world will be activated to invest an average of $1000. The impact will be billions moved into companies led by women. NOTHING like this has EVER happened. 80% of women's capital goes to their families & communities, men, 30%. This game-changing activation will change families, communities, the economy and the world!","Women-led businesses are significantly underfinanced. They receive less than 3% of venture capital, 17% of angel investment, and 4% of commercial loans. Yet, women are starting businesses at 1.5 times the rate of men... even faster for women of color. Companies led by women, that have more women on their boards, or women as decision-makers outperform their competitors on EVERY measure of profitability...by 63%!

We Are Enough's activation will create measures of cultural and global economic influence by changing women's mindsets. Women do not consider themselves investors and are passive with their investments BUT women control or influence 75% of consumer discretionary spending around the globe. After four sold-out and successful pilot events (which included surveys) in LA proved women were eager to learn how to activate their economic power, we concluded that we could reach all women in LA County. Where LA goes, so goes the country and the world... so it's the perfect place to launch and pilot our new global campaign.

Why will this ""make LA the best place to create""? LA is the most economically unequal place in the country. Women reinvest more of their capital back into their communities than men... by 50% more. If we really want our region to be the best place to create, we need to remove the inequities. This is what women will do if they have more wealth and their businesses more financial support. Our campaign will build wealth for all women and teach our girls to do the same.","We Are Enough has its roots in LA and intends to launch and grow the global campaign from here. We believe in the power of locally engaged women to connect and support other women and girls across the country and around the world.

The activation will engage Angelenos to make LA the best place to CREATE by encouraging participation in investing in women-owned businesses. This will be done through a PSA/video, social media, marketing campaign, and partners locally and around the world. The weareenough.biz website will house the investing challenge and directory of investment destinations.

We do not replicate current initiatives and we do not provide investment advice or direct investments to individual companies. We do curate all the best options and make it easy for women to decide whatâ€™s right for them, based on their risk tolerance, level of participation, economic reality, investment amount, etc. 

Whether itâ€™s $25, $25K or $25M, we believe there are ways to harness womenâ€™s investing power and align their investments with personal values and generate wealth... And a tangible way to impact LA women entrepreneurs, their businesses, and communities. 
","We will inspire women (and girls) to commit a percentage of whatever amount of capital they choose - savings, 401K, shoe/purse budget, lunch money, etc over a multi-year period. We will track their commitments and create a great sharing platform to engage colleagues, friends and families. 

This will be measured in real time on the WAE site. Women will go to the site and enter their pledge. We will also encourage woke men to tell their daughters, sisters, mothers, wives to do the same.","We actually hope that We Are Enough will not be needed in 5 years. We hope by launching the campaign that we change the mindset of all women and they know their economic power.. and our job is done!

8102137,8102137,Los Angeles Veterans Orientation (LAVO) ,The Los Angeles Veterans Orienation welcomes veterans to our community and provides a friendly and fun introduction to the benefits veterans need to become successful Angelinos. ,"The LAVO is an opportunity to directly engage and support the veterans of Los Angeles County. The LAVO provides a casual, informal community for veterans to discuss their needs, obtain information about  available  resources, and access the robust veteran network in Los Angeles. Hosted at various sites across Los Angeles County, the quarterly orientations maintain a friendly, ""small community"" approach with attendance ranging from 50-70 veterans each month.","Founded by veterans for veterans, LAVO is a monthly event for veterans who have recently transitioned to LA county where they can come to be introduced to a myriad of benefits, services, and local opportunities. It is a one stop shop for the resources and networks veterans need for a successful transition into the LA veteran community and to Los Angeles overall. 

According to a University of Southern California School of Social Work report, nearly 12,000 veterans return to Los Angeles every year, largely unprepared for civilian life. The study found that six in 10 post-9/11 veterans identified assistance needed for employment, education and Veterans Affairs benefits. LAVO can be a preventative measure ensuring veterans find the resources they need before itâ€™s too late. 

LAVO will host speakers and representatives who provide various resources for employment, education, VA benefits (medical), family services, housing, and more. 

LAVO will provide an atmosphere of camaraderie and social interaction. Every veteran will have an opportunity to introduce themselves and there will be a social atmosphere for veterans to meet one another including veterans who are well connected to the veteran community in LA. Veterans will also be introduced to volunteer and civic opportunities should they want to get involved in their communities. Our goal is to make the most veteran friendly city in the country! 


","LAVO will partner with student veteran populations, local veterans services orgnaizations/providers as well as LA city and county officials to primarily engage veterans who have recently arrived to LA (1 year or less). 

Our value is that we make events fun and entertaining first thus allowing veterans to have low pressure and friendly environment to discuss resources/benefits. 

LAVO will host speakers and representatives who provide various resources for employment, education, VA benefits (medical), family services, housing, and more.  Past speakers have included former NFL players, county officials, city representatives, and various industry leaders. 

LAVO provides an atmosphere of camaraderie and social interaction in a location that is unique to Los Angeles so that veterans can discover their resources and city at the same time. Past event locations include LACMA, Disney Studios, Fox Studios, Deloitte's downtown office and many other veteran friendly locations.



","With the LA2050 support, we will measure our success in 3 ways. 

1) The LAVO will have the ability to fund four (4) events annually, each with the capacity to host 100 veterans. 
2) The LAVO will receive the capability to develop a Veteran Mentorship Program, providing direct support and assistance to 50 veterans annually.
3) The LAVO will be able to expand its outreach and marketing into the San Gabriel Valley, East LA and South Bay. Veterans feel most comfortable talking to other veterans, and the LAVO will ensure that every LA Veteran is welcomed into the LA's vibrant veteran community.
","In less than 2 years, LAVO has become the model for other communities in the Southern Califonia to replicate in support of their veterans. In 5 years, we plan for LAVO to be the national model for veterans outreach and that Los Angeles will be the most veteran friendly city in the nation.

8102139,8102139,"World Harvest Dream Village: Affordable Housing with Food, Jobs, Healthcare, and Community.","Itâ€™s the dream we all dream of: A village in the city where you can live, work, eat, learn, play, heal, connect, and create. ","World Harvest is designing a 100-unit affordable housing complex that includes a grocery store style food bank, restaurants, jobs and job training, a health clinic, a credit union, a community garden, artists-in-residence, free bikes and Wi-Fi, a maker space, a small business incubator, and more. This model can be replicated across L.A. County and beyond. We will create project replication materials to help build affordable housing dream villages in every community.","We all dream of living the village life, but we love our big city, too. The World Harvest Dream Village is a place where you can have it all: Affordable housing, groceries and restaurants, healthcare on site, jobs and job training, a maker space and small business incubator, a credit union with microloans, free bikes and Wi-Fi, multigenerational housing, artists-in-residence, community gardens, participatory budgeting projects, and other elements of a healthy, thriving, authentic village community â€“ located in the big city. 

We are not reinventing any wheels. These elements all pre-exist. Our innovation is to bring them together with affordable housing, which is made possible by the passage of County Measure H and City Proposition HHH, which provide funds to build affordable housing. Weâ€™ll stretch these dollars by bringing in additional partners to fund the build. Activating Angelenos to help plan this project will raise awareness that there is a better way to live, that we can live our dreams, and that itâ€™s up to us to build it for ourselves. We can do it!

Food, housing, and healthcare are the top three metrics addressed by the proposed project. Over a third of households in Central L.A. experience food insecurity, and a sixth experience hunger â€“ among the highest rates in L.A. County. A combination of rising rents, barriers to building affordable housing, and stagnant wages has resulted in a humanitarian crisis of homelessness and housing insecurity. L.A.â€™s poorest residents pay more than half of their income to stay housed. Universal access to healthcare remains out of reach. The proposed project addresses these issues through a replicable, modular Dream Village model.

Operating almost entirely without grant funding for nearly ten years, World Harvest social supermarket has a proven capacity for managing complex projects. In addition to serving 50,000 clients annually on a self-sustaining budget, we provide many tons a week of high-quality diverted waste food on demand to clients like the L.A. Zoo and reentry transitional housing agencies. 

With the award of LA2050 Activation Challenge funding, the World Harvest Dream Village will lead a two-year activation in collaboration with the city, the county, our neighborhood council, neighborhood residents, and future residents of our dream village. AltaMed will help plan the Dream Village health clinic design. ADX will help plan the maker space and small business incubator. Participation in the planning process will activate Angelenos around a vision for wholeness beyond mere housing. 

Now is the time to make affordable dream villages a reality. The World Harvest Dream Village is more than a housing project; weâ€™re building a community. Join us in building a road out of homelessness and hunger to a better future for Los Angeles.","Our activation will mobilize Angelenos to make LA the best place to LIVE through digital organizing and activism, trainings and in-person engagements, opportunities and motive for businesses to change their practices, increasing food waste diversion at the individual level, and impactful volunteer opportunities. 

We will activate Angelenos around planning the World Harvest Dream Village including our immediate neighbors, the 50,000 families we serve, clients of our project partners, and LA2050 citizen activists. Tools include email newsletters, press releases, robocalls, texts, and social media viral videos that invite Angelenos to community events, planning meetings, trainings, focus groups, and future resident meetings. Our team uses Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Snapchat to reach a wide audience. Events include surveys to inform planning for the dream village and to identify future residents. Trainings and focus groups will address volunteer opportunities, participatory budgeting, small business development, maker spaces, and other topics informing the public about elements of the Dream Village and eliciting feedback. Community events will include focus groups, planning meetings, surveys, food giveaways, health screenings, and fun family activities. We will invite our corporate food donors to design their own food waste diversion kiosks for placement in the new Dream Village social supermarket, increasing awareness and encouraging corporate responsibility.","A successful activation engages 5,000+ Angelenos in the World Harvest effort to make LA the best place to LIVE. Weâ€™ll invite our neighbors to share our vision to end homelessness and hunger and help design L.A.â€™s first Dream Village. Success measures include collected feedback and data to inform the village design. Other measures include events (participant demographics, and food and services received, e.g., training and health screenings), volunteerism and social media activism by activated Angelenos (event & viral video shares), and surveys collecting self-reported changes in consumer behavior re: preventing food waste. Success measures also include diversity among participants. We will track diversity demographics for in-person activations. Equity in planning our Dream Village includes diversity among planning participants that reflects neighborhood demographics. 

We anticipate planning eight quarterly community events over the course of two years, sending press releases to our media list, monthly newsletters to our 2,000 subscribers, doubling the subscriber base, sending weekly robocall/text updates to our list of 50,000, posting daily on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook, and Snapchat. This is a team effort that will be a continuation from the campaign to win the most votes for the LA2050 Activation Challenge; we will continue to use our team assignment tree to divide the labor of social media outreach among six staff members, with additional support from two new staff.","In five years, we hope to have activated 5,000 Los Angeles residents to share about this project on social media, participate in trainings, focus groups, and planning sessions, volunteer with us, and change their consumer habits to include diverted waste food from our social supermarket. We hope to have a complete World Harvest Dream Village project plan at the end of two years including agency partnerships and timeline. In five years, we hope to have identified a site, raised grant funds and secured funding partners, and completed the permitting process. Ideally, in five years, the Dream Village will be under construction. We will continue to activate the 5,000 Los Angeles residents activated through this process. 

In five years, we hope to have established World Harvest as a thought leader in ending homelessness and hunger. We hope to see the all-inclusive, wraparound service, authentic community village model become the norm rather than the exception in Los Angeles. Once the project plan is complete, we will work with the residents we have activated to identify organizations and neighborhoods that will replicate the Dream Village, personalizing the model for the individual needs of each neighborhood. ","[""Access to healthy food"",""Healthcare access"",""Housing affordability""]","We all dream of living the village life, but we love our big city, too. The World Harvest Dream Village is a place where you can have it all: Affordable housing, groceries and restaurants, healthcare on site, jobs and job training, a maker space and small business incubator, a credit union with microloans, free bikes and Wi-Fi, multigenerational housing, artists-in-residence, community gardens, participatory budgeting projects, and other elements of a healthy, thriving, authentic village community — located in the big city. 
 
 
 
 We are not reinventing any wheels. These elements all pre-exist. Our innovation is to bring them together with affordable housing, which is made possible by the passage of County Measure H and City Proposition HHH, which provide funds to build affordable housing. We’ll stretch these dollars by bringing in additional partners to fund the build. Activating Angelenos to help plan this project will raise awareness that there is a better way to live, that we can live our dreams, and that it’s up to us to build it for ourselves. We can do it!
 
 
 
 Food, housing, and healthcare are the top three metrics addressed by the proposed project. Over a third of households in Central L.A. experience food insecurity, and a sixth experience hunger — among the highest rates in L.A. County. A combination of rising rents, barriers to building affordable housing, and stagnant wages has resulted in a humanitarian crisis of homelessness and housing insecurity. L.A.’s poorest residents pay more than half of their income to stay housed. Universal access to healthcare remains out of reach. The proposed project addresses these issues through a replicable, modular Dream Village model.

8102140,8102140,Nuestros Murales Unidos,"Through Nuestros Murales Unidos, communities in Central LA will come together to design public art spaces that reflect the communities themselves and serve as a space for gathering and collaboration.","Nuestros Murales Unidos will activate communities in Pico-Union and Westlake to beautify neighborhoods and unite people through public art, working with local residents and artists to design and paint murals. A summer youth program will work with local businesses to revitalize storefronts, while motivating the next generation of leaders. These worksâ€”designed and painted by localsâ€”will connect the community in a collective process and reclaim streets as a collaborative public space.","Nuestros Murales Unidos will paint five neighborhoods in Central Los Angeles with public art, fostering connection through a collective process and depictions of community pride in public space. We will work in Pico-Union and Westlake, bringing the community together to choose five areas to turn into a â€œmuseum mile,â€ each featuring 2-4 murals. YPIâ€™s Community Engagement Coordinator will work closely with local artists, including YPIâ€™s partner Juan Reyes, to activate residents and work together towards designs that showcase community identity and resilience. We will distribute a community feedback form through local schools, YPI afterschool programs, and door-to-door canvassing to get widespread input. Reyes will use this input to make an initial design, which will be available for public review. Parents who are active on YPIâ€™s Safe Routes to School Task Forces will be engaged to give input and activate their friends and family to participate in the mural process. Once a design is finalized, volunteers will work with Reyes at a community event to prepare the wall and paint the mural. The Museum Miles will activate community members at every stage of the process, offering volunteer opportunities and culminating in a large community cultural event in a public space.
Nuestros Murales Unidos will also create a summer program for local students to participate in beautification. The program will be run by the Community Engagement Coordinator and held each weekday for an hour. Students will work with local businesses to talk about the appearance of their storefront, offering to repaint shabby exterior walls with simple designs or place decorated potted plants outside. The summer program will activate the next generation of community leaders, empowering students with a sense of responsibility to their community and the tools to take action. Parents and community members will be encouraged to help with designing and creating these smaller works.
Throughout the process, we will work with community members and partner organizations to kick off a social media campaign using the artworks as a focal point for community pride. #MuralesUnidos and #OurMurals will give this project a unified online presence, and carry connections created through the design process online. Angelenos across the city will be connected to the art through Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, and encouraged to start similar projects in their own communities. By offering meaningful volunteer opportunities and cultural events in community spaces, YPI hopes to provide resources for these communities to come together and create something that truly represents them. The collaborative murals will serve as a visual representation of the communityâ€™s pride and resilience, as well as the power of collective action. These worksâ€”chosen, designed, and painted by localsâ€”will reclaim streets as a collaborative public space, a canvas for public engagement led by a new generation of community leaders.","Nuestros Murales Unidos will create a clear path of engagement, moving from social media interaction to campaigning for change at neighborhood council meetings. The first step will be activating people online, targeting Angelenos countywide to like or share social media posts about the art. The project will activate the local community to post original content about the artworks, including pictures and descriptions of how the art represents them. #MuralesUnidos and #OurMurals will unite content in an online community, and all promotional materials will use the hashtag.

The summer program will activate students, administrators, and local business owners, creating partnerships for neighborhood beautification. Business owners will be key stakeholders, and encouraged to engage in other aspects of the project.

Local residents will be activated to participate in designing and painting the murals. Bilingual forms will be sent out to students and families, and staff will canvas to widen the projectâ€™s reach. This process will emphasize community ownership of the project, and lead to large volunteer turnout at mural creation events.

In each neighborhood, we will encourage those who are most passionate to join together in a Task Force that will canvas for community input, rally friends and family to attend events, and campaign for any needed City approval. The Task Force will receive capacity-building training to attend neighborhood council meetings and lead the charge for change.","Activation will be tracked at each level of engagement to reach the goal of involving 100,000 Angelenos. Social media impressions for posts by YPI, as well as all related content with #MuralesUnidos and #OurMurals will be tracked weekly, and compiled into Excel sheets that will be analyzed quarterly to determine progress.
YPI will track the number of completed community feedback surveys, flyers given to students and families, and community members volunteering at mural events. These numbers will be analyzed in quarterly STAT Reports that track progress towards annual outcomes. Nuestros Murales Unidos will aim to reach 100 community members through canvassing, give flyers to 400 students, and engage 100 volunteers in each area.
Additionally, YPI will track the number of student participants in Nuestros Murales Unidos summer program through enrollment forms, with a goal of enrolling 100 students over two years. Students will activate business owners, whose activation will be tracked by the Community Engagement Coordinator. The Community Engagement Coordinator will also be responsible for tracking the number of community members activated in each Task Force, with a goal of 20 community members in total.

Successful activation will be defined by a community-driven process and murals made by and for local residents. Our vision of success also includes a widespread social media campaign that will activate Angelenos across the county to reach the goal of engaging 100,000 people.","Nuestros Murales Unidos is only the beginning: in five years, we hope this project will inspire communities across Los Angeles to come together and revitalize their neighborhoods. We envision collaborative public art as a gateway to more community campaigns, led by engaged community leaders who received capacity-building training from Nuestros Murales Unidos. Students activated through our summer program will grow up with a sense of responsibility for their community and lead the drive for change. We hope that murals in Pico-Union and Westlake will make the neighborhoods as visually vibrant as the communities that live there.

,,MoonBus is a traveling art installation and research lab hybrid ,,"Driven by unbound imagination, MoonBus is a lab facility and cultural venue that, powered by its own functional artistic adoptions of exclusive, industrial technologies, creates an accessible and mobile experience. MoonBus will integrate technologies capable of conserving our biosphere, as it supports the curiosity that instigates a culture of positive and generous integration with each other, our planet, its inhabitants and our cosmos through captivativating, awe-inspiring interactive art.","Like LA, MoonBus is a frontier for the exploration of our world and beyond, capable of harnessing and bridging unreached boundaries through creative, all-ages entertainment and engagement. With its pertinent messages, utopian aspirations, achievable goals and useful outputs, MoonBus redefines PLAY as a mechanism for solving the most pressing â€˜Glocalâ€™ issues through fun and curiosity. MoonBus is itself a product of the unique hybrid LA offers geographically and culturally, whilst it forges new pathways into LAâ€™s potential as a clean, prosperous, equanimous and balanced city. MoonBus can build the future of LA through its fundamental playfulness, thus it is resonant with its envisioned future. 

MoonBusâ€™ ability to achieve its PLAY agenda lies partly in its configuration as both research facility and art installation within the same space; prototypes can be used and/or integrate with art programming and other facets of the bus and its services directly from the test bench making it fun and accessible to create otherwise seemingly inaccessible devices and systems.

With an eye on fun for all ages, MoonBus events will be held as workshops, lectures, art shows, live experiments, screenings, meditations, sound baths, deep listening sessions, camping expeditions and informal gatherings facilitated by MoonBus and special guests and collaborators from a wide variety of fields at the new and full moon. Selected events will be ticketed at a variety of prices reflecting the anticipated audience and cost of showing, others will be free, or charge a nominal fee. When MoonBus is out of city quarters, events will include camping activities. Annual and bi-annual memberships will be offered, providing reduced fee access to certain events. Schools may participate in learning-exchanges where students help with archiving and MoonBusâ€™ general maintenance in exchange for workshops, lectures and other curriculums. Institutions in association with MoonBus may schedule their own events. MoonBus will offer visits to venues, festivals, institutions, or private establishments,schools, libraries and other venues in underprivileged areas for specially prepared workshops, learning-exchanges or any of the above mentioned categories of events. Any member of the public can apply to become a MoonBus facilitator or collaborator. MoonBus will collect and disseminate VR experiences of its research trips to be portrayed as immersive experiences, or simply as documentary material for world-wide access to its activities. MoonMusic will stream live internet and radio broadcasts. MoonBusâ€™ interactive immersive art installation will provide an ongoing and evolving experience of its innovations and developments. A nominal subscription service to MoonBusâ€™ data outputs for non-commercial purposes will be available. Prototypes and demonstrations will be available on parr with their development. MoonBus events may take place in the field, or city. 
","MoonBus is open to the public and intends to become a resource as an open educational lab facility and cultural venue that, powered by its own functional artistic adoptions of exclusive, industrial technologies, creates an accessible and tangible glimpse into conserving a pre-apocalyptic biosphere in a post-apocalyptic world through captivativating, awe-inspiring interactive art. 

MoonBus events may take place in the field, or city. It can be one of a fleet of such vehicles in the creation of a networked, mobile, global archiving, innovation and implementation vessel for art, technology and ecology. MoonBus travels to educate and instigate locally-driven community enterprises by way of providing long-term financial strategies, manufacturing know-how and technology transfer.

","Attendance, participant response, data, technical successes, other activities spurred as a result of MoonBus influence, public engagement, rate of return, membership applications, volunteer numbers, event and curriculum participation requests, local community involvement.
","In five years, we anticipate advancements in the technologies, art programming, and social notions that MoonBus will host. We envision the success of MoonBus generating the financial and public support to create a networked mini-fleet of MoonBusses. Operating in different parts of the world, connected to each other and the rest of the globe via the internet and expeditions, the MoonBus fleet would serve to forge entryways into more permanent and significant community engagements. These engagements, initially directed by Children of Wild collaborative initiatives, serve educate and instantiate community enterprises. An example would be the launching of local, collaborative manufacturing enterprises where communities receive training, technology transfer and other guidance for the installation and maintenance of MoonCell energy systems. Such systems provide clean, cheap electricity from municipal waste and are able to integrate with renewable technologies so as to benefit the local environment. 

MoonBus aims to leave in its wake, the implementation of other Children of Wild projects and services, such as ORBS Hybrid Interactive Wilderness Domes, which, run on MoonCell and other such urban life support systems, offer integrated initiation hubs whilst offering its other benefits, such as safe play areas and ecological connection sanctuaries.

,,Ucivity App - Crowdsourced Public Spaces ,,"We will build a revolutionary app that enables a true bottom-up approach to public space improvement. The app gives any Angeleno regardless of age, race, or ties to local government an opportunity to be heard and actively participate in shaping public spaces. Citizens, neighborhood organizations and local officials will be able to use 
Ucivity to create together hundred and thousands of unique public space solutions in the city and activate millions of Angelenos. ","Eric Garcetti, Mayor of City of Los Angeles once said that the cityâ€™s small issues are the hardest to solve, not the large infrastructure challenges like freeways or subways. 

Currently, it is impossible for local governments to know about every single hyper-local need in every community, especially when the decision makers do not live in the community. However it is local government that makes the majority of the public space improvement decisions â€“ often with little to no information about the communityâ€™s needs and without the input of those who live in the community and will be the end-users. 

Ucivity aims to solve this challenge with a bottom-up approach to public space improvement. Ucivity empowers any Angeleno, regardless of age, race, or ties to local government with an opportunity to be heard and actively participate in shaping public space.


Ucivity is a free social app that puts the end-users in the driverâ€™s seat. The app helps Angelenos point out and confirm public space needs in the community, organize themselves around hyper-local needs, brainstorm creative solutions, crowdfund a project if needed, and get officials to act through healthy social pressure. The gamification of the app makes the user-experience fun and rewarding.

Due to shortage of funds in the city, many great public space projects never become a reality. 

To help solve the funding gap, Ucivity implements a state of the art civic crowdfunding mechanism that gives Angelenos more control over the public space destiny as the funds go directly to the projects they were raised for. 

One of the big challenges of crowdfunding platforms is that many people have no experience running a successful campaign. Through Ucivity, users who have previously run successful campaigns are rewarded for being mentors to newbies. Mentorship can significantly increase crowdfunding success rate and as a result increase the number of quality spaces to play in LA. 

On Ucivity neighborhood organizations and non-profits can effectively engage with communities and post volunteer opportunities which are matched with local volunteers.


Local officials can use the app to learn about most important public space needs and prioritize accordingly. Because the app makes community needs transparent, it keeps local officials accountable and encourages them to work in the interest of their constituents.

As citizens engage and take pride in the public spaces they actively helped create - maintenance costs, waste, vandalism, and crime, all decrease.

With Ucivity, Angelenos can, not only improve the quality of the over 3,000 existing public parks, beaches, school yards, and streets in LA county, but also identify and bring to life unique spaces that do not exist yet. This helps significantly increase the number of quality, intergenerational, and vibrant spaces in Los Angeles","The free Ucivity app can be used by anyone in LA. While the app will benefit every community in LA, we will begin on-boarding underserved communities first as these communities can achieve the greatest impact.

We will conduct training sessions at public parks throughout the county to ensure an initial critical mass of users become expert users. We will train neighborhood organizations on how to engage the community and attract more volunteers. 

To further accelerate activation, we will help neighborhood organizations and city departments utilize Ucivity for planned projects. This could entail, for example, running a community outreach to obtain ideas from end-users for a new proposed park. This approach will provide planners and designers with invaluable user-centric information that shall be used to create spaces Angelenos will love.  

We plan to collaborate with the Department of Recreation and Parks to help improve quality of over 3,000 parks in LA County. To showcase the magnitude of impact Ucivity can create, we will run one of the first pilot projects at the Pan Pacific Park. The goal is to reactivate the park by converting a large eye-sore structure into an unique public art landmark. Via contest street artists submit proposals to the app and community members vote for the proposal they want to become a reality. A true crowdsourced solution as design and decision are provided by the community. This one project alone can activate over 100,000 park visits a year.","Success of the Ucivity app will be measured not only by utilization of the app itself and its ability to get Angelenos engaged in the process, but also by the quality of the end result and its ability to facilitate public space projects into fruition.

To measure engagement with the app and help improve ease of use, we will look at app usage metrics like number of active users and number of ideas submitted per day. 

To measure the success of geographic coverage but also help understand which areas need further activation, we will look at idea submissions per neighborhood, public parks, beaches and other geo-specific areas like LA River. 

To measure volunteer activation we will look at metrics like the number of volunteer opportunities posted and the number of confirmed volunteers.  

To measure the success of donor activation we will look at metrics like number of fully funded crowdfunding campaigns, total amount raised, and success rate of campaigns. A crowdfunded project indicates high probability of projectâ€™s installation and user-centric design.

To measure the role of Ucivity in adding vibrant, unique and intergenerational spaces to play in LA we will be tracking the number of public space installments initiated on Ucivity; type of improvements e.g. kids, seniors, arts, or sports; and number of public space improvements outside parks or beaches. 

Our analytic tools will show metrics in real-time and help us make strategic decisions about next activation steps.","5 years from now Ucivity will have activated millions of Angelenos and have created a paradigm shift in governance of public space.  
Majority of hyper-local projects in LA are going to be initiated on Ucivity and planned jointly by the community/end-users local government bodies. 

Los Angeles will see a significant increase in Angelenos utilizing public space as it was built exactly for their need. Each community will have developed itâ€™s unique public space fabric that represents perfectly its culture and needs.  

The app will become the number one go to tool for local governments and organizations to engage with communities and obtain user-centric data.  

5 years from now Ucivity will be used in cities nationally and internationally. The app will have expanded its functionality. Among other functionalities it will allow citizens participate in and vote on items at public hearings via live stream.",,,,,,,
,,DIY 3D Printers for 2Âº School Science Departments,,3D printers will likely rival the microscope as an iconic fixture in a working science lab.  This project aims to introduce science teachers to 3D printing by guiding them through the assembly of one self replicating 3D printer over the course of one professional development day.,An obstacle faced by teachers in delivering new technology to students is lack of teaching training.  This project will allow members of a science department to learn about 3d printers by assembling a printer for the department over the course of one professional development day.,"Teach the teachers, and the teachers can teach not only their students, but also the community.",Success will equal one assembled 3d printer for every science department that would like one.,One printer for every science department in the county.,,,,,,,
,,A social movement about how we finish this sentence.,,Our goal is to make a documentary film that can be shown prior to a typical police community meeting.  There is something magical about a film where people will let go of their preconceived notions. Everyone agrees we have a problem and need to find solutions.  Unfortunately everyone shows up to these conversations to battle. This film will serve as an ice breaker to soften hearts and open minds only from there we can attack the problem not each other. ,There is such a disconnect currently with law enforcement and the communities they serve.  This is a way to bring them together in a social way sort of the cocktail party to meet and greet rather then the volatile community meetings when emotions are high after a shooting.,I want to reach all of LA.  Each division of law enforcement would have to opportunity to host an event at a theatre in that division.  I have a film distributor that will hold a screening.  So each city can directly talk to the officers that are answering their calls and discuss issues directly related to their neighborhood.,"It will be hard to measure the true success because it will be what doesn't happen.  It will be one person deciding to lead with compassion and humility instead of anger and fear.  However, the way I would be able to measure success is people showing up to the event.  It may just be a small seed that is planted something they can chew on in the days to come.  Or relationships built with officers and civilians that later proves to have helped down the line where they needed to rely on each other.",It is my hope that this becomes an annual or bi-annual event.  We can continue to build on relationships or make new.  Each year we could tackle current issues.  This could potentially serve as an example to other departments across the state or nation.,,,,,,,

,,A Community-Oriented Platform for Co-Creation,,"Current social media platforms employ a business model in which the user is the product and the advertiser is the customer, which in turn has led to spread of polarization, misinformation, passivity and fear.

Our goal is to bring the average back up and improve social media by delivering value through real life interaction and collaboration.  Our focus is to help communities organize, volunteer, fund raise, and participate in politics and we strongly believe we have the most efficient formula. ","As humans our need for connection is as fundamental as our need for food and water. Over 30% of the global population now uses some type of social media platform to connect and share information, in the US this number is at an astonishing 81%.

Our goal at inUnity is to guide this need for connection and turn it into an opportunity for collaboration. We use a simple formula to notify users of activities that they might be interested in that go beyond entertainment and tap into other interests such as political activism, volunteer opportunities and others.

How?

As new users log in they are taken to a screen that lets them select the type of of activities they are interested in being notified about.

Currently projects are done in private silos where needs and roadblocks are only known to a small amount of people immediately involved in the project. On our platform we open source the project creation process to crowdsource every type of person that can possibly help the project move forward faster.  

As a project is created on the platform the user selects the needs and metrics of the project which include, but are not limited to, funding dollars, team members, volunteers, or any other customizable metric.

Once the project goes live, the users on the network are notified of the project or opportunity based on their pre-selected preferences and can see the progress being made on it and if there is a need for their help in any way.

If this were to be applied to a rally for example, a starting user would create the project on the app and create a blueprint to what he or she is trying to accomplish and any other valuable information that could help communicate the idea.

Users are then notified of the rally and can communicate through the group chat to stay updated on the project.  Once the project is completed it can then be deleted or maintained as an open portal to communicate with those involved for further opportunities.

This formula can be applied to any kind of project in the platform and would help angelenos make meaningful connections with their fellow neighbors. ","We have community managers to onboard users that would create projects within the following initial verticals.

Local Political Activism to include Neighborhood Councils
Music Events
Comedy Events
Film & Television
Small Business

The reason for multiple verticals instead of just one is to give users a reason to use the platform for more than one type of interactive opportunity.

Once the initial round of users are on-boarded and we can guarantee content for other users to see we will start reaching out to the general population to create awareness of the platform and get the gears turning on activating the city.

","Number of downloads, activation rate, and monthly active users.

Given that this platform's purpose is collaboration and co-creation we can measure the success of the activation with these metrics.",We hope that in 5 years we can be a widely used action platform to help propel communities forward.  We intend in introducing other features that can further help individuals connect as we grow and helping organizations that advocate change get the exposure they need to reach their desire goals.  Our goal is to be at 100 million users by this time.,,,,,,,

,,HOLIGENT RECONSTRUCT EDUCATION,,We are participating in festivities such as the LA Times Festival of Books. We will promote the concept on college campuses to students and faculty.,"Holigent Reconstruct Education

What to do
Recruit students and instructors to introduce discussions in and out of classrooms about Holigent Reconstruct Education. The proposed discussions are aimed to explore the ""Why do it"" challenge and progress to discussing Societal Reconstruction to achieve peaceful systemic sustainability.

The ultimate goal of this discussion series is that by 2050 courses in the subject of Holigent Reconstruct America to achieve social, economic and environmental justice, quality and systemic sustainability will be offered in schools across the nation. Our proposal is to plant the seed of this innovation in education in Los Angeles campuses. We offer a puzzle-game to help start the discussion and a book to facilitate the learning. For metrics, we will be counting the number of discussion groups and classes that take up the subject.

Why do it
Because techno-industrial capitalist consumerism on a nuclear armed planet will not last but is heading to its catastrophic end. Yet higher educational institutions are turning out high-end consumers, on an industrial scale, credentialed to fuel economic growth and work the levers and gears of capitalism â€” an unsustainable concept on our planet.

How to do it
In time, years of discussion and courses should lead to universities turning out credentialed systemic solutioneers. Sometime before 2050 higher educational institutions will hopefully come to the conclusion that societal reconstruction to secure universal quality of life and peaceful systemic sustainability must be demonstrated beyond the classroom. Accordingly, they will construct experimental/ teaching campuses to demonstrate cellular, self-directed, all green, live/learn/work, pedestrian communities with hybrid economies and social contracts to secure enduring peaceful resilience. We aim to plant the seed and nurture the proposed education and societal innovation for peaceful systemic sustainability take root and develop in Los Angeles.


Note: Holigent is coined from holistic and emergent, a concept of self-organization following the lead of natural evolutionary self-organization â€” the essence of which is doing the essential most with the least of resources without waste. Embedding this concept into human affairs, starting with education, may be a significant step toward peaceful and equitable systemic sustainability in creating thriving and enduring communities. 
",We will stage portable exhibits on high school  and college campuses across Los Angeles about Holigent Reconstruct Education. Encouraging students to demand classes that prepare them to become Systemic Sustainability Solutioneers rather than consumers fueling (unsustainable) capitalist consumerism that is killing our planet.  ,Will count the number of classes offering the proposed hybrid educational and societal reconstruction programs.,In five years we expect that a number of campuses will have ongoing discussions and or classes offered preparing students to become Systemic Sustainability Solutioneers.,,,,,,,

,,Outside the Box - open-sourced solutions for the world's most evasive problems.  ,,"Problems in our city are solved at tables far from the citizens they affect, and the decision-makers are often limited by their own experiences. OTB aims to activate our communities through direct democracy. For each problem that our citizens seek solutions to, we bring together a cross-sectoral group of minds to lend their expertise. The solutions they derive are published, iterated upon, and voted on by the public - thus, vetting ideas in the greater community before breaking ground on them.","Outside the Box hosts and facilitates in-person community problem solving sessions focused on specific issues the community is facing. Over the course of a few impactful hours, the participants are led through a Design Thinking exercise catered for civic/community problem solving. The host creates a safe space for idea generation, and encourages participants not to just think outside the box, but to â€œcreate as if the box never existedâ€. Creativity is made easier by the makeup of the group. The Table Sessions are curated to include individuals from different professional sectors and walks of life with limited exposure to the problem and its historical limitations. An issue â€œexpertâ€ is available to which the group can ask clarifying questions and gain any critical context needed to generate solutions. These in-person engagements are facilitated in a way that draws out ideas and connects the participants to a common cause. Sessions are held bi-weekly and include 10-15 people - thus directly engaging atleast 260-390 Angelenos per year in community problem-solving. Once a solution is generated at a â€œTable Sessionâ€, it is uploaded to a digital community forum - offering the larger community a chance to connect with each other and engage in solution-making. Citizens in the greater community can comment on, add to, and iterate upon any idea generated during the session.  After the solution is refined and vetted by the people it will eventually impact, it is shared with government officials and/or private citizens to implement - thus activating citizen entrepreneurs and making government officials more aware and responsive to the will of the people. As citizens see their ideas rise to the top of government agendas, they will have a stronger sense of responsibility in their local democracy, and when they see their ideas on the ballot, they will be more likely to turn out to vote.

Signing up for the OTB community online is easier than voting, and it is a great civic entry point. An individual can engage in various ways - by joining a â€œTable Sessionâ€ in person, contributing to the iteration of solutions online, digitally voting on proposed solutions, or sharing the solutions with their larger social network. This process gives citizens a seat at the table that may otherwise feel exclusionary. It engages them in the democratic process and gives them a sense of ownership in what happens in their city. OTB generates creative and innovative ideas for the civic space. Most importantly, it allows our government and other decision-makers to get real-time feedback from ALL of its citizens - testing policies and interventions in the public before spending time and money implementing them. It allows the city to hear the voices and leverage the gifts of ALL of its people to solve its most evasive problems.","OTB engages a diverse population in solution-making and it is designed to be radically inclusive. The OTB community crosses generational, racial, educational, professional, and economic lines. It aims to engage ALL Angelenos, and eventually, ALL citizens in direct democracy. OTB employs Design Thinking in its community problem solving sessions, and it leverages an online community forum with digital voting to vet and refine generated solutions. It also employs social media as an educational and engagement tool to spread awareness about issues and increase engagement in solutions.","Success for Outside the Box will be measured in multiple ways. The primary reason for its existence is to bring diverse citizens to the solution-making table. We define success first by the number of citizens that take part in our community via live events, digital interactions on our platform, and social media engagement. Second, we measure the effectiveness of our model by the number of solutions that are vetted and refined by the community.

Specifically in our first year, we will 1) launch the OTB online platform, 2) host bi-weekly Table Sessions, and 3) see Angeleno engagement reach 5% of the population. Engagement is defined as the sum # of people that attend live sessions, # of digital engagements in online platform, # social media likes, shares and interactions, # of unique solutions generated, and # of people directly influenced by solution implementation. 

In our second year, we will refine and expand our reach based on year-one learnings. We will explore expansion to a B2B model, directly engaging civic organizations to help them solve in-house problems preventing them from achieving greater impact. We would like to see Angeleno engagement in OTB reach 10% of the population by the end of year two.","In five years, I hope that Outside the Box has engaged at least 75% Angelenos in some part of the community problem-solving process. I hope that it has generated visible and meaningful solutions in the civic space, and I hope that it is seen as a valuable resource for government officials and entrepreneurs alike to hear from the public. It is my dream that Angelenos set the tone for a new radically inclusive and innovative democracy that can be scaled to other cities across the nation and even across the world. I see Outside the Box creating a cultural current of active citizenship and inclusive community problem solving. ",,,,,,,
,,"Meet The Youngs, a community center for young creatives that aims to self-empower communities.",,"We want to open our first physical community center in Los Angeles County to empower marginalized creatives with the infrastructure they need to live & work creatively.

Our space will provide equipment creatives can borrow, facilities they can use, and serve as an offline platform for them to share work, gain business, and meet community-members.

We'll host workshops that inform, exhibitions that showcase, and community meetings to generate financial and social capital for creative projects.","Our community center will function as a critical bridge between high school graduation and entry into the creative economy. Per the 2017 Otis Report on the Creative Economy in Los Angeles, 759,000 jobs were generated earning $56.9 billion in total labor income. There are three main components to the creative economy. (1) The businesses and individuals involved in producing cultural, artistic, and design goods and services, (2) organizations that provide a venue for artists to share their work, and (3) the support system that nurtures and sustains creative activity.

The community center we plan to build is a needed part of the support system that nurtures and sustains creative activity. After high school graduation, having access to free or low-cost support of a creative career is not yet a reality. 

We would achieve this possibility by leasing or buying a space in an underserved creative community - Jefferson Park, Arlington Heights, West Adams, and Downtown Pomona are all being considered as imprints. At this space, we will offer a range of resources to young creatives in our immediate and extended vicinity. The services and amenities available would include meeting and work spaces, free public wifi, tech equipment and creative supplies, photography and film studio space, and weekly events (galleries, lectures, fairs, workshops, trade shows, concerts, conferences, etc). A low-cost membership fee will maintain operating expenses and support our plans of investing in creative projects. Members and non-members will be able to apply for investments in their creative projects on a quarterly application cycle.

Mobilizing Angelenos is at the crux of our plan. By building this physical community center we are creating a door to creative and professional advancement, a vehicle for cultural activism, and tool for local civic good. Through our project, we aim to bring together people who aren't in the same room enough to strike up dialogues and create empathy. We want to provide a safe space for exhibiting and developing creative voices. And we want to match our social or educational investment in creative projects with a financial component. Each of our community meetings will operate like Kickstarter, serving as a crowdfunding platform for someoneâ€™s creative project. Ticket sales to meetings will be re-invested into developing creative ideas.

Meet The Youngs will make LA the best place to create by developing the infrastructure to help young creatives progress socially and financially in the creative economy. Our plan would not only benefits thousands of young creatives it also benefits thousands of LA-based businesses, and the millions of people who will be affected by what they create.","Our approach to engaging Angelenos will be hosting a series of meetings at our community center. We've already begun organizing these meetings in a pop-up format as a beta test and have been successful in mobilizing young creative communities. From our beta test, we've improved our strategies and tactics and have discovered how to effectively connect with this population and build environments for them that make LA the best place to create.

The population we serve is typically 18-29, a mix of junior college students, four-year university students, recent college grads, and emerging professionals. They live throughout LA County, have varying amounts of knowledge or success in the creative economy, and don't have the adequate resources or structure needed to create.

The first strategy to serving them is bringing together people from various social circles, creative industries, and socioeconomic status. This mix of people creates social equity for everyone in the group and improves the likelihood of learning something new or getting a job.

Another lesson is ensuring the space is comprised of multiple rooms that offer different experiences. This approach to spatial design focuses the activities that occur in each room.

Finally, we implemented a crowdfunding component to our meetings in order to match the human capital we're facilitating with financial capital - cash investments in creative projects. This mix of approaches is what makes our activation unique and effective.","We will prioritize depth and consistency of engagement over breadth and reach when it comes time to measuring success for our community center.

This means seeking sustained engagement from our community members. We'd track measurements such as length of time in the center, number of consecutive visits, and the number of members referring other members.","In five years, the hope for Meet The Youngs as an organization would be to operate more than one community center in Los Angeles in order to create interplay between communities in different parts of the city. We'd hope to have incubated creative companies fully-owned by members of our community center and to have given thousands of young people access to the creative economy - getting jobs, launching business ventures, and publishing creative works.

Beyond LA County, we plan to align our efforts with other underserved creative communities who are in the shadows of their city's creative industries. We're planning to start by organizing community meetings for creatives in cities like New York and Chicago and aspire to open additional community centers there as well.",,,,,,,
,,Direct Assault on Threat,,"The proposal includes setting up three conferences (one for each of the three countries) in which professionals from LA and the respective countries would engage in discussions on issues of health, law and business.",TBD,TBD,TBD,We hope to improve relations and cooperation with the subject countries.,,,,,,,
,,"Hip Hop & Walls For All
Where paint, beats, words & moves, collide with pride!",,"We want to build a plaza where mural making, percussion and performance all happen in the same public place. We see this open to everyone to work out their skills, showcase their work or just hang out together in an environment that is conducive to creating live. We know that this will draw young ""risk taking"" brains, like teenagers, just like roaming the streets do but this will harness that energy and elevate it in ways that has them left feeling great about themselves.","This first plaza will break ground on Los Angeles being the first city in the country to embrace a public problem with a solution that is daring and dynamic in the same way that the city actually is underneath it's Hollywood veneer. This concept will give rise to unbridled social networking, happenings will occur to unite friends in ways that parks are supposed to do but seldom give support to the arts. The kicker though is that it will also help shift the paradigm of understanding that the ARTS are so tightly choreographed inside of SPORTS, that mastery and muscle memory and practice are at the core of all their greatness. The paradigm will assist Los Angeles in shifting it's already stellar Recs and Parks inclusion for sport toward the one thing that it's so well known for - the visual and performing arts. Our idea is not just for parks it's for open spaces, which happen to be plentiful in parks but we can also see these in public transportation hubs and civic centers throughout the city. The message of inclusion for art, dance, poetry, percussion, and more to happen openly will hug the kids who we know are feeling alienated by the ""pay to play"" type of locations for this kind of working out.

We will know that it's effective because we will ask them to check in on social media, but nothing that will track them, just count. While our focus behaviorally is on young people 10-25, we know that this is a very young at heart city and we thoroughly expect that these plazas will be used by anyone who wants to spin on a stage or tap out a beat. Anyone who wants to propose with a mural behind them which was painted that day only for that day... with their friends playing drums on the percussion instruments. 

We have seen how much money the city spends in graffiti abatement and we will closely watch our 311 phone calls to note if they go up or go down in neighborhoods where there are these walls and plazas exist. 

We know that LA wants to give this money to 5 ideas and that you might even be looking for something in particular, or have a notion of what LA needs. We have studied this specific solution to graffiti and young people's need to connect to this city in positive ways for over eight years. We know that there are zero solutions which touch on their friend groups, their affinity for being outdoors, their social structure which has them wanting to be seen, heard and shared as well as their unmonitored home life. 

This city has a chance to hug them in ways that it never has, by opening it's arms to their form of self-expression, knowing fully that if they have a chance to express the first layer of how they are feeling, freely, that they will be open to positive influence and education after it. If we keep shutting them down, saying they can't be seen, heard or that they don't have what it takes, because money isn't in their hands to practice, then they will continue to own the city in their own way. 

This project will change their course.","We will use high schools where we teach M2ART & DESIGN and sites where we have M2ART4ALL implemented to tell people where these plazas are and what they could do there. We will engage other organizations, like GetLit, and TheGR818ers and other musical orgs which focus on this demographic and self expression to plan events and to tell their audiences. 

We know that there are many other influences to hit other demographics, like Frances Anderton at KCRW who love design and urban development. We know that students and teachers could use it to showcase their lessons. 

We know that the Olympics will soon be swirling around us and this is a dynamic place for public interaction and engagement. Nothing like this has ever been done permanently in Los Angeles nor have we seen it in any other city in the U.S. or Western Europe. It's truly groundbreaking in theory and concept.

We know that there are tools like geo-cashing and games like Pokemon Go that look for areas like this, we already have been tagged at our sites in NOHO for our mural making. 

This is truly an ""If we build it they will come"" concept. What a better place to showcase such a thing. New York doesn't even do it yet and that is the home to Broadway and the MOMA... the home of graffiti and hip hop. They don't have it yet, but they will because our co-founder is already at work with his home town, talking to the parks department there. Imagine this in Central Park, too. 

As LA goes, so goes the nation.","Success is a perceptive measure when you are building something that no one is asking for directly. It's like eating well. The measure is in how you feel and less like what your blood count is. 

We will know if this works if it is being used. If we note and count how many times the artwork changes or how often we see a collection of people at the site.

Our friends in organizations will aide us by noting their participation as well. We will survey people through volunteer weekends where the specific engagement will be to document how people are using the site and with what regularity. We will do this once every six weeks until we feel that it has a pattern of use that is deemed equal to park statistics for a field or court.

We will also measure it times 1000 if other areas ask for more of them. Should we multiply by only one, that will be an exponential shift in the cities participation in the arts and live art component to self-expression.

If we see four new pieces of art or murals worked on per month, that is success. If we see people tapping on the drums, even idylly, and if someone stands on the stage to mime a gesture... those are the beginnings of success for this project and it's impact on others.

Real success will be when we can teach at these sites and bring art education to them, just like AYSO brings coaches to a soccer field.","We hope that we have multiplied this in every major city in the country and that we have teachers in those same cities teaching our curriculums in high schools and in public spaces. We hope that we begin to have competitions at these sites instilling a desire to win and better one's self. We hope that we are an organization that is so fully funded that we can't find enough teachers to teach where the need is and that our students have to hurry to graduate college so they can return to teach.

And that workout walls in all parks are a norm... as normal as skateparks.",,,,,,,
,,Grow LA's creative economy with ARTWORK. ,,"We believe in creative freedom and access, which is why weâ€™re launching ARTWORKâ€“â€“a membership-based, fully-equipped shared studio and creative space designed for creatives to: get affordable access to space and resources to work on their craft, build community, become immersed in creative culture, and actively grow our creative economy.	","â€œEvery city, town, and business that relies on the output and impact of the creative economy and access to a healthy creative workforce should be concerned about the availability of affordable and appropriate space to incubate emerging talent and retain a competitive pool of creative workers.â€ - Artspace (California Arts Council). 

Finding affordable space is a problem for LA creatives. Creatives need facilities designed for creatives, and traditional coworking spaces arenâ€™t equipped for creative work. Access to professional equipment is expensive and can be difficult to acquire. And storing equipment takes valuable space. 

Our solutionâ€“â€“ARTWORKâ€“â€“a membership based, fully-equipped shared studio and creative space designed for creatives to: 
-Get flexible access to space and resources to work on and develop their craft 
-Build community, network, and become immersed in creative culture 
-Save money and hassle, allowing creatives to focus on their work, and leave the rest to us
-Actively grow our creative economy

Access to the proper space, equipment, and environment are important factors in growing our creative economy. In order to increase employment in the creative industries, we must grow and support the pool of viable candidates. By creating affordable access to professional studio space and equipment, coupled with creative workshops and networking opportunities, we can develop new and emerging talent ready to enter the creative workforce.

Communal culture has become a catalyst for high growth startups. We want to extend this model to the creative space. By creating shared studio spaces and access to resources, weâ€™ll create an environment for collaboration, exploration, and communityâ€“â€“all important drivers in startup success.   

Art is culture. A creative environment is an inclusive environment and a reflection of the people. Inclusion in the workforce and creative economy are two of our top priorities. Through community outreach, and our diverse network of creative industry professionals, weâ€™ll provide a platform for the next group of creative leaders, entrepreneurs and business owners from all walks of life. 

","â€œThereâ€™s never been a social movement without artists at the tip of the sphere.â€- Yosi Sergant, co-creator of â€œInto Actionâ€ LA art festival. 

Art is activism. Creatives like Shepard Fairey and Tatyana Fazlalizadeh are examples of the mobilizing power of the arts. Our goal is to mobilize the LA creative community, which includes creatives from all 12 super sectors of the creative industry: architecture/interior design, art galleries, communication arts, digital media, entertainment, fashion, decorative arts, industrial design, publishing & printing, toys, visual & performing arts, and arts schools. Through ARTWORKâ€™s collective of creatives, weâ€™ll put our talents together to shape and activate the surrounding LA community through: 
-City rejuvenation projects: murals & public art 
-Providing creative resources for local issues & PSA campaigns (according to Matrix Media, just one LA billboard unit can receive nearly 96,953 impressions per week) 
-Community art shows and public gallery

ARTWORK is not just a collaborative studio space for creatives to work on their craft, itâ€™s putting artists to work in the community for a better LA.    

","Success should be measurable. Weâ€™ll measure our impact through three key factors: 
1. Number of ARTWORK membership signups: ARTWORK creative members will be the driving force behind our activations. Our goal is to increase membership by 50% each year to grow a vibrant community of creative talent.
2. Number of attendees to community events and activations: Through email captures, RSVPs, counter clickers, and additional tracking systems, weâ€™ll be able to count the number of Angelenos activated at our in person events, such as creative networking nights, workshops, masterclasses, and art shows. Our goal is to double attendance from Year 1 to Year 2.
3. Number of social and media impressions: Using social media tools weâ€™ll track engagement on our social platforms. Our goal is to increase followers and impressions by 50% each quarter.
",Within 5 years our goal is to grow and expand ARTWORK to additional major creative markets in California and the U.S.  ,,,,,,,
,,At Brick we make it fun to take a vacation from our phones for a little every day.,,"Our phone habits have turned into compulsions, if not even full-fledged addictions. At Brick, we say itâ€™s time to take back our time. Using the most recent research in habit change, we combat distraction and distress from technology by making it fun to take a vacation from our phones for a little every day. Our products and services include phone-free events, a recommendation engine for phone-free businesses and activities, and a mobile app that rewards you for the time you spend off your phone.","Our technology is amazing, and its no surprise Americans spend upwards of 10 hours a day on our phones. But this has come at a cost. We have replaced real-world relationships with digital ones, and as a society we are somehow now more stressed, anxious, lonely, and more unsatisfied than ever before. Millions of us realize we need to spend less time on our phones, but there is no structure in place to make it fun, easy, and social. Brick challenges the LA community to Brick (TM) their phones for a little bit every day. To Brick your phone means to disconnect it from the grid for at  least an hour a day, turning it into a brick, and go to something engaging in the real world. We make it fun an easy to do this with our phone-free events like dinner parties and game nights, through our mobile app that rewards you for the amount of time you spend off your phone, and through our recommendation engine that supports and recommends other businesses that are phone-free, like yoga studios, meditation studios, restaurants and cafes that don't want you to be distracted.","We are putting all our efforts into making LA the primary hub for Brick. We are partnering with a large number of businesses and locations that support the idea of disconnecting to reconnect by spending daily Brick Time, and are growing a community of people who support the mission. We want to decentralize the process by allowing anyone to their their own phone-free activity, promoting meaningful connections and social bonding. We are developing various phone-free activities for Los Angelinos like sunset hikes, escape rooms, dinner parties, camping trips, cooking classes, and more. ","We measure success through increase in subscribers to our community (via www.gobricknow.com). We also measure success through ticket sale and partnership revenue. We also measure success qualitatively through our surveys. During onboarding our community fills out a survey about how detrimental their phone is to their health. Questions such as, ""Do you wish you spent less time on your phone?"" allow us to measure stress and then measure again months later to gauge improvement and increased feelings of balance and wellbeing amongst the community. ","In five years, we hope that Brick Time will be part of our cultures common vernacular, but more important, that spending structured time off our phones will be as much of a daily routine as brushing our teeth. For our health, and the survival of humankind.",,,,,,,
