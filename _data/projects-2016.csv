The grant funds will be used for the purchase of still and video camera equipment and PC computers to be used directly by the students in our workshops to create and develop their own 3-D images and content. Funds will also be used to purchase the cell phones and virtual reality viewers used to show the created content for use in classes, public presentations, and events. And grant money will be used to fund the actual costs of these classes, including facility and equipment rentals, advertising and promotion, and additional outreach opportunities.

The classes, workshops, and presentations will be open to all residents of the greater Los Angeles region, and specific classes and workshops will focus on 3-D arts and history education for youth, adult, and senior populations. The digitized archival media will be made available both to the students enrolled in these classes, and online in order to reach a broad local population. The creative 3-D media created by the students in these classes will be presented at public events throughout Los Angeles, and will also be made available online in order to reach a broad local population.

Research has shown that students who study STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) become better problem solvers, innovators, inventors and logical thinkers. Studies also show that Students who study the arts are more likely to be academic achievers with strong skills in creativity and innovation, critical thinking and problem solving, and communication and collaboration. Arts specific education is on the decline, but arts conected to STEM (STEAM) through mutually-reinforcing objectives deepens learning in both areas.

The proposed plan can be scaled to include increased frequency and availability of presentations, classes and workshops citywide and countywide in order to provide creative opportunities to larger portions of the community. Specific topics and techniques can be expanded upon and programs can be individually tailored to meet the needs of specific populations. Our programs will also be able to supplement a broader STEAM curriculum in partnership with other arts and science organizations.

Our initiative will provide a contextual and factual foundation for an increase in the creation and use of 3-D content by the Los Angeles population. Our target populations will gain exposure to current digital technologies while learning the analog history of the medium. This knowledge will benefit the growing numbers of LA residents who will pursue careers in the numerous fields that are rapidly implementing 3-D imagery, including entertainment, medicine, design, and education.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/3-d-space-teaches-3-d-image-creation-from-analog-photography-to-digital-virtual-reality,

We are currently creating a minimum of two homes per week, 130 homes over the next 12 months.  We are powered by 3,000 volunteers giving over 300,000 hours annually.  

ASOH documents the effects of the home creation experience from beginning to end in multiple modalities.  A pre-assessment  is administered & again 6 months and then a year after the home creation. 

In 2 years all youth are still in homes, are on an upward trajectory in terms of career, education & emotional well being.

There are several formal psychological assessments that ASOH will be integrating into a more elaborate assessment process. These instruments measure areas that are important for these youth for their recovery from trauma and their life-long success in life. These are:
* The Emotional Quotient Test – measuring all aspects of emotional intelligence
* The Trauma Symptom Inventory
* The Tennessee Self-Concept Scale
* The Behavioral Rating Inventory for Executive Function (BRIEF)

Additionally ASOH is inviting outside assessments that might affect policy . For example APS Fellow Eldar Shafir of Princeton University published in Vol. 341 of Science, that individuals functioned 10 IQ points higher when they were not living in scarcity. The National Scientific Council Report attributes substandard housing and separation from parent(s), among the main factors that are toxic to the developing brain.","[""Money "",""Support of the city""]","ASOH brings together volunteers to serve as a family would utilizing donated furniture to create the youth’s first permanent living space.

ASOH is a solution being implemented by former foster youth, shoulder to shoulder with a swelling community of volunteers. ASOH is true grassroots community building. It began in LA and is ready to be replicated in every major city in the USA. The youth become inspired to be as successful as their new environment, move from an existence of scarcity and survival towards building a prosperous future (with the support of a community of care). 
Eliminating the financial impossibility of furnishing one’s home dramatically improves cognitive capacity & emotional intelligence & an uncluttered, organized, and serene home environment has been proven to significantly improve the productivity of an employee & student & the ability to build & form healthy relationships. 
Every 2 minutes a child enters foster care in the US. A large percentage of those kids are never adopted. Up to 35,000 age-out of the system each year having never been adopted. Aging out foster youth are more likely than those in the general population to 
• become incarcerated,  homeless, not finish high school, be unemployed, be dependent on public assistance , have addiction issues, & higher rates of PTS. Aging-out youth cost the US $8 billion/year.
LA County has the largest population of foster youth aging out of the system. A full 50% fall into homelessness. Resourceful former foster youth may secure Section 8 housing but with no support system to help them set up their first homes, their apartments are empty of furniture and basic necessities most people take for granted.  Having already endured lives of emotional and/or physical trauma, these young people have no sense of security.  They‘re left to fend for themselves, quite often sleeping, eating and studying on bare floors.  They store their belongings in plastic garbage bags.  Together, as a community, ASOH is a proven model to reduce youth moving back into homelessness, unemployment, incarceration, & mental health issues.
Each home creation is a true celebration of youth who beat the odds, and through ASOH they become agents of change.  The key is the human-to-human connection, one youth at a time, and the fact that they are both the drivers of the solution and the recipients of the outcome.  
Another important aspect of the ASOH model is the seamless experiential and powerful process of the home creation that provides a bridge between communities. Working side-by-side, adult volunteers become mentors to the youth and open career opportunities. The entire experience unearths youth’s sense of dignity, self-worth, & confidence. The completion of each home creation is celebrated with a housewarming party in which youth share their stories and educate the gathered through powerful spoken word poetry, original music and songs.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/creating-a-home-is-a-bridge-to-creating-community,

Specific programming activities include:

Sustainable Aquaculture:  CSR educates students in the importance of raising protein sources within ocean ranches and the sustainable methods for aquaculture.  The students learn about mollusk breeding programs and how to increase productivity and resilience to climate change for this valuable form of protein. 
  
Local Ocean Ecosystems: LAMI programs introduce students to the local ecosystem on tall ships. These rigged vessels were purposely built for youth education at sea.  In addition to offering a close-up look at marine life, the students become a part of a working sailboat crew learning the importance of teamwork, nautical navigation and the physics of sailing.

Ocean Exploration: OET’s President and Founder, Dr. Robert Ballard and OET bring the new frontier in ocean exploration to the students' classroom through telepresence technology. Telepresence connects scientists, teachers and students on shore to live images and real-time data from EV Nautilus and from their remotely operated vehicles working on the ocean floor. 

Blue Technologies: BR use Remote Operated Vehicles (ROVs) to present STEM lessons that emphasize critical thinking and the principles of engineering. Through lessons which consist of building and operating ROVs, students are encouraged to continue their education in engineering and math in middle and high schools and to explore careers in ocean robotics.

The AltaSea network brings STEM ocean experiences to students, inspiring them to pursue an education that will lead to careers in the expanding blue economy sector.

Need: Currently, low-income neighborhoods in Los Angeles lack safe spaces for children and families to gather and engage in physical activity and play. The actual or perceived safety of the environment is linked with an individual’s inclination to engage in physical activity and play. Crime and fear of crime are also barriers to physical activity and play. These barriers are further amplified when examining how they impact the behaviors of children and youth. “Safety concerns play an important role in how people respond to the built environment, with perception and fear of crime an important contributor to inactivity. Signs of disorderliness, such as broken windows, cue children to feel unsafe at school. Children of parents who report anxiety about neighborhood safety get less physical activity.”1 

The creation of safe turf play spaces where there is currently asphalt will change the built environment of underserved LA neighborhoods and increase physical activity of its residents, thus reducing the risk among adults to develop chronic diseases like heart disease and type II diabetes while reducing the risk in children to become overweight and/or obese. In addition, safe places to gather and play, build connection community and increase the social capital of neighborhood residents.2

Connecting Children to Art in Nature (CCAN) promotes multi-disciplinary explorations through a variety of settings with the sole purpose of providing a meaningful and artistic link between the child and nature. The comprehensive arts and nature educational program adheres to the State Board of Education’s model of integrating three modes of instruction:
• Subject centered
• Instruction connecting themes and other disciplines
• Instruction connecting the arts and other core subjects

Benefits of Art Experiences for Young Children:

By learning how to manipulate the variety of natural media and becoming masters of technique, children can better articulate their ideas and be empowered to communicate with visual language before they learn to read and write.  Under the supervision of the CCAN Art Specialist, the children would also be encouraged to think for themselves in creative ways and also to move ahead with their creations in a more sophisticated manner.  The CCAN Art Specialist would work together with ABACC teachers and be involved in helping them understand the process of how children learn through experiences with art and nature. 

Making Learning Visible:

Documentation would contribute to the extensiveness and depth of learning gained by the children from their work; make it possible for parents to become aware of their children’s experiences in school; provide opportunities for the teachers to sharpen and focus their attention on understanding what children know and their role in the children’s experiences; children can revisit their work to see what they are learning and their progress.  It is important for children’s work to be documented because this encourages children to move forward or expand in their work as opposed to having their experiences only be a fading memory. The staff will meet weekly with the CCAN Art Specialist to evaluate the creative experiences, what has been accomplished, what directions should the next project take, what art experiences have been most successful, what have been least successful, and any particular concerns.

Overall Benefits to ABACC:

By working with CCAN, the Anna Bing Arnold Children's Center would:
- Extend the range of art experiences it currently provides;
- Teach children to use a variety of art media to express themselves;
- Teach art techniques to children so they would be able to channel behavior to allow them to release pent-up feelings of energy or stress;
- Encourage children to feel a sense of accomplishment by creating art that is admired for its beauty and uniqueness;
- Teach children to experience new emotions that come from creating something that will not be judged as right or wrong.

Community Input: The goal of the workshop series is to visualize local residents’ desires and concepts for the future. It is a collaborative process that requires a deep conversation in co-designing future urban-based technologies or urban plans. Our success is determined by our ability to retain volunteer participants and engage them in compelling and creative ways. 
Design Complexity: The power of design is its ability to say complex things in simple ways. Our final design videos will be short, but need to present a holistic image of everyday life in our urban future. The videos must be able to present urban forms, technological interfaces, and civic activity in a compelling way. Our prototypes and final autonomous car design will also give concrete form to our provocative visions. 
Public Impact: The final goal of our workshops and our videos is to provoke public conversations. By creating videos, we’re able to present an accessible and naturalistic portrayal of a potential future. These portrayals can be screened and discussed locally, as well as shared online. The amount of widespread discussion or larger community feedback will prove the relevance of our urban model and solutions.","[""Money "",""Volunteers"",""Publicity/awareness"",""Education/training "",""Technical infrastructure (computers etc.)"",""Community outreach""]","The advent of new urban-based technologies means that the future form of Los Angeles will be unlike anything one can now imagine.  For example, how might self-driving vehicles and augmented reality be used to change our relationship to the city - to even change the city itself?

Technologists and students will work in groups with local visual artists, musicians, and residents to design urban prototypes, stories, and videos about the future of Leimert Park and South LA. 

For example, a video would show the power of autonomous vehicles, equipped with augmented reality windows, to give interactive history tours. As the vehicle drives through the neighborhood, passengers would see overlaid archival footage or holographic reenactments of jazz greats and past residents, like Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, and Ray Charles. Multi-channeled audio speakers in the vehicle would immerse the passengers in the intoxicating sounds of these local Leimert legends, bringing history to life.

Further scenarios may include paratransit vehicles for the elderly or disabled, self-driving karaoke booths, or playful immersive games for children and families. But we’re not just looking at transportation and UX/UI. We’re also exploring issues of sustainable gardening and local economies. Our workshops are holistic and collaborative across a range of stakeholders and participants, combining elements of cinema, design, urban planning, architecture, and community arts. These workshops build on a four year collaboration called the Leimert Phone Company, a design collective with USC and Ben Caldwell’s Kaos Network. For the past 30 years, Kaos Network has been a space for music, arts, and digital technologies in Leimert Park. 

We’ll also be working with Urban Systems Laboratories, a nonprofit infrastructure systems company with significant expertise in the emerging field of autonomous transportation. They've been working with the community to envision a number of autonomous low speed vehicle applications to enhance the safety, everyday life, and economic well-being of the community. A key aspect of their philosophy is to include the community itself in the process to develop advanced technologies. For this project, they will engage with community members to design low-cost vehicles and develop a plan for their local manufacture. Along with Kaos Network and AIL, Urban Systems will staff a community workspace for the purpose, providing a full-scale vehicle mockup and producing an accurate scale model for use in presentations and manufacturing studies.

The full-scale vehicle and other prototypes will be central to the videos to show real solutions for integrating new urban technologies. The videos encapsulate complex concepts and multithreaded scenarios, allowing us to crisply convey community-generated visions. Our final videos will be presented to the community, exhibited publicly, and shared online to deepen conversations about future alternatives for local innovation and everyday technologies.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/sankofa-city,

Establishing a protocol for longitudinal data collection could also unlock a new paradigm of preventive street maintenance in the future

More concretely though, success can be first measured at the data collection phase in achieving near complete street-image coverage of LA's entire street grid. Beyond this, the prioritization of street maintenance using SQUID data could lead to significant cost-savings, over time and can be measured.

Taken to its logical conclusion, another vector of success is aiming to integrate various operational silos around street-level imagery and mobile data collection i.e. cleanliness assessments, asset management, pavement maintenance and even air quality (* if SQUID is fitted with an air quality sensor). We are careful though not to over-promise and under-deliver.","[""Money "",""Advisors/board members"",""Publicity/awareness"",""Infrastructure (building/space/vehicles etc.)"",""Network/relationship support"",""championing digital street inspections""]","SQUID is a low-cost device that uses open hardware to collect images and ride quality data across the entire city street grid to enable and empower the city or county of LA to offer efficient and equitable response around street maintenance.

SQUID combines the thoughtful deployment of  low-cost sensors and  inexpensive cloud data storage and computation to empower street level bureaucrats to augment existing street response tactics towards equitable and efficient outcomes.","[""Government responsiveness to residents’ needs"",""Travel time to work"",""Public transit riders""]","It is said that street maintenance is the most visible indicator of local government performance. LA's street network contains over 6,500 center lane miles of streets which makes maintenance a daunting task. LA has already begun using digital methods to survey the city for trash and prioritize cleanup efforts. SQUID is a logical conclusion of this approach by integrating low-cost sensors , the cloud  and computer vision to empower the LA city and county to be more proactive and enter an anticipatory paradigm for street maintenance. 

The results, if adopted at scale and over a period of time, we believe will bring about significant efficiencies through better allocation of resources and more importantly an equitable response to street maintenance which is unprecedented.

The basic concept is to collect a 'complete' data about all, not just a few streets. SQUID does this by leveraging low-cost sensors and cloud technology to allow an inexpensive method to collect large data. 

A typical lifecycle of using the SQUID device to collect data and improve decision making around LA's street maintenance involves mounting the SQUID to city vehicles and passively collecting data about street quality.

Data is collected by automatically taking a picture of the street every second and combining it with a ride quality score. A fleet of 10 vehicles driving 6 hours a day could theoretically cover LA's entire street grid in about a week. We have already prototyped this approach with New York City and Syracuse.

Once the data is collected, it is cleaned using LA's street grid GIS file and uploaded to a user interface, we call SQUID annotator. The purpose of the annotator is to allow qualified street inspectors to 'virtually' inspect every street in Los Angeles using the image data. Individual street defects like cracking, hummocks, potholes or poor lane markings can be annotated on the interface. 

Once all streets images are adequately annotated, a robust response model can be developed quickly to determine where street maintenance resources need to be deployed.

We are also testing automated methods of defect detection using computer vision

The most impactful part of this approach is when data collection is done repeatedly. Longitudinal  data for ALL of LA's streets unlocks an anticipatory response paradigm. Assuming LA commits to perform at least 4 surveys in a year - the resulting data would be unprecedented in terms of fidelity and scale. The degradation rates of individual streets could be 'seen' through the data prompting a more proactive response. Repaving decisions could involve using higher grade materials for some highly trafficked streets. The complete nature of this dataset could also be used as a powerful proxy for other city phenomena such as traffic indicators.

While focussing on street quality, SQUID can be repurposed to inspect other facets of the urban environment and integrate several operational silos around street imagery.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/street-quality-identification-device-aka-squid,

In spite of the city’s progressive reputation for trendsetting and trailblazing, a great dichotomy exists between the flourishing state of its commerce and the reality of how its children are educated. LA has the dubious distinction of ranking as one of the 10 worst school districts in the USA – a status due in large part to low reading & math scores, high dropout rate, and overcrowded classrooms. These undesirable realities generate apathy among students and teachers alike, producing environments short on inspiration, employment opportunities, technical training, and preparedness for contemporary problem solving.
Arts Connect proposes to change these circumstances by implementing creative strategies grounded in real-life, direct experience learning deployed through a system where traditional education methodology intersects with state-of-the-art, next-generation multimedia tools. The goal is to nurture students’ capacity to succeed by engaging them in enriching, real-life learning scenarios presented through digital media by some of the world’s most notable experts, admired celebrities, sports figures, and other individuals distinguished for their success in their chosen fields. Arts Connect responds to the demand for education reform by offering a program that inspires teachers and students alike, and is distributed free of charge throughout LA irrespective of the instruction venue.
Arts Connect challenges both left-&-right-brain thinking in students in order to provoke both imagination and creative problem-solving, but also in order to cultivate a high level of individual character formation, instill self-confidence and solid skill development, and generate personal pride.  Success results from lessons which are fun, engaging, authentic, relatable, and designed by classroom teachers dedicated to achieve optimal learning and comprehension outcomes. 
Arts Connect curricular integration could not be more timely!

LA might be home to millions of people - but it also has a well deserved reputation for isolation - it's hard to get to know people when you're enclosed in your own vehicle, listening to some jams and frustrated by traffic. 

Lots of people would be into riding a bike - but for people born and raised on freeways, it can be like learning a new language to figure out what streets to take instead of a freeway. 
New residents and lifelong ones all benefit by being able to find the easy (vs the faster) routes. Get to work/school/errands or connect to transportation without wondering what way to take.

And, in cases where the infrastructure just plain sucks for cycling - encouraging signage and the ability to find someone to ride with makes a big different to how easy, fun and safe it can be to chose to bike.

Los Angeles, like many cities, is divided– racially, socially, economically. Our nation is in a state of civil unrest, as demonstrated by protests and arguments surrounding critical issues such as police relations and LGBTQ+ rights. We need more opportunities for people to connect to better understand each other and the complexities of these issues. Our most precious resource – youth – have the potential to come together to confront these issues but are disconnected and not being activated. 

Why youth? The National Institutes of Health found that between the ages of 12 and 25, people are literally wired for excitement, novelty, risk, and peer authority. These traits make young people uniquely suited to solve problems, if given the opportunity. Excitement and novelty leads to learning new things and creating new solutions. Risk leads to trying things adults might not. Peer authority leads to changing behaviors. 

Big Citizen HUB harnesses these youth assets and positive peer networks through dialogue, community immersion, diversity, and teamwork, while activating youth to address the critical issues dividing our cities – ultimately contributing to a more just, open, and connected society.

Over the course of 22 Saturdays between January and July, we focus on increasing Big Citizens’ civic knowledge and personal agency. We:
* Place youth on diverse teams, utilizing a near-peer mentor structure 
* Address concerns of cultural competency by exposing youth to different groups, perspectives, cultures, and ideas that they may not otherwise have access to
* Give Big Citizens the space to learn and practice civic leadership skills, such as public speaking, mobilization, information literacy, social media usage, conflict resolution, and team leadership
* Provide the resources to explore, serve, and reflect on social justice issues
* Provide a place to implement local solutions to local problems, so that Big Citizens can immediately see how their actions can have a positive impact on the community, setting the stage for future action
* Complete youth-led service projects (middle school) and six-week externships (high school)
* Utilize public transit to learn from and volunteer with agencies across the city, witnessing issues first-hand

Partnering with over 50 community-based organizations, Big Citizens will address the following social issues in 2017: Animal Rights, Environmental Sustainability, Food Justice, Homelessness, Immigration, and LGBTQ+ Equality.

Our mission statement embodies the spirit of 'connecting.' As our mission statement says, 'We connect people through helping.'

We started as a single day of service. Today, we offer more than 2000 ways every year for absolutely anyone to pitch in, help out, and give back. Even better, we bring all kinds of diverse people together in the name of helping. 

At Big Sunday, we believe that absolutely everyone has some way that they can help somebody else. We do not see the world as haves-and-have-nots but rather as haves-and-have-mores. Our participants include everyone from homeless people to movie stars and everyoje is treated and valued the same. In fact, at many of our events, it is difficult to tell to who is helping and who is being helped. In fact, we are proud of the fact that we often blue those lines.

Over the years, we have worked with hundreds of schools, from preschools through grad schools. We've worked with public, private, religious and secular schools. We've also worked with schools that serve all kinds of communities. One thing we've discovered is that schools don't only serve children, but they involve faculty, parents, neighbors, and other stakeholders, too. Not only that, schools increasingly meet other needs as well, whether they operate as camps in the summer, polling places, sites for community meetings, a site for a show or concert, the home of a sustainable garden, the site of an exciting game, or drop-in sites for locals.

Of course, many schools that once were a site to simply teach children now also serve the function of de facto social service agencies, providing everything from food to clothing not only for their students, but the kids' families as well.

We think every school should be welcoming to all. And without question a pretty and cheerful environment goes a long way to making a place ingratiating. We've discovered that too many schools can be run-down or drab -- with others can be new but too sterile. We think that colorful murals can provide a school not only with warmth, but a great sense of place. This adds to the community's sense of belonging (always important at Big Sunday) and pride. (Come to think of it, also very important to us!). 

More importantly, when a community comes together in the name of creating that mural it has resonance both in the moment and for years to come. We will be teaming with professional artists who will work with schools communities to not only paint professional-level murals, but to work with the community to discern their interests and passions. Better still, the artists will be trained in color therapy and teach the participants about the value of color in creating environments that are not just pretty and festive, but also encouraging feelings of well-being, security and confidence.

Creating these murals will connect people in a classic Big Sunday way: impactful and fun.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/connecting-community-through-color,

We regularly engage our community by: providing three runs a week in different parts of the city; offering free training programs; activating informal open spaces for play; hosting an annual 5K run/walk; and organizing runner safety workshops.

Our training program, Project 4242, provides coaching, support and motivation for runners of all abilities. We train our runners for our official 5K race (Happy Birthday L.A. 5K), a
local half marathon, and the L.A. Marathon. Comparable training programs typically cost $75 — $150 dollars and can be daunting to most individuals. Project 4242 is free of charge, eliminating any hesitation, thus allowing runners to explore local neighborhoods – while unlocking human potential and bringing added vitality with every footstep. In our 2015-2016 season, a total of 446 runners participated in our activities. Of the 446 runners, 335 completed the program, which amounts to a 75% success rate.  

Happy Birthday L.A. 5K was created not only to celebrate L.A., but to prove that anything from roads to empty parking lots can be used as open space for PLAY. This year our run/walk saw a 23% runner increase and 10K in social media interactions.

With the help of our volunteers, our weekly runs, the Happy Birthday L.A. 5K and Project 4242, BlacklistLA has been extremely successful in mobilizing and strengthening our community, highlighting the efficiency of activating public spaces, reduction of obesity, and inspiring active individuals for years to come. However, our work to make L.A. the best city continues.

As we increase runnership in Los Angeles, we feel obliged to address and improve the safety of pedestrians, runners, and cyclists alike. We believe to make L.A. the best place to play we need to simultaneously increase open space, physical activity, community building, and most importantly, put an end to pedestrian fatalities. According to Vision Zero L.A., a road safety policy that committed to eliminating traffic deaths by 2025, amongst peer cities that have committed to this effort, our city has the highest transportation death rate at 6.27% per 100,000 people. We can all agree that statistic in unacceptable.

Being awarded this grant would allow us to both continue our work in running and make strides in helping Vision Zero eliminate traffic deaths by 2025. To support this vision, we will facilitate workshops, create runner safety campaigns for our specific community, and collect data from our members to create a safer city for all.

Through our efforts in both inspiring runners in L.A. and increasing runner safety, Angelenos will finally enjoy working and playing in The City of Angeles.

BTC was fortunate enough to hear the needs of the young people of Los Angeles at a recent Los Angeles for Youth Rally.  During the rally a young woman about 18 years old shared a story with the audience about her younger sister.  She recalled that she was sharing a memory about how safe and engaged she felt attending their youth center.  Her younger sister asked her, “What’s that?” She realized that her sister had no relationship with the center.  Other young people talked about how their safe place was a liquor store around the corner until they got harassed by gang members or cops thinking they were gang member. Some sections of Los Angeles youth are provided with spaces that help them proactively contribute to the community while in others they are not.  We specifically see this challenge in the City Terrace neighborhood of East Los Angeles. There is a huge opportunity to ignite a neighborhood of healthy relationships through a pilot called the Zone.  Los Angeles’ young people need more info about healthy relationships and resources to take action, their families and adults need support to break down intergenerational forms of violence in communities.

This reinforced BTC’s desire to bring prevention education to young people in the spaces where they reside.  BTC has been very successful in bringing dating violence prevention education to schools in Los Angeles.  However, the space does not allow for completely open dialog and misses out of school youth.  Unedited, frank conversations with young people is the key to creating enhanced peer prevention educational tools and awareness campaigns that reach spaces outside the school setting.  BTC is particularly interested in the time just after the school day and before young people return home.  For some young people that time can be extremely unpredictable.  While only a few hours that time may include, walking to a store to get a snack.  Stores may be bodegas, liquor stores, convenience stores or other shops that serve multiple purposes in the neighborhood.  It may include a brisk walk through either official gang territory or unfriendly neighborhoods.  For others it may be a direct route to a local neighborhood club.  This time and space is a good time to reach youth through The Zone.

The Zone a mobile technology station would have TV monitors and tablets which would rotate media clips discussing various relationships.  Youth would be encouraged to view the media, talk to peer educators, take a fun engagement tool, and sign up for the Let’s Be Real youth group for continued information.

Food insecurity impairs growth and development among children, affects academic success and contributes to childhood obesity.  BFLA can combat food insecurity and obesity with the promotion and protection of breastfeeding. The highest prevalence of food insecurity, poverty, and obesity is found in South LA.  The 2014 Los Angeles Mommy & Baby (LAMB) survey showed the lowest rates of breastfeeding were also found in South LA.  

BFLA plans to make South LA the best place to live for moms, babies, and families through an innovative program supporting beginning families.  We plan to do this by providing prenatal breastfeeding classes and support groups through a partnership with SFYB and providing technical assistance to clinics to achieve improvements in communities with low breastfeeding rates. We will use the newly developed guidelines released by the State of California, The Nine Steps to Breastfeeding Friendly Outpatient Settings: Guidelines and Criteria. These guidelines provide a framework for community medical facilities to support breastfeeding and early infant attachment through policy development, professional education, discharge follow-up, and evaluation.

By December 30, 2017, SFYB in partnership with BFLA will provide two series of culturally relevant breastfeeding classes and nine support groups for African American families led by a culturally congruent peer counselor and/or certified lactation educator (CLE) in South Los Angeles. The 6 hour course is taught over three weeks. 

Using research and findings from focus groups, classes will link breastfeeding to the African American experience, history, and hope for better health outcomes. The program will address sociocultural concerns as well.

In addition to classes and support groups, by December 31, 2017, BFLA will assist two Community Health Centers (CHC) with enhancing, implementing, and adopting policies that promote breastfeeding initiation and continuation.

BreastfeedLA will support a minimum of two CHC’s in South LA to successfully implement practices and policies that protect, promote and support breastfeeding and create and sustain a community-based, universally accessible, support system for breastfeeding mothers and their families. BFLA will work with CHCs to implement evidence-based practices that have been shown to increase breastfeeding initiation and duration. BFLA will provide guidance on ways to deliver high quality, culturally competent breastfeeding promotion, support and care services to mothers and their families within clinics. BFLA will assist CHCs with establishing written procedures that ensure a breastfeeding-friendly clinic environment.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/creating-a-first-food-friendly-south-los-angeles,

* 95% of BUILD students graduated from high school on time.  In contrast, the national average rate of on-time high school graduation is 81%, and the national average rate of on-time high school graduation for low-income students is 73%.
* 98% of our students were accepted to a postsecondary option, and of those, 82% were accepted to four-year colleges.
* 69% of BUILD students who graduated in 2015 enrolled in college the Fall immediately following their high school graduation.  In contrast, the national average college enrollment rate is 66%, and the national average rate for BUILD’s target population (low-income students of color from urban high schools) is 52%.

BUILD’s Plan for Los Angeles
Beginning with the 2017-2018 school year, BUILD Los Angeles will serve 600 students in the 9th grade.  Our initial geographic focus will be on the region centered in Downtown Los Angeles and extending several miles into East Los Angeles.  BUILD Los Angeles will work with traditional comprehensive public high schools, charter schools, and pilot schools.  BUILD’s national Research and Evaluation Team will be able to study and learn how the BUILD model works in each of those three settings.  

In succeeding years, BUILD Los Angeles will continue to add a new 9th grade cohort of approximately 600 students each year.  By the 2020-2021 school year, BUILD will have grown to serve approximately 2,400 students.  Seed grants invested now will quickly bear fruit in the form of a highly impactful regional team of 30 BUILDers serving 2,400 students, 25 schools and 500 mentors.  

Outcomes in Los Angeles
Most importantly, BUILD has a demonstrated record of ensuring high school graduation and college enrollment among low-income high school students.  Of BUILD students nationally in 2015-2016, 95% graduated high school on time and 69% of those graduates enrolled in a post-secondary institution.  Both of those figures are much higher than the national cohort’s rates of 73% graduation and 52% enrollment.

Assuming BUILD Los Angeles matches these results, that means over the next five years:

An additional 528 students who graduate high school instead of dropping out (2,280 of 2,400 BUILD Students graduate vs. 1,752 students nationally graduate)

An additional 408 students who enroll in post-secondary institutions (1,656 of 2,400 BUILD Students enroll vs. 1,248 students nationally enroll)

With its first class of 9th graders, BUILD Los Angeles will be responsible for an additional 132 high school graduates and 102 college enrollees in Los Angeles.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/build-los-angeles-entrepreneurship-is-the-hook-and-college-is-the-goal,

It is a multi-sector approach to connect resident leaders with government and community-based organization resources (CBOs) to activate open space and parks in the Drake community and surrounding areas. Well-engaged, safe parks provide many benefits. Parks serve as a connecting space that build social capital by providing a shared space for users to develop and maintain neighborhood ties. These interactions enhance the personal and communication skills of users, which significantly contribute to residents' sense of safety and emotional/social support.  PPS’ three project goals are to: 1) increase resident capacity, building up their advocacy for increasing access and resources to parks and open spaces; 2) increase the rate of resident and partner organization volunteerism at parks and open spaces; and 3) increase communication between government, CBOs and residents on the use of vibrant park spaces within Drake and surrounding communities. Authentic resident engagement is critical to develop a community vision for safe parks that support early childhood, intergenerational play, and reduced neighborhood violence.

Capacity Building:  People’s Planning School will offer a free, 6-week city planning training to 20-24 residents and work with them to develop a neighborhood action plan. Using the tools learned in their training, residents will co-design a neighborhood survey along with project partners, collect data, and present their findings to city decision makers.  In the Neighborhood Action Plan, residents will identify specific community resources that meet the needs presented in the data, securing commitments for programming and maintenance of Drake Park. 
Connection to Place and Volunteerism: PPS will strengthen existing government, CBO and resident relationships while identifying new partners to increase park activity and responsiveness to resident needs. Residents will create private and non-profit partnerships to increase park programming and create opportunities for resident volunteerism at local parks. The connection between organizations and resident volunteerism is key to create a neighborhood identity where residents have the power to support programming in parks and open space.  
System Change-Communication: PPS partners and residents will work together to open dialogues with policy and civic decision-makers, expanding the current conversation from designing park spaces to include support for long-term park programming in low-income areas of the City. The City of Long Beach has made a commitment to increase opportunities for its citizenry to live active, healthy lives.

Children in the Pools of Hope service area are often plagued with gang violence, high unemployment, and low educational achievement. The lack of supplemental educational opportunities in the area puts children further at risk of engaging in anti-social behaviors. In addition, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, 1) drowning is the second leading cause of unintentional deaths among children 1-14; and, 2) the fatal drowning rate of African American children ages 5-14 is 3.1 times that of Caucasian children--making it vitally important for children in our community to learn water safety and solid swimming skills.

The Swim & Achieve Homework Assistance Lab was developed specifically to meet these pressing community needs. Swim & Achieve will reduce risk factors for children dropping out of school and increase their chances for graduating high school and continuing on to college. The program will promote confidence in learning and impart life-saving water safety skills among 100 disadvantaged children over a one-year period--giving them the ability and inspiration they need to excel in school and in life. 

Students participating in Swim & Achieve receive 45 minute to one-hour tutoring sessions--with swim lessons provided to students afterwards as a reward for participation in the tutoring program. The program is expected to help children make a body-mind connection, strengthen communication skills in the Lab and in the pools, and support healthy relationships with adults who are lifeguards, instructors, and tutors.

Unfortunately, these contributions are often overlooked because of the communities' reputation for low academic achievement from under-resourced schools, cycles of poverty, unemployment and under-employment and neighborhood violence. The proposed project was developed in response to a recent increase in violent, gang related activity among east side middle school, and early high school youths.  Many local youth who have been identified as 'problematic' because of their behavior or neighborhood affiliation are being lost to gangs, and drug use because the local parks, community centers, or schools lack the resources or training to support them and they often find themselves pushed out of programming with nowhere else to turn to but the streets. Several of the youth at CALÓ YouthBuild found themselves in similar situations before reclaiming their lives and education.  This project will allow CALÓ youth to put into practice the leadership development, green building construction and engineering skills, and arts and culture training provided to them in the YouthBuild program by designing mobile solar powered generators to power arts and STEM programming to younger versions of themselves.  Students will work with CALÓ and YouthBuild Charter School of California staff to develop arts and STEM programming to take to underserved young people in local housing projects, parks, community centers, and schools. Programming would include music instruction, full band rehearsals, music recording and production, introduction to solar photovoltaics and energy efficiency, introduction to engineering, STEM careers, construction basics, leadership development, mentoring, and recreational community movie screenings.

CNCA students reside in some of the most historically underserved areas of Central Los Angeles, including the communities of MacArthur Park, Pico-Union, Wilshire Corridor, and Echo Park – a region that holds the second densest neighborhood in the U.S., where the annual family income is among the lowest in the city. Latinos in California have lower rates of college matriculation directly from high school. In fact, approximately 41.3% of MacArthur Park's population never graduated from high school.

CNCA is determined to reverse those statistics. Even though 99% of our students from the class of 2016 enrolled in a two or four-year college, we continue to build our CTC Program. We are working hard to provide our students and families the support they need to succeed in college and beyond, and to ensure that by 2022, 90% of our students are accepted into, 80% enroll in, and 60% complete college within six years of graduating from high school.

CTC focuses on preparing students for success through exposure to different colleges and careers, skill-building, parent engagement, and support throughout the college-application process, enrollment and beyond.  All high school students participate in a class where they learn about college preparation, explore college and career options and prepare for entrance exams, applications, and financial aid opportunities. Students also participate in career exploration activities, like projects around career options, job shadowing, and a 50-hour internship. 

While exposing students to college and career options, we provide parents with the information they will need to help their students get to and through college. A series of “College Knowledge” workshops are provided for families, which emphasize academic requirements for college acceptance, financial preparation, and the social-emotional aspects of sending a child away to college. A parent support group is also available to prepare families for this life transition.  

As students begin to narrow down their college and career interests, college counselors help students identify which colleges will be best suited to their needs and desired field(s) of study. Students participate in college visits to public and private universities in California and nationally.  Then, college counselors help students complete their college applications. 

As students move toward graduation, enrollment and their first year in college, the program helps to remove financial barriers for the most disadvantaged students by providing college scholarships to 25% of the senior class through a CNCA scholarship fund. Additionally, we work to match mentors with students to help address barriers by providing personal and academic support and connecting students to resources on campus.

With the implementation of ETO, we aim to: (1) improve the ways in which we capture, measure and assess our activities; and (2) improve the CASA volunteer experience through better recruitment, training and retention. ETO is the beginning of outcomes measurement at CASA. When a case is assigned, both the Senior Program Coordinator and the CASA volunteer examine the case and rate the status and level of risk of the child on a baseline scale along the three core dimensions of safety, permanency and well-­being.

CASA will serve at least 30 additional foster youth in Los Angeles County through this advocacy.","[""College completion"",""College matriculation rates"",""District-wide graduation rates""]","The comprehensive 2011 study “Young Adult Outcomes of Youth Exiting Dependent or Delinquent Care in Los Angeles County,” supported by the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation,  found that older youth in the care system are much more likely to remain there without ever achieving permanency. Over 30% of children who entered the system above the age of 12 aged out. Subsequently, by the time they are approaching the age of emancipation from care, they are also more likely to have endured multiple placements, leading to lost personal connections, a disruption of health services, and often, several changes in school which is extremely detrimental to both academic and social development. According to the study, of the youth aging out of the foster care system in Los Angeles County, one third experienced extreme poverty, 20% received outpatient mental health services, 25% spent time in jail, and only 25% were consistently employed. 

All of these issues—challenges to maintaining educational continuity and meeting grade level standards in high school, failure to secure a permanent placement, as well as basic dependency care transition and independent living issues—converge when foster youth approach post-secondary education, so it is unsurprising that the Alliance for Children’s Rights found that only 3% of Los Angeles County foster youth graduate from college.  Equally important is the statistic that 70% of foster youth want to pursue a higher education. So what’s happening to this missing 67%, between the hope to attend and graduate from college and the failure to do so?

As many CASA of Los Angeles success stories, and other success stories around the country, demonstrate, despite the serious challenges foster youth face, they can do it. But they can't do it alone. The critical relationship between higher educational attainments and more positive long-term outcomes for foster youth clearly indicated by the Hilton funded study is a powerful incentive to implement more effective strategies that address these missed opportunities. CASA intends to raise awareness around this important issue within the dependency care system, and with the support of other post-secondary programs, to facilitate more foster care youth attending college. 

From the standpoint of the CASA, there is probably no other role in the dependency care system better suited for this level of advocacy. Because CASAs work with the youth one-on-one, and many hold the educational rights of the youth they serve, CASAs are able to make recommendations to the Court to request for services and supports to enable youth to participate in post-secondary preparation activities, and to better promote those opportunities in all areas of their life. By working directly with the youth’s teachers, counselors, case workers, attorneys, and care givers, CASAs help establish networks of support and services around educational opportunities for these youth, increasing their likelihood of educational success.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/college-collaborative-for-foster-care-youth,

What are their priorities? Why are they engaged? How can we grow this level of engagement? How can we turn their priorities into realities? In a city as large, complex, and diverse as Los Angeles answering these questions is a real challenge. Organized and executed over the last fifteen years by the Thomas and Dorothy Leavey Center for the Study of Los Angeles at Loyola Marymount University (LMUStudyLA), the LA Votes project seeks the answers to these questions by interweaving research, civic engagement, service, and dialogue to network, empower, and inform Angelenos about their electoral landscape, civic decisions, and self-identity. 

LMUstudyLA has amassed valuable insight into voter patterns, identity, and priorities through its fifteen years of research. Concurrently, it has advocated for reform successfully with the following two examples serving as highlights:  

LMUstudyLA's reporting of inequities in polling place conditions during LA Votes prompted the late California State legislator Jenny Oropeza into passing AB177: Voter Bill of Rights legislation in to law in 2003, which sought to 'protect all voters so that they may understand and defend their rights.'

LMUstudyLA's Director chaired the City of Los Angeles Municipal Elections Reform Commission in 2014 which ultimately led to Charter Amendments 1 & 2. These amendments were approved by Angeleno voters in 2015 and addressed the issue of low voter turnout in LA Municipal Elections by moving them to the election days with the highest turnout, June and November of the even years, alongside gubernatorial and presidential contests.

The LA Votes Project researching the Municipal Primary Election held on March 7, 2017 will continue to build on this legacy through an exit poll of LA voters and an election reception titled Election Central.

The LA Votes' Municipal Primary Election Exit Poll will engage 150 undergraduate students at LMU during their spring break. Through the field research they'll be conducting in their community they will learn to become engaged citizens invested in their civic processes. In addition to conducting field research all eligible students will be casting absentee ballots given their commitment to research on Election Day. 

With LA Votes' Election Central, hundreds of Angelenos will be given the opportunity to celebrate and observe their electoral process in a centralized, convenient, location free of charge. In addition, Election Central attendees will be given the opportunity to interact with and engage with various civic stakeholders and leaders including city officials, county officials, elected officials, staff, academics, journalists, and activists.

Too many kids that experience trauma lack the supports and services they need to heal and thrive, are placed into the foster care system or end up arrested or homeless.

In LA County, there are currently 28,000 youth in foster care. In 2013, more than 500 LA County children under age 4 were hospitalized for intentional injuries. In 2014, nearly 7,000 kids under 18 were arrested. And based on state estimates, over 418,400 kids in LA County have had at least two Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) in their lives.

The LA community already has the power to address this problem – it just needs to be harnessed and coordinated. Hundreds of LA agencies, organizations, congregations, coalitions, businesses and community leaders serve or support children and want them to grow up trauma-free. There are many promising practices that can prevent trauma, build resilience in kids and heal those that have had ACEs. The problem is that these groups are often disconnected from each other or lack the support to scale what is working.

Children Now will connect all of these groups under our 'Pro-Kid' frame to build a strong base of support to achieve scalable change.

We lead The Children's Movement, a network which includes 385 diverse organizations in LA County dedicated to making kids California's #1 priority.

To move toward a trauma-free LA for kids by 2050, we will engage Movement members, and hundreds of other groups across early childhood, health, education, and child welfare fields to speak with one united voice for needed policy solutions. We'll learn from local efforts and leverage our policy knowledge to develop a comprehensive cross-sector agenda that outlines concrete steps to reduce the number of kids, 0-18, who experience the consequences of trauma. These policy changes will include expanding voluntary early childhood home visiting programs, increasing access to mental health services, creating targeted education supports for foster youth, reducing juvenile criminalization, reforming school discipline practices, etc .

In a new approach for the field, FosterMore is using 21st century techniques to engage people in the lives of youth in care.  This kind of specific targeting works at two levels—at best we have recruited a new person to actively support foster youth, and at the same time we have promoted the larger mission of FosterMore to change hearts and minds.  
The online media buy targets precise demographics, primarily on Facebook and the audiences targeted include middle and upper income households, LGBT families, single women and more.   With a budget of just under $12,000 the initial effort garnered 1.876 million impressions, with 609k of those watching the videos.  One hundred and thirty three viewers were converted to leads (by filling out our contact form) and after follow up, 45 individuals were referred to foster family agencies and mentoring opportunities.  The overall cost per lead in LA was $68.34.  By comparison to other media buys, this is a very low viewership cost which can be attributed to compelling content and thoughtful media buy targeting. 
What’s more research shows that foster parents on average spend two years considering this decision.  Our effort may serve to accelerate their decision and bring new leads into the funnel.

If our assumption proves correct, the county can expect 3,047 new foster parent and mentoring leads in 2018.  If we look at the static ad impression figures at a conversion rate of 0.001%, we can anticipate 1,877 new leads in 2018. 
We are seeking to expand our online effort to meet the pressing need for foster parents in LA County.  The grant would be used for direct digital contact with a micro-targeted audience of potential foster parents.  We estimate an investment of $25,000 could return 312-384 foster parent leads over a 6-8 week effort.  Further the long-term impact could yield an estimated 5,700-7,000 additional foster parents starting 18 months from the date of execution.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/fostermore-because-no-child-makes-it-alone,

Our approach to reentry is jobs.  We are recognized leaders in the reentry community for the work that we do to create jobs, to connect people to employment, and to assist formerly incarcerated people to increase their incomes.  
Chrysalis offers job-readiness services, through supportive social programs and paid, transitional employment, that strengthen our clients’ employability and help them secure and retain work. All clients attend classes providing information to empower them to conduct their job search, and learn about things like where to look for a job, how to create a resume, interview, and address felony convictions in the job search. Clients can access supplemental supports such as interview clothes, transportation assistance, food, phones and voicemail, fax, and a mailing address.  Scholarships help clients access training, certification and tools that will aid them in their job search. When necessary, we provide clients with on-site, short-term mental health support and legal assistance, free of charge. 

But clients who have criminal histories and past incarceration face enormous challenges finding and maintaining employment due to a lack of job search experience, education, vocational skills, and/or work history, as well as employers’ reluctance to hire those who have been involved in the justice system. For these people, as well as others with major barriers to employment, Chrysalis offers paid, transitional jobs with our in-house CE businesses to get them started on the road to permanent, outside jobs. 73% percent of CE workers have a criminal history, and 59% have prior felony convictions. Transitional jobs deliver marketable experience and occupational skills while providing a supervised, supportive work setting that allows clients to prove themselves as reliable, capable workers.  CE workers earn wages and pay taxes, reducing their recidivism rates and dependence on government assistance.  They receive on-the-job training, particularly to increase soft skills, from supervisors with lived experience in homelessness and incarceration. And they are paired with an Employment Specialist, to support their job search throughout their transitional employment, helping to move them successfully into mainstream employment.

Our project also makes L.A. a better place to LIVE. We know that the benefits of getting and keeping a job are about more than just income and survival; a job is a catalyst for setting people on the path to self-sufficiency.

We believe true learning can occur best in a diverse school environment that honors and engages the community it serves. CWC schools bring individuals with diverse backgrounds and perspectives together, so students can learn how to engage others respectfully and productively, and develop the competencies they will need for future success in a fast-paced, diverse world.

Research supports the academic benefit of a diverse learning environment, as noted in a recent Scientific American article that states: “diversity enhances creativity. It encourages the search for novel information and perspectives, leading to better decision-making and problem solving.” When students recognize and learn to transcend lines of difference, it allows them to work more effectively with each other, while also achieving better academic results, becoming stronger critical and creative thinkers, and contributing to society in meaningful and positive ways.

Schools are uniquely positioned to address the social challenges we are facing in LA and across the country. By educating our next generation of leaders to deeply understand race, equity and diversity, we can help avoid some of the unrest we see today. CWC’s educators aspire to lead this work in LA, setting an example for how to maximize the benefits of diversity. Our approach to embracing diversity will fundamentally reshape equity in our schools by allowing all students to achieve at equal and high levels (compared to the persistent “achievement gaps” seen throughout our city and country).
 
CWC aspires to create schools where there is a culture of learning for all, starting with the adults in our buildings who will learn to engage with issues of race, equity, diversity and education openly and honestly. By changing some of the language/frameworks we use, the conversation we have among staff and the goals we set, we expect to see positive growth in school culture and student achievement.

We started on this important work in August, with a two-day all-staff training as a pilot. Going forward, we intend to expand our race and equity project to include:
•          Building adult staff capacity for navigating differences
•          Creating more structures to support and engage all families
•          Developing strategies to address issues of diversity and difference with students

In fact, thousands of youth within Los Angeles never see the beach at all, and a few who are lucky enough to make a trip may actually be more fearful of the waves than ready to surf.  The opportunity for youth to play in the ocean, to swim in the waves without fear, and to be able and ready to help someone else in trouble in the water – that is what this amazing program offers. The Open Water Junior Lifeguard Program operates for six weeks during the summer months at two open water locations – Cabrillo Beach (ocean) and Hansen Dam (lake).  Each week, the youth are instructed in aquatic skills such as swimming, running and paddling, with the intent of instilling participants with confidence in their abilities in the ocean.  Additionally, this program is designed to promote physical development and water safety.  Youth are instructed in lifeguarding skills such as effective swim rescues, Community CPR and First Aid. Each week there are conditioning and competitive activities, such as rescue board relays, run-swim-runs, buoy swims, rescue can relays, run relays, and beach flags, with the intent of promoting teamwork ethics culminating to regional and national Junior Lifeguard competitions against other agencies.  This grant will subsidize the costs to run this program and allow youth who normally would not be able to get to the ocean, have a summer to be on the beach and in the water, places they otherwise might never enjoy.  The youth will be integrated into a program that builds social skills and mutual respect along with healthier bodies and strategies of water rescue, and do it in an environment with quality facilities and friendly, skillful adult instructors.  In fact, a major positive element of the program is the student-mentor relationships that blossom, and the interaction of the youth participants with adult staff and the other older adults.

Most Smart City strategies are tailored for large cities and disregard the opportunities available for smaller cities.  With a population under 35,000 and number of new smart technology initiatives underway, including development of a municipal fiber backbone network, acquisition of light standards from Southern California Edison, and a robust smart bus shelter replacement project, the City of West Hollywood lacks a model guiding plan to integrate and streamline its Smart City projects.  

We suppose that many of the other cities in Los Angeles County are in the same position as West Hollywood in this regard.

California, and specifically the city of Los Angeles, represents a huge percentage of these unfilled positions. It is an absolute necessity that LA’s children are prepared to meet the technological demands of the future. 

Unfortunately, LA’s most high-need students are being disproportionately underprepared for the demands of the future workforce. According to the U.S. Department of Education for Civil Rights, 56% of high schools with low minority populations offer calculus, compared to only 33% of high schools with high minority populations. The same can be said for physics, which is offered at 67% of low minority schools but a mere 48% of high minority schools, and chemistry, which is offered at 78% of low minority schools but only 65% of schools with high black and Latino enrollment. Because of this unequal system, minority students are predisposed to be unprepared for future employment demands. These conditions perpetuate the cycle of poverty, and contribute to the struggle that children living in low-income communities have to change their circumstances. This is where City Year Los Angeles steps in to help.

CYLA places AmeriCorps members, aged 17-25, in Los Angeles’ highest need schools in order to intervene directly with students who are at risk for dropping out of school. CYLA corps members are responsible for guiding students through their coursework in English Language Arts and math, supporting students in their social emotional growth, and ensuring students attend school consistently. Additionally, CYLA corps members offer students “extended learning time” after school so that students understand concepts and are on track towards success. 

This year, CYLA is implementing a STEM pilot in our after school space in order to enrich student knowledge of concepts essential to a well-rounded education in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math. The program, called “Globaloria,” allows students to select which subsection of the STEM field interests them, and then complete independent, self-guided learning by using actual technology. Globaloria ensures students are learning real-world concepts by testing students in real ways. Through Globaloria’s platform students will write their own code, create their own video games, and design their own independent learning tracks. All along the way, City Year corps members will be there to guide students through learning these complicated processes. In addition, each pilot school will have a trained professional on site, ready to help students as they navigate their way through their learning.

In addition, we will test the program through a random control trial so that we can accurately measure our impact. 

In 2005 and 2006, Professor Green, then at Yale University, and Professors Elizabeth M. Addonizio and James M. Glaser, of Yale and Tufts University, respectively, conducted a study on the quantitative effects of voting as a social engagement. They implemented an experiment in the form of fourteen Election Day Poll Parties in communities across the nation. Each community was engaged to help plan, and then invited to attend, a local, all-ages voting event including food and family-friendly entertainment. These Election Day events saw a rise of 6.5% voter participation in areas with high levels of voter participation, and a rise of 2.6% in areas with low levels of voter participation.  

Civic Nation is in the process of executing a similar experiment in 2016. To expand the experiment and post-pilot the successful results in Los Angeles in 2017, we will take the following steps: 

1) Engage, and partner with, non-partisan community groups in Los Angeles to choose 20 viable experiment sites--early vote or Election Day polling locations that do not pose physical barriers such as safety or accessibility issues, inadequate space or parking, etc. 

2) In coordination with those local groups we will seek all the proper permissions to hold the event from elections boards, municipal entities and the proprietors of the locations themselves (such as libraries, fire houses etc.)

3) Once we have permissions for 20 viable sites, Professor Green will randomly select 10 to be the treatment sites (where events will be held) and 10 to be the control sites (where no events will be held). 

4) Then we will engage with each of the communities to create events that match the personality and preferences of those neighborhoods through food, music, art and other elements. And we will work with our local partners to ensure robust communication about the events.

Our project will adhere to all legal guidelines and restrictions: The events will be open to all, regardless of whether individuals vote or have voted. Also, nothing in the events will advocate on behalf of any candidate or party. This includes within speakers’ remarks, materials, etc.

Through this pilot project expansion we will offer Angelenos a way to vote that is community-driven, celebratory, creative, and collaborative.

This innovative partnership between Clockshop and California State Parks addresses 4 of the metrics outlined in LA2050’s PLAY category: providing access to open space; creating opportunities for informal play; offering intergenerational opportunities for play; and laying the groundwork for a “vibrant” park that will serve urban park-poor communities in East Los Angeles. For LA2050, Clockshop proposes continuing the Bowtie Project in 2017, with an ambitious schedule of events and a renewed commitment to creating culturally relevant programming. 

The Bowtie is a special place. Visitors remark on the sweeping views, the quiet calm, and the flourishing plant and animal life. With an elongated north to south shape, the Bowtie runs parallel the river, which is green and verdant, and water audibly flows. This portion of the LA River is often called the “crown jewel” of river revitalization. The Bowtie was purchased by CSP in 2003 but was underutilized as CSP lacked funds to develop it into a public park.

Clockshop’s work at the Bowtie, which began in 2014, is designed to cultivate appreciation for the land as a nature experience and an oasis of calm in a dense urban landscape. Clockshop accomplishes this by organizing events (12-15/year) and commissioning site-specific artworks (2-3 performances and 2-3 sculptural installations). 

Events fall into several types: Reading by Moonrise, at which local authors read around the campfire on the full moon; LA River Campouts, at which families and youth groups camp beneath the stars; Bowtie Family Days, a drop-in all-day event designed for multigenerational families; and fieldtrips with LAUSD students. These events draw large crowds; the LA River Campout usually has a waiting list of several hundred people. Clockshop also collaborates with architecture students at Woodbury University to add amenities to the site, such as seating, viewing platforms, and a fire pit. Event audiences are encouraged to come early and stay late—to bring a picnic, enjoy the river, and watch the sunset.

Public art at the site provides another occasion for people to gather and enjoy the land. Installations and performances by Rafa Esparza, taisha paggett, Rosten Woo, Carolina Caycedo, and others have engaged the site in many ways. The first Bowtie artwork, Michael Parker's The Unfinished, is a recreation of an ancient Egyptian obelisk in the process of excavation, a reminder that the LA River corridor is also a work in progress. Clockshop’s most recent artist project was an after-dark performance by vocalist Carmina Escobar, in which Escobar’s vocalizations were mixed with recordings of Bowtie birdlife.

Through these programs and others, Clockshop is building a community of stakeholders who will ensure that the Bowtie remains in the public trust, as a place for all Angelenos to play now and in the future.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/laying-the-groundwork-for-a-park-on-the-la-river,

From the re-emergence of a thriving downtown to having the third largest technological ecosystem in the nation, Los Angeles is a force to be reckoned with. Residents continue to find innovative ways to connect to the community and expand their impact. That community importance has also been prevalent in the world of volunteerism in the city. About 21% of Angeleno residents volunteer -- giving 283.3 million hours of their time amounting to $6.4 billion of services contributed per year.
 
CoachArt wants to revolutionize how volunteers are matched to individuals in need by creating a platform to allow for ease, scale, and automation. We are a nonprofit that creates a transformative arts and athletics community for families impacted by childhood chronic illness. 

According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, 22% of U.S. children live below the poverty line, and one to four of those children suffer from a chronic illness.  Caring for a child with a chronic illness can put a financial strain on a low-income family -- often 30-50% of a low-income family’s income goes towards healthcare and out-of-pocket costs.

We have approximately 400 volunteers working with 1,000 children impacted by chronic illness through different arts and athletics programs. Each month, we have a backlog of between 15-20 volunteers waiting to be processed before they can work with students, which have resulted in a 70-student waitlist. To solve this problem, we are working to modernize our volunteer program. 

Our current volunteer training and onboarding methods are slow and inefficient. Once volunteers are recruited, trainings occur in person, which can take 4-6 weeks to prepare them to work with our students. Additionally, volunteers only have four opportunities a month to participate in these in-person orientations. This limits the number and quality of available volunteers for our students. We plan to implement an online system where volunteers can sign-up, be prompted to conduct their own background check, and follow a self-learner training portal. With the support of this grant, CoachArt will be able to implement this new system, modernize our volunteer program, and impact more students.

Moreover, our “moonshot” includes the creation of a replicable tool that will empower any current and future organizations with a matching model in their organization helping increase volunteerism rates in LA.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/coachart-matching-platform-revolutionizing-volunteerism-in-la-for-those-in-need-through-technology,

Incarceration increases exposure to infectious diseases such as hepatitis B and C, and negatively impacts employability and wages earned, which affect health (M. Massoglia, Incarceration, Health, and Racial Disparities in Health, Law and Society Review, Volume 42, No. 2, June 2008). With jail overcrowding and exposure to violence, youth with mental health conditions often worsen during incarceration (B. Holman and J. Ziedenberg, Dangers of Detention: The Impact of Incarcerating Youth in Detention and Other Secure Facilities, Justice Policy Institute, 2011).

The Coalition for Responsible Community Development (CRCD) will make LA the best place to LEARN by re-engaging disconnected youth who have been pushed out of the education system. Our youth experience many challenges and obstacles in obtaining their high school diploma and employment. CRCD tackles those challenges by providing an alternative project based education program that leads to a high school diploma; academic and support services to address barriers to high school diploma and college success; college navigation and completion support, and provides vocational training, placement and retention in employment.  

CRCD will expand and promote alternative sentencing for low-income youth aged 18-25 as a violence prevention and learning strategy. Our model – known as CURE (Community Uniting for Resolution and Empowerment) - provides multiple interventions to youth charged with gang-related misdemeanors, including: workforce development activities, college readiness workshops, weekly restorative justice group circles, and community service learning projects such as community beautification and the 20th Annual South Los Angeles Jazz Festival.

To prevent criminal convictions and incarceration, CURE redirects youth away from jail toward prosocial activities to promote health, prevent escalation of misdemeanor offenses to felonies, reduce recidivism and violence, and increase community safety. CURE offers youth an opportunity to earn case dismissal/reduction by engaging with CRCD in 12-18 months of alternative secondary education, postsecondary education and training, career placement, and wrap-around services such as mental health care. Completion of this program will allow them to earn a reduction of the original charge(s), or a dismissal of their criminal case and, in applicable cases, are encouraged to petition for removal from enforcement of the City’s civil gang injunctions.

CRCD, the LA City Attorney, and LA County Public Defender developed a shared vision to prevent escalation of offenses. Since its launch in 2010, CRCD has engaged a total of 94 young people in diversion from incarceration and has catalyzed meaningful change in LA’s criminal justice system.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/community-uniting-for-resolution-and-empowerment-cure,

A series of four pop-up events to take place over the course of 2017 will highlight a set of alleys that IDG has identified as the future green alley trail system. These pop-up events provide a common testing ground for our transdisciplinary team of collaborators - specializing in healthcare, art, ecology and business development - who will develop inventive research tools for community engagement. Some examples include: native plant tracking stations, mobility challenges, wildlife counting corridors, biodiversity monitoring soundscapes & water donation buckets from businesses. The playful and sensory-inducing quality of these tools is the essential ingredient for optimizing intergenerational and community participation. The diverse composition of our collaborators enables us to target populations specific to the Industrial Neighborhoods inclusive of humans and wildlife. The inclusion of a business strategist as one of our collaborators is essential to our project as its sustainability depends on a business plan for long-term maintenance of the green alleys. The new insights gained through the PLAYlab will be used to inform the design and implementation of the future green alley system.

As a partnership between IDG and Cal Poly Pomona Department of Landscape Architecture, the PLAYlab concept is about stimulating the public imagination about what the future green alleys could become. Unlike many typical community based greening proposals, this project does not follow conventional place-making formulas or participatory practice techniques; instead it embraces play as an engine for exchanging local and expert knowledge in a joint effort to ensure that human, ecological and economic health remain at the forefront at all times. 

Building upon the committed efforts of IDG over the past two years, this project is grounded upon a wide network of support from business owners, developers, city administrators, local residents and environmental advocates. Cal Poly Pomona and IDG co-organized a green alley activation event this past summer as part the public art biennial CURRENT: LA Water. This effort serves as a launching pad for our current proposal.

Educational Pipeline/College Matriculation Rates
 
Currently, there are no county-wide programs to help students and their families navigate the transition from high school into college and career. Wealthy families can afford expensive private schools or personal coaches who will assist their children in the transition. For the rest of us, we are on our own to figure it out. The result is often stressed families, students entering college without a major or career plan, or students attempting to go to college but unable to due to mistakes made on college or financial aid applications.
 
Future Focus, accessible to all, is a comprehensive college and career preparation program for students and their families that includes 11 group workshops and ongoing individual or small-group mentoring. The workshops include topics from the following categories: Planning for College and Career, Choosing a College and Career, Applying to College and Careers, and College Tests. The program is offered, in part or in whole, to students in grades 7-12. Students build a portfolio with their transcripts, test scores, extracurricular activities as well as researched college plans that is maintained at the YMCA and updated annually.
 
While most of the students’ research, planning, and applications are completed at the YMCA, families and school counselors are also engaged in the process. At a minimum, a students’ school counselor and family reviews college and career plans and provides feedback. In terms of financial aid for college, families attend the workshops and complete the applications with their child. The cost of college is a major concern for most students and families. Through Future Focus, students and families will make the final decision about whether or not they can afford college based on their financial aid award letters and not on a notion that it might be too expensive. Further, responses from the colleges are tracked and students are taught to follow-through to ensure all mistakes are corrected.

Youth Unemployment and Underemployment
 
The question, “What do you want to be when you grow up?” is not easily answered by most teenagers; it is not even easy to answer as an adult. Through Future Focus students will begin the exploration through web-based tools to discover personality traits and natural talents as well as possible careers that may be a good match. From there, they will research regional job growth categories, wages, and educational requirements. Students will explore internships and summer jobs in their chosen fields to determine fit, build their resume, and plan for future employment. All of their research and experiences are organized in their portfolio assisting them in their transition into college or career.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/future-focus-college-and-career-pathways-for-la-county-students,

College Track deeply believes that every person has the potential to change the world. Our 10-year program is designed to make sure our students are given the opportunity to fulfill that potential through earning a four-year college degree. We empower our students to transcend the limits of their circumstance by providing the support that helps them to discover their dreams, build their academic skills, secure financial aid, and persist on the path to and through college. As a result, College Track alumni are 2.5 times more likely to graduate from a four-year university than their peers. Yet, the magnitude of what our students accomplish extends far beyond earning a degree. A college graduate is twice as likely to be employed and will earn nearly twice as much as a high school graduate. It’s not only the economic impact that’s real – it’s also the community impact. A college graduate is twice as likely as a high school graduate to participate in society as a volunteer and nearly twice as likely to vote.

Success on the road to earning a college degree is not only about academic preparation. It is also highly dependent upon a student’s ability to develop a sense of purpose and GRIT – guts, resilience, integrity and tenacity. College Track believes that if students explore and articulate their dreams and purpose, they will develop stronger ownership over their own actions and outcomes, ultimately leading to success in college and beyond. 

Through our Dream LA project, College Track will support 400 high school students from Boyle Heights and Watts to identify their dreams and passions, and then connect those interests in service to the LA community. Research shows that when students are engaged in service and community work, they make gains in measures of academic achievement, citizenship and character. Students will participate in curriculum developed by The Future Project related to exploring and identifying their dreams, culminating in a dream declaration. Driven by their own passions, students will then design and/or participate in community service projects, completing a minimum of 25 hours of service per year. 

Service projects will allow students to explore leadership, activism, community development and entrepreneurship – creating networks and developing interests that propel them through college and beyond. Past projects include a book drive to promote early literacy in collaboration with the Boys & Girls Club and Project DAD, as well as a campaign around food sovereignty.

Continuous program support and technical assistance will be provided to these schools by a trained CT staff member or TKC educator, setting the precedent within schools and their communities for long-term teacher support of school wellness that incorporates both the built environment and healthy lifestyles education.

Small Bites curriculum (versions available for preK-8 grades) consists of 8-12 hours of education for each student (eight 60- to 90-minute lessons) and includes lessons on choosing and preparing healthy snacks, reading nutrition labels, and understanding the importance of whole grains, lean proteins, and varied fruits and vegetables to long-term personal health. Lessons are aligned to Common Core and Next Generation Science Standards by grade level (K-8) and National Health Education Standards.
Garden Bites includes the eight Small Bites lessons as well as eight garden extension lessons, during which teachers utilize plants and other gardening tools and concepts to reinforce the concepts learned in the nutrition lessons and to educate children on the lifecycle of different foods. Students will receive ample exposure to fruits and vegetables, so that the next time they see them in the cafeteria or at home, they’ll be more likely to try and enjoy them.

Alongside our proven curriculum, CT schools will receive access to our new Common Bytes digital nutrition education platform, and we expect to train 80 teachers to utilize Common Bytes in their classrooms, reaching an additional 480 youth.

We believe every empty patch of soil has the potential to feed and educate people about nutrition, sustainability, connection, art, community and love.

The Watts Healing Garden at Markham Middle School is a three-year project plan by Community Healing Gardens with a goal of building a self-sustaining business for the community. Our vision is to create a “blueprint” for building a successful community garden that we can duplicate within other underserved communities and schools all over Los Angeles.  

Why Watts?  Known as the “Food Desert” of Los Angeles, Watts is an underserved neighborhood located in the streets of South Central Los Angeles. This 2.12 miles wide neighborhood is a dense pocket of crime, poverty and gangs with very limited access to healthy food choices for low-income children and their families. The rate of diseases including heart disease, diabetes, hypertension and obesity are prevalent in the community. Also, South LA neighborhoods like Watts, have some of the highest pollution rates in the state. 

A vital component of the plan is the partnerships we are forming with key stakeholders in the community including: Cedar Sinai’s Coach for Kids, Boy’s & Girls Club After School Program, Watts Healthy Farmers Market, I (Heart) Watts, Watts Neighborhood Council, Locol (Roy Choi’s new local restaurant) and the Watts Gang Task Force.

Thi summer, we launched the pilot stages of the garden, including 25+ food producing trees and 15+ rows of food built with kids from the summer school programs in the garden.  This fall, two school programs, the Pre-Med and MESA Program (STEM), will be using the garden as a “Learning Space’ for classrooms. Additional gardening programs will be launched in early 2017 in partnership with the school.

Year two plans include installing Sky Water, a water system and technology game changer creating water made from air that produces over 300 gallons of water per day. This system will rely solely on solar energy and supply the much-needed access to clean, healthy water. The results will include a much higher rate of food production and increase jobs opporunities as well.

The Watts Healing Garden will grow healthy food, create jobs, improve the local environment, grow future farmers from the school, and develop a more inclusive local economy in Watts and the surrounding South Central Los Angeles area.  Community Healing Gardens will take this “blueprint” and grow it in other underserved schools and communities in Los Angeles.

CPs reflect the needs and values of residents living in the community as it lays out guidelines for land use, housing, transportation, and business development.  However, CPs, like those in SLA, are not always followed or updated. Of the three Community Plan areas in SLA, only one has been updated in the last 10 years. As a result, SLA has experienced decades of neglect from decision-makers and investment.  This has resulted in residents feeling disillusioned and disengaged from the political process and believing that their voices do not matter.  Neighborhood Councils are vehicles that can help SLA residents reengage since these are groups comprised of residents that the City recognizes as being the voice of the people. NCs and other residents can get involved in CP hearings, meetings, and other discussions so that they can advocate for equitable access to fundamental resources.  Engaged residents can push for a responsible CP that ensures future developments will bring in safe parks instead of liquor stores; produce markets instead of fast food restaurants; and affordable housing instead of only high-priced condos. 

This project will have a three-pronged approach:
1) Engagement
A technical committee will be formed to help design the resident engagement strategies and collaborate in the delivery of the Community Planning Literacy Workshop Series. The committee will include local NCs and individuals currently engaged in the CP Updates.

2) Training
The training is organized so that residents are well versed on the technical aspects of the CPs and they are equipped to recruit, train, and motivate their neighbors. Using CHC’s Community Plan Literacy 6-part Workshop Series, that was successful in training and preparing residents to become active participants in the West Adams CP Update recently adopted by the City, residents will be informed about:

-The relationship between community resources and health
-Places where people can get involved in local decision-making
-How to participate and take leadership in a Neighborhood Council
-The skills needed to participate in the development of the guidelines which are the foundation of Community Plans
-Strategies to get other neighbors involved 

3) Neighborhood Councils
Using our relationships to NCs, we will identify Councils ready to establish Subcommittees. These subcommittees will ensure decision-makers keep residents informed; and that plans are being implemented according to resident feedback. Trained workshop participants will join their NCs to communicate updates and opportunities around the Plans and organize community efforts to educate their neighbors. Subcommittees will also monitor the CP process to mobilize residents around city planning and council hearings when necessary.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/save-spaces-for-healthy-places,

No wonder many students who don’t see themselves as successful learners think seriously about dropping out.  For LA to have a pipeline of well-prepared high school students who transition successfully into postsecondary education and 21st century careers, 9th grade students must stick it out. They must start by making it over the first hurdles: completing 9th grade, not being held back, and showing up in the 10th grade. A critical part of 9th grade success hinges on students seeing the importance of school for their futures and having decent attendance. Why? We know that students who miss too much school also miss lots of important content, don’t turn in homework, and don’t complete in-class assignments.
In this project, we define success in terms of how much students in these technology-enabled career exposure activities engage in school, how they connect school success to their future lives, and their belief that they will complete high school. We will use two information sources to measure these outcomes: student attendance and responses to in-class survey questions.

When students are not engaged in learning and cannot envision themselves in an exciting career, they see little reason to stay in school. A thriving and growing LA-region pipeline of students who succeed academically, aspire to postsecondary education or training, and want to engage in productive work demands significant career exposure that helps students create a vision for their own future.
LA has an abundance of terrific career opportunities, but many of them are beyond the boundaries of students’ local communities or even their imaginations. To start addressing this problem, for the past 10 years, ConnectEd has supported  LAUSD in building pathways that give students an engaging,  college preparatory curriculum plus career exposure. LA students have accessed ConnectEd’s library of Day in the Life, career-themed videos, and teachers have used them and  many other resources to design content for academic and technical courses.  However, the number of career development experiences students can have in real workplace settings has been greatly limited by time, resources, and logistics. The integrated technology solution proposed here addresses this limitation by adding Nepris technology and resources to an existing, collaborative career development design process. It will be a vehicle for teachers, starting in grade 9, to facilitate an initial one (expert) to many (students) virtual career development experience based on the career theme of  their existing career pathway and the students’ interests. Specifically, Nepris will match teacher requests to the skills of business/labor/and non-profit professionals and bring the right expert(s) into the classroom virtually to provide topic relevance, project mentoring, virtual tours of workplaces, opportunities for mock interviews, interactive Q&A sessions, and evaluation of students’ project work.
The integrated product we are proposing offers a strong value proposition for students, teachers, LAUSD, and the community. A single tool will (1) offer relevant career-themed academic, technical, and career development curriculum, including a wide array of rich media resources; 2) provide a way for project leaders to manage connections between the district and industry, the community, non-profits, universities, and labor organizations; (2) increase opportunities for the employer community to engage easily with educators and students; and (3) enhance efforts by the district to capitalize on the equity and community commitments of professional organizations such as Women in Engineering, the Greater Los Angeles African American Chamber of Commerce, the Society of Hispanic Engineers, local arts organizations, and many others.

Building a coalition of practitioners from different fields, we will begin forging the collective strength by forming discussion groups, mailing lists, sharing digital space and engaging in affinity marketing. We can collectively approach civic, commercial and political leaders for support and investment in realizing the Community Space. Shared resources that the space might provide to both Cornerstone and co-founding partners include thought partnership, rehearsal space, production or exhibition space, studios, and administrative offices. We can also envision joint efforts such as project-based collaborations and as a research hub to study and examine community-based art making practices. We envision creating opportunities for field leaders, especially artists of color, seniors and young people, to engage in dialogue, undertake residencies, build their work, experiment, and cooperate with similarly engaged colleagues.  

We envision a shared space that is open to all forms of civic dialogue and empowerment even those outside of art making, for example as polling sites or as a meeting space for community activists. Regionally and nationally, the potential that such a space holds will be illuminating for the field-at-large, as more and more organizations seek methods of addressing lack of equity, diversity and inclusion in our increasingly multicultural society through creative practice and aesthetic outcomes. Empowering Angelenos towards ownership of their community leads to collective impact. Catalyzing this dialogue connects local leaders; bringing them to the table creates a common agenda, while striving towards systemic change.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/shared-space-for-community-engaged-creative-practice,

New writers are making connections, sharing their work with the community and building a culture of writing in areas where this may not have existed before.  

We just need help to continue and expand the project.

Up to now, Tell Your True Tale workshops have been supported by the County Library; but that support is not open-ended. We also want to diversify and include different community partners.

Since starting at ELA Library in 2013, the workshops have taken some 50 people with no previous writing experience, helped them imagine and polish their stories, then published books of their pieces – leaving them energized by the creation and eager for more. Many of the participants have taken the workshop two and three times. We are at the beginnings of a new arts organization.
 
We’re now up to seven volumes of their stories. These volumes form a magnificent mosaic of life, and lives, in Los Angeles. They also show the deep mine of stories out there just waiting like diamonds to be dug up and polished. Los Angeles is a collection of bubbles of people, from across the country and the world, who know little about each other. Tell Your True Tale volumes bridge that, show the depth and breadth of the people who have settled here, and present a template for how to access their stories.

We bring the community together in public gatherings – book presentations that feature the authors, let them talk about their stories, sign books, feel the energy that comes with a newly published work.

Our motto is: Write Then Rewrite. No successful communication, no great story, no real creativity, comes without rewriting, editing, and more revising. We aimed to create nonfiction stories from working people’s lives that read like fiction.

We will measure success by the number of students who gain meaningful employment as a barber or hairstylist after graduation. With a license in hand, each graduate will be qualified to work as an entry-level barber anywhere in the country and earn a respectable wage doing so.

Another measure of success will be our ability to draw customers for haircuts at the college. Establishing a reputable brand will enable us to engage the community and provide value in the neighborhood. Low and no-cost haircuts to targeted populations (homeless, elderly, school-aged youth) will be served through appointments and walk-ins. The more customers come in, the more practical experience students receive and resources are added for sustainability of the project. 

We will measure success by our ability to ensure a sustainable social enterprise that increases the capacity of Angelenos to earn, start their own businesses, and serve the greater good.

We will take the best of the for-profit world – the aggressive pursuit of customers, an emphasis on efficiency, and the flexibility to meet the needs of the community– and combine it with the best of the non-profit world – an understanding of the ways people navigate dark times, an unconditional approach to engagement, and a love of finding resources and opportunities where there appear to be none.

This will help to make L.A. the best place to live because it will seize upon the fact that this city is ripe with resources, viewpoints, opportunities, and purposeful struggle. This social enterprise is a business that will ensure that the capacity for earning power is equal between homeless and non-homeless alike, equipping all with in-depth trade knowledge and small business acumen taught by an expert in the field, and provide a new understanding of just how close we all are, despite the challenges we’ve faced. This cooperative model creates a higher level of accountability and opportunity for community engagement; its income will not only fund the efforts of the college, but will underwrite the comprehensive services that we provide to Los Angeles’ homeless and trafficked youth.

We are firm in our belief that non-profits and for-profits have a lot to gain from one another. The charitable sector could be better at being unapologetic about economic progress and businesses could be better at understanding the real needs of the communities they call home. This project will address the issue of rent burden and earning capacity in L.A. Those armed with a trade that is relevant in a city this that employs hairstylists for myriad entertainment productions as well as the thousands of opportunities for barber positions. What’s more, we will create a body of graduates who will also be schooled in the art of starting and managing their own small businesses, a skill that translates anywhere. Finally, with the emphasis on service, we will generate a population of young, eager men and women with an eye for justice. 

Students enrolled in the barber college will have the option of joining our street outreach team and offer free haircuts to youth who are still on the streets. This takes the charitable model of service in the community and turns it on its head – we’re accustomed to the ‘givers’ in society being those who are blessed with resources but we know from experience that our youth who have the least are eager to give, and we couldn’t be more excited to help nourish a whole new population of givers who are creating positive change in L.A.

We are eager to witness the effect that hundreds of service-oriented graduates with earning power and a unique perspective on social engagement will have on our social and fiscal economies.

Also, studies show that children with an engaged father are more likely to further their education, get married, and less likely to become incarcerated. On the other hand, father involvement and the prevalence of fatherless homes and communities are a crisis in this nation that needs to be addressed. Below is a quote from United States Census Bureau: 
“Children in father absent homes are almost four times more likely to be poor.

This means each additional patron connection puts more strain on the local network and its E-Rate subsidized Internet connection, so that it slows to a crawl or even breaks very often. 

MIMO WiFi technologies use more than one antenna to beam connections to each new patron, which means net performance should actually increase as patrons are added. Mega-MIMO 2.0, as defined by MIT researchers, coordinates multiple AP's to make one big virtual MIMO AP, with more antenna and beam diversity as each AP is added. Combined with mesh routing methods, this allows existing WiFi antennae resources to connect with patrons much faster and farther out. These improvements are from better software, not expensive hardware. Our tests of WiFi speed, range, reliability, and costs should all improve accordingly.

Once any Mega-Mesh extends beyond a host institution's walls, patrons who run Mega-Mesh software on their devices can also join in to grow the net even wider. As it grows into entire communities, local library and e-media resources hosted on the Mega-Mesh can be spread around these communities faster at lower costs. Event calendars and other locally sourced data can all stay local, including during emergencies.

Rather than depending on far away cloud providers, e-media or courseware owned by any library can be shared directly over its local Mega-Mesh.","[""Access to free wifi"",""Cultural events"",""Public/open streets gatherings"",""Government responsiveness to residents’ needs"",""Public transit riders"",""Participation in neighborhood councils"",""Rates of volunteerism"",""Residential segregation"",""Total number of local social media friends and connections Angelenos have"",""Voting rates""]","Too often, the Internet is seen as this big cloud of stuff very far away, where the only way to access it all is via the incumbent Big Telco or Big Cable gatekeeper, at whatever high prices they want. In reality, 'Internet' is just shorthand for 'interconnected networks', and anyone can build and own a small network without paying any monthly fees. Once anyone connects their own network with any neighbors', they are considered peers on their own inter-net. Unfortunately, that first incorrect view has been written into a lot of our utility and connection laws, including FCC E-Rate restrictions on the kinds of network services our public schools and libraries can afford. 

The combination of new Mega-MIMO 2.0 WiFi and distributed Mesh technologies may allow us to fix these problems with Internet ownership and E-Rate restrictions, and allow local community learning resources to thrive over a local Mega-Mesh both online and off. With enough hardware funding for an experimental Learning Angels' Mega-Mesh (LAMM) network, Los Angeles institutions could become the first place where community teaching tools are distributed, instead of the last place community members search for vanishing scarce free WiFi.

If enough prototype hardware is funded for at least 2 site installations, local Los Angeles learning institutions will all be eligible to apply to be one of the first sites with a seed Mega-Mesh. More funding or less expensive prototype hardware will allow us to accept more local institutions into the prototype test phase.

We firmly believe that physician-patient interactions provide a unique opportunity to identify though who do no have reliable access to healthy food, educate these patients and our community, and connect them with the numerous excellent resources already available in Los Angeles. 

Many Los Angelenos suffer from food insecurity, but are unaware of the resources that are available to help them. Often this is a result of language barriers, cultural barriers, and stigma/ostracization of homeless, mentally ill, and poor who are in need in our community. Physicians are uniquely positioned as trusted community members, who often have access to populations in need who otherwise are difficult to engage. For example, in the emergency departments of Los Angeles, physicians often have the opportunity interact with those suffering from homelessness, drug addiction, and mental illness who are otherwise not connected with services organizations and case managers. These points of contact create a unique opportunity to identify those suffering from food insecurity, provide education, and connect these patients with resources to address their needs. These points of contact can be multiplied as those screened, educated and connected share their experiences with others in inaccessible communities in need. 

Our approach to this campaign has 2 main components:

1) Education - This entails the development of resources to educate physicians on the importance of screening for food insecurity, how they can incorporate this into their practices, and what to do when they determine a patient does not have reliable access to healthy food. This will involve the creation of a web page, handouts to be given to physicians and patients,  and an educational seminar/webinar, which can be attended in real time, or viewed as a recording posted to our website.

2) Community engagement - We will create a campaign for health care providers in LA to screen their patients for food insecurity, educate them, and connect them with resources. This will increase health care provider awareness of the importance of this issue and encourage providers to incorporate innovative methods of addressing these issues in the future. We will provide physicians with 'prescription for food' handouts for use in their practice, including the locations of nearby food banks as well as instructions on how to apply for WIC, SNAP, and other resources. The campaign would include a social media component where physicians report back their experience and raise awareness of this issue in our community and among other others. We will additionally have a media outreach component, encouraging physicians to submit op eds to local newspapers, blogs and other media sources to raise awareness of this issue.

Build a movement of solutions-oriented teachers;
Identify and train teachers to lead change in their schools, districts and union;
Create teacher-developed policy recommendations;
Advocate for teacher-developed recommendations; and
Scale the model with training, partnerships and resources.

We measure our success based on the following: 
Expanding our membership by serving hundreds of additional teachers each year;
Training dozens of additional teachers to take on leadership roles or actions on behalf of LA students;
Elevating research and classroom expertise by publishing one teacher-created policy paper per year; and
Making substantive policy changes by mobilizing our members to promote meaningful changes in policy and practice.

We use the following mechanisms to measure progress:
Tracking membership and leadership data through a robust Salesforce CRM;
Surveying members, non-member teachers, partners, parents and students to inform our policy positions and papers;
Tracking education policy issues, bills, resolutions and media; and
Tracking the outputs and performance of our team against goals to inform training and course correction.","[""Money "",""Advisors/board members"",""Staff "",""Publicity/awareness""]","E4E-LA is building a movement of teachers to take action on behalf of student success. As our district responds to decades of demand for better public schools by trying to implement higher standards, healthier school climates, and improved rates of entry to colleges and careers, E4E-LA provides teachers with opportunities to learn about education policy, network with policy makers, and participate in leadership development and advocacy campaigns to make LA a great place to learn and teach.","[""College matriculation rates"",""District-wide graduation rates"",""Proficiency in English and Language Arts and Math"",""Student education pipeline"",""Students’ perceived sense of safety at and on the way to school"",""Suspension and expulsion rates""]","To help transform LAUSD into a great place to learn and teach, we are building a teacher-led movement for education equity. In doing so, we will continue training teachers to lead policy design, advocacy and implementation where critical decisions are made that affect teaching and learning--at their schools, unions, district and state. 

Why are teachers a critical lever for educational equity? Teachers often bear witness to the problems and shortcomings of our education system. In addition to contending with persistent achievement gaps, our school system struggles to empower parents and teachers who are increasingly defecting from public education and the teaching profession. In LAUSD and California, student enrollment has declined by 2.6% annually since 2002, and enrollment in teacher preparation programs has decreased by 53% since 2009. The confluence of these and other alarming trends creates less funding and faith in our public schools and a looming teacher shortage estimated at 100,000 in the next decade.

In the face of these challenges, teachers, parents and students intuitively know that a great teacher can change the trajectory of a student’s future. In fact, research shows that teachers are the most influential school-based factor determining student achievement. However, despite what research, parents and students already know, teacher voices are rarely included in education policy discussions. And as a result, teachers are often positioned as the subjects, not agents, of education reform. This leads to lower rates of engagement, morale and retention among teachers.

We are helping teachers harness their passion for students and their frustration with “the system” into a movement for smarter, more equitable education policy. Five years into this work, we have inspired more than 4,500 teachers to join our movement and hundreds to lead our policy and advocacy work, and they are focused on making LA a better place to learn and teach. Our teachers have already taken steps to influence and impact Common Core implementation and school climate, affecting outcome metrics such as: college matriculation rates, district-wide graduation rates, student education pipeline, students’ perceived sense of safety at and on the way to school and suspension and expulsion rates. 

E4E-LA teachers have crafted research-based policy recommendations, testified before the LAUSD School Board, taken on formal leadership seats in their schools, district and union, written media and participated in coalitions with parent and youth organizations that have resulted in concrete changes to budget, support plans, staffing and accountability. Most importantly, our teachers have experienced improvements in the number of students we engage, graduate and send to college. While there is greater room for improvement in Los Angeles public education, our teachers are becoming part of the solution.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/those-who-can-teach!-elevating-teacher-solutions-for-student-needs,

Yet in the country that invented the Internet, nearly one in five Americans (64 million), disproportionately from low-income and minority communities, are not connected to the Internet at home, forcing them to use inconvenient public sources to access basic services. The global impact of the digital divide lies in how it compounds and deepens other social inequalities. For example, 80% of K-12 students need Internet to do homework, 90% of college applications are filled out online, and 90% of job applications are hosted online.  An unemployed person who has Internet at home will be employed over seven weeks faster, due to availability of online job search platforms and advice, which translates into over $5,000 in additional income over a year.

- Almost all existing homes in LA County were built as luxury or mass housing, to make a profit, back when it used to be easier to construct housing 
- in recent decades we changed rules to make it harder to build enough new homes, and we reaping the results today with rising costs and homelessness
- by adopting better rules, we can allow more housing of all types to be built, helping people of all backgrounds

- what types of homes exist in LA county?
- how were lower cost homes built?
- what changed to slow housing production?
- do places that add more new housing have more or less displacement?
- which cities in LA county do a good/bad job adding homes?
- what are policies to add housing in LA County?

Because many people are visual thinkers, we will also illustrate good strategies & policies for adding more more housing using images and diagrams. To reach LA’s diverse population, we will translate all materials into Spanish and info graphics into Chinese.

Youth growing up in foster care are among LA County’s most at-risk populations. These are young people who experience trauma and neglect within their families. As these young people grow older, many struggle to succeed in school and find work, and have yet to develop critical self-sufficiency skills.

The oil we extract, refine and burn and our natural gas infrastructure are causing severe health consequences for our communities. According to the Los Angeles County Asthma Profile, nearly 1,221,000 adults and children have been diagnosed with asthma. Asthma contributes to 332 deaths yearly in LA County and 14 of those are children under 18. This is a direct result of our continued dependence on fossil fuels and polluting gas infrastructure in Los Angeles. To make Los Angeles a healthy and cleaner place to live, we must transition away from fossil fuels. 

We are working to commit Los Angeles to a 100% renewable energy future by 2030 that mandates phasing out the use of dangerous natural gas, obtained via fracking, and the decommissioning of polluting gas power plants and storage fields in the Los Angeles basin. Currently, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) operates four gas fired generating stations in Los Angeles. These gas power plants are located in underserved communities in Sun Valley, Wilmington, Long Beach and El Segundo. 

Currently, DWP is working to transition off coal power by 2025, but this could means more reliance on polluting gas infrastructure unless we make sure that is replaced by renewable power. According to studies by CalTech and NOAA, L.A.'s gas infrastructure and pipelines leak methane at an alarming rate: 2.5-6% of gas delivered in-basin leaks and contributes to 47% of all methane emissions in Los Angeles. Finally, Los Angeles just witnessed the worst gas blowout at the Aliso Canyon Gas Field that forced the evacuation of over 15,000 households in the San Fernando Valley. We are working to keep the dangerous and leaky field closed for good. 

Instead of transitioning from coal to gas, Los Angeles needs to make a commitment to 100% renewable energy by 2030 to clean up the air and prevent the worsening of the climate crisis. 100% renewable by 2030 is necessary to prevent 1.5°C warming of the planet. Already, we have seen a 1°C rise in temperatures and have observed effects of violent storms, droughts, floods, acidifying and rapidly warming oceans and altered growing seasons.

It will make LA the best place to LEARN in three ways: 
1. Providing great opportunities for students.
2. Surfacing LA innovation, businesses and solutions.
3. Hyper-driving collaboration in universities and across the city.

1. Providing Opportunities for Students:
Students with the most inspired ideas get recognized by leaders in business, government and education, helping them find better jobs, graduate programs and opportunities.  When brought to scale, by 2050 every student in LA who attends a university and participates would have the same opportunities to rise above the noise and get recognized by global leaders for their ideas, research and hard work.

2. Surfacing Great Local Ideas:
After great ideas are submitted by local students, professors, researchers, orgs and business, we use the power of the crowd, machine learning and sentiment analysis to surface the best ideas every day, week, month and year.  The result is a living archive of great ideas that is always surfacing the best innovation and solutions from LA residents. 

3. Hyper-Driving Collaboration:
When the best local ideas and research are always being surfaced in one LA hub, this allows everyone in the city to keep their fingers on the pulse of emerging projects and research, increasing recruitment and funding opportunities for the most promising LA innovation.  This will allow everyone working on the same problems to find each other and organize.  The goal is sustainable convergence for all of LA's thinkers & doers, instead of fragmented research and effort.

Conclusion:
Using #Library to unify LA's ideas, research, projects and efforts by synchronizing its students, researchers, activists, orgs and local businesses, would make LA the most collaborative city in America.  By 2050, millions of people will be given opportunities for better jobs, graduate programs and funding, and each will be given the chance to play a role in the advancement of local research and innovation in Los Angeles.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/sync-thinkers-doers-research-to-hyperdrive-local-solutions-innovation,

We have access to several key metrics which can help measure the effectiveness of our program:

1) We anticipate an increase on our standardized test scores of five percentage points per year over the next five years.

2) Fitnessgram results. Each year, fifth graders go through a set of physical fitness tests. In spring of 2016, [averages data from the most recent fitnessgram results].

Several years ago, Glenfeliz Elementary  School began a multi-year collaborative process to help address these concerns within our school and our community. We were incredibly proud earlier this year when Glenfeliz was designated the first ever Farm-to-Table Gardening and Culinary Arts SAS Program in the Los Angeles Unified School District. The kitchen garden and outdoor classroom we built with our partner EnrichLA is the first public school garden certified by the Department of Agriculture, County of Los Angeles.  Our goal is to increase student interest and achievement in school, while promoting good nutrition and the health of our community, both in Atwater Village and throughout Los Angeles.

As a diverse Title I public elementary school located in the heart of Atwater Village, Glenfeliz Elementary is ideally situated to implement this new and innovative Farm-to-Table Gardening and Culinary SAS Program. Over 70% of our students qualify for assisted lunch. For some of our students, the meals and snacks they receive at school are their primary source of nutrition. Because families in Title I schools often lack the education and resources to provide balanced nutrition at home, our program aims to improve both our students and their families’ awareness of health and nutrition, while meeting key LAUSD education metrics. We serve over 300 local families and also open our doors for many community events, including our annual Harvest Festival and Friday Night in the Garden. 

With our new SAS distinction, our hope is to grow our Farm-to-Table Gardening and Culinary program in order to draw students from all over Los Angeles, as well as to open our door for even more community involvement. Over the past several years, with the help of our community partners, including local restaurants like Forage, we have placed an increased emphasis on health, nutrition and the joy of cooking within our curriculum. Our students learn lessons in math, science, English language arts and the fine arts all while working in our garden and preparing healthy and delicious food. 

Due to our passion and commitment, non-profits EnrichLA and Common Threads have chosen Glenfeliz as their flagship school. This grant will allow us to expand our program by building three fully-equipped kitchen classrooms, increasing our gardening hours with EnrichLA’s Garden Ranger Program, offering more cooking classes for both our students and parents through Common Threads, as well as providing us opportunities to share our gardening and culinary expertise through more nutrition-oriented community programs.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/glenfeliz-helping-la-grow,

Unfortunately, due to severe budget cuts in LAUSD over the past several years, our facilities are in a sad state of disrepair. Our field is worn out, and too hot from the exposed crumb rubber, creating a dramatic heat island effect that makes the surface significantly less playable. As the crumb rubber migrates off the field, it is also becoming harder and poses greater risk of concussion. The field is also desperately in need of drainage upgrades, so that runoff may naturally feed the arroyo that runs through our school. Our recording and audio equipment are severely outdated, making it difficult for participants to hear theatrical performances and film screenings of student work and others. Our beautiful outdoor amphitheater is in a state of disrepair and in desperate need of ground cover and shade trees. This area serves as a place for students to play hacky sack and just run around a little during the day. It is also a scene of bi-weekly dance parties put on by student DJs, and has the potential to be a regularly working outdoor theater and alternative physical education space.

The Project will be anchored in Friends of the Family’s Young Dads program, a long-term training and support program with a 20 year track record of success. 
Research confirms that poverty has great negative impact on children and teens, creating an atmosphere of chronic stress that impairs attention and concentration and can lead to depression, low self-esteem and a sense of powerlessness over the future.  Children being raised by a single parent miss out on learning about healthy relationships. For boys, the absence of a positive male role model at critical developmental stages has a long-lasting impact.  They emerge from their homes into a culture that links masculinity with toughness, violence, and sex.  They face social pressures to initiate sex at an early age, a pregnancy happens, and the cycle is set to repeat itself for another generation. 
The Man2Man Project seeks to interrupt this cycle by influencing two key metrics selected to measure progress toward making LA the best place to connect – enhancing social and emotional support and increasing volunteerism, in this case among multiple generations of boys and men in our community.  It has two key components:   (1) the Young Dads Impact Team and (2) the Adult Mentor program.
Young Dads Impact Team members will be trained and coached to connect with middle/high school youths to educate them about male responsibility for teen pregnancy prevention and the real-life challenges of being a young dad.  This approach capitalizes on the peer-to-peer influence of young men who are close to the youths in age, come from their own community, and face the same challenges they do.  This activity also increases the self-esteem of the Young Dads as they recognize that that their life experiences have value as they are “giving back” to the community.
The Adult Mentor Program will provide the kind of mentorship that Young Dads need as a part of their ongoing support system.  Adult male volunteers will be recruited from a variety of sources – academia, business, trades, sports, churches, retirees – successful men with a wide span of life experience to share.  They will be trained and supervised by qualified FOF staff to develop enriching relationships with individual Young Dads and provide insight, advice, and encouragement.  In turn, the Young Dads will be coached to become mentors for younger men following in their footsteps.
By fostering the development of a vital network for men and boys to support each other “man to man” around the importance of responsible fatherhood, the M2M Project will impact future generations and help make LA the best place to connect.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/the-man2man-project-preventing-boys-from-becoming-dads-too-early-and-helping-teen-dads-to-step-up!,

We will simplify, and make it compatible with all water piping systems.  

Here's why we should use Multi-Spectral Imaging: 

1. Nitrogen: Plant growth and nitrogen deficiency symptoms can be detected by leaf spectral reflectance differences in the red and near infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.

2. Irrigation: Heat emitted by plants under water stress can be assessed through thermal images. Spectral changes due to water stress can be also detected with visible and Near Infrared wavelengths. 

3. Yield Management: “Plant growth can be detected by plant spectral differences in the visible and NIR portion of the EM spectrum”. 

4. Soil Mapping: Variations in soil color related to soil properties such as texture, or organic matter can be detected by soil spectral differences in the red and NIR portion of the EM spectrum.

Fuzzy logic is an approach to computing based on 'degrees of truth' rather than the usual 'true or false' (1 or 0) Boolean logic on which the modern computer is based.

Our Los Angeles listeners, which we have between 100,000 to 125,000 annually, are spread across the entire city. According to our past surveys, the location of our donors, and the emails we have received throughout the years, we have listeners in every part of the city: from South Los Angeles, to Highland Park; from East Los Angeles to Hollywood and everything in between. Los Angeles is the second largest radio market in the US, and we anticipate awareness and listenership of dublab programming to increase dramatically once we get on the FM airwaves. 

Beginning in the throes of the internet boom of the late 1990s, dublab has maintained a steady, relevant presence that has out-lived countless other internet radio organizations. To date, we are officially the longest-broadcasting online station in the world. Due to our longevity and a desire to share music not heard on mainstream radio, dublab is recognized as a pioneer in the now booming field of internet radio streaming. Both an incubator for homegrown talent and an early champion of various LA-based artists, from Flying Lotus and Dam-Funk to Julia Holter and Animal Collective, local and international audiences consider dublab to be an anchor in LA's forward-thinking artistic and musical movements. While our organization is known internationally as a beacon of LA music and culture, it is also a hub where Angelenos can access contemporary sounds from around the world, and independent artists can find traction and airtime where they might not have had otherwise.

Get Lit will measure the impacts and success of the Lit for Literacy Tour using all key quantitative data elements – including how many schools implement our curriculum, how many students graduate from our program, and how many students attend performances – as well as qualitative data from student, teacher, and principal surveys that assess changes individually, in the classroom, and in the school culture. We will also collect and compare pre­ and post­English Language Arts test scores in the schools that we work with and evaluate improvements in writing, reading, and memorization; increased life skills as students apply their learning across curriculum and make connections to future careers; and broadened horizons full of personal relevancy, hope, and renewed enthusiasm for learning. 

Get Lit’s school curriculum promotes literacy and college readiness; develops critical thinking, public speaking, and performance abilities; creates leaders; and develops vital social skills that are rooted in self-awareness and confidence, personal responsibility, collaboration, and compassion. A successful Tour will achieve all this while increasing exposure to and engagement in media literacy and the transformative power of poetic expression.","[""Money "",""Volunteers"",""Advisors/board members"",""Publicity/awareness"",""Education/training "",""Technical infrastructure (computers etc.)"",""Community outreach "",""Network/relationship support"",""n/a""]","Get Lit seeks funds to put the Get Lit Players on our brand new Poetry Bus for a “Lit for Literacy” Tour that will visit underserved middle schools, high schools, and community centers throughout Los Angeles County.

Their innovative poetry created a new art genre that they “took on the road” from clubs and gatherings to classrooms across San Francisco and the nation. 

Similarly, you can HOP ON THE BUS with the Get Lit Players, an award-winning performance troupe made up of teenagers from high schools throughout Los Angeles, who are going on a “Lit for Literacy” Tour to share personal stories as well as classic and response poems from their new book “Get Lit Rising” to inspire youth literacy and social activism. A book alone can change a life. Especially this one, which youth can relate to the true stories of their peers' journeys navigating crushing circumstances to find hope and personal voice through poetry. 

Currently, literacy rates in Los Angeles rank among the lowest in the state, with high school drop out rates exceeding the national average. This creates a sense of hopelessness and separateness in one of the country’s largest counties stretching over 4,751 square miles, with the second largest school district where over 90 languages are spoken and geography ranges from the ocean to inner-city to canyons. 

Get Lit’s “Lit for Literacy” Tour creates a connection between these diverse schools and communities through the universal language of story and poetry. Combining the book with performances can lead to extraordinary transformation, setting lost youth on a path they did not even know existed. Through LA2050, the Get Lit Players will perform for over 30,000 teens at 50 Los Angeles middle and high schools, 10 libraries, and 20 community events, modeling engaged learning and performance achievement, and leading workshops from Get Lit’s unique curriculum which was recently approved as a University of California ‘A-G’ college prep elective. 

The Get Lit Players will travel on the only poetry bus in the country, with original artwork by Ernesto Yerena, a Boyle Heights-based artist who trained for years as Shepard Fairey’s right-hand man. An online app will make it possible to follow the Tour stops and location of the bus, and a professional documentary crew will accompany the Tour to tell the story through the powerful medium of video. The completed digital film will be submitted to major film festivals and distributed online. 

In this crucial time of elections with growing tension around police-community relations, inner-city violence, and inflated rates of type 2 diabetes, educating and awaking the activism of our youth has never been more important. Get Lit’s model has proven effective. Now we have the vehicle and book to reach many more people. By connecting Los Angeles youth from different areas and amplifying their voices to adults and policy makers, we can create a more engaged populace that betters the lives of all Angelinos to come.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/get-lit-players-go-on-a-lit-for-literacy-tour-in-los-angeles-first-poetry-bus!,

To funnel more women into tech careers and eradicate gender disparities in STEM fields, Girls in Tech seeks to provide training and education to women who are entering, or have an interest in, careers within STEM. To accomplish this, Girls in Tech would launch a Success Factors Boot Camp, a three-day course that teaches female entrepreneurs all the basic tools they need to succeed, from ideation to product development to pivoting. In this 3-part series, the participants of this GIT program will develop skills that they will hone and leverage session over session, using best-in-class methods and current research for maximum engagement and retention.  All participants leave with actionable skills, rich interactions with fellow participants, and critical knowledge that they will use and apply for a long time to come. We are also bringing an e-mentorship platform that can further support participants both in person and online so that progress can be effectively reached and measured. We want to ensure that we can bring our bootcamps to LA with the aim to educate aspiring entrepreneurs and women with technical backgrounds on how to build and launch a company; increase the number of women launching startups and secure seed funding; connect seasoned entrepreneurs and professionals with aspiring entrepreneurs for long-term, ongoing mentoring and sponsoring purposes. 
In addition to this, we would expand the Catalyst Conference to become a semi-annual event allowing GIT to host the conference in additional locations every year. The conference has been lauded for its ability to bring women in tech from around the world to one location to explore opportunities, learn and network with some of the lead thinkers and innovators.

Global climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, manifesting in Los Angeles as heatwaves, droughts, dry spells, and fire. Global Green’s experience with green building efforts in Los Angeles, New Orleans and New York has led us to identify a key moment between response and recovery when needs are high and disadvantaged populations are likely to suffer most from extended power outages. Our solution is expanding our Resilience Hub program that we have piloted in New York City since 2013. The program provides grid-tied solar with off-grid battery storage for emergency power to centrally located, familiar community buildings within areas that suffered disaster damage, power loss and have no emergency shelters. These hubs provide back-up energy capacity to provide emergency services, creating safe and reliable points of distribution following emergency events. Year round, they engage the community in climate adaptation and resilience. 

Action on climate issues has been limited on a national level due to political controversy, however some cities and metropolitan regions that have experienced disasters have developed responses. The responses and lessons learned from our work in places like New Orleans and New York after Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy are valuable tools for the transferability of adaptation and resilience pathways to Los Angeles. Global Green’s experience with green rebuilding efforts in disadvantaged communities in Los Angeles, New Orleans and New York has led us to identify a key moment between response and recovery when needs are high: after the disaster, but before stabilization - a gap comprising five to ten days, where the most disadvantaged among us will suffer without access to power, water, heating, and cooling.

As extreme weather events and corresponding electricity disruptions become more regular, it is critical that Los Angeles’ most disadvantaged residents have access to safe, reliable community centers that can quickly support residents during recovery efforts. Building off previous experience, Global Green will develop a Resilience Hub model specifically suited for our increasingly hot, arid climate, and work with local community development corporations to identify sites for building pilot hubs.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/los-angeles-resilience-hubs-developing-a-model-for-a-resilient-city,

In most cases, obesity can be prevented or controlled by regular physical activity. However, 80% of people in the United States do not meet the federally recommended minimum exercise guidelines. Obesity is a major health concern. Adult obesity rates range from 10% to 40% in Los Angeles County. Cities and regions with the highest obesity rates of 30% to 40% include Baldwin Hills, Bell Gardens, Carson, Compton, Culver City, Downey, Inglewood, Lennox, Long Beach, Los Angeles, Lynwood, Hawthorn, Gardena, and Paramount. 

The Grassroots Training for Health project’s goals are twofold: (1) Establish a program within the community to build a culture of health through a structured physical activity program, and (2) Establish a train-the-trainer program in which members of the community can be the exercise trainer at the conclusion of the Grassroots for Health program.

The Grassroots Training for Health project will equip the Community with the necessary equipment to begin a basic workout routine. The Grassroots Training for Health has partnered with the founder of Academy of Strength and Sport, Danny Henry to be the exercise champion for the Community. Danny Henry will teach two fitness classes per week for the Community for the award period. This project will work with the Community members and Danny Henry in selecting the members that will go through the train-the-trainer program. The Grassroots Training for Health, the Community, and Danny Henry will formulate workout routines and class times that best meets the schedule of the Community. Danny Henry will work with the Community in selecting the future trainers through an application process.

At the conclusion of the Grassroots Training for Health program, the community members will have the necessary skills and equipment to run a physical exercise training program independently. The engagement and efforts by the members of the Community to promote health through physical activity will foster and cultivate a Community that is resilient and healthy. The Grassroots Training for Health program hopes to empower the Community to cultivate and maintain a positive health culture for many generations to come. 

The Grassroots Training for Health has identified the Community, in the initial phase as “Churches.” A “church” provides the structure and the Community in which this project will benefit the most.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/grassroots-training-for-health-combating-obesity-one-community-at-a-time,

As proof-of-concept in a temporary location, and in just six months, boxcar+muse has connected almost 100 diverse women, taking them on creative journeys together via expert-led workshops on subjects ranging from felt-making, gardening, and improv to decision-making, financial literacy, and goal-setting. We’ve hired over a dozen local artisans and experts and forged relationships with local studios and businesses. Many friendships and barters have sprung from the “boxcarmunity” as have several collaborations, professional opportunities, and at least two Etsy shops.

We’ll be able to multiply our work and play sponsorship and to formalize inclusion programs. We’ll also be able to increase the breadth and depth of our offerings when member-driven clubs like The Accomplices (for racial, gender, and economic anti-oppression training and action) or All Hands on Deck (for civic and social volunteering) have regular meeting space and resources, and when we can hire series leaders for the year rather than for a month at a time. And our curated space will allow us to both incubate and promote members’ work.

boxcar+muse, itself a women-owned arts establishment, believes that inspiring women to regularly explore creativity and innovation like this will lead to gains in CREATE metrics like employment, arts establishments, women-owned firms, patents and manufacturing, and graduates-retention. We have already shown demonstrable and ongoing gains in CONNECT and PLAY metrics such as access to free WiFi, social and emotional support, cultural events, local social media friends and connections for Angelenos, and the number and quality of informal play spaces.

We will measure success based on the following:
- Number of tech startups exhibiting by industry
- Number of CSUPERB researchers presenting
- Number of corporate/industry influencers and investors attending

Through pre- and post-event surveys, we will measure the following:
- % of attendees interested in participating in collaborative opportunities
- % of students who express an interest in pursuing STEM-related careers or entrepreneurial endeavors

While one event alone cannot impact the CREATE metrics such as federal research grant funding or high-growth startups, we believe that offering a platform for collaboration across the entrepreneurial ecosystem will, over the long-term, result in more manufacturing activity, more STEM-related job opportunities, more patents per capita, increased venture capital investment, and an increase of minority- and women-owned tech startups reflecting the diversity of Southern California’s residents.","[""Money "",""Volunteers"",""Advisors/board members"",""Publicity/awareness"",""Community outreach "",""Network/relationship support""]","IGNITE22 brings together, in a collaborative environment, the entrepreneurial community, industry partners, academic institutions, and other stakeholders and supporting organizations, for an event that showcases technology that will impact our lives into the 22nd Century.

Entrepreneurs will benefit from the connections with industry collaborators and investors, as well as access to academic researchers and deep science. Investors benefit from making connections with a vast array of tech entrepreneurs. Corporate executives and industry leaders get an opportunity to experience new technology that may impact their businesses while they explore how early adoption will lead to competitive advantage. University students and faculty will connect with industry to move projects beyond the lab toward the goal of commercialization. The event will engage high school students interested in STEM careers inspiring them to become tech entrepreneurs. Elected officials and policymakers will learn about technology trends and therefore, better understand impacts and opportunities within their communities.

Collectively, IGNITE22 is the spark that will attract visionaries that will help make LA be the best place to CREATE. As a result of connections being made and collaborations being formed, IGNITE22 will positively impact the metrics we’ve identified.

Through strategic partnerships, startups have a better chance of gaining market traction and realizing exponential growth. This results in more and better jobs, increased manufacturing in the region and an improved Gini coefficient. By engaging high school and college students from the LA Harbor area we will inspire the next generation of entrepreneurs and STEM leaders, offering role models that will lead to more minority and women-owned businesses. These students are then more likely to attend and then graduate from local higher education institutions and more likely to remain in the region due to the improved career opportunities.

Today, many don’t have this access; only 36% of residents live within a 5 minute walk to a grocery store and tree canopy cover only makes up 21% of our land (contrasted with a national average of 27%).  Only 16% of the city is park land, and from 2007 to 2012 county farm land declined by 15%; only 3% of the total land area in the county is devoted to farming and only 2% of food consumed is locally produced. Access to community garden plots is in high demand and often too expensive due to fee hikes for water and the density of agricultural production associated with higher median income neighborhoods with higher percentages of white residents.  Lack of access combined with health and environmental inequalities have dire consequences. 20% of LA County residents are obese and the poverty rate is 15%, one of the highest in the country.  Poverty, obesity, and lack of access to fresh food are linked to negative health outcomes, including diabetes and depression.

The Trellis Project is a multi-pronged collaboration by two established nonprofits, Groceryships and Netiya, designed to address these health and environmental inequalities by integrating nutrition support education into pre-existing faith communities and making use of underused lands at congregations throughout LA County. Through LA2050 we propose to work at two south LA churches, offering Groceryships’ 20-week nutrition education support groups, the installation of two Netiya community gardens, and the Netiya Victory Garden certification course.  Groceryships’ support groups include fresh produce “scholarships,” emotional support, and tools to consume more whole foods on a budget; Netiya offers the creation of water-wise community gardens on underused lands at faith-based institutions. Both empower communities to create lasting change in their food consumption habits, and increase access to healthy, whole foods. 

Our two church partners, Emmanuel HM Turner AME Church and New Mount Calvary Church in Central Alameda, are home to a bustling community among the highest density neighborhoods in LA.  Residents are 97% Latino and Black with a median household income of $32,000, well below the county median of $53,000.  28% of people in the 90011 zip code are food insecure, contrasted with 9% for the city overall, and the nearest grocery stores are over 4 miles away from our proposed garden sites. 35% of 90011 zip code’s residents are obese, compared to only 25% across LA County. Life expectancy here is estimated at 77.6 years, compared to 84.2 for West LA.

Creating a pilot nursery at this centralized location will provide a highly visible and accessible testing ground for innovative plant research and production that can translate to more efficient practices used by the public, agencies and other professionals. The LAb will serve as the flagship site that tests out best practices to be applied to other locations around the region. Under the scientific expertise and guidance of The Nature Conservancy, Grown in LA will conduct research on plant propagation techniques, climate adaptation, urban trees, and water management. Plants grown on site will be used in ecological restoration projects in Griffith Park and along the LA River. The site will host demonstration installations that reacquaint urban dwellers with nature and illustrate how ecology can regenerate and thrive in the midst of human activity and climate change.

A Conservation Pathways Coordinator will teach workshops with the guidance of our partners Orchard Dale Water District and Water Replenishment District of Southern California (WRD), which provide program input on a volunteer basis. Since July 2015, HYC has conducted 30 on-site conservation workshops. With LA2050 funding, HYC will expand our project and resources to serve more residents. We aim to increase the number of people reached to 25,000 children, youth, adults and seniors from throughout Southeast Los Angeles County, including students from school districts with which HYC partners. 

A touch-screen educational Kiosk will deepen the learning experience more than existing signage, allowing interactivity regarding local natural habitats, water and energy conservation strategies, and sustainable landscaping methods. Kiosk content will be especially geared toward children and youth. To facilitate the greatest reach for the project, HYC will develop a Southern California Conservation mobile app that youth and families can install on their telephones to deepen their environmental and conservation learning. A 10-passenger van will provide increased access to Conservation Pathways.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/conservation-pathways-environmental-education-and-careers-for-tomorrows-leaders,

Here to Serve comes through during the deepest, darkest, most stressful time that a parent can face. When a child is gravely ill, Here to Serve is there to help families bridge the gap from heart ache and catastrophe to a new life which sadly doesn't always include their child.” Leilani O'Dell

Coordinated support from family, friends and the community is needed to avoid the high rates of illness, death, bankruptcies, and lost productivity at work for parents with a critically-ill child or young parent who does not qualify for government support. Here to Serve stands in the gap to identify, mobilize and organize a community of support to avoid physical, emotional and financial collapse of the family and caregiver.

Here to Serve believes we need to care about the well-being of lower and middle-class families who DO NOT qualify for government assistance, who's health care requires premiums and often large co-pays and no support from hospital social workers who are focused on patients on government assistance. This invisibly under-served sector of society are contributors in their family, community, and the economy.

We CONNECT people and organizations with them through social media and as family members hand out custom business cards provided by Here to Serve to register friends and loved ones on the family’s custom online care community. These online communities provide: an interactive calendar of daily household needs such as meals, child and pet care, house cleaning, shopping, transportation; medical updates; a blog; fundraising, and numerous ways to support the family. Here to Serve’s research coordinator demystifies and CONNECTS caregiver/families to other charities, businesses and organizations through our database of 3000+ organizations.

LA offers large and diverse communities of people, charities and businesses who can help. Los Angeles is by far one of the top 5 cities to offer the most resources to people, but that also makes it the most confusing and difficult to navigate. Most people in LA are not connected with their communities.  When a life crisis hits, they flounder trying to seek small solutions to large issues like a meal list at church when they are in for an 18-month journey with a child who has cancer. These are not solutions, they are band-aids. Here to Serve offers real solutions by leveraging social media to CONNECT communities of support not just weeks but for the time needed to get the family through a medical crisis, usually 6 to 18 mos.

LA is the BEST place to CONNECT and Here to Serve offers the only program and platform to do that when you have a young child or parent in medical crisis and you do not qualify for government assistance!",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/connecting-communities-of-support-with-families-who-have-a-critically-ill-young-child-or-parent,

The new Spring Street parklets will make LA the best place to connect for the tens of thousands of residents, visitors, and commuters that use Spring Street every day in several ways:

- Public/Open Space: In densely populated DTLA, public open space is an important and scare resource. Projects such as Pershing Square Renew and DTLA Forward seek to maximize public open space for the benefit of our entire community. The Spring Street parklets will add public open space in a critical zone: the residential, bar, and restaurant hub of Spring Street. The parklets will allow Downtowners, visitors, and daytime workers to relax, eat, work, play, and meet one another in beautiful shared space.

- Cultural Events: Working with cultural organizations such as the monthly Downtown Art Walk, we will coordinate visual and performing arts in the parklets. 

- Technology Connections / Access: Each parklet will be equipped with free public wifi access. This will allow all members of the DTLA community to better connect to their friends, family, work, and information. In particular, this will serve as a vital resource for our numerous residents in low-income housing buildings along Spring Street who may otherwise have difficulty accessing wifi.

The agency’s comprehensive plan ensures that resources are consistently available to conduct Quality Control, Assurance, and Improvement processes and activities within the agency. Essential strategies HHCLA uses to solicit feedback include: 1) conducting needs assessments to identify gaps in services or program needs; 2) administering client satisfaction surveys on a quarterly basis; 3) staff surveys/input; 4) conducting program evaluations to assess the effectiveness of the services being provided; 5) staff trainings; 6) productivity standards; and 7) performance evaluations. Examples of utilization review activities include: number of overdose prevention trainings provided to clients and local agencies, number of naloxone/overdose prevention kits distributed, review of access to services; and program participation rates.

HHCLA does whatever is necessary to help unhoused individuals secure housing and to stay housed. All programing is based on the principles of Harm Reduction and creating a Trauma-Informed Care environment, where participants are treated with respect, no judgement, and recognized as the primary leader in improving their quality of life. By providing a full suite of services for participants— such as behavioral healthcare, health services, housing, syringe exchange, overdose prevention, and an array of supportive services, HHCLA seeks to reduce the impact of homelessness in LA County. Since 1985, over 150,000 homeless men, women, and children have received services from HHCLA leading toward an improved quality of life and recovery from health, mental health and substance use issues.

Over 1,000 individuals have been trained with HHCLA’s LA County Certified Overdose Prevention Program. In 2015 alone, an estimated 1,700 naloxone kits were distributed. An opioid overdose is preventable and reversible with the use of this lifesaving drug! Naloxone, an “opioid antagonist” medication is used to counter the effects of an opioid overdose, from morphine, heroin, or various prescription opiate painkillers.

HHCLA’s underlying objectives are to positively impact the communities of Los Angeles, and:

* Help individuals reduce the harm they are causing to themselves in a nonjudgmental approach
* Improve each Angelino’s quality of life
* Contribute in making Los Angeles a safer, healthier, and better place to live

HHCLA utilizes best practices to train individuals and agencies in overdose prevention and on how to do this critical lifesaving work. HHCLA is to the go-to group and its collective expertise is highly effective. HHCLA is in need of new funding streams because in order to do this kind of innovation and work, it is still nonetheless hard to find funding. HHCLA has found that offering such an array of services and not focusing on a more specific one-way approach towards helping others can create a challenge to raise funds to operate in this inclusive manner. HHCLA recognizes first and foremost that the most vulnerable people will die if they are unable to receive such comprehensive aid. Individuals are treated in a “whatever it takes” approach towards ensuring they receive the help they need. 

If fully funded, HHCLA will be able to accomplish the following: 

* Provide at least 5,000 overdose prevention trainings and kits 
* Distribute at least 10,000 naloxone doses (provided in the overdose kit)

Now, we would like to expand our platform to be able to build longer lasting relationships and activations that can work  to drive campaigns and opportunities.

I3 Arts Fest transforms these public spaces into a vibrant urban canvas for regional artists to engage and exhibit their most innovative and imaginative works. This nighttime celebration features large-scale installations, multimedia and performing arts experiences that will inspire the community, entertain visitors, and thrill stakeholders.

Grand Park will transform into Interaction Park and host large scale interactive art installations. These installations will engage its audience through technology, media and mechanics. All the pieces featured in Interaction Park are created by local artists. This activation will be free and open to the public, all ages welcome. 

LA State Historic Park will become Immersion Field and be home to the Art Car Ball. An art car is a vehicle that has had its appearance modified as an act of personal artistic expression. Attendees will get to experience the art cars through both performance and play. These mobile structures are truly a work of art on wheels. Immersion Park will be the only ticketed event, all ages welcome. 

Grand Performances will transcend as Innovation Plaza and present The Country’s Tallest Musical Instrument.  LA based installation artist and musician William Close has developed over 100 new types of musical instruments including the, “Earth Harp.” The Earth Harp is the largest stringed instrument on the planet. The body of the instrument rests on the stage and the strings travel out over the audience attaching to the back of the venue, transforming it into the instrument. The giant long strings are played with violin resin covered gloves. The player runs their hands along the strings creating beautiful cello like tones. New York Times raved it, 'An instrument unlike anything Bach or Beethoven could have ever imagined!” 

William Close will attach his famed Earth Harp to the top of an 800ft skyscraper (Two California Plaza) and transform it into The Country’s Tallest Musical Instrument. This innovative concert experience will push the creative boundaries on how to make music and how to present it. This activation will have three performances and be free to the public. This once in a lifetime musical spectacle has proven to be a sight and sound experience for all ages. 

All three activations are steps away from a metro stop to expand accessibility and to encourage attendees to utilize public transit while exploring this region-wide festival. 

We see I3 Arts Fest as a demonstration of how community is built through interactions with arts and culture and how this in turn creates the foundation for a thriving and dynamic city.

This may be particularly true for youth entrepreneurs that come from low and moderate income neighborhoods or with a criminal justice background. Research indicates that youth entrepreneurship training will help (1) Promote social and cultural identity, (2) Build a stronger sense of community, (3) Give youth, especially at-risk youth, a sense of meaning and belonging.

This pilot program will be used to develop an entrepreneurship track for Mayor Eric Garcetti’s summer youth jobs program. Hire LA’s Youth is one of the City’s most exciting programs to put young adults to work, ensuring they have “first time” job experience that will set them on the path of lifetime earners. This year (2017), the City of Los Angeles committed to providing 15,000  Jobs per capita for young people ages 14 to 24 who live in the city of Los Angeles. This resource serves youth looking to put their news skills to task and it serves the small business owners who are looking to give back and hire new talent. 

By putting these HeArt of LA youth entrepreneurship training program participants to work, the business will benefit from having a highly motivated young adult in their workplace and the youth will gain by having a crucial career hands-on experience. Our program also focuses on developing small businesses who are creating jobs at a higher rate than bigger firms. Success of local businesses is directly linked to job per capita increase.

Our youth program will not only support Minority- and women-owned firms who have up to date technological and social media knowledge but will also foster and create a new generation of minority and women-owned firms and by our recruitment efforts to women’s centers, first-generation youth, sororities in local higher education institutes, local non-profits, etc. An intended consequence from growing minority and women owned businesses is enriching culture, political views, and foreign relations increasing Los Angeles’s global economic influence(soft power). 

Recruiting and retention rates for local higher education institutions will increase thanks to our program as we will partner with local higher education institutes to have representatives come and make presentations and engage our youth about their respective institutions and programs. 

Youth that participate in this program are innovative, creative, community oriented, hardworking, dreamers, and possibly entrepreneurs in their own respect - full of untapped potential. The HeArt of LA will help unleash this potential by connecting youth to resources and programs will create long-term Angeleno entrepreneurs in our great city.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/young-creative-entrepreneurs-and-small-business-internship-program,

This hands-on approach allows us to determine where the student is having problems, enabling our team to catch the mistakes and gradually and consistently improve their performance.

We ultimately measure our success by having every student show up to each session prepared to learn. In the past, we have assessed a ninth grader at a fourth grade reading level and fifth grade math level. This is one of many similar cases we have encountered in our program. 

As mentioned in item #11, the performance of our students is strongly related to their everyday environments. Many of these at-risk youth end up in jail or pregnant at an early age. In 2014, out of 86,823 California juveniles, more than 60% are Black and Hispanic, and ¼ of these juveniles are eventually detained with a 2nd offense (www.aog.ca.gov).

I'm A Movement Not A Monument will hire more tutors looking to improve the education system, and also provide intern hours for college students in the educational field.  We will also recruit peer tutors per site allowing juniors and seniors to get involved by giving back to their community in a unique way.  Every student that is a peer tutor will receive volunteer hours allowing them to graduate high school with additional Honors and recognition, thus strengthening their college resume for scholarships.    

We will be able to engage more students with our services, which in turn provides a quality convenience to a community with minimal amenities, keeping children off the streets and engaging them in more mentorship, leading them to post secondary options rather than jail or early teen pregnancy.  

If our communities fail to CREATE signature programs such as No Mind Left Behind, Los Angeles will not improve. Inglewood School District is already in receivership as schools are under capacity due to parents pulling their students from certain public schools and bringing their scholar to a charter school. Such changes force budget cuts due to enrollment decreases, which result in the termination of teachers, cutting of after school programs, and minimizing janitorial services making the teachers unmotivated to teach and the students unmotivated to learn. Also, a lack of security on site in areas that gangs are infested results in the unapproved presence of gang members and riots erupting. 

We are forced to maintain school systems in the inner city where teachers are in fear of their lives because our children are being raised in the streets rather than in adequate environments consisting of educated and effective guardians, mentors and advocates. It takes a village to raise a child and it is not only up to the parent. If we left it just up to a single mom who can barely afford rent, utilities may be shut off, the family might then be placed on government assistance of some sort, and the household is left struggling to get by on a daily basis, forcing an ongoing cycle of instability and poverty.

I know we can help change this system by CREATING quality after school programs that improve our children’s lives by working hand in hand with teachers on a consistent basis, with ultimate efforts to build a solidly structured team focused on uplifting our youth.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/no-mind-left-behind-free-tutoring-services-for-pre-k-to-12th-graders,

* Parents are on career paths and are able to increase their incomes. On average Imagine LA families increase their earned income by 162%!  
* Families learn positive parenting skills and are able to provide stable homes, which reduces the likelihood (and costs) of a child being placed in foster care.  One child in foster care costs nearly $30,000 annually.
* 100% of youth participants are on track to finish high school and attend college or trade tech (our first family’s eldest son raised by a single mother graduated from Sacramento State University this past June).

Out-of-school arts workshops include our Visual, Media and Performing Arts Institutes and Artists in the Middle summer program. Additionally, our Work of Art program advances the experience of high school students through pathways to college and careers via educational and employment opportunities and mentoring–such as work retreats, professional arts experiences at cultural institutions, and summer internships and employment.

ICA LA is a new contemporary art museum in Downtown Los Angeles, launched by core members of the former Santa Monica Museum of Art (SMMoA). The organization’s new identity and 12,700-square-foot home in the Arts District, slated to open in Fall 2017, will serve as a hub for community members of all backgrounds and income levels. 

LA is emerging as a global capital of cultural production. While broadening the reach of art is important for our region’s economic well-being and cultural vitality, the relationship between art and gentrification has never been more controversial. The depletion of manufacturing and the rise of creative industry has had an adverse effect on many of the surrounding low-income neighborhoods. As cultural institutions and businesses continue to propagate, the concerns of local residents become increasingly urgent. 

As it prepares to open its doors, ICA LA is immersing itself in the local community and confronting issues of gentrification head on. Our LA2050 project intends to break down any barrier between arts organizations and adjacent communities—the “Us vs. Them” mentality—and to activate the museum as a forum for social change. 

Agency of Assets is a three-part program: (1) spring break workshop intensive, (2) summer job placement, and (3) pop-up community art space. 

The spring break intensive will expose students to diverse creative pathways through hands-on workshops, one-on-one mentorship, and daily excursions. Helen Campbell, analyst at the City of LA Housing and Community Investment Department, will collaborate with students to create a map of Los Angeles, analyzing shifting economic trends and identifying assets within the neighborhood. Participants will gain an understanding of the economic forces driving change in their neighborhoods, as well as the tools necessary to forge their own careers in the cultural sector. Each day of the one-week intensive, students will visit cultural institutions and participate in multi-disciplinary workshops.

For our second phase, ICA LA will partner with businesses, government entities, and nonprofits in the Arts District and Boyle Heights to develop one-month, full-time summer job positions. These paid learning experiences will span a number of creative fields in order to best meet students’ interests. These include architecture, graphic design, printmaking, urban planning, glass blowing, film production, and fashion design, among others. 

Agency of Assets culminates with a pop-up arts space and event series, designed with the students based on what they have learned. By instilling local youth with agency, ICA LA will cultivate a new, diverse generation of arts professionals to participate in the City’s changing socioeconomic and cultural landscape.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/agency-of-assets,

Local corporations and philanthropists do not adequately and efficiently distribute their social responsibility funds to charitable organizations, primarily because they are not receiving a return on their investments. As a result, nonprofit organizations in Los Angeles are left with limited access to funding and resources, making them less sustainable and making it nearly impossible for them to produce the social impact they wish to achieve in the Los Angeles community.

Coligo solves these issues by taking a strategic approach to donor beneficiary segmentation. Coligo adopts the viral content form of the most commonly used social media platforms to create the first social networking service for nonprofit organizations. Coligo fills a unique gap in the market by identifying a convenient and accessible way to strengthen beneficiary and donor relationship management and engagement in Los Angeles.
 
Coligo has two key components: 1) connecting nonprofit organizations and donors in Los Angeles 2) to make Los Angeles the hub of community development.
 
Coligo is the easiest way for nonprofits in the Los Angeles are to make impactful connections with local donors. Nonprofits and donors create user profiles. Basic information is gathered and the user's social graph is analyzed. Using the results of a simple search engine, the app groups nonprofits and donors into meaningful and measurable segments based on their preferences. Candidates who are most likely to be compatible based on the organization mission, population services, location served, demands and needs are then streamlined into a catalog of matches. Coligo allows users to anonymously “like” each or “pass.” If a nonprofit and donor “like” each other, they “match” and can connect, chat and exchange resources and funds.
 
The second component of Coligo is to make Los Angeles the hub of social, environmental and community development. The heart of Coligo is to help underserved communities in need, tackle intractable issues that plague the community, and successfully implementing transformational change. Coligo will place Los Angeles at the forefront of implementing novel approaches to mobilizing the city’s human capital to create strategic connections that will achieve  social impact.
 
Coligo stems from the Latin word coligatus, which means to unify, bind, and connect. Coligo will outlive its name as a cutting edge online community based platform that will plant the seed for social and environmental change. By creating engagement and strategic partnership opportunities for nonprofits and donors, Coligo will make Los Angeles the best place to make connections worthwhile.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/the-first-social-networking-service-for-nonprofit-organizations,

The problem we’re trying to solve is clear: Per the National Equity Atlas, the Los Angeles metropolitan area has a higher rate of inequality than California and the U.S. The gap between the region’s wealthy and low-income communities manifests itself spatially, where you live can greatly affect opportunities for educational attainment, job access, health outcomes, public safety, environmental quality, mobility, and more. Simply put, place matters — and how you access those opportunities through different modes of transportation is paramount to one’s success.

Our proposal will accelerate our efforts and make LA the best place to connect in three ways:

1.We will de-mystify the politics of regional transportation financing through a digital video series that is dynamic, educational, and accessible to all audiences. For the past year, Investing in Place has been working to put action behind the “just growth” framework developed by Dr. Manuel Pastor (director of USC PERE) and Dr. Chris Benner. Simply put, “just growth” is the idea that by putting equity at the center of regional economic development, the region will grow stronger for everyone, for the long-haul. Indeed, there is evidence to support this not just from Pastor and Benner, but from the International Monetary Fund and Standard and Poor’s, to name a few. This means that closing the gaps between the rich and the poor through policy and other strategies benefits everyone. Our proposal will help draw the connections between transportation and broader economic opportunities.

2.We will create a story bank of how individuals travel throughout Los Angeles County and the challenges and opportunities they encounter in their own voice and experience. We are inspired by efforts from LA’s Legalize Street Vendors Campaign, DREAMers, low-wage workers organizing for dignity and recognition, and community members organizing for better neighborhoods. The core of our campaign is to empower the people who depend on more affordable, frequent, and reliable transportation options to amplify their stories to decision makers through social media, in-person meetings with elected officials, and through traditional media and the press.

3.Throughout this process, we will help cultivate new leaders and connect them to opportunities on how to improve transportation decision-making in their neighborhoods.

JMA addresses climate change caused by the county's fleet of fossil fuel-burning buses and the need for high quality jobs in manufacturing at a time when a disproportionate number of workers in our region are unemployed, under employed or working at jobs that do not support a family. JMA aims to make LA a better place to create manufacturing jobs & a clean public transit system. JMA plans to launch a new campaign for a speedier and more equitable transition to zero emission bus fleets that will replace polluting buses.  Momentum for the transition to clean technology is growing. The JMA plan will also stimulate creation of thousands of manufacturing jobs in Southern California.
The proposed electric bus campaign will build on JMA’s success in linking transportation spending to economic development and good jobs, and focus on the intersection between climate change and poverty.
Our plan will benefit from Measure R, which established a half cent sales tax for LA County to finance transportation projects. It may be supplemented by Measure M on the Nov ballot, which calls for a $120 billion investment in transit. The region already has 3 bus factories & the region's largest transit agency--LA Metro--recently issued an RFP for purchase of 200 EV buses.  These factors make LA perfect to create sustainable transportation and good local manufacturing jobs.
As we launch Electrify LA, JMA will use a tested policy called the US Employment Plan (USEP), which is a contractual provision between transit agencies buying equipment and manufacturers that offers incentives to create good jobs for disadvantaged workers through recruitment and training programs.  We will advocate for evaluating manufacturers’ proposals based on the USEP & the use of zero emission technology.
We will involve a broad based coalition in policy campaigns with local & regional transit agencies so that public buses and component parts are made in our region and that pipelines are created to allow people of color, women, the formerly incarcerated & other disadvantaged LA workers get the jobs.  We will urge investors and manufacturers to make EV bus equipment in the LA region and to hire and train a more diverse workforce.
Our long term strategy is to permanently transform the way local transit agency procurement functions in order to spur a new green jobs movement that will reduce fossil fuel emissions as well as create major investment in workforce training and the development of career paths into manufacturing jobs for low income workers and communities of color.

The challenge is twofold: there is a void in access to and training for services that holistically address a survivor's mind, body and spirit in order to activate long-term change. And, for the past forty years, the field has been so entrenched in meeting the immediate needs of survivors with limited resources and support that staff are themselves, suffering from high levels of vicarious trauma. A 2009 study in Violence Against Women found that 70% of participating domestic violence advocates met the criteria for clinical levels of post-traumatic stress disorder. As a result, despite extensive personal sacrifice from front line workers in the field, the services that survivors receive oftentimes fail to meet the overwhelming need in both volume and quality. This challenge has been amplified in Los Angeles, where in 2015, the LAPD announced that reports of sexual assault had increased by 21% and domestic violence incidents had increased by 33%.
 
Joyful Heart Foundation's four-day retreat is designed to restore participants' central nervous systems by addressing the physical, emotional and psychological impact of trauma, reducing the short and long term effects of this trauma, and ultimately laying the groundwork for participants to create healthy, permanent change in their own lives. Retreats are separately offered to survivors and healing professionals. The retreat offers 16 key workshops that integrate traditional and alternative healing methods and provide participants with tools they can implement themselves, post retreat. Participants are provided with nourishing meals, bodywork, time for reflection, and space and direction to create their own action plans for change and healing. 

With support from LA2050, JHF will implement two survivor retreats. To date, Georgetown University has evaluated three survivor retreats and a retreat for healing professionals.

Our proposal seeks to help stem the outflow of manufacturing jobs through the use of crowdfunding, digital technology, management consulting and other tools to re-invent older companies. Our goal is to conduct the research and development needed to reposition them in the marketplace AND retain their jobs.

Employment in Creative Industries:  The use of digital marketing  techniques will require the talents of many creative industries ranging from graphic design to filmmaking to copywriting. 

Video pitching is an integral part of any crowdfunding effort.  It demonstrates a company’s transparency, showing specific products/services; it can support early branding, storytelling, and customer identification;  the video format can entice a potential consumer in a crowdfunding campaign.

LA County is rich in documentary filmmakers.  Older manufacturing companies can tell their story through the use of documentary film. 

Jobs per Capita:  In a Forbes Magazine story ‘LA: CITY OF LOSERS?’ Urbanologist Joel Kotkin noted that per-capita manufacturing employment in Los Angeles has fallen significantly.  “.. industrial job count stands at 363,900, down sharply from 900,000 just a decade ago.”  The Apparel industry alone lost 45,000 jobs in LA County during the last decade. 

The significance of this is that manufacturing jobs directly effects per capita income. 

According to LAEDC, median household income in LA County is estimated to be $54,529, approximately 9% lower than the state median. At $27,488, per capita income in the county is 7% below the state average. This differential is directly attributable to the loss of manufacturing jobs in recent years.

Maintaining this base is key to high per capita income for LA in the future.

Measures of cultural & global economic influence (“soft power”):  Utilizing crowdfunding tools including digital storytelling and marketing, the project will help create a body of content on the internet that highlights LA as a leader in manufacturing.  

Minority- and women-owned firms:
Our collaboration with the Alliance of Women Directors (AWD) in the creation of crowdfunding campaign videos will provide creative opportunities for women filmmakers in LA. 
Many small companies selected in this pilot program will be minority owned. 

Venture Capital:  Businesses with market validation via rewards crowdfunding are highly attractive to VCs. VCs are discovering that the industrial sector offer high return potential when re-invented & married to new tech. An SBA study entitled “Research on the Current State of Crowdfunding: The Effect of Crowdfunding Performance & Outside Capital” found a relationship between crowdfunding success and an ability for a business to obtain outside financing. Crowdfunding success also “increases the probability of business partnerships and stronger customer base.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/re-make-it-la,

They will then apply this research to their interviews where they will practice and strengthen their oral communication as they listen, ask questions, and engage in conversation with interviewees. This will increase ELA proficiency as students practice reading, writing, listening, and speaking in all subject areas.  As students learn how to produce a podcast, they will develop digital media skills and have greater facility with technology and software.  

The development of communication and digital media skills in middle school youth will allow them to begin building their resumes that can be used to apply for a job in the future.  While the students are gaining and strengthening skills in a meaningful way, they will learn how these skills are applicable to academic and career pathways. Not only will they learn how to be journalists, producers, and writers, they will have the opportunity to imagine a variety of possible futures and potential career pathways through their interaction with professionals from a variety of sectors. The expansion of their skills and social capital will be critical in addressing youth unemployment and underemployment rates. 
 
Research shows that engaging students in real world, meaningful learning leads to increased student engagement. When students are engaged, they are more likely to attend school and engage in appropriate behavior.

We record 8 – 10 new plays each year, recorded live at UCLA’s James Bridges Theater and in-studio, employing 100 – 150 theatre professionals annually. We disseminate these recordings to a global audience of 7+ million through a weekly public radio show in 50+ U.S. markets (KPFK in Los Angeles); download and streaming on-demand at our website and retail partners; and free distributions of over 27,000 to the public,  schools and libraries nationwide - including 30-40 public libraries and over 100 public schools in LA County, which serve an estimated 1,000-2,000 library patrons and 6,000 students per year.

An essential part of expanding worldwide public, educator and student access to our plays and educational resources is building a 21st century infrastructure to support them. We are pursuing a major technological capacity building project that will encompass a total rebuild of our website, new constituent and asset management systems, and a re-tooling of our educational resources.  

Since 2012, we have developed innovative mobile apps that use theatre as an interdisciplinary teaching and learning tool for high school students. Our current apps enable users to experience plays as an enhanced form of literature by bringing the text to life through synchronized audio. As part of our Audio Theatre 2.0 project, we are developing an expanded online educational platform featuring advanced apps that will integrate text and audio with standards-aligned lessons, exercises and activities designed for use in English, history, drama and science classes, a community space for educators and students to share ideas, and models for student-driven projects based. An example of this is the iBook created by students at Canyon Crest Academy, a public high school in San Diego, who used our app to build their own interactive learning app (see video link).  The new website platform will be a universally accessible and welcoming one-stop storefront featuring our educational tools and resources which will be accessible by any device.

The project will achieve progress toward the LA2050 goals by: a) Enhancing the sustainability of LATW as an “arts establishment” as well as the dozens of local arts organizations we support through PSAs on our radio show; b) Increase employment in creative industries by enabling LATW to pursue new artistic ventures such as podcasts, video, social media and interactive content; and, c) Expand LA’s cultural influence by building on LATW’s global reach, which has included live productions in Europe and China, and radio co-productions with the BBC, Voice of America, Radio Beijing, NHK (Japan), CBC (Canada), ABC (Australia), Radio New Zealand & others.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/audio-theatre-2-0-an-it-platform-for-audience-engagement-and-student-creativity,

We have launched the pilot MusicWorks program to connect volunteers from the entertainment and music industry to collaborative music projects. During the one- to eight-week long projects, students will prepare for and participate in a “masterclass” or concert session with a guest artist, culminating in an intimate performance showcasing the collaboration and aimed at attracting new volunteers to the host nonprofit. Each project is to be professionally filmed by a volunteer, resulting in a 3 to 5- minute video used to promote our incredible partner organizations and the MusicWorks mission. 

In addition to these project-based opportunities, MusicWorks volunteers are individually vetted and placed in ongoing opportunities at over forty nonprofit programs as volunteer teachers, teaching assistants, and other roles as appropriate. Our volunteers are musicians, producers, directors, teaching artists, recording artists and other entertainment professionals and amateurs. 

Early, intensive, consistent educational intervention, provided by volunteers through in-class and after-school programming, can help struggling children achieve more than double the academic and social gains of their peers who do not receive these services. In the recession years half of California's public schools shuttered their music programs. As a result, there are now 700,000 fewer students enrolled in school music classes than before the budget cuts, with California ranking last in the nation in the ratio of music teachers to students.

Additionally, Los Angeles ranks an appalling 45th out of 51 major cities in the U.S. for volunteerism. Long commuting times and high poverty rates can adversely affect volunteering rates and the most frequently cited reason for not volunteering is not knowing how or where to plug-in. In a region as diverse and vast as L.A., we need to make it easy for people to connect to service. Leveraging celebrity reach for MusicWorks will increase total number of local social media friends and connections Angelenos have, organically spreading the word about this volunteer opportunity, and drive volunteer participation rates to increase – moving us from the embarrassing 45th place nationally.

Of course equally important to our L.A. pride, is the positive benefits that will come from significantly increasing the rates of volunteerism. Volunteerism is an avenue for individuals to have first-hand experience in learning about the pressing issues in the community; it bridges gaps within a community for greater cohesiveness and diminishes residential segregation; and inspires further action to bring about change. With the help of this award, we hope that in the near future, L.A. will be thought of as a model for service as much as we are known for entertainment, sports, and our weather.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/musicworks-connecting-music-industry-pros-to-underserved-kids-for-social-transformation,

By expanding our current countywide compost hub network, we will continue to divert thousands of pounds of organics from reaching landfills monthly, while also providing residents with the tools and education needed to compost on their own.","[""Access to healthy food"",""Self-sufficiency"",""Resilient communities""]","LA Compost will help make LA be the best place to LIVE by reconnecting communities across LA County with their food, their soil, and their neighbors.

Communities across the country are proving that local food systems not only work, but also are the way of the future. Areas such as New York, Austin, and Washington D.C have proven that local composting within larger cities can succeed, and have gained the support from their local city departments. Los Angeles is slowly moving in the right direction by appreciating the local food movement, but due to its expansive size, LA still has a long way to go.

 Los Angeles County is the most populated county in the country with over 10 million people eating daily. This ongoing purchase and consumption of food for over 10 million people leads to large amounts of food going uneaten, and if not donated to a local food recovery agency, ends up in landfills. Due to our unique situation in Los Angeles, the solutions for these problems need to be as creative and beautiful as the cities that make up our county. 

LA Compost is creating a countywide composting program neighborhood by neighborhood. The hubs we place throughout the county keep organics within the same zip code where the food was originally grown or consumed, and they create a space for educational workshops and workdays to take place. They are a tool for educating the public about composting for soil health, a testimony to the practicality of composting, and a distribution center from which we send compost made on-site into the local community. 

By keeping organics in the same zip code where the food was grown or consumed, communities become less reliant on trucks hauling their “waste” away. The material that trucks often haul away still has value, and can help with many issues that communities across the county are facing. Creating compost locally improves the way our soils store water, sequester carbon from the air, and produce healthy food. The act of composting locally increases a community’s ability to become self sufficient, as residents now have the means to grow a portion of their own food and manage their excess organics from the kitchen and their landscapes. 

Beyond composting locally our hubs serve as an educational platform for residents to coexist well and learn alongside their neighbors. Our monthly workshops and workdays encourage residents to slow down, get outside, and interact with both their neighbor and the soil. When neighbors come together and are working towards a common goal, there is an undeniable sense of community. 

We believe that taking responsibility for the environment you live in can be empowering and healing, and that Los Angeles needs just this. Composting is a beautiful, regenerative process that is collaborative, self-giving, and exemplifies the type of city we want to embody.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/building-community-and-reducing-organic-waste-via-community-compost-hubs-throughout-la-county,

To assess achievement of these measures, we will track the following:
- Number of new members joining the adult and juniors programs annually
- Number of retiring members from the adult and juniors programs annually
- Number of members from the immediately surrounding neighborhoods
- Annual survey of members assessing the quality of social-connectedness and emotional benefit received from league involvement.
- 'Exit' surveys of retiring members which assess:
     - reason for retirement from the league
     - benefit received from social and emotional support during their time with the Derby Dolls

Within the organization, league-members find the fellowship and camaraderie that come with team sports, in an environment that is unique to the Derby Dolls community. The LA Derby Dolls will help achieve LA's CONNECT goal by increasing the number of women in LA who receive sufficient social and emotional support.
 
Team sports provide for increased emotional wellness resulting from an inherent support system and increased social health gained through developing teamwork and relationship building. Participants in team sports create closer bonds to others, become more accepting of diversity, become more adept at facing challenges as a member of a team, are more responsive to teaching, and demonstrate more confidence in leadership. However, team sports are less accessible as adults get older, with women's team sports being even scarcer. 
 
For over 13 years, the LA Derby Dolls has provided a space for women across Los Angeles to find social and emotional support among other women while competing together in a physically and mentally challenging sport. Modern roller derby is unique in that it is a fast-action contact sport led by women as opposed to so many other sports that present as a 'women's alternative' to a male-dominated sport. The pro-women attitude is galvanized by the Derby Dolls’ focus on issues of women’s empowerment, body positivity, and inclusivity. The result is a safe community where women support each other in their successes, encourage each other through their defeats, and receive the same in return - whether on or off the track. It is common for women who have retired from the training and competition aspect of the organization to continue to volunteer with the organization because of the strong bonds that they have formed and because they continue to believe in the importance of the mission of the Derby Dolls. 

The LA Derby Dolls are dedicated to ensuring that women in Los Angeles continue to have the same opportunity to increase self-confidence, positive self-image, empathy, and a strong social and emotional support network from our organization that hundreds of members - past and present - have benefited from. We plan to grow the program's reach to women who do not know that the Derby Dolls is available to them and make our space available to a greater number of LA women and juniors through the availability of scholarships.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/la-derby-dolls-promoting-social-and-emotional-support-through-womens-team-sports,

We are challenging that assertion & telling the story of LA County through a podcast series that is intended to spark conversations and generate enthusiasm for the experiences of how we get around and live in our urban region. Off Peak uses storytelling to bring the past, present, and future of transit to the people of LA County.

Both inside and outside LA, there is an outdated stereotype that the only way to get around is through a sea of traffic congestion. But, there is so much more to getting around our region. LA has an iconic past of cycleways, electric rail service, funiculars, and a veritable encyclopedia of transit dreams that didn’t quite make it (Just Google: Aerial Swallow Burbank!). We also have a vibrant bus, rail, pedestrian, and cycling community, with entrepreneurs trying to disrupt the single-occupancy-vehicle at every turn. 

These are the stories we want to bring to our community, shifting our perspective and our connection to our city and one another. Off Peak challenges the traditional car-centric narrative of Southern California through a story-driven series of podcasts. The series celebrates the intriguing stories that occur between Point A and Point B, as we roll and stroll. 

Each episode features real people with real experiences in LA, and we encourage story ideas and participation with all segments of the community. We document important events within transit and serve as a trusted voice for people who may not otherwise be heard. The long-term vision for Off Peak will feature community events, live performances, and regular segments connecting citizens to Metro in a personal and human way.

Metro is producing a four-podcast mini-series to kick off this concept. Two podcasts have already launched with a third coming on October 7. In “True Tales from Bus Drivers” listeners get a front-row seat to the twists and turns of maneuvering a 40-foot bus through LA. From nerve wracking 1st days, getting lost en route, sexism, homelessness, and the passengers that make it all worthwhile, Metro bus operators are the modern Zen masters of the streets.

“Roads Were Not Made for Cars” tells the story of the evolution of American roads from their origins as ancient paths for mastodons to the rutted muck tracks traveled by horse drawn carriages, through their virtual abandonment during the height of the train era and on to their resurrection as smoothly paved roads designed for bicyclists. How we got to the car-covered roads of today is a tangle of coincidences and conspiracies that no one would have predicted. 

We’re asking for your support to take the 4 episode pilot that we have begun, and expand this project with an additional 12 episodes to continue to grow and expand our communal story, reminding our community how Los Angeles is truly the best place in the world to connect with our fellow citizens.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/off-peak-podcast,

It will also expand the capacity of LA Plaza’s existing performance area, where a year-round schedule of concerts, family festivals, culinary events, film screenings are conducted.  One of the primary elements is a mural depicting the city’s founding, which will be erected on the wall of La Placita Church.  The Walkway will become an important public gathering space for public events produced by LA Plaza and other organizations.

Public/open streets gatherings:   According to the Countywide Comprehensive Parks and Recreation Needs Assessment, La Plaza’s region contains a miniscule 0.2 – 0.5 park acres per 1K residents. (Countywide average: 2.2 park acres/1K.) Open space will relieve park pressure. It will benefit those communities underserved by park and open space amenities. It will increase park and open space for those ranked lowest in the county.  Through artistic innovation, the content development will showcase art and artists, while LA Plaza’s programming will expand cultural options for the neighborhood and region.
  
Public transit riders:  The Paseo will be an important central gathering place for all, including children and families, youth and school groups, downtown dwellers, daily commuters and tourists.  Union Station, part of the El Pueblo historic core, is a regional transportation hub for numerous rail, bus and shuttle services.   The Union Station “Connect US Action Plan,” was developed to improve historical and cultural connections in downtown Los Angeles by enhancing pedestrian and bicycle travel options through and between communities.   The Historic Paseo Walkway is fundamentally aligned with the Connect US Plan to create connections between Union Station and the cultural/historic sites in the surrounding neighborhoods by means of a clear primary route; promote improvements that convey the unique identity of each neighborhood and street; improve pedestrian and bicycle linkages to/from Union Station to the destinations within each neighborhood and between neighborhoods.

Transit-accessible housing and employment: LA Plaza is coordinating with proposed projects and previous studies within the area including Plaza Paseo, LA Plaza Cultural Village and Metro Linkage Study to ensure a well-integrated, historically rich public realm.  Downtown’s historic core will soon experience a new resurgence of economic and residential activity with the development of the LA Plaza Cultural Village, a 425,000 square foot mixed used complex opening in 2018.  The complex will include 355 apartments, including 20% priced at affordable rates, and 47,000 square feet of restaurant and retail space.  More than 500 people will be part of this dynamic new residential community in the northern section of downtown and will have direct access to our museum, Olvera Street and Union Station.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/la-plaza-historic-paseo-walkway-downtowns-first-historic-pedestrian-pathway!,

Internet connection and cell phone service have become essential to staying involved in one's community and the world. Internet access is now necessary to research and complete school assignments, apply to jobs, access affordable healthcare and other social services, and participate in politics and social media. Cell phone service is important to stay connected with friends and family no matter where you go.

Unfortunately, low-income families do not have equal connection as wealthier families. A survey in 2013 by digitalequality.net estimated that while over 92% of families in LA County earning $100,000 or more per year had internet connection at home, only 43% of families earning less than $25,00 per year had connection. The survey estimated that over 650,000 households earning less than $50,000 per year in LA County lacked internet connection. Furthermore, low-income families with internet access typically have poorer service and frequently lose connection due to inability to pay.

Drizzle will help close this digital divide by providing a way for low-income families in LA to receive free, high-speed internet and cell phone service.

This will have a significant impact on education and job opportunities for low-income families in LA. Students will be able to research, complete assignments, and take classes online from home. Adults will be able to search more job opportunities, apply online, or even work from home. In addition, families will have greater access to affordable healthcare and social services by using online resources. Giving more people the opportunity to learn and thrive will diversify and increase talent in LA.

Drizzle will also engage more people in the greater Los Angeles community. With greater internet access, lower-income individuals will be able to interact more on social media and discover events and opportunities in LA. They will also be able to register to vote online and better voice their political opinions. These effects will increase the number of social connections between Angelenos and bring a wider variety of experiences and viewpoints to LA culture.

By making internet and phone service more accessible to low-income Angelenos, we will develop a more inclusive community and make LA the best place to connect both online and in person.

LAND’s fundamental mission is to bring contemporary art out of the museum/gallery setting and into the public sphere. Thus, LAND’s core audience for all projects includes members of every type of demographic as LAND’s exhibitions and programs are brought into the daily lives of community members that may not encounter or have the means to experience art in other ways. 
 
LAND makes LA the best place to CREATE because it funds local, national, and international artists to create work in LA and to directly engage with the people of LA, thus creating jobs in the arts sector. The projects are always specific to the city’s unique architectural public sites, increasing LA’s international reputation as a city that welcomes artists to enhance it. LAND hopes to emphasize its commitment to the arts in LA through this innovative project, which is part of a larger dialogue with the Pacific Standard Time: LA/LA community of prestigious and reputable arts institutions. 
 
For Jose Dávila’s project, the exhibition will begin with a commissioned concrete cubic sculpture installed at West Hollywood Park. The components of the sculpture will break apart and travel across the city to be installed in various neighborhoods simultaneously, creating connections between the diverse communities of LA. The migration of the pieces will occur at various points throughout the run of the exhibition, concluding the project with the sculpture reinstalled in its original cubic form. 
 
The project will bring art to new audiences in each neighborhood, inviting them to participate creatively, using the sculpture as they wish, as a place to sit, play, draw, dance on, skateboard over, relax on, etc. Participants will be encouraged to take pictures and post on social media creating an archival map which will be connected with the Pacific Standard Time online activity. 
 
The process of discovery of each additional site will create a unique, expansive experience for LA residents which speaks to broader concerns of navigating the cityscape and LA’s inherent geographic segregation. Audiences are encouraged to follow the migration of the sculpture, visiting new neighborhoods, and are invited to participate in a series of events to celebrate the sculpture’s reformations. LAND will co-present these public gatherings with the local organizations/sites that are hosting the sculpture. Inspired by the location and the community interest, the events may include  artist talks, basketball games, garden tours, salsa dancing, and educational activities for children, etc. . 
 
Furthermore, the transformation of the sculpture and the artwork’s neighborhood impact will be documented and photographed in a bilingual publication.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/jose-dávila-public-art-project,

Our proposed series is “Mixing California Native with Non-Native Plants”. These short films show people how to retrofit their non-native gardens with native plants adapted to our rainfall, climate, and soil – plants that most of our butterflies, birds and other animals can’t live without. Use these films to retrofit with native plants for creating a beautiful resilient LA where nature and urban agriculture can thrive!","[""Waterways"",""Local water"",""Resilient communities"",""Tree canopy cover""]","Through the content of these films and the action they inspire, the LA2050 landscape can be one of beauty with ecological function and decreased reliance on aquifers and imported water. For LA to become this environmentally inspiring place to live, we need an informed public. 

Everyone knows we are in a water crisis, but not everyone knows we are also in an extinction crisis and that how we landscape matters. The world has lost 52% of its vertebrate wild animals – birds, mammals, fish, reptiles and amphibians – since 1970. Two-thirds of California’s arid-land bird species are at moderate to high risk of extinction without aggressive conservation action. Native gardening is something we can do across the vast LA landscape, in containers, parkways and yards, to help mitigate the extinction crisis and support biodiversity and the nature of LA.  

Our proposal supports a major shift in public awareness that is needed for LA to meet the challenges of long-term drought, climate change and extinction of pollinators and other species. If 50% of LA were landscaped native, this vast area could be evergreen flowering habitat for birds, butterflies and other wildlife – landscape habitat that achieves an 80% reduction in water and corresponding energy use compared to conventional non-native gardens. Native landscaping requires no soil amendments, fertilizers or pesticides, all of which can harm ecosystem and watershed health. Our short films will help create an informed public that knows practical steps they can take at home, at school or the work place to help slow climate change, heal the bay, and bring birds and butterflies back to LA.

Los Angeles is a biodiversity hotspot blessed with an incredibly rich natural heritage threatened by population pressure and habitat loss. Our proposed films will show how to use this incredibly rich natural heritage for landscaping that uses less water, creates less green waste, requires fewer maintenance hours, and supports the nature of where we live.  These films are essential because we have so thoroughly erased most of LA’s natural landscape that most people know little or nothing about native plants:  
Myth:  All green is the same. Non-native plants feed the ecosystem just as well as native plants. Fact:  Only native plants support the nature of where we live. Up to 90% of leaf-eating insect species (caterpillars of butterflies!) can eat ONLY native plants; these insects are protein that fuels the food web. 
Myth:  Most California native plants are cacti. Fact: only 1-2% of California’s 6,000 species, subspecies and varieties of native plants are cacti.
Myth: California native plants don’t make flowers. Fact: Yes, they do, and native gardens can produce flowers throughout the year!

Our proposed films will help inform the public about how to use LA’s rich natural heritage for making LA the best place to live in 2050.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/california-native-plant-public-education-project,

Tutoring sessions will take place three times per week, and will be offered in small group settings, including one EC volunteer and up to three LA’s BEST students. 

Over a single academic year, success will be defined by the number of LA’s BEST students who are tutored by EC volunteers and make at least 60% more progress in learning two particular reading skills – sounding out new words and reading comprehension – than their non-participant peers. Another measure of success will be the percentage of students targeted by the proposed project who achieve reading proficiency by the end of the third grade.

Further, children served will report perceptions of safety while participating in LA’s BEST, and have increased likelihood of ultimately graduating high school than their non-participant peers. The project also addresses the City’s challenge of youth underemployment, as LA’s BEST employs more than 2,000 program staff each year – primarily young adults from the same communities as those served by the organization – to teach, coach and mentor the 25,000 children served by LA’s BEST every day. Through the project, program staff will work alongside EC volunteers and receive training to replicate and expand the project. 

In addition to making LA’s BEST the best place to LEARN, the proposed project will help make LA the best place to PLAY through the enrollment of 25,000 children in the LA’s BEST After School Enrichment Program each year; the best place to CONNECT by providing social and emotional support to participants and increasing rates of volunteerism; the best place to LIVE by giving children daily opportunities to take part in nutrition education programs and at least 30 minutes of physical activity during the after school hours; and, the best place to CREATE by offering high-quality employment opportunities to young adults who reside in low-income, under-served neighborhoods and meaningful volunteer opportunities to retired professionals.

On average, 90% of LA’s BEST students qualify for free or reduced-price lunch.  Moreover, all LA’s BEST sites—Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) elementary schools—are located in high-crime, low-income communities throughout Central, East and South Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley. English is a second language for 44% of LA’s BEST service demographic. 

Reading proficiency by third grade is the most important predictor of high school graduation and career success; however, more than 80% of low-income children fail to meet this vital milestone. Students who work with EC tutors for a single school year experience more than 60% greater gains in critical literacy skills when compared to similar students who are not served by EC. They also score significantly higher on standardized reading tests. 

Assessment results demonstrate that participation in LA’s BEST increases a student’s likelihood of graduating high school and decreases their chances of becoming involved in juvenile crime. Children report overall feelings of safety while participating in LA’s BEST, and program surveys show that children become more confident and interested in the academic content areas LA’s BEST intentionally infuses into enrichment activities. Finally, the organization is effective in helping children develop social and emotional skills through a pro-social approach to programming.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/las-best-aarp-foundation-experience-corps-brighter-futures-via-reading-proficiency-by-3rd-grade,

LIFT has always helped our members navigate complex social service systems in order to be able to connect to housing, employment, education, child care, legal services, and other systems that members bump up against as they endeavor to provide a better life for themselves and their families. It has always been LIFT’s ultimate goal to empower members to access these resources…getting this information directly in their hands instead of being the intermediary. Furthermore, we know that this program model can pose a potential barrier to members in requiring them to come into our offices to be able to engage services and get the information they need.
 
One Degree, a technology-driven nonprofit, provides LIFT members with a strong community resource platform that is uniquely user-friendly and accessible (available at all times via computer and mobile device). Partnering with One Degree puts LIFT closer to the goal of true empowerment in putting critical information directly into their hands. With this technology, LIFT is able to be more active in the coaching process in communicating with members to follow up on appointments, offer suggestions, send motivating messages- beyond the bounds of an office appointment.
 
Members at LIFT will utilize One Degree in their resource search to directly access healthy food, housing assistance, and other resources that help parents become more self-sufficient and create happier, healthier homes for their children. To track members’ progress, One Degree uses a referral management system (RMS). RMS will help streamline LIFT’s work by enabling LIFT staff to specifically recommend services and provide a check-list of next steps to members.

In America, a person is sexually assaulted every 2 minutes. 1 in 5 women and 1 in 33 men have been victims of sexual assault, but only .006% of perpetrators are convicted. 50% of transgender people experience rape, but 68% of all cases go unreported due to a long-ingrained stigma, which continues to persist today. These survivors have one thing in common - they all need healing and justice.

Light Sprout collaborated with ProSocial, an LA based strategic planning company, to research the most prevalent issues survivors face, the resources available and where additional resources were needed. We found that survivors and their families are still living in isolation, shame and confusion. There is an acute lack of the guidance necessary to heal and seek justice in the immediate aftermath and the years that follow. 99% of current resources are allocated to rape prevention rather than support for those already victimized. A central hub where victims and their advocates can find support and information required is clearly needed. Resources for minority and LGBTQ groups are scattered, making it difficult for these marginalized communities to get the help they need. Empower Me will thus be the first app to aggregate resources for all survivors, inclusive of their gender, race or sexual preference. 

Additionally, Empower Me will be the first platform specifically targeted to survivors’ family and loved ones, as it is essential to provide resources to those who care for the survivor post trauma. These great people are allies and must be equally equipped with resources necessary to effectively support survivors. This ranges from assisting in completing a rape kit to collecting evidence, what to say and not say, and how best to care for the survivor and themselves. Sexual assault is often also traumatic for the ally as some feel lost, inadequate and overwhelmed.  

Storytelling has been proven an essential feature of community building and combating the isolation survivors and their allies face. Empower Me will highlight both the traumatic aftermath and forms of recovery which will propel the movement against rape culture forward.

Empower Me will be a trusted and instantly accessible virtual advocate designed to eliminate the anxiety around seeking medical and legal help in a logically constructed and user-friendly mobile environment. The multiple features of the app are thoughtfully combined to mitigate the physical, mental and emotional trauma from sexual assault, while providing outlets for support as it will be linked to Take Back the Night for free online counselling, legal advice and advocacy alternatives.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/empower-me-a-digital-tool-for-rape-survivors-allies-that-fosters-community-justice-healing,

This is due to various factors, which has left people on the streets, homeless, without access to adequate services, showers inclusive. Recent studies have shown a marked increase in the number of homeless in L.A., with over 10,000 in the Downtown area of Los Angeles, and over 6,000 veterans. These homeless are seen on the streets, night and day, most times looking unkempt. In spite of their possession of clean clothing, without a proper shower, the effect is all but negated. 

While the city of Los Angeles strives to be the best place to live, through the humanitarian services of the city and other organizations, providing food, shelter, healthcare, and more, to this group, there is a gap in the attention to their personal hygiene. In view of this, Living Spring Foundation, which is aimed at bringing hope to the less-privileged seeks to embark upon this program, which is providing free showers starting in Downtown L.A. This activity will buttress the other humanitarian services and further contribute towards making L.A. the best place to live. 

If Living Spring Foundation is granted this award for the implementation of the shower program, we will offer warm and cool baths, encouraging the homeless to come at least twice a week to daily. Thus, making L.A. a better place to play, a better place to connect, and a better place to live.

-	Improved hygiene. 
-	Improved self-esteem and dignity.
-       The homeless will be happy with themselves.
-	Better positioning for access to job, healthcare, housing, and food.
-	Improved relationship with city officials, police inclusive.

We tirelessly campaign to protect sharks before they are all extinct.  About 80% of the world's shark population has been wiped out and whether or not you live on the coast you need to care, especially in a metropolitan area like Los Angeles County.  Without sharks, the entire ocean ecosystem is thrown off balance and weather patterns around the world will be impacted.  How?  The ocean is a carbon sink and without sharks to sequester carbon in their bodies and, more importantly, control herbivore populations the plant life will be severely limited and unavailable to remove as much carbon from the atmosphere since there will be less photosynthesis.

Replace the fear of sharks with facts and join the fight for their conservation.

Amazon Web Services, and more.

The Santa Monica Bay is thought to be a white shark nursery and in 2013 the local television news sensationalized every juvenile shark sighting.  Since we are daily surfers at the beach break where most of the sightings occurred, El Porto, we knew we had to do something. El Porto Shark was started as a pet project with a social media presence that tried to replace fear with facts. In the summer of 2015 we were motivated by a local General Assembly instructor to take it further and do something about shark conservation.

Our events we have planned will educate the local public about not only why sharks are important to fisheries, but to the climate. weather, and the lifestyle here in Los Angeles.  Angelinos will also learn to appreciate how our work informs local fisheries to keep their seafood sustainable.  They will learn how to be citizen scientists and contribute to our database.  County policymakers will use our data to inform climate and recreational fishing limits as it is more robust than current sources.  Fisheries will be able to utilize our data and our model not only for sharks, but other species in order to create smarter catch limits.

To help us achieve this vision, LACI is launching the ‘Youth Cleantech Training Program,’ an integrated, multi-stakeholder approach which will support the cleantech and advanced manufacturing sectors' growth while maximizing Angelenos' training and employment opportunities,  particularly among women and people of color.  The program will start with theoretical work in the classroom, shift to hands-on work in the labs, and culminate in internships with cleantech companies.

In addition to growing the NoHo Artwalk, EMX has established two educational after-school programs in the Burbank Unified School District and soon the Los Angeles Unified School District called Future DJs and Future Producers.

Future DJs is an after-school program partnered with a Los Angeles nonprofit called The Portable Classroom.  Pioneer DJ supplies equipment for the kids to use, and Future DJs concentrates on teaching students about DJing & audio production.

Future Producers is an after-school program partnered with a Los Angeles nonprofit called the Electronic Music Alliance (EMA).  Software and guest speakers for the program are provided by Ableton Live, and Future Producers provides teen & adults a cost-effective platform for learning to produce electronic music.

The difference in the EMX educational platform is that the classes offered are lead by the very DJs and Producers who participate in the EMX community.  These DJs and Producers are also the leaders who participate in & encourage community engagement through the EMA Play it FWD program.

We consulted with public school administrators and teachers and discovered that this was a growing issue, often preventing children from experiencing parks, museums, cultural and educational programs, and more.

After being one of many chaperones on a field trip with a class of 125 elementary school kids we had the opportunity to see the challenges of monitoring both large and small groups. Not only is a chaperone tasked with the important duty of protecting a group of children, but the chaperone must spend a significant amount of time gathering and monitoring the group, even when there is nothing wrong.  This experience has inspired us to develop a solution to this problem using smart phones that most chaperones already carry.

Gaggle is a unique, new child safety service that helps families and groups keep track of each other.  Children on field trips wear a Gaggle Beacon, which allows a chaperone to know that a child is near. Chaperones use an iOS or Android application that is linked to the bracelets, allowing them to know when a child has moved out of range. This real time, continuous, automated attendance monitoring allows a trip to run much more smoothly, and more importantly, safely.

If a child separates from the group, or the group moves on without the child, their primary chaperone(s) will be alerted before they have a chance to wander too far away:  instead of many minutes passing before a chaperone realizes a child is missing, they are alerted in seconds. If the child is not readily found, the alert can be escalated to the entire trip or even to every person who has the Gaggle application installed on their phone.

What makes our service unique is that all the chaperones are linked to one another via the Gaggle cloud service. If a child moves between groups, their chaperone will know that the child is not actually lost. Information is shared among every chaperone of a trip, and if escalated, every local Gaggle user.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/gaggle-uses-a-fun-wearable-beacon-and-mobile-app-to-create-a-revolutionary-new-child-safety-service,

Small and medium-sized local farmers struggle to compete in global market channels, which threatens the resiliency of local and sustainable food production for our region. The result is the paradox of hunger and obesity disproportionately impacting low-income communities and communities of color, environmental degradation, exploitation of food workers, and economic loss for small farms and food businesses. 

The Los Angeles Food Policy Council serves as a space where stakeholders of diverse communities, and representing every sector of the food system, come together to generate solutions. 

We unite farmers and gardeners, entrepreneurs and activists, government officials and community members who care about health disparities and diet-related disease, hunger and access to healthy food, working conditions for food workers, and the resiliency of our soil, seed, water and food economy. 

Through our dynamic public events- which we call “the Network”- and eight open Working Groups, we have been successful in passing policy related to urban agriculture, food stamps, farmers markets, healthy food access, and school and government food programs. 

Now it’s time to generate the next big policy agenda! 

Our proposal for the next 12 months is to ramp up outreach and engagement to generate a visionary and comprehensive policy platform for the NEXT 5 years. Utilizing our Food System Dashboard – which aggregates almost 200 metrics that depict the health, sustainability and fairness of our local and regional food system – we will engage a diverse and expansive network of food advocates, practitioners and residents to generate policy recommendations for the City and County of Los Angeles. 

Prioritizing the lived experience of those most impacted by a broken food system, we will partner with organizations working with youth, seniors, mothers, workers and those living in neighborhoods with limited healthy food access to ensure policy recommendations holistically reflect our communities. 

The campaign for the new Good Food for All Agenda will utilize a three-pronged approach: 
(1) Engage the LAFPC Network for feedback and build new partnerships with organizations representing those most impacted in the food system 
(2) Use data to inform policy ideas and 
(3) Creatively use social media to get the pulse of needs and opportunities throughout our local food system. 

Using these three strategies- and your help- we will generate a new Good Food For All Agenda, which will offer concrete action steps to create a healthy and fair food system that makes LA the best place to LIVE.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/food-democracy-in-la-creating-policy-ideas-for-a-healthy-fair-food-system,

In the short term, Equallet's success is defined by the number of women-owned businesses that register and utilize our marketing tools, and by the number of active users that use Equallet to search for and engage with the businesses.

In the long term, success will be defined by the increase in sales and investments our WOBs have realized through the Equallet platform, the number of new jobs those WOBs create for women and the positive impacts those WOBs have on our local communities.

This will allow consumers and investors to make informed decisions on how they wish to engage and support the individual businesses. Exposure to WOBs allows us to galvanize the collective community support – consumers, investors, government and corporate entities – to help WOBs grow. The dividends of that growth will flow in to the community through new job creation, generation of wealth, and ultimately elevate women to decision making positions that can impact positive change for Los Angeles residents.

Equallet was founded with one driving purpose – to help eliminate gender inequality in our lifetime.  By creating an easy way to find and support women-owned businesses in LA, we are leveling the playing field and creating a supportive environment for women entrepreneurs to thrive.

Equallet’s focus on supporting women in business is grounded in research that shows elevating women is not just a feel-good exercise, but an economic imperative. Data demonstrates that more equality leads to higher GDP and increased productivity - effects that clearly benefit all of us. 

According the 2012 US Census, LA County is home to nearly 440K women-owned businesses, the largest population of WOBs in the country. However, the surveys contain very little information on the businesses themselves. There is no comprehensive, accessible database of LA based women-owned businesses that exists today. Therefore, there is no reliable way to track key metrics on them such as their progress, success rates, growth, services they provide and overall needs of these business owners. What we are seeing is that this lack of data on women-owned businesses is severely limiting government and private agencies alike to make policies and decisions to ensure the women-owned business communities are being represented properly.

As Equallet scales to include all LA based women-owned businesses we will be collecting the much needed data on these businesses that can be used for the purposes of driving policy and community decisions in order to help these businesses thrive.

Over the last 10 years, Los Angeles neighborhoods have undergone unprecedented change. Expanding public transit options, the blossoming of artistic cultural centers, as well as the increased interest in urban life, have transformed neighborhoods that once had limited desirability, into attractive places to live and work. This has often meant an escalation of rents resulting in the displacement of many residents in communities across the Los Angeles landscape. Ultimately, this phenomena has the potential to transition the urban core of the city from a collection of culturally dynamic neighborhoods, to a relatively homogeneous area populated based on one’s ability to afford the rents. However, as noted in a recent paper by UCLA researchers, there is the opportunity to occupy the space “in between” the neighborhoods of the recent past and the potentially gentrified future to negotiate the ultimate destiny of the neighborhood. In particular, cultural economic development provides a solid platform through which to level the playing field in the tug of war that determines a neighborhood's future.

LA LISC, in collaboration with LA Commons, are poised to take on the challenge of supporting local stakeholders in 4 distinct neighborhoods by engaging businesses, residents, merchant associations, arts-related entities and community based organizations to maximize collaboration and harness the creative cultural potential to achieve a sustainable future that allocates the benefits more equitably. Through this work, we will further the development of more culturally-based businesses and solidify neighborhood identities and the ability of residents to live and work locally.

As part of the project, LA LISC will: 

(1) Convene a cultural economic development summit to address the many facets of cultural economic development and connect participants to creative strategies that have been used both locally and nationally. Attendees will be exposed to many ideas to pilot in their neighborhoods. 

(2) Activate 4 cultural magnets with a pilot or iconic activity that will spur the creation of culturally-based businesses. The cultural magnets include: Central Avenue Historic District (local partner: Coalition for Responsible Community Development), Little Tokyo (Little Tokyo Service Center), East Los Angeles/Boyle Heights (East Los Angeles Community Corporation and Leimert Park (LP Village 20|20 Vision Initiative).

(3) Support and grow entrepreneurial enterprises contributing to neighborhood cultural vibrancy. The goal will be to assist these businesses with access to capital, information, larger markets and technical assistance.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/preserving-las-cultural-diversity,

The project promotes community health, supports food security and combat high rates of nutrition-related diseases by creating a fun, beautiful and drought tolerant way for community members to take a walk, and by making free, nutritious, fresh fruit available to anyone who walks by. Studies suggest that contact with nature beneficially impacts blood pressure, heart rate, mood, day- to-day effectiveness, social behavior, cognitive functioning, and work performance. This project will stimulate the economy by helping to save tax dollars and increase local income. Let’s improve the environment by planting fruit trees with spongy root systems that will catch a significant amount of rainwater and that will remove both C02 and pollutants from the air.

LAWA will contribute to their education and we realize that our young people need to be paid. We will provide opportunities to work with professionals in fields such as IT, Human Resources, Administration, and even Airport Police and Risk Management.

With a network of comprehensive, multi-disciplinary preventive care clinics, a focus on individual and community education, and a consortium of experts from leading cancer centers around the country all dedicated to early detection and prevention, we seek to increase survival rates and improve the lives of women and families affected by cancer.

The LCF Clinic at USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center allows women at increased risk for breast or ovarian cancer to arm themselves with resources, knowledge and doctors by their side to stay healthy. This clinic is for all women all over Los Angeles to access their risk by seeing a breast oncologist, gynecologic oncologist, genetic counselor and have access to genetic testing if deemed necessary and wanted. 

The goals of the Lynne Cohen Foundation Preventive Care Clinic at USC Norris Cancer Center are to:
-Provide access to exceptional quality care to all women with, or at increased risk for, hereditary ovarian and breast cancers, particularly those that are underserved. 
-Expand our treatment and screening efforts for underserved women with ovarian cancer or at increased risk of developing ovarian cancer.
-Advance research opportunities at USC in the screening and treatment of breast and ovarian cancers.

We were thrilled to have had 160 participants in the first iteration of Maiden LA, and were amazed by the range of events that materialized, from artists hosting web-based projects, including a biennial that only exists on Instagram and a blog that addressed an artist's permanent ban from the US, to a collection of Noah Purifoy works at Tara's Hall, a survey of works by 80s L.A. punk rock scene artist Mary Woronov at the Lodge, a Post-It installation at an artist-run children’s museum in San Gabriel Valley, and a talk with Jackie Winsor at Hauser Wirth and Schimmel. 

Success for the 2017 iteration of Maiden LA will involve greater artist participation, events well-attended by the community, more social media followers and engagement, more newsletter subscribers, a wider promotional campaign, and greater press exposure.

We foresee 300 participants in Maiden LA 2017, with more artists and their respective communities being connected and represented.

Maiden LA, both a playful anagram and homophone of the Hammer Museum’s ‘Made in LA’, broadens the scope of what it means to be an artist in Los Angeles and how to find and engage with a community in such a vast city. Maiden LA is different from other biennials in that it is a community-driven, egalitarian event, aiming to dissolve hierarchies.  The artists involved hold the reigns in an effort to expand upon rather than undermine the institutional dictates. 
Because Maiden LA’s application process is 100% inclusive, it provides a rare forum where established institutions, like the Getty, are on the same plane as an unrepresented artist working out of their garage. Los Angeles is broadly acknowledged, especially as of late, as a current artistic hub, with a recent influx of galleries and artists moving here, as well as a flood of media coverage. In addition to the publicized aspects of the LA art world, there are also so many artists that no one gets to see or know about.  By encouraging the use of alternative spaces to showcase one’s work, unrepresented artists can open up their spaces and share their work to the greater community under the Maiden LA umbrella.  

Regarding the LA2050 metrics: 

Arts establishments: Through exposure, community engagement, and networking we hope to bring artists and arts establishments together to foster new relationships.  We plan to invite emerging and established art spaces to attend open studios and vice versa. The 2016 iteration of Maiden LA saw collaborative efforts between artists and art establishments, with organizations adding to or creating new programs.  This is certainly a measured success!  New professional relationships will continue to emerge as a result of Maiden LA.

Employment in the creative industries: With over 300 events it is inevitable that many of the organizations involved will have a need for additional staff and/or volunteers. 

Percentage of graduates from local higher education institutions that remain in LA County 5 years after graduating: By turning Maiden LA into a household name, we hope to contribute to the rich texture of this city, providing incentive for graduates to stay and thrive here. We will offer 25 need-based artist stipends to help launch individual projects.

Recruiting and retention rates for local higher education institutions: We plan to reach out to local higher education institutions, in hopes that our ongoing program will aid in their recruitment and retention rates.

Everyday people travel from all over the world to see the city where dreams come true and stars are born. This reputation has attracted thousands of aspiring artists to join our community and turn Los Angeles into a City of Creatives. Our community is flooded with artists, innovators, pioneers, and dreamers. Angelenos have remarkable gifts that have been celebrated and praised globally.

However, while the world is applauding, our home is silent.  Los Angeles does not celebrate art the way the rest of the world does.  This city is deprived and far behind any other metropolis. Our creative community is starving for acknowledgement, appreciation and inspiration. Art is the greatest form of entertainment and if we truly are the capital, then our city should be flourishing with art. 

When people interact with art and become part of a piece, it creates an emotional connection between the artist and observer.  The art piece becomes a heartfelt letter from the artist that the observer reads through each personal interaction.  As people notice others reading the letter and feeling the same connection, a community begins to form. It’s amazing how in seconds strangers become friends over a letter written by someone neither of them personally knows.  If art is that powerful just imagine if our entire city was immersed with these beautiful, colorful and inspiring letters.

Playascape is a public arts program that will transform urban communities into artistic playgrounds through interactive and immersive art. We produce cultural experiences that infuse community engagement, technology and media to interact with the whole family. 

The art we curate shares a symbiotic relationship with math and science, creatively pushing boundaries and inspiring innovation.  This can be seen and understood by the large scale interactive pieces that most people experience at art and music festivals. Exposure to the festival experience is limited to a small percentage of the community. Further, the lack of public spaces in urban communities makes it difficult to install permanent art pieces. To fill this void, Playascape focuses on bringing these inspiring ephemeral pieces to these communities for all to enjoy.

Playascape's cultural experiences engage its community through outreach programs such as field trips and artist engagements. The art they curate contains technology and they utilize media to expose, educate and inspire. For example, PlayascapeTV is an educational Youtube channel that showcases artists and their creative inventions.   

Playascape is a art establishment that will make LA the greatest place to create as it will provide opportunities for artists to shine in their city, increase visibility to female and minority artists, and advance LA's artistic achievements that will transcend this city as the creative capital of the world.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/playascape-transforming-la-into-an-artistic-playground-that-inspires-innovation-with-public-art,

Melrose Elementary is built upon a bedrock commitment to alleviate harms of racial isolation by creating a culture of excellence that attracts students from diverse communities. As a Magnet school, de facto segregation is addressed through LAUSD transportation services for students living beyond a two-mile radius from our school, while extending our reach to a wider variety of ethnic and socio-economic groups. Also, the newer iPads that would be purchased with this grant funding have a greatly heightened dictation capacity. This will help bridge the achievement gap of our English Language Learners and our DHH (Deaf and Hard of Hearing) students.

At its core, this program is founded on the belief that a sustainably literate community depends on the accessibility of books. Unfortunately, there is a staggering amount of students in Los Angeles that do not have access to the books needed to inspire and engage. We believe by taking on the challenge of delivering books to every elementary school within a single district each year, our program will have a targeted impact and put a spotlight on the importance of supporting reading and literacy within lower income communities. 

For the 2016-2017 school year, we will be focusing our efforts on impacting the 12 elementary schools within Lynwood Unified School District, where 40% of their students are English Language Learners and nearly 80% of them live at or below the poverty line. Since literacy is a key factor in determining future life success, without building a solid reading foundation early in their learning career, students are increasingly less likely to succeed in academics and the job market. This barrier to their best and brightest futures is hindered further by poverty, as a majority of the lowest-level readers are from low-income families.   

With an average of only 36% of students reading at proficiency or higher in Title I Los Angeles elementary schools, we are failing our students and condemning them to subpar lives. In a job market that is increasingly reliant on higher education, these students stand little chance at earning a livable wage as adults, as those who cannot read proficiently by the third grade are four times more likely to drop out of high school. Worse yet, those who fall behind are likely to never catch up to their proficient peers. In the city of Lynwood, nearly half of the population has less than a high school education. At its core, the schools in Lynwood Unified School District lack the necessary resources to close this income-based inequality. With Leaders + Readers, we are working to change this narrative…we are focused on expanding school, classroom, and home libraries with books that children are genuinely interested in reading and will serve as their “gateway” to a love of reading and stronger literacy.

Our goals grow exponentially each year with our Los Angeles-based program and we hope to accelerate our impact on Title I students year after year and make LA the best place to LEARN.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/leaders-readers-growing-school-libraries-and-minds-one-book-at-a-time,

Children living with muscular dystrophy and related life-threatening diseases face daily challenges that often make it difficult to 'just be a kid.' As their muscles progressively get weaker, children may lose basic functions such as walking, dressing, eating, talking or even breathing. MDA Summer Camp gives kids with muscular dystrophy and related diseases a chance to discover new interests while gaining self-confidence, forging lifelong friendships and experiencing the independence of being away from home in an environment where barriers don’t exist. 
Prevalence over adverse childhood experiences - Some children require 24-hour care from parents or caregivers. However, at our summer camp, kids of all abilities are able to overcome their care needs and takes away the daily stress and pressures they face. This is one week of the year where these kids can truly live unlimited.  Prior to their diagnosis, our kids lived uninhibited and were able to lead active lives. Summer camp is an opportunity for them to be active again, with adaptive sports, zip-lining, and swimming. 
Healthcare access - We are also able to provide these kids with access to amazing healthcare breakthroughs. As a result, our kids are living well into adulthood. MDA is the leading organization for the advancement of progress with muscular dystrophy. In the last 5 years, there have been more research breakthroughs than in the last 20 years combined. A perfect example is the FDA's approval of Eteplirsen, a drug that is helping children living with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy treat symptoms of the disease and slow the progression.  These medical breakthroughs give kids the access to the healthcare they need in order to live longer and live stronger.

These clinics are able to provide specialized health-care to our families in Los Angeles. These clinics are critical to helping our kids live healthier lives. Specialists are able to provide one-on-one care to our families, ensuring each family's needs are met.

The students at each school or group we visit participate in a survey before and after the presentation. Students who see the workshop take a pre- and post-survey, which are then compared. In addition, NCJW|LA conducts interviews with students who have seen the workshop for their feedback.

The Talk Project is a bold student-driven movement that was created by NCJW|LA teen volunteers who felt their schools lacked education on sexual violence. They noticed harmful ideas perpetuated by their peers stemming from rape culture, ideas like “she was asking for it by getting so drunk” and “boys will be boys.” These high school students were inspired by recent activism on college campuses to start organizing to create positive change through education, by taking it upon themselves to change “The Talk” surrounding the issue of sexual violence. 

With the support of NCJW|LA staff, the teens researched and wrote a script for a workshop they call The Talk Project.

Now, teen volunteers in The Talk Project are trained by other teen leaders to run interactive and engaging workshops for LA high schools and youth groups on understanding the issue, supporting survivors, bystander intervention, how to have healthy, consensual relationships, ways to get help if violence occurs, and advocating for cultural change. 

Since its launch February 2016, The Talk Project workshop has been presented for six Los Angeles high schools and one youth group for 1100 students so far. The workshop includes clips from The Hunting Ground documentary on the campus sexual assault movement, and NCJW|LA gives schools the option to screen the film in full at a discount. 

The issue of sexual violence is heavy and can be taxing to take on. NCJW|LA staff works very closely with the volunteers to make sure they are comfortable talking and thinking about the subject matter, and never feel they are alone in this.

The Talk Project has its own website so that students everywhere can educate themselves and take part in the conversation.  The site features blog posts, videos, art and more from our student leaders and students from all over are invited to submit. It’s amazing to see student passion fuel a movement of their own creation. Check out changethetalk.org! 

With resources and strong support this program can truly take off, and LA teens can continue to use their voices to make Los Angeles a safer, more inclusive, more empowering place to learn.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/the-talk-project-–-teens-leading-workshops-on-sexual-violence-culture-change,

By bringing them together and showing them how their experiences can inspire reform, NFYI helps connect the voices of the foster care community with those who need to hear them.  
We CONNECT youth, families, policy makers and the general public in a variety of ways:
The LA Leadership Corps: Foster youth and alumni, ages 18 and beyond, and their relatives, foster families and community allies learn how to organize for change by doing the hands-on work of becoming recruiters, trainers and organizers themselves. 
Shadow Days: Foster youth spend the day with local, State or federal officials to share their experiences and make policy recommendations.
Listening Tours and Dinners for Elected Officials: Foster youth and families, policy experts and elected officials gather to learn about a particular issue together, getting a first-hand look at the problem and possible solutions.
Other Organizations Who Share Our Goals: NFYI is part of a network of organizations that work together for change. By collaborating with others such as the Community Coalition who work with the grandparents and other relatives of foster youth, we can reach out to more people and avoid duplication of effort.
Building relationships and identifying shared values and goals is the foundation of our work.

In late 2011, GRID was the very 1st transportation mega-infrastructure proposal to be given a resolution for support by Sierra Club.  In 2012, GRID was rejected by PortTechLA for membership & also rejected from the newly opened LA Cleantech Incubator (LACI). So GRID moved on & was joined in support by LIUNA the LA/OC Building Trades, the International Brotherhood of TEAMSTERS & the Equipment Operators Unions. In mid-2013, GRID re-applied to LACI & was accepted. GRID's next goal was to obtain an independent evalution of GRID's viability & received assistance from California University of Northridge School of Engineering who assisted GRID to submit a grant application for Transportation Infrastructure Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER). GRID succeeded in receiving letters of support from key elected officials to include members of congress Janice Hahn, Adam Schiff, and CA Pro Tem Senator Kevin De Leon.

The most non-visual impact will be the privately financed contribution to building transportation infrastructure (estimated at $18B) that will create 10's of thousands of jobs, primarily jobs in the fields of construction and alternative energy infrastructure. We apply jobs created as a CONNECT LA benefit because GRID's proposed infrastructure are within the very neighborhoods we hope to grow jobs; adjacent to workers reducing commuting times required to travelling to and from work. But it's the byproducts of the GRID Project that will have the most impact to CONNECT LA.  For historical reference, in 1984, Mayor Tom Bradley and Olympic Games chief Peter Ueberroth forged an agreement to suspend deliveries of containers on trucks travelling to and from the Ports of LA and Long Beach. The move was a success and the 'LA Traffic Miracle' reported to have reduced LA's freeway traffic congestion by over 50%. The advent of freight pipelines is envisioned to become the 2nd iteration of freeway rights of way to increase efficient traffic flow for the Greater Los Angeles mega-region. However, freight pipelines with not have the impact freeway construction has had over the last 70 years. Natural effects of efficiency for freight transportation are anticipated to greatly  enhance other aspects of our regional transportation transportation networks (i.e. cars, bike lanes, walkways).  GRID proposers anticipate this new iteration of urban transportation (controlling truck populations) will have significant knock on effects to the point that more pipelines routes will developed. Motivations will be concession revenues, carbon tax credit opportunities, continued support from environmental, social justice groups and labor unions, and business interests primarily from the construction and renewable energy sector.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/the-grid-project-lets-create-50k-jobs-building-great-things-to-reduce-air-pollution-fwy-gridlock,

OUR NEED

Youth referred to New Directions for Youth (NDY) are at high-risk of, or already involved with, gangs, criminal behavior, substance abuse, victims of physical and/or sexual abuse, school failure, early pregnancy, or juvenile delinquency. NDY's programs provide a secure, welcoming environment for youth who are involved with the juvenile justice system, are in foster care, or who are experiencing poverty and hardship. Parents and guardians referred to NDY are challenged by issues of violence, economic hardship and lack of basic services. 

In addition to the challenges these families face, there is a lack of nutrition education and physical fitness activities for underserved low-income youth and families. Traditional fitness centers are not available or are outside their financial reach. 

The 2015 Obesity in California report from the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research notes that obesity has a greater impact on vulnerable Californians. 

-	“Thirty-one percent of adult Californians below 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) were obese compared to 20% percent with incomes at or above 400% FPL.”

-	“The prevalence of obesity was higher among African-American, American Indians, and Latinos than among whites.” 

-	“Neighborhood safety is linked with obesity and physical activity… (The) lack of safety can hinder physical activity and increase stress.”

OUR SOLUTION

The NDY Health and Recreation Center will have weights, a dance studio, and cardio equipment that youth and their family will be able to use. These fitness activities and workshops will be available to help reduce obesity and the onset of chronic conditions in disproportionate rates for high-risk and underserved minority populations in Los Angeles. (NDY clients currently served are 70% Latino/Hispanic; 10% African American; 10% Caucasian; and 10% from other ethnic backgrounds.) The Center will also provide healthy opportunities for stress relief to individuals facing life’s most difficult challenges.

To further help the community, the NDY Health and Recreation Center will also provide job training and employment to local youth. The Center will be led by youth employees (ages 16 – 24) who will oversee day-to-day management. For many, this will provide a first time job experience that will give them an opportunity to build their résumé and provide them the necessary hard and soft skills to gain employment.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/ndy-health-recreation-center-creating-a-healthier-and-resilient-los-angeles,

LA is multifaceted megapolis which function like archipelago. To be a place to create and live it has to connect its part in an number of alternative ways: by private vehicle, public transport, pedestrian routes, WiFi. 
LA has long been car-obsessed and now desperately needs public transportation network. Therefore 'bridges' of public transit and pedestrian paths have to be built in large quantities. It is a long iterative process, but the first thing we can do is to see how LA connects now, to discover where fast problem-solving may be implemented and what has to be connected.
How to do it?
 
Solution
By using Habidatum Platform we help identify the priority public transport development areas. We highlight places where public transport is unavailable, and people have to wait or walk longer than in other locations.
We also analyze where public transport is inefficient. In some cases, getting somewhere by foot is faster than using public transport. 
Automated spatio-temporal analysis, which is performed in our platform and based on open data only, supports improvement of public transit’s reputation and the quality of life in the city. We still leave space for analysts’ creative work producing interactive analytical visualization which sets a dialogue between the complex data and the transport planner.
By playing with metadata filters, layers intersection, time and geographical scales, the analysts can unveil transport system’s pain-points which further leads to both fast problem-solving and building strategic optimization roadmaps.
 
Habidatum Platform description
Habidatum Platform is a space-time analysis tool serving the exploration of space use and operation through time (hourly, daily, monthly or even annual time intervals). The platform accumulates various types and combinations of data multiplying several indicators. Project deliverables may be presented in various formats including monitoring dashboards, research interfaces, text & stats reports et al. The visual interface is user-friendly and easy to understand. It can be fine-tuned for each project according to customer’s priorities.
 
Innovative characteristics of the proposal
•Space-time visual analysis technique to define behavioral patterns
•Semantic analysis engine to explore people’s attitudes
•Visualization system to support real-time interaction with data
•Innovative metrics built by experienced urban analysts
•Hybrid approach: machine-learning and human training
 
Feasibility and implementation
The platform has proven its value for urban managers and planners in 15+ cities globally, and the scope continues to grow. It is mainly used for area development planning, transportation planning  and management, real estate property management and evaluation.
The public transport application of the platform has been used in 5+ cities. Among them is the city of Pune, India, which serves to showcase the feasibility of the current proposal (see the video).",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/la-easy-access,

The Master Plan will make the park both a destination and a gateway, bringing together South LA, Downtown, the Westside and nearby communities in a single park that is connected to much of the City through multiple Expo Line Metro stops and several buses, and through a unique blend of cultural, recreational, and sporting activities. We will promote transit ridership and pedestrian activity among visitors, while making tangible improvements to the neighborhood. 

Exposition Park (“Expo”) sits just south of Downtown Los Angeles, adjacent to the USC campus. Its 160 acres are an iconic place to meet friends, visit a beautiful park and gardens, exercise, and enjoy life. It is home to celebrated museums, including the California Science Center, the L.A. County Natural History Museum, and the California African American Museum. The Los Angeles Football Club (a Major League Soccer team) is building Banc of California Stadium there, and the park’s Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum is the home of USC Trojan Football, and the Los Angeles Rams through 2018. 

Expo is a jewel in the center of the city, but it faces several challenges. Visitors and residents are concerned that navigation within and around the park is challenging. The park is located on two stops of the new and expanded Exposition Line, a direct route from Downtown to Santa Monica, but this is not immediately clear to all visitors and transit riders. Additionally, there is a clear inequity in amenities: the north side of the park hosts plentiful green space and museums, but the south and west sides of the park are largely dedicated to surface parking, limiting the experience of visitors and nearby residents.

Our goals include:

• Preserving the historical legacy of Exposition Park, while enhancing its character, landscape features, and relationship to adjacent communities and transit.

• Addressing the lack of amenities on the park’s neighborhood boundaries, reinforcing the value of the Exposition Line and the bus system, and managing traffic and parking impacts.
  
• Preparing for larger crowds and a growing number of uses for the park, and reducing growth in vehicle miles traveled by encouraging the use of transit to and within the neighborhood.

• Promoting biking and pedestrian activity through a clearly delineated system of pedestrian walkways and improved linkage between light rail, buses, bikes, and cars.

• Increasing space dedicated to recreational uses and cultural events.

LA2050 funds will pay for the following components of our vision: 

• A comprehensive online presence, including social media and a dedicated Master Plan website. 

• Public events including charrettes, workshops, public transit education, and surveys of neighborhood residents and park visitors. 

• Interviews with park stakeholders, such as LA Metro, USC, and nearby businesses, schools, and the Neighborhood Council.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/exposition-park-a-gateway-and-a-destination,

Key performance indicators include the numbers of: volunteers, in-kind and financial donations, and package recipients. 

The true benefits and ultimate success of the Operation Gratitude program, however, can be found in the Mail Call section of our website which displays thousands of letters from heroes who have received the Care Packages. One theme that runs through the letters is how surprised and appreciative they are that total strangers have taken the time to show they care: “We expect to get things from friends and family, but you sent me something out of a deep respect for your country & its defenders. That's powerful.” 

Equally important is our ability to touch troops who served during previous wars. A former 82nd Airborne Paratrooper from WWII wrote: 'It's a great feeling to know that we haven't been forgotten. Because of you & all Americans like you, our country remains strong and united.” 

The most dramatic illustration of our impact was received from an Army First Sergeant: 'Your care packages lifted morale & helped save the life of a young soldier who never got mail, care packages, or anything. He was planning to commit suicide on Christmas, but because that soldier received your care package on Christmas Eve, he changed his mind. Your care package made a major difference in a human life.

During each Assembly Day--15 to 20 per year-- we host 500-1000+ local volunteers who assemble thousands of Care Packages within just 3 hours.  Year-to-date, 10,197 Los Angeles-area residents have assembled 167,122 Care Packages at our facility in Chatsworth. In addition, thousands of Angelenos have hosted Collection Drives and donated items, hand-made scarves and hats, and made “survival” paracord bracelets to include in the packages.

Operation Gratitude provides more than just the creation of Care Packages.  For retirees, the elderly, the handicapped and Veterans of all eras, Operation Gratitude is a way to stay active and engaged while still serving their country in a meaningful way. Students complete community service hours while working with our diverse group of volunteers and gaining respect for our nation's service members. Corporate employees find great team building exercises, but also a heartwarming experience – especially when putting their own products into care packages. 

On any given day at Operation Gratitude, one will see volunteers of all ages, veterans, corporate executives, people of every race, religion, ethnicity, ability, and political persuasion working together to put a smile on a hero’s face and say “Thank You.”  It’s a perfect reflection of the diversity of Los Angeles, and we are proud to create a community that is so accepting and interactive.

The extraordinary diversity within our community of volunteers would be striking to a spectator, but those differences are invisible to the volunteers as they work side by side in mission-driven action.

Discrimination does not exist when gratitude is being expressed.

Most importantly, we believe we’re the number one organization providing a critical bridge between the First Responder/Military Communities and the Civilian population – closing a social and emotional divide that many have noted causes a serious rift in our society.

As one example, on September 11, 2016, in commemoration of the 15th anniversary of 9-11, we gathered 1,300 volunteers to work shoulder to shoulder with dozens of LAPD and LAFD members.  Together they created over 11,000 Care Kits to distribute to every Los Angeles area First Responder.  This was an opportunity to see the best in each other and develop mutual trust and respect.

The ultimate bridge between these communities occurs when the Care Package recipients open the packages, read the personal letters, wrap themselves in the handcrafted scarves, place the handmade paracord bracelets on their wrist, enjoy the snacks, and use the toiletries. Then they truly understand the immense generosity and effort that went into assembling each box by hand.

In the short term, we track the number of applicants and number, dollar volume, and type of loans originated, and client characteristics such as income, ethnicity, gender, credit score, household size, type of business, sales and number of employees.  

Over time, we measure the impact of our loans by tracking changes in borrower household income; growth of business sales and income; job creation; and business survival rates. We also gather data related to client satisfaction and confidence in running their business as a result of OF’s microlending and advising services.  This data is collected using MicroTest, a performance evaluation tool developed by the Aspen Institute and used by the nation’s leading microenterprise organizations. Data on these outcomes is measured starting two years after the loan is made, and is collected through phone surveys and tax returns.  

Through our Community Partners Program, OF seeks to invest $4.8 million in 240 small businesses in LA County’s underserved communities in FY17. Based on previous results measured through MicroTest surveys, we project these investments to generate positive outcomes for our borrowers, including the creation/retention of 2.7 jobs/loan on average, a 20% increase in business revenue, a 90% business survival rate, in addition to a “ripple effect” of $2 in economic activity for every $1 invested.","[""Money "",""Advisors/board members"",""Staff "",""Publicity/awareness"",""Network/relationship support""]","OF is committed to the idea that a small amount of money, combined with meaningful financial advice, can help working people pursue the proven pathways to prosperity in their own lives while driving economic mobility and building stronger communities.

This collaboration is a means to scale and provide fairer and affordable capital options for our community.","[""Jobs per capita"",""Minority- and women-owned firms""]","Entrepreneurship provides a path to employment for low-wage workers. While Greater LA features high levels of small business ownership, it lacks sufficient capacity to address the capital needs of these entrepreneurs.
Conventional lenders have tightened their requirements, limiting access by small business owners. And some financing options such as payday loans and merchant cash advances strap high APRs on available financing, doing more harm than good. Access to affordable, appropriate capital is essential for small businesses to survive and thrive.  Almost half of small businesses that fail do so because they cannot get the financing they need to grow.  

OF helps local entrepreneurs gain access to credit, advising, and the means to build a stable enterprise, earn a living wage, and work toward financial independence while creating jobs in their community. Since our launch in 1994, OF has offered an innovative combination of products and services, directing more than $516 million, and thousands of hours of financial training into California's distressed neighborhoods, improving lives in more than 23,000 households. OF provides loans of $2,600 to $100,000 at low, fixed interest rates to low-income entrepreneurs with small capital needs and imperfect credit.

Through our new Community Partnership Program, OF is creating a network of quality lending partners that collectively have a deeper reach, improve the entrepreneurship ecosystem and have an electronic portal to capture data. OF will create a consistent partner referral channel for microbusiness, thereby increasing new loan volume.  By leveraging OF’s position as an “Affordable and Responsible” lender, and capitalizing on our expert knowledge of alternative financing to educate and train partners about “New School Lending,” we expect to be a best alternative to more LA small business owners. To date, OF has secured MOUs with the following LA-area community partners: AmPac Tri-State CDC; APISBP; LA Mas; LURN; MCS – Harbor City; MCS – Hollywood;PACE and Vermont-Slauson EDC. Together we have originated 200 loans for a total of $2 million invested in the local economy.

OF’s model will create a more vital work force in LA. Each of our loans creates or maintains an average of 2.7 jobs, resulting in a “ripple effect” that generates new revenues, wages, and taxes that flow through the local economy. A recent independent study found that every $1 OF lends generates nearly $2 in new annual economic activity.

OF has helped fill the financing gap by providing microloans to low-income entrepreneurs throughout CA .

And as the exponentially larger millennial generation- many of whom opt out of marriage altogether- reach the ‘Age of Conscious Uncoupling,’ that number will surely skyrocket. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, high conflict divorce/separation is the second (out of ten) most common Adverse Childhood Event (ACE) which have been proven to lead to negative health, academic, and economic outcomes in adults.   Conversely, children growing up with coParents who collaborate, cooperate and effectively coParenting, thrive. But catastrophic cuts to an already-overwhelmed court system have eliminated mediation, coParenting resources and self-help programs, leaving separating, divorced and never-married parents with few options for resolving conflict.  This lack of resources force many Angelenos to manage conflict and every day coParenting issues on their own.  Unfortunately, a disproportionate amount of parents end up litigating in court leading to advanced economic hardship for families as well as ACEs- which have documented connections to negative health, academic, and economic outcomes in adults.  It doesn’t have to be this way. A family’s marital status does not, in and of itself, lead to negative outcomes for children.  coParenter Project disrupts the cycle of conflict through three interrelated strategies.  First, our project will deliver research-based coParenting education to 1,000 coParents through a network of community-based organizations. Second, we will distribute 5,000 free licenses of coParenter, a coParenting management and mediation platform offering family communication, scheduling and management tools, automated conflict resolution and live, professional coaching to help coParents resolve disputes, make agreements and make better, more informed decisions for their kids. Finally, #coParentingProject, a Twitter based learning network for children of coParents, will connect youth in coParenting families with each other, to mitigate social isolation, build a community, and share information and resources in a safe, anonymous environment.

The APP Academy has its home on the campus of Pasadena High School where, in addition to their computer science classes and project, Academy students experience a complete high school education, from English to arts and music. The curriculum includes field trips to places like JPL, Art Center College of Design and Microsoft's LA offices, and guest speakers from Caltech and Idealab.

APP Academy classrooms are designed to emulate a high-tech start-up experience. They have laptops for every student, comfortable seating, spacious desks, large monitors along the walls, and space for group work in the center. The rooms are painted an attractive blue and the walls are lined with cartoons, video game art, and in one room, a rotating display of top-quality work created by the students.

The course sequence begins in grades 9 and 10 with students learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and C# to develop web applications. In grade 11, they create their own mobile app, which combines computer science concepts -- algorithm design, object-oriented programming, and database design and integration -- with programming techniques. In grade 12, students apply advanced programming concepts to advanced web development, 3D game development and the 'Internet of Things.' The program culminates with seniors designing and developing their own Capstone Projects, either in groups or independently. The 2016 Capstone Projects included: an R2D2-inspired robot, designed to inspire younger students to become interested in computer science; 'To Protect and Serve,” a story-based game that serves to shed light on the experience of African-American youth; and Star Gazers, a wearable product that allows users to locate constellations in the night sky (see the uploaded image for details about the student and her project.)",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/app-academy-mobile-web-and-game-development-for-high-school-students,

Los Angeles County is one of the most diverse counties in the U.S. with 47.7% Latino/Hispanic, 27.8 % Caucasian, 8.3% African American, 13.5% Asian Pacific Islander and 11% other. Per Census data, 39.4% of the population in LA County speaks Spanish at home. This means that our future scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs and thinkers will be bilingual and bicultural. Not to mention, STEM opportunities are on the rise in the county with companies boasting innovation and new technology. The SEMI program will prepare all students with the opportunity to learn STEM in a hands on interactive course in both English and Spanish. 
Patrick Henry Elementary School is 1 of 4 two-way English Spanish Immersion School in the Long Beach Unified School District, and the only school where 100 percent of the classrooms are dual immersion.  The Patrick Henry dual immersion education gives children the opportunity to become bilingual, bi-literate and bicultural by the end of 5th grade. The school is designed to serve speakers of other languages and English speakers in the same classroom. The students are purposely mixed in the same educational environment to provide communicative and academic language development through an interactive and cross-cultural setting. Participation begins in Kindergarten and continues through fifth grade. 
Over the past 2 years, the Patrick Henry Foundation (run by parents of Patrick Henry School students) has funded a “Teacher Innovation Grant” and subsidized a fee-based after school program (“Beyond the Bell”) to supplement the regular curriculum. These programs have expanded the curriculum at the school to include over $40,000 in new technology and web-based curriculum in the classrooms, as well as provided hundreds of students with science, arts, and technology classes before and after school. The Foundation would like to expand on these successful pilots to make these programs and technology available to all students at the school for free, and to refine culturally appropriate techniques for delivering these learning experiences to English language and Spanish speaking students.
The combination of the English Spanish Immersion with a STEM Curriculum creates an innovative learning environment which will develop the next generation of scientists, engineers, mathematicians and innovators. The SEMI program will be delivered to all students at the school. Each class will receive SEMI instruction on a grade-level basis. Students will receive coaching and technical assistance on how to conduct projects and experiments in the classroom setting. The program is unique in that is designed to dispel negative stereotypes about scientists (e.g., eccentric, isolated).",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/the-bilingual-scientists-engineers-mathematicians-and-innovators-semi-program,

We hope this model will have a ripple effect in LA, and encourage other models of creative housing solutions.
Tiny Houses – Affordable-by-design:  While tiny homes are generally under 300 square feet, they are highly customized to fit the homeowner's lifestyle and needs, and use design innovations to maximize useable space and reduce waste. Their small size substantially lowers build costs and increases efficiency.  The average cost of a Tiny Home is $22,000, allowing a minimum wage earner to become a mortgage-free home owner within four years using less than 30% of their income. There are creative possibilities available to a house with mobility incorporated into its design, most notably ease of syncing to existing infrastructure, allowing occupiers flexibility, and communities adaptability. Resilient communities are diverse and adaptable, and we believe increasing housing options to include Tiny Homes will make communities throughout LA County stronger and more resilient. 
A Maker’s Space for Tiny Houses: LATCH provides the opportunity for Angelenos to take action towards increasing their housing security by providing the space, tools, training, and support necessary for collaboratively building their own affordable-by-design DIY homes. The benefits of this maker’s space reach beyond those directly involved in building a Tiny House. Community members will have access to educational workshops focusing on building specific skills like framing, siding, electrical wiring, etc. A tool share program will allow them access to rental tools they need to improve their own dwellings. LATCH will be a center for research, support and housing advocacy, offering assistance to anyone in Los Angeles in understanding their options for legally living in small structures, on or off wheels. 
Helping Veterans Build Housing: By working with local agencies to identify veterans and other housing insecure candidates, we will sponsor these individuals to be participants of our “Hammer & Heart” program, which provides dedicated building space at LATCH and connects participants to the support and resources they need for a safe and successful home build. 
Land for a Tiny House Village: Makes A Village wants to create a Tiny House village as part of their plan to help Los Angeles residents finance and build affordable housing. The village aims to have owner-occupied housing, integrate living-wage jobs into the community design, and implement a hyper-local economy. 
Starting a Housing Cooperative: The development of our housing cooperative will allow LA residents an opportunity to work together to overcome high costs of living and participate meaningfully in the development and management of each housing community.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/how-we-can-use-tiny-houses-to-make-a-big-impact-on-housing-affordability-in-los-angeles!,

Goal1--Expand community use of CSPs: 

We will use geographic mapping to examine each CSP to understand how many and what types of people we are creating access for (eg, age groups, income, access to resources). We will use a systematic observation tool to measure how many and what types of people use the parks. We aim to serve 300-500 parkgoers per month and 4500+ for special events.

Goal 2--Empower individuals to access parks and take community leadership roles: We will systematically collect data from parents, children, and community members in outreach activities (e.g., trainings) to understand barriers and facilitators to parks access, tools/resources we can provide, and needed changes in community capacity. Outreach and park attendance data will be linked to understand what activities increase park use.

Goal 3--Improve individual and community wellbeing:  
We will examine annual scores from LAUSD’s Physical Fitness 5th grade testing to describe youth activity levels and obesity rates. We will also conduct interviews with school staff to understand the impacts of CSP use on student health, parent involvement, and neighborhood quality (e.g., park quality, crime and safety).","[""Money "",""Volunteers"",""Advisors/board members"",""Staff "",""Publicity/awareness"",""Infrastructure (building/space/vehicles etc.)"",""Technical infrastructure (computers etc.)"",""Community outreach "",""Network/relationship support"",""Quality improvement research""]","In 2016, People for Parks (PFP) opened 9 new Community School Parks (CSPs) for use during non-school hours, providing a park within walking distance of 45,000 Angelenos.

First, we will continue operating our 11 Community School Parks (CSPs). Second, in collaboration with community based organization Kid Healthy, we will empower community members to become leaders in recreation, play and park vibrancy so that CSPs are fully utilized and become self-sustaining. 

CSPs are supervised school playgrounds that PFP opens to the public on weekends and during the summer. Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) youth enrichment staff engage park-goers in play, sports and art & crafts. PFP’s community organizer carries out community empowerment.  LAUSD is the second largest landowner in LA. CSPs “joint use” of otherwise locked playgrounds is a creative way to provide park space in dense neighborhoods.

PFP will partner with Kid Healthy to customize and carry out its quarterly  “Padres En Accion” (PEA) education series with parents from all of our CSPs. Together we will train parents on playground leadership, physical activity, joint use and the recruitment of other parents and neighbors in recreation activities. This builds upon outstanding examples of inter-generational play, found at our Vine St CSP, where one grandma is a sought after goalie and Berendo, where neighbors formed a handball league enjoyed by players of all ages.
PEA sessions will be interactive with hands-on role-play and action planning to keep CSPs safe, fun and enriching. We will hold each training at one CSP site. Three parents from each CSP will participate in the training and then share what they learned at each of their sites. PFP’s Community Organizer will support this ongoing knowledge sharing. 

Background: In 2016, with an LA2050 grant and leveraged matching funds, we opened 9 new Community School Parks, making a total of 11! Located in Pico-Union, Westlake, Central Alameda, South Park, Hollywood, and Koreatown, these CSPs provide safe park access for more than 55,000 Angelenos and support community building and healthy lifestyles through play. 

We also grew our team with a Community Organizer who leads our CSP Incubator, helping parents and neighbors take ownership of these community spaces through parent-led activities such as Zumba classes, park beautification days, gardening clubs and sports teams. This has helped lower crime and strengthen perceived safety.  Berendo’s principal, Rosa Trujillo, writes, “Adults at the Saturday program clean and supervise their respective areas, decreasing vandalism activities as they take more ownership of the shared space.” 

And a parent shared, “Each staff member we have met has been wonderful. I know they are always keeping an eye on my son to make sure he is safe and having a good time.” 

This grant will help keep our CSPs thriving, and allow us to take our community empowerment to the next level through a strategic partnership with Kid Healthy, helping make LA the best place to PLAY for generations to come.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/people-for-parks-community-school-parks-go-kid-healthy!,

FLLA LA covers a wide range of civic participation leadership skills: how to be an effective campaign manager, finance director, communications director, field organizer, and even candidate. FLLA LA equips young people with the skills and confidence to become effective leaders, and prepares them to work on a campaign in any capacity as well as to assume key roles in non-profits, local government, and community leadership. In the application and selection process, we look for applicants who are committed and have the potential to create change in their communities – now and over the long-term. Since 2006, 161 participants have graduated from the program nationally – 70 percent of FLLA graduates have gone on to hold leadership roles in nonprofits, community groups, or in an elected official’s office; 70 percent have increased their civic participation through work on issue or political campaigns; and 14 percent have run for office (65 percent of these won their races).

Participants in past FLLA LA classes are already making strides toward many CONNECT metrics.

Many FLLA alumni are working toward increased voting rates. A recent FLLA alum is serving as the Volunteer Coordinator for a southern California Congressional campaign, using the field and communications training from FLLA to increase voter turnout in the district.

Other FLLA LA ’16 alumni hosted a meeting to sign up participants for Vote Allies. Vote Allies matches eligible voters with those who cannot vote (undocumented immigrants, citizens with a past felony, etc) to educate each other on the issues and process; to find common ground on the issues and candidates to “share” a vote. Vote Allies engages potential voters to critically think about issues in elections through conversations with ineligible persons, and increases their stake in the electoral process.  Through official and unofficial capacities, FLLA alumni work toward involving more people in the electoral process and local government.

FLLA alumni can also contribute to building cultural and public events. A pair of FLLA alumni, including one working for Los Angeles County Parks and Recreation, partnered to host a community hike and build relationships with community members in their neighborhood. 

Another significant outcome from FLLA is the development of young civic leaders who will go on to participate in and lead neighborhood councils. Five FLLA LA alumni have received appointments to their community’s public boards and commissions, including:

We deliver innovative, age-appropriate, and culturally competent sex education that empowers community members to make healthy choices. We partner with LAUSD to provide sexuality education to more students than any other organization in Los Angeles. Our curricula empower individuals to assert their rights within relationships, decrease risky behavior, and delay pregnancy.
Our Sexuality Education Initiative takes learning beyond the classroom by wrapping around schools and communities. We know that learning happens outside the classroom, whether it is at home, after school, or in the community. That’s why our programs reach parents, communities, and health centers, as well as classrooms. Our Peer Advocates program trains youth to become active health ambassadors, disseminating health information and conducting outreach in their schools and communities to educate peers about the importance of preventive health care and positive behaviors. PPLA operates two school-based wellness centers to provide healthcare to students, and conducts parent education sessions so that the information students learn in the classroom is reinforced at home and in the community. 
This year was a milestone for sex education legislation. California adopted AB 329, a new law requiring all public schools to provide medically-accurate, comprehensive sex education. As schools work towards full compliance with the law, we will use our decade of experience providing training to youth-serving professionals to help shepherd in a new era of sex education. Using a “train the trainer” model allows PPLA to significantly extend our reach. By providing safe and inclusive school environments, medically accurate information, and ongoing support, we are empowering teens to make healthy decisions about their bodies and their futures.
We know that the need for sex education is not limited to youth. Myths and misconceptions about sex and healthy relationships are just as prevalent in adult as it is in youth populations, which is why our Promotoras Comunitarias have provided education to the adult Latino population for over 20 years. Latina women are trained to provide reproductive health information in their communities. They create an effective link between communities and the health care system and provide culturally appropriate health education and information about health insurance options. 
The Promotoras also implemented the first-ever LGBT Family Acceptance Curriculum tailored to the Latino community to address stigma, shame, discrimination, and familial abuse. Evaluations show that the program is making a great impact on increasing knowledge and behaviors that support the LGBT community. We are proud to help advance these conversations in our communities, PPLA works to empower everyone in Los Angeles County to advocate for their own health, receive the medical services they need, and make positive decisions.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/community-based-comprehensive-sex-education,

We will measure this success as follows: 

At PPPSGV, every department tracks and reviews indicators in each area of our strategic plan. This is done quarterly and then shared with the Board of Directors. Additionally, each month, our Leadership Team reviews 51 metrics pertaining to: Health Center Access; Revenue; Service and Quality; Compliance; Outreach and Marketing; and Finance. Every month, we track whether we are on-target or within 5% of our goal, and if we are not, we respond intelligently. Health center managers undergo a similar monthly performance evaluation on 40 metrics pertaining to: appointment access, quality indicators, patient satisfaction, and financial performance. 

At the start of the grant, PPPSGV will generate additional metrics pertaining to PrEP patient services and outreach and integrate these into our existing performance measurement plan, so that the program’s quarterly and monthly results are not reviewed in a vacuum. This will be especially important since the activities of this project will be undertaken by staff in both our Patient Services and External Affairs Departments and implemented at all our health centers as well as in the community at large.","[""Money "",""Volunteers"",""Advisors/board members"",""Staff "",""Publicity/awareness"",""Education/training "",""Community outreach "",""Network/relationship support"",""Advocacy to elected officials""]","PrEP protects and empowers men who have sex with men and dismantles the sexual stigma and shame that still lingers today.

PPPSGV aims to be the first health centers in northeast LA and the San Gabriel Valley to offer sliding-scale PrEP, with the end-goal being to help 960 new patients per year stay healthy and HIV-free.","[""Healthcare access""]","This proposal will make LA the best place to LIVE because we envision a place where honest and proud sexuality is the norm and health equity is a reality—no matter who you are or where you live or who you love. PPPSGV was founded over 80 years ago to provide all women with broad public access to family planning, thus empowering them to seize control of their futures. With PrEP now proven as a highly effective medical prophylactic against HIV, PPPSGV now has the opportunity to offer men who have sex with men (MSM) and other HIV at-risk patients with the compassion, security, and freedom we have given women for nearly a century. 

But for many Angelenos, PrEP is a drug of privilege: it can cost at least $1,500/year and can be hard to access beyond metro LA. Last month, the California HIV/AIDS Research Program published a study showing PrEP awareness and usage is lower among Black, Hispanic, and young MSM, and although the majority of MSM are interested in taking PrEP, they don’t know where or how to access it and have fears about side effects, efficacy, and cost, with nearly 60% indicating they don’t think they can afford it. This is alarming because, although metro LA continues to shoulder the greatest HIV disease burden, the Department of Public Health has said “strategies to stem the epidemic in this region are working” while other regions, like the San Gabriel Valley, are exhibiting signs of emerging epidemics, with MSM, the young, and communities of color disproportionately impacted. PPPSGV’s HIV-positive results from the past three years underscore these trends: 81% of our HIV cases were MSM; 57% were MSM of color; and 70% were under the age of 29. 

PPPSGV possesses unique capabilities to reach and serve these populations. Last year, 75% (23,387) of our patients were under the age of 29 and 81% (25,052) were people of color. In the past three years, we performed 32,409 HIV tests, and in 2015, we distributed 516,926 condoms. Our patients know our staff will speak their language, will listen to fears and dispel myths and misinformation, will be sensitive to their sexual preferences and gender identities, will offer sliding scale or no-cost services, and will help them navigate the all-too-often costly and labyrinthine healthcare system beyond our doors. As one of six Planned Parenthood affiliates in California, we also have successful models of PrEP provision that we can draw upon to replicate laterally. Furthermore, our health centers are sexual-orientation neutral, meaning: no signage inadvertently “outs” clients entering our buildings for care. This is important since stigma, shame, and homophobia continue to be key barriers inhibiting HIV at-risk people from accessing the recommended care.  

Our long-term goal is to offer sliding-scale PrEP to nearly 960 patients/year, and at the close of the grant, we will have rolled out nPEP/PReP services at all of our health centers and will be seeing at least 40 patients/month or 480/year.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/northeast-los-angeles-and-the-san-gabriel-valley-get-prepd-and-pepd!!,

In 2005, POLAHS became the first new public high school to open in San Pedro in over 100 years. Educated on our campus are 950 students as diverse as the City of Los Angeles. Most students enrolling at POLAHS are considered at-risk; they struggle academically in middle school and would likely drop out of the education pipeline. POLAHS helps close the achievement gap and provides an environment in which students succeed. 

POLAHS’ CTE program was introduced on campus in fall 2015. Approximately 400 students in grades 9-12 participate, the majority of whom are traditionally disadvantaged. POLAHS’ program offers individualized instruction, small class sizes of 25:1 on average; highly qualified teachers; and a network of postsecondary and industry partnerships. POLAHS maintains 98% high school graduation and college enrollment rates, and last year was named a California Gold Ribbon School.

The program addresses an important theme: that all students learn and thrive in different ways. High school students involved in CTE are more engaged and graduate at higher rates. CTE also fosters postsecondary completion and addresses youth underemployment. Studies show that 4 out of 5 CTE graduates who pursue college earn a credential or are still enrolled two years later (Association for Career and Technical Education, 2016). Technical skills from POLAHS' CTE program provide a viable way for students to work and pay for their college degree.

However, this can be challenging in the late elementary and middle school years, when family involvement and teacher-family communication can begin to wane.

To address this challenge, we are partnering with Johns Hopkins University to build upon the strong success of their research-backed Teachers Involving Parents in Schoolwork (TIPS) program by enhancing it with 21st-century technology to become our Family Playlists Program.
	
In this innovative program, teachers and students will extend learning into the home environment by completing mathematics-based “Family Playlists” from our free digital learning platform, PowerMyLearning Connect. Students will have the opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge by “teaching” parents what they have learned about math concepts, and parents will complete the process by sending feedback about their student’s performance via guided prompts, including full bilingual support for Spanish-speaking families. From a central dashboard, teachers will be able to assign Family Playlists to an entire class, prompting parents via text messaging in their home language. Following completion of the playlists at home, teachers can easily access parent feedback in one place, or determine which parents they should follow up with. Once students, teachers and families have become accustomed to using the playlists and text messaging, the program will serve as a low-lift, informal way for teachers to remain in constant communication with parents regarding student learning. This process has been demonstrated to have a positive impact on students’ homework completion, engagement with schoolwork, and overall academic performance.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/los-angeles-family-playlist-program,

For our target cohort of the 40 high school and middle school students, they will complete pre, mid, and post surveys that focus on college awareness, college attainment, self esteem, and hope for their future.  Additionally, post program focus groups will be completed for all cohorts: college, high school, and middle school.  For long term success, we will analyze school wide data obtained from our schools.  We already have baseline data from previous school years from the three target schools on attendance, behavior, graduation rates, course performance, and college enrollment.  We will use this data to gauge the school wide impact on our program’s presentations and school wide initiatives.  In addition to the school baseline data we have, there is a documented need for this type of programming in Boyle Heights.

PBH expansion includes 1) C-S strategies at Roosevelt HS & Hollenbeck MS; and 2) targeted community wellness strategies. 

Next, PBH will launch a unique peer mentorship program that bridges middle school, high school, and college students by providing at-risk and high-performing students with opportunities to support and learn from one another along the education continuum.  It will be structured as follows:
A cohort of 20 students at Hollenbeck MS who are at the highest-risk for dropping out of school will receive  1:1 mentorship by a higher-performing HS student from Mendez  or Roosevelt.  Their HS mentor will provide them with peer support and motivation.  
Those same higher-performing HS students (20 total) – many of whom are good candidates for college but lack the resources and social capital to feel confident in applying – would gain confidence by providing personal and professional development to high-risk middle school students.  
The 20 High School students in this mentoring cohort would also be mentored by 10 college students who share a similar journey and background and would support them in applying for college.  College students would mentor the high school students at a ratio of 1:2. Potential partners for this project are USC, Cal State LA, UCLA, Occidental College, and Loyola Marymount University, where we have current relationships. 

Youth first identified peer mentorship as a key PBH strategy in the PBH planning in 2010 and the LA2050 project strategy was defined by youth.  Concurrently, high-performing students at Mendez High School and Roosevelt High School expressed a desire to develop their personal leadership skills and also mentor younger students in the community who are facing the same academic challenges they once faced.   In April 2016 focus groups students shared:  “I like that we would be mentored by high school students, because they can give you their perspective, since they were just there.  When you talk to adults, they don’t know how it is now.” --HMS 8th grader.  “The program is a win win.  You get to help someone, while also helping yourself by building your extracurricular activities for college, and you get helped yourself!” --MHS 12th grader. Additionally, high school and middle school students participating in the program will work as a cohort to design school wide initiatives they will lead on their campus to raise college awareness, offering opportunities for both leadership development and a wider project scope.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/collegesquad-promesa-boyle-heights-peer-mentor-program,

In 2003, First 5 Los Angeles funded Public Health Foundation Enterprises (PHFE) and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) to develop and implement the Little by Little (LBL) School Readiness Program, an intervention designed for participating WIC families.  LBL was designed to engage parents in their children’s education, create a stimulating home environment, foster early literacy skills and significantly improve school readiness for underserved children living at or below the poverty level.   The genesis of Little by Little was in understanding key health disparities that unfortunately have developed in low income communities. Research has consistently demonstrated that children born into poverty hear 30 million fewer words before they reach kindergarten than those who come from middle and higher income families. This is difference has come to be referred to as the “30 million word gap.”  
Because of this gap, children born into poorer families tend to test lower on school readiness scores than those born into higher income families, and this disparity develops before kids are even five years old. The gap continues throughout their lives, affecting high school graduation rates, job prospects, income, health and wealth.Funded by First 5 LA, LBL reached over 118,000 children and pregnant women between 2003 and 2008.  As published in the journal Pediatrics (Whaley et al., 2011), the LBL intervention was found to significantly improve children’s school readiness, and the program now continues in 10 WIC centers with seven partner agencies in Los Angeles County. Currently, LBL serves more than 70,000 children and pregnant women annually through renewed funding from First 5 LA. At a cost of approximately $52/child, LBL represents a low-cost, low-dose program that has the potential to reach hundreds of thousands of low-income children and families who often are not served by other family engagement and early literacy programs. Another unique aspect of this program is the distribution of corresponding educational handouts that WIC families receive.  These handouts inform parents about age specific child development milestones which help educate parents about their child’s growth and development.
PHFE’s Little by Little School Readiness Program would like to replicate this program in other Los Angeles County Communities. In order to do this, we must work with our local state and federal legislators/decision makers to advocate for systems change so that the long-term costs for LBL’s early literacy education is supported by public dollars either through USDA (as part of the WIC allocation),the Department of Education and/or through local public funding sources. We propose hiring a Public Policy consultant who will help create and implement a public policy/education strategy to engage legislators/stakeholders.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/little-by-little-school-readiness-program,

In the twenty-two years since, the press has published more than 400 books of poetry, fiction, and creative nonfiction by acclaimed and emerging writers. Red Hen has also established itself as a significant cultural presence in Southern California and beyond through its diverse programs: WITS, which provides free books to low-income students and places authors into underserved third through twelfth grade classrooms to conduct writing workshops; an annual series of over thirty reading events on the east and west coasts and internationally; the conferral of three literary awards to emerging writers; and publication of The Los Angeles Review, a nationally distributed literary journal that also confers four awards biannually.

In 2017, Red Hen Press will publish 26 books of poetry, fiction, and creative nonfiction by a diverse array of both established and emerging authors. Specifically, Red Hen Press will use LA2050 grant funding to:
* Copyedit each manuscript to check for compliance with the Chicago Manual of Style and proofread each book after layout to eliminate formatting errors.
* Design and lay out original covers and interiors for each book through the press’s in-house design team.
* Fulfill larger print runs for books while decreasing prices to increase literary accessibility. 
* Publicize individual books via print and online channels by sending press releases, soliciting book reviews, and bringing Red Hen authors to conferences and bookfairs to interact directly with their readers.

While high school students and health teachers in select LAUSD schools currently benefit from the live version of AMP!, many more can be reached by widening the program’s delivery system to include a digital platform. This platform includes digital content created by the UCLA Sex Squad; program manuals; sexual health resources; and step-by-step art-making activities and workshops that invite youth to engage in conversations and respond to the works created by the UCLA Sex Squad.

The unfathomable experiences of a person in interaction with the scientific and technological advances as experienced in advanced heart failure are novel to patients and their families, and unknown to health care professionals (e.g. http://ampersand.gseis.ucla.edu/federica-raia-book-on-relational-medicine-reveals-doctor-patient-collaboration-2/; http://newsroom.ucla.edu/stories/q-a:-federica-raia-and-life-with-a-new-heart ). For the last five years, Dr. Federica Raia conducted an ethnographic and participatory research study on the practice of high-tech modern medicine in collaboration with the advanced heart failure cardiologist Dr. Mario Deng, director of the UCLA Integrated Advanced Heart Failure-Mechanical Support-Heart Transplant Program. Based on ethnographic work and the analysis of recorded medical encounters following patients with their doctor encounters for two years, the authors provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the practice of high-tech modern medicine (PS More information about this book can be found in http://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/9065). What Dr. Raia discovered in her research revealed that the marvels of technology mandate the practice of Relational Medicine, i.e. the integration of body, science technology and personhood into one singular framework of practice and that this integration can mean the difference between life and death. For the thousands of heart failure patients that receive treatment at UCLA Reagan Medical Center, their often prolonged recovery can critically diminish their physical, mental and spiritual health.

The Relational Medicine Foundation aims to launch an art intervention program that allows patients – through art and creative pursuits – to keep them optimistic through their recovery. Patients spend such long periods of time in the hospital due to their Heart Disease, and providing them with an opportunity to express their emotions creatively would be invaluable to their mental and physical health to ultimately decrease the Heart Failure burden. We hope that our project will serve as a model to other medical centers. It is in our vision to support future research that will advance Heart Failure knowledge and care.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/art-from-the-heart-an-art-and-movement-therapy-program,

LA is the Entertainment Capitol of the World, consistently attracting talent from across the globe. The LA County Economic Development Corporation, in their 2012 analysis of the entertainment industry & the LA economy, noted that the entertainment industry is one of the largest & most economically significant industries in the county, & unique in its reliance on freelance talent such as actors, writers, & agents. 

Unfortunately, according to the Media, Diversity, & Social Change Initiative of USC Annenburg’s September 2016 report, women, people of color, the LGBT community, & folks with disabilities are underrepresented & often misrepresented in media. This inequality is further exacerbated because costs to enter the industry, especially professional & technical training, are significant barriers to individuals from diverse backgrounds. 

In order to diversify the entertainment industry & reach equal media representation in film, TV, & theater for the LGBT community, women, people of color, folks with disabilities, & all those living at the intersection of these identities, RSAMA will educate & empower the next generation of diverse media makers to gain employment in the creative industries. 

As a new arts establishment, RSAMA will provide free intermediate & advanced courses in the fields of acting, TV, screen & playwriting, & filmmaking to diverse, aspiring media makers. During the 8-month course, our experienced instructors will deliver a top-notch curriculum & mentor students, grooming them for their future careers. Additionally, industry professionals will teach master classes on acting, TV, screen & playwriting, & filmmaking, which will be open to the public. 

In order to empower our students to gain employment in the creative arts, RSAMA will create a pipeline to employment. We will provide students with professional headshots, opportunities to produce their own projects, representation by experienced agents at our End of Year Showcase, referrals to pro bono entertainment law services to help ink their first deals, & the promotion & community support instrumental to building & sustaining a successful career in the entertainment industry.

BDLA is a celebration of the act of drawing that encourages local organizations to plan participatory art-making events to connect community members with each other in October. BDLA, which Ryman Arts is presenting for the 7th year, will increase cultural events in LA, engagement in public gatherings, and provide a common thread for Angelenos to connect through social media. 

1.Facilitating the production of public participatory drawing events at LA County venues
Ryman Arts creates and promotes community drawing events at diverse venues such as museums, libraries, senior centers, restaurants, parks, and others. Participating in art-making and cultural activities leads to a stronger community and enhances individual development. BDLA ensures that Ryman Arts continues to educate community members on the value of community engagement, build awareness of the value of art, and increase opportunities for artistic participation among the Los Angeles public. This leads to increased public participation and appreciation of both formal/informal arts events, and impact on Los Angeles’ role as a leader in the arts. 

2.Marketing of events and online sharing of artwork 
Any organization can host an art event, with an emphasis on free or low-cost events. Ryman Arts compiles these events on TheBigDrawLA.org website, coordinates marketing, and provides additional communication about events through Ryman Arts’ social media. Each participant is encouraged to post images of his/her artwork with the hashtag #TheBigDrawLA. 

3.Assisting organizations to create public drawing events
Program support to community groups includes holding planning events for local organizations to assist them in hosting community events – specifically geared towards non-arts related organizations. With funding, Ryman Arts will be able to build event kits – canopies, carts, banners, art supplies, and additional marketing supplies –  that can be lent to partner organizations for usage in their events. 

4.Producing one large scale event for the public at Grand Park
BDLA includes Ryman Arts’ flagship event, Make Your Mark in the Park, a fun-filled, creative, afternoon that celebrates the act of drawing through free activities, led by Ryman Arts students. This event connects with local partners, including: Artist & Craftsman Supply, CicLAvia, Otis College, and Self Help Graphics. 3,000+ community members captured the spirit of art at this year’s event at Grand Park in DTLA.

SAFE has already passed statewide legislation on hit-and-run collisions (with two more bills in progress) and actively works with city officials to author statutes that will make streets safer. In addition to expanding our network of volunteers, SAFE Support will motivate those who were once victims to become agents of change, partnering with our organization to improve government responsiveness to residents’ needs for safe streets, a basic necessity in this county.

By crossing city borders that are too often divided, intersecting art forms and exposing youth to live theater, poetry, dance, and the history of LA, MERGE will create original work, build equity, and foster healing through arts education. 

We know art changes lives. We witnessed this just recently, when the Say Word poets met the 4C LAB dancers for the first time. 4C LAB’s Marissa Herrera asked them to explain to a partner “an instance where art saved your life?” The room filled with the voices of young artists opening their hearts and sharing their stories with conviction and passion. Later, Say Word’s Kat Magill explained, “If you don’t document your story before it becomes history, someone else will define your legacy.” The only sound heard were the urgent scratches of pencils on paper. 

MERGE will continue this work, bringing together 25 young adults, ages 14-24, over the course of 14 weeks. They will examine the landscape of LA freeways, from the 405 to the 57, exploring the communities torn and formed by their formation, understanding the local history alongside their own personal narratives of identity, and defining their civic and artistic role in the greater LA community. Informing their work will be field trips, guest speakers, and professional performances. Using a framework of artistic development, peer mentorship, and community activism, we will engage participants in a collaboration of movement and verse that digs deep to give voice to merging narratives, culminating in a public performance of original work. 

Studies have shown: young people who receive arts instruction in high school are 55% more likely to attend college and 29% more likely to earn a 4-year degree (Arts Education and Positive Youth Development, Elpus, 2013). They perform better at school, show significant gains in self-confidence, tolerance and persistence and are more likely to obtain employment (The Arts and Achievement in At-Risk Youth, Findings from Four Longitudinal Studies, National Endowment of the Arts, 2012).

Our work echoes that data. 100% of teachers working with Say Word see improvement in students’ social skills, teamwork, and vocabulary. 90% of participating students see a full letter grade improvement, and 90% go on to college. Of 4C LAB’s participants, all are in high school, or have graduated. Of the graduates, all are attending either a 2 or 4-year university. Nearly half have jobs in the creative or mentorship field, and the others are interested in careers in the creative economy.

By the end of the program, they will understand the content lifecycle, so that the learning does not conclude after content is created. Instead, they will understand how to test content, how to optimize it and how to relate it to future pieces.

SeedLA solves this gap by pairing LA’s most influential environmental organizations with our best and brightest young minds to collectively solve local environmental challenges. 

HIGH IMPACT PROJECTS

Over the next year, SeedLA will host 12 projects with environmental nonprofits working on local sustainability initiatives that directly support the advancement of LA 2050’s LIVE metrics. Each of our dedicated project teams will donate a total of 400 hours over a 10 week period. The best way to understand what each project will do, is to take a look at what we have already done:

- Developed marketing strategies for Prop 67 (Plastic Bag Ban) with The Surfrider Foundation.
- Planned the transition of 1,200 City of Los Angeles vehicles from gas to electric
- Created the first draft of LA’s ‘Building Resilience’ guide with the US Green Building Council

Our consultants stem from a wide range of industries and academic disciplines (Caltech Astrophysics PhDs, SpaceX Engineers, and Fox marketing analysts) to offer unique perspectives on solving LA’s toughest environmental issues. We believe our consultant diversity not only provides more valuable support to our partners but also develops sustainability ambassadors across every industry. 

TOMORROW'S ENVIRONMENTAL LEADERS

SeedLA provides an engaging volunteer opportunity for Angelenos who want to leverage their academic and industry experiences for environmental causes. Each member gets an intimate understanding about a particular environmental issue, feels a deep connection to the city of Los Angeles, and serves to make a tangible impact on his or her community.

We need leaders throughout the economy who will advocate for the LA 2050 we envision. We view SeedLA as an incubator that transforms LA’s high achieving outliers into those environmentally conscious leaders.

Audience members will have the opportunity to engage and interact with presenting artists, through intimate musical salons, talkbacks with local authors and screenwriters, live podcast recordings, readings and/or workshops presenting new works of theatre, live dance and music performances, interactive art exhibitions, film screenings in partnership with local filmmakers and more.

1) By supporting shifts in professional practice to reset the existing mindset in the elementary school setting by guiding and supporting administrators, teachers, and instructional support staff in several ways including: non-evaluative observation and planning with the staff; engagement in professional learning to ensure a common understanding of the agreed upon process and to deepen the understanding of the topic; in-class support to model, co-teach, and mentor the shift in practice; a debrief at the end of each day to engage teachers in metacognitive practice leading to growth and change. This is a 2 week cycle lasting for a total of 6 weeks.

2) We create ample opportunity for continued access, understanding, and growth by providing our schools with a gamified platform that encourages self-driven eLearning and professional Learning Networking opportunities with our partner Vignettes Learning. Access to the Path to Expertise site provides educators with webinars; access to peer reviewed research, articles, white papers; and blogs within the greater educational community. It also provides an interactive professional learning community/network of educators where points can be gained for each learning step, sources can be tagged favorite/like, and any information, learning, and insights can be shared. In addition, educators will be engaged in a system that includes to both monitoring and updating of goals, and goal achievement as related to a rubric of implementation.

3) We want to garner an opportunity for extending learning through online university credit coursework focused on Mindful Learning, Formative Assessment, and Meeting the Needs of a Mixed Ability Classroom. This coursework will provide teachers with an opportunity to earn credit/ salary points for the work they are doing within the pilot and on the Path to Expertise platform.

The pilot will be supported by action research to determine its effectiveness, personal and professional impact on educators, and the impact on school culture.

Sound Body Sound Mind (SBSM) plans to fill this void by providing recipient schools within LAUSD a state-of-the-art fitness center, SBSM Curriculum, and professional development training. This comprehensive package gives underserved students a space to transform their physical education experience, and P.E. educators new and inventive resources to implement within their class.","[""Self-sufficiency"",""Obesity"",""Resilient communities"",""Prevalence of adverse childhood experiences""]","SBSM commits its services to an array of student populations and needs that would otherwise go unnoticed in many communities. The lack of fitness resources is particularly acute in low-income and minority communities where safe outdoor play space is limited and an abundance of fast food restaurants has created the child obesity epidemic in Los Angeles. 

According to the L.A. Department of Public Health, 42 percent of our children are obese or overweight. 

Obese children have more risk factors than their normal-weight peers for what were formerly considered “adult” diseases such as cardiovascular ailments, hypertension, and Type 2 diabetes. Studies also show overweight and obese children struggle with peer-to-peer socialization and exhibit lower self-esteem overall. 

At SBSM, we believe that eliminating childhood obesity begins by filling the void in quality fitness resources at school. Since 1999, SBSM has provided over 100 underserved schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) with a comprehensive fitness program designed to promote lifelong confidence and wellbeing among adolescents. 

Each school within our program receives a state-of-the-art fitness center equipped with commercial-grade cardiovascular equipment (ellipticals, hybrid cycles, spin bikes, and arm cycles), strength training equipment (weights and strength machines), and mobile equipment such as jump ropes and agility ladders. 

In addition, each new school receives the SBSM Curriculum and professional development training. The SBSM Curriculum is an evidence-based instructional program combining circuit training, the fundamentals of movement, and methodologies for motivating students. The Curriculum provides 36 age-appropriate lessons that are structured yet flexible, and also discusses the research and theories that inform them.

Along with the tangible aspects of the SBSM program, fostering an inclusive and encouraging P.E. environment is especially important. The strength of our program lies not only in improving students' fitness, but also in beginning to change their mindset. We strive to create a sense of emotional safety in the classroom, thereby facilitating students' intrinsic motivation to exercise. Students learn that exercise is fun, and that they can succeed in maintaining physical fitness for the rest of their lives.

Furthermore, students can incorporate these lessons outside of school, thus enabling them to independently combat the growing issue of childhood obesity and lowering their risk factors for Type 2 diabetes and heart disease. 

Along with health risk factors, LAUSD is in critical need of exercise resources, with Physical Education budgets averaging only $500 per school. LAUSD schools are rarely able to compensate for recreational and fitness resources their neighborhoods lack. With implementation of our program model, SBSM can provide LAUSD with an impactful solution.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/fighting-child-obesity-through-the-transformation-of-physical-education-in-los-angeles,

Traditional approaches to social services do not authentically connect & engage residents. Social service experts, practitioners and institutions design services & programs without the voices or lived experiences of real people. Evidence-based, best-practice models designed by people who do not live in the neighborhood lead to ineffective programs & services. Honoring the gifts, talents & capacity of residents allows them to be active agents of change.

The problem of resident disempowerment & disengagement is widely recognized & there have been a number of attempts to solve it. However, existing initiatives to engage residents consists of focus groups or token representation on a variety of committees. 

The solution: go connect directly with residents & co-create programs, strategies & initiatives that are resident-led. SBCC will achieve the goal of authentic resident participation through three strategies: Relationship-Based Community Organizing, Resident Co-creation & Resident-Driven Civic Engagement. 

The first strategy is Relationship-Based Organizing (RBO). RBO’s approach is rooted in an asset-based perspective, focused on harnessing the skills & talents of residents. 10,000 residents have participated in neighborhood groups. This strategy includes SBCC’s network of Neighborhood Action Councils & Community Connection Groups— which connect residents through their talents, passions & the implementation of neighborhood projects. These social networks form the foundation for the other two strategies SBCC will utilize. 


The second strategy is Resident Co-creation. Co-creation is an emerging approach to social innovation built on the Human Centered Design (HCD) movement built on the core value that the end user of any product, service or system should be empowered to create effective solutions. Co-creation in the social sector takes these core principles further and brings the best practices of HCD—end user research, systems, ideation and prototyping—directly to residents, empowering them to create solutions that reflect their lived reality.

The third strategy is Resident-Driven Civic Engagement. This strategy empowers community residents to act in ways that address social issues in their neighborhoods such as public safety, voter registration & neighborhood revitalization. This strategy allows residents to hold local officials and institutions accountable. In practice, this strategy is the neighborhood-based iHeart campaigns currently deployed across Los Angeles County in : Wilmington, Carson, Hawthorne, the Antelope Valley, Compton, East LA, Watts, & San Fernando Valley. 

In mobilizing these 3 strategies, Co/Lab will empower Angelenos across the county to be effective change agents. By placing Angelenos at the center of the solution design process, Co/Lab’s  approach will make LA a premier place to connect & live.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/co-lab-co-llaboration-resident-driven-co-created-social-change,

By fostering a culture of connectivity within and outside of the nonprofit sector, LA can build its reputation of interconnectedness that best serves the residents of our city. This program will encourage new connections among nonprofit leaders to provide the social and emotional support they need in their high-stress roles through peer support programming, and expand their access to others in the social sector, not just the nonprofit world, who are working to make positive change in new and innovative ways.  We aim to expose leaders to new ways of sharing resources and ideas that can benefit everyone they serve.   The result is an increased positive and long-term impact that each organization can make in our community.
SPARK!: Convene-Connect-Collaborate is a two pronged program: First, we will bring together nonprofit leaders and innovative thinkers and doers from other sectors by hosting three large events.  We will invite nonprofit leaders to participate by accessing our vast network of nonprofit partners. They will in turn invite someone they think is doing interesting work – either from the nonprofit, corporate or public sector.  The events will be designed as a forum to connect: sharing ideas for creating social change, triggering new thinking and perspectives, and encouraging continued collaboration among the leaders. CNM will facilitate these three interactive events over the course of 9 months, leading participants through the strategies, methods, and practical tools for effective and productive community partnerships. 
For the second prong, CNM will build upon the connections that were made during the large scale events and incubate new cross-sectoral partnerships.  By incubating new ideas and providing an environment for people to talk on a regular basis, we will promote long lasting partnerships that ultimately serve to improve services for those in need across LA.   Small groups of participants will commit to meeting every other week and each group will set the agenda for the calls.  CNM will facilitate these meetings and ensure that participants are getting the peer support and follow through that they need to be successful.

Yet every problem has inspiring, innovative individuals and organizations working to solve it.

KPCC’s #MeetSoCal will help further that important work and make LA the best place to CONNECT by promoting more robust, inclusive civic dialogue in communities throughout LA County. Ultimately, we aim to help Angelenos feel better connected to their neighbors, their communities, KPCC, and Los Angeles.

Our engagement and live events platform, KPCC In Person, is a crucial part of our public service mission. Since 2010, KPCC has produced over 500 events attracting more than 60,000 people. Our events explore timely civic and cultural issues with experts, advocates, policymakers, community leaders, and artists and create opportunities for community members to speak out, interact, and feel connected. Through our mobile recording booth “Big Mic” and signups for our Public Insight Network (a community reporting tool to find sources and gather data), we also use events to gather input, perspectives, and voices to inform our coverage. Recent examples include our live broadcast from Watts on the 50th anniversary of the 1965 civil unrest and our #WhyIVoted party on primary election day at Downtown LA’s La Plaza de Cultura y Artes.

After we pilot 2-4 #MeetSoCal events in early 2017, LA2050 funding will enable KPCC to launch the post-pilot phase in Spring 2017 with 4-6 events in LA County communities, emphasizing those underserved by and underrepresented in public media. The format of each event will be designed to best fit the particular community and venue. Our goal will be a fun, entertaining, thought-provoking, and connection-building experience uniquely tailored to the community’s character and needs.

Community input and insights gathered at each event will inform KPCC’s coverage to help us better reflect and serve our region. We will live tweet events (and encourage audience members to do the same) to further broaden the conversation. If the event format is appropriate and lends itself to audio or visuals, portions may be edited and distributed on one or more of KPCC’s content platforms. Overall, social media and the Public Insight Network will ensure that the #MeetSoCal events are just a beginning of ongoing conversations with the communities we visit.

- ready: academically, socially, and emotionally prepared to navigate high school

We’ve established a data-sharing agreement with our partner schools to monitor the three warning signs of disengagement -- grades, attendance, and behavior -- as well as graduation. Spark also tracks the development of key skills and mindsets that set students up for success, including teamwork, positive attitude, and other social/emotional competencies.

That makes middle school a critical transition, when as many as 60% of students become chronically disengaged, seeing no clear link between what they learn in school and what they see around them in the “real world.”

Spark forges that link. We believe that every student deserves to be engaged in their education and inspired to succeed in high school and beyond. So we target 7th and 8th graders from underserved communities who display early warning signs of disengagement and connect them to a powerful combination of mentoring, project-based learning, and a tailored academic curriculum.

We start by matching students with mentors at leading companies to explore new career opportunities through hands-on workplace mentorships. Their weekly visits culminate in a capstone project, driven by the student’s interests and the mentor’s expertise, like developing a videogame at a tech company. Back at school, students participate in Leadership Class, which reinforces these classroom-career connections and develops eight key life skills. Finally, Spark just launched our High School Transition initiative, supporting students and families through the high school selection and application process, with 300 8th graders at Bethune Middle School.

Mayra, a Bethune graduate, says that without Spark “I wouldn't be able to see myself actually going to college. For me to have somebody in the role that I want to become… it gives you the guidelines in where you want to go with your life.” With her mentor Perry Wallack, co-founder and former CFO of Cornerstone OnDemand, Mayra explored potential careers in business and planned her academic and professional path to get there. 

In her mentor’s view, the greatest impact may have been on her public speaking skills: “The ability to stand up in front of a group of people and convey a message,” says Perry, “that started with Mayra not having the confidence and the composure that you see today.” Ultimately, 83% of students meet or exceed expectations on skills like communication, 91% improve their school performance and 92% have graduated on time or are on track to do so.

Spark is also making LA the best place to connect by providing local companies with a turn-key corporate volunteerism program -- literally delivering mentorship opportunities right to their office doors. Spark has a noticeable effect on employee engagement, with 71% of mentors saying our program increased their job satisfaction and 97% saying they’re proud their employer partners with Spark. The impact goes beyond students and mentors to the company itself: “It’s energizing and it’s cool,” says Perry Wallack. “It will help your company hire. It will absolutely help you retain.'",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/spark-la-youth-mentorships,

People: Community Engagement
Community engagement is the number of people that join, be a part of, and contribute to our community.  We will also track organic growth in membership outside our targeted LA communities.
Measurements include: number of registered users, number of active users on a daily/weekly/monthly basis, the variety of GrowCycles used, and the number of farm/garden locations in the community, etc.

Plants: GrowCycles (GC)
We will begin the community with 10 initial GCs, and measure the use and comments we receive on each. We will also engage the community in the modification of existing GCs and in the creation of new ones.
Key measurements will include: the number of GCs, comments on GCs, number of GCs completed or abandoned, etc.

Product: Plantaware online and mobile community
Online community will begin with a minimal product, containing limited features that will grow over time through dialog with users. Use of agile development will allow us to prioritize community needs. Initial features include: membership, GC activation, and comment threads.
Measurements used on product development are use-case growth, backlog expansion, and the ability to integrate new features to address community needs.

Many, no matter where they come from, are interested in urban farming as a way to make LA more self sufficient, sustainable, beautiful, and connected.

Plantaware is a web and mobile social community space for people interested in gardening and urban farming. It offers the tools for people to interact with each other, share their knowledge and “home grown” product, as well as receive personalized,  hyper-local information about the plants they want to grow.

Of the 3+ million LA households, over 1 million have shown interest in food gardening. Still, only a few actually do so. There are many who would like to, but do not know how or where to begin. We look to fill this space and become that social community and knowledge place for “All-Things-Plants”. 

Our vision is to have LA become a garden of food and beauty. Our mission is to connect people, and to offer anyone who is interested, the personalized hyper local knowledge and tools to grow any plant successfully.
 
A key innovative concept developed by Plantaware for its community is the GrowCycle. GrowCycles serves as a framework for knowledge that is time and place dependent as well as the hub for communicating instructional data-sets in a fun and engaging way. The GrowCycle provides all the information necessary for tracking a plant’s life cycle and configures itself for the plant’s local environment incorporating real-time data from weather and other public services.

GrowCycles generate weekly garden instructions, with tips, suggestions, and to-dos, specifically tailored to a given garden and plant.  They include:
tips about sustainable gardening methods that won't deplete your wallet,
suggestions about what will grow well in your garden, and
GrowCycle generated to-do lists to remind you of things to look after in your garden that are delivered as text, videos and pictures to communicate the relevant information.  
The GrowCycle is the hub of personalized information and its delivery to our members. In our context, personalized information is the intersection of plant, place, method, and real-time data.

We plan to begin our online community in LA and the San Gabriel Valley. We are truly hands on, so we plan to go door to door and invite residents of these communities to join. Our experience suggests that almost 25% of residents, have tried their hand in food growing, and did not continue on the path for lack of information and support. 
We assembled a team of engineers and business people with extended background in urban farming and online community building. Our work showed us that  it’s not about technology but about connecting people and knowledge.

Plantaware will bring together and aggregates all people who are interested in urban gardening and farming in Los Angeles, its neighborhoods and communities.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/a-digital-green-thumb-for-the-urban-scape,

Our 360-degree program provides students attending a public university the type of support that many students attending a private university receive, including internships, mentors, scholarships, career panels, access to and networking opportunities with business and technology executives and hiring managers. STEM Advantage aims to level the playing field for young women and underserved communities attending the California State University system. In 2012 we launched our program at CSU Dominguez Hills.

STEM Advantage makes LA a greater place to learn as we mentor, prepare and inspire STEM talent. We want businesses to think of Los Angeles as a hub for STEM talent and a reason to keep/locate their businesses in LA! Focus areas:

1) Grow flagship STEM Advantage Scholars program at CSU Dominguez Hills, CSU LA and CSU Northridge. Expand to CSU Long Beach and Cal Poly Pomona. Scholars say the program is “life changing” as it provides opportunities they never thought possible and builds their confidence. Most receive job offers over $55,000.
  
2) Provide mentors to STEM students at CSU campuses beginning their Freshmen year to increase retention, especially of women, African American and Latino students, in a STEM major. Fewer than 50% of students who enter college intending to major in a STEM field complete a STEM degree; the majority switch to non-STEM majors during their first two years of study. By increasing retention we can have a significant impact on the number of STEM graduates and develop a diverse skilled workforce. Plus we build a talent pipeline to participate in the flagship STEM Advantage Scholars program.   

3) Galvanize STEM Advantage Scholars and Alumni to “pay it forward” as role models and mentors to excite young people, especially girls and minorities, that STEM is cool and encourage and inspire them to pursue their dreams. We can have an exponential impact on diverse STEM talent as we build pathways with programs that focus on K-12. Many STEM Advantage Scholars are women and students of color.

- Signing a lease for a 40 pod location, and building the pods and community space.

- Seeking gift-in-kind sponsors for ongoing supplies.

  — Signing partnership agreements with nonprofits regarding daily operations and staffing.

Long term success involves evaluating:

Each youth pays a nominal fee and must either have or be actively seeking a job.","[""Housing affordability"",""Self-sufficiency"",""Resilient communities"",""Homelessness""]","If LA wants to be the best place to LIVE, we need to offer more places to live. One solution to LA's homeless crisis is to build creative communities using vacant buildings and 'pods' as adaptive re-use of small spaces.

Pods utilize vertical height and cubic airspace to comfortably host up to 4X more people than traditional bedrooms. The PodShare team has developed and tested our co-living model since 2012, housing over 6,500 guests across three locations at a 94% occupancy rate.

We found that our pods appeal to millennials who are traveling or moving to the city and need an affordable place to stay while apartment and job hunting. 87% check in solo, and almost everyone meets new friends.

This grant can help develop an innovative solution to a city-wide obstacle by applying the PodShare model to homeless youth, which closely mirror our demographic.

Sharing saves money and serves many. PodShare comfortably built 10 pods in 1,000 sq ft and 18 pods in 2,000 sq ft with space allotted for co-working, a kitchen, restrooms, game room, computers, bicycles, and laundry. PodShare is seeking a leasable 4,000 sq ft property to build 40 pods with shared amenities.

Bunk beds are for kids, pods are for adults. Our model cured the rickety top bunk problem and replaced the ladder with a comfortable stairway. Incorporating technology and minimalist design, each pod has its own TV, light, outlets and storage. 

Co-living is transparent. We believe that if community was a shape, it'd be a circle; and so, the pods face each other. Each 'Podestrian' can see every one, with their name written above or below their head. “Within the realm of social psychology, the proximity principle accounts for the tendency for individuals to form interpersonal relations with those who are close by.” Whether serendipitously or as a product of intentional community, identification creates a natural introduction to fast friends.

The open floor plan offers maximum social collisions, but also cultivates accountability and self-policing to prevent any inappropriate behavior. You can read community stories at http://thepodshare.com/podestrians.

All of our locations promote the collaborative trend with access to a 'maker's lab' comprised of amenities like a sound recording booth, green screen, and computers. The proposed location will allot space for content creators and encourage collaboration.

Getting 40 youths off the street and into a supportive community is a start, but our program will also implement a hospitality training course to create viable applicants for PodShare and other hotel partners.

We have met with local nonprofits and community leaders, and the consensus is that it best serves the client to charge a nominal fee (likely on a sliding scale) so that the youth develop responsible fiscal habits. Fees can be offset through government subsidies, private donations, and possibly even housing vouchers.  The goal is to create authorship and autonomy.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/building-a-co-living-community-for-las-homeless-youth,

Revitalization of the city center is crucial to promoting diverse, cross-cultural collaboration. We believe that by providing a space for all Angelenos to connect and engage around independent storytelling, we can help make our city better. 

Sundance NEXT FEST goes beyond a traditional film festival format by pairing highly anticipated films from the Sundance Film Festival with live performance, music, panels, and comedy. Presented in August 2017 at the historic United Artists Theatre at Ace Hotel in downtown Los Angeles, NEXT FEST annually reaches audiences of up to 10,000 with seven L.A. premiere film screenings over the course of three days. NEXT FEST offers unexpected juxtapositions. For example, in 2016, following the premiere of Chad Hartigan’s “Morris from America,” Sundance partnered with community youth organizations 826LA, Inner-City Arts, and Venice Arts to showcase the artistry of some of Los Angeles’ most talented youth in a talent show hosted by “Morris” star, comedian Craig Robinson.

NEXT DOOR provides an open community gathering space in the parking lot next to the Ace Hotel, where our audiences and the general public can meet over food, drink, entertainment and games. Visitors to NEXT DOOR can screen print their own NEXT FEST tote bags, play lawn and table games, and participate in a variety of activities designed to connect them to the larger NEXT FEST community via social media.

A 2009 National Endowment for the Arts study found that American adults who attend art museums, art galleries, or live arts performances are far more likely than non-attendees to vote, volunteer, or take part in community events. We believe that cultural engagement and access to independent storytelling can engender empathy, spark creativity, and promote understanding. Sundance aims to increase Angelenos’ access to cultural events by implementing a new community ticket initiative reserving 20% of NEXT FEST tickets to be distributed free-of-charge to community organizations that serve LA County residents. By centering NEXT FEST in the historic core of downtown Los Angeles, we hope to reach as many LA residents as possible. As we approach the program’s fifth summer, we are eager to build on NEXT FEST’s track record of reaching young, diverse audiences. 

The Los Angeles Times noted that NEXT FEST “has become a Los Angeles summer fixture.” Over the past four years we have worked with dozens of Los Angeles organizations including BAFTA, CalArts, Ghetto Film School, Homeboy Industries, and The East Los Angeles Society of Film and Arts to find ways to collaborate during NEXT FEST and year-round.

We believe that the ocean, a healing resource, should be accessible to all. Unfortunately, most low-income communities in Los Angeles County are cut off from ocean access through lack of transportation. It is our mission to connect youth growing up in urban areas with the ocean in a way that is empowering, playful, and safe.  Surf Bus Foundation was honored by the Justice Department in 2012 for our work with at-risk youth.  Apparently a trip to the beach improves internal security of our country (gang prevention!  The time children spend with us is time free from the pressure of gang recruitment).

The Surf Bus Foundation was founded as an urban outreach program in response to the drowning of Theresa Robertson, a twelve-year old girl from South Los Angeles, who was caught in a rip current in Manhattan Beach. She came to the beach to play and was caught unaware and uneducated about the great power of the sea.  There continues to be a public health and education crisis for youth that engage in open water settings, especially ocean rip currents. Statistics from the CDC show that youth of color drown at higher rates than their Caucasian counterparts, most likely because they grow up without the same open-water awareness, experience, and education as youth residing in coastal communities. 

We wholeheartedly believe in the healing power of the ocean. Children live in a physical world of exploration and the ocean environment is kinetic in nature.  The energy of the sea has a calming and centering effect on all those who enter and we believe this connection directly benefits Los Angeles County.  Our past work has far-reaching therapeutic benefit for youth with trauma pasts, mental health challenges, or autism. It seems that the sea of life on land for these youth has rip currents of depression and danger. The marine environment, ocean immersion, and the direct engagement of surfing waves (whether on a surf board, body board, or body surfing) offers therapeutic intervention similar to that of equine therapies which are now embraced as transformative for trauma survivors.  The shifts in life-outlook through successfully engaging turbulent waves of the sea are transferable to negotiating turbulent seas on land – at home and in school.

Surf Bus Foundation is applying for the LA2050: PLAY grant because our love for this city and its coastline are central to the work we have done with youth since 2003. Our educational programming leverages our deep roots in the community.  We cultivate fondness for the sea through teaching youth about how human actions are negatively impacting our local and global ocean environments. Our ocean safety education is empowering. We teach youth how they can make a difference by becoming ocean stewards, starting in their own communities, and thereby protecting the Santa Monica Bay for all to enjoy.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/theraputic-ocean-engagement-surfing-t-o-e-s-as-in-on-the-nose!,

Since its inception in 2014, SCVAP, with a basic staff of two and a handful of volunteers, has held over 70 pop-up adventure events in the LA area and has been actively developing Eureka Villa, a 2-acre nature park where kids build with hard materials, use tools, and develop the space long term. Through our existing efforts we estimate that we’ve served over 1,000 families, and are eager to expand our reach.   

Adventure playgrounds (AP’s) and playwork, although relatively new to the US, have a long and vibrant history of protecting the rights of children to claim space in their communities as their own.  Although many older generations played freely in abandoned lots or empty spaces, LA kids’ activities are structured more than ever and available play options, if they exist, largely consist of manufactured playgrounds focusing only on locomotor play.  AP’s are staffed with Playworkers who are trained to keep the kids safe while interfering with the play as little as possible.  This allows kids to play under self direction, enhancing problem solving, social and emotional skills, and confidence in one’s own life interests and choices.  

Our first initiative, expanding our pop-up AP events, increases no-cost options and extends our reach into more communities in LA especially those with little play opportunities. Using supplies such as boxes, containers, fabric, etc., the kids create their own play space.  They are unrestricted by income, age, location, learning style or disability.  Neighbors both young and old come together at our AP’s creating fun community building opportunities. This play can also continue beyond the event!  Our playworkers role model various AP practices for parents, educators and caregivers to implement in the home or anywhere using materials we may otherwise throw away or recycle.  

Our second initiative, opening Eureka Villa Adventure Playground (EVAP), offers L.A. County its first  permanent adventure play experience.  EVAP will be staffed by playworkers to encourage kids to explore their environment, use tools to build, take down, re-build and manipulate the space however they want.   At EVAP kids connect with nature by using its natural elements to facilitate their needs, hang out with friends, or find quiet repose from their busy lives.  In order to open EVAP to the public, we need to replace fencing, add storage, and prepare accommodations for more visitors to maintain regular hours.

SCVAP’s initiatives fit the needs of any LA community, are any size, for any age and cultivate quality space for kids to play on their terms.

These road and sidewalk overpasses are strewn throughout Los Angeles -- which provides ample opportunities for researching and selecting sites that are closest to heavily populated areas -- within walking distances to dense urban environments. A priority will be to first build the parklets in park poor communities.

Given the lack of land available to build parks and plazas in urban Los Angeles; I feel this is a good solution for creating more park space in Los Angeles by 2050. There are tons of these overpasses throughout Los Angeles that people just pass through; what if these overpasses instead become places -- places where people can connect and idle whilst viewing and learning about L.A.'s urban waterway system -- seeing both the complexity and beauty in its natural elements and its engineered elements.

These overpass parklets would be different than the current parklet model seen across the U.S.; different as they will be grade separated (above curbs and on the outside edges of sidewalks) from traffic -- making them much safer than parking spot parklets -- where the risk of cars running into parking spot parklets is high.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/jutout-parklets,

It has been cited time and again that a lack of home cooked meals with fresh foods is a contributor to obesity. It is also known that high need areas are often without options to purchase fresh ingredients for recipes. There are 11 areas in L.A. County with childhood obesity rates at 30% or higher and these are the areas we are going to target.  Culinary Skills in a Box addresses both contributing factors: access to healthy foods and the childhood obesity epidemic.

Culinary skills for a child enriches a culture of health by arming children with an arsenal of healthy habits to take with them into adulthood. Hard to source ingredients from a corner market? Not to worry, the ingredients for three healthy recipes per month are delivered too.

How does it work?
Delivered straight to the doorstep, monthly, is a box containing everything an adult needs to institute a program to teach culinary skills to children, motivate them and be comfortable doing so.  Each monthly kit includes 3 illustrated recipe guides, 3 culinary skill cards, a creative kitchen project, kid friendly kitchen tools, online bonuses and lesson plans.  Don’t forget the aprons children get to wear while they are cooking and a magnet to congratulate them for a task well done. The ingredients for the recipes included in the box will also be delivered.

Why In Home Child Care? 
The impact is greater and long lasting. We will pilot this with 50 child care providers participating in the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) who have 6 full-time children.  We can reach 300 children with introductions to kitchen skills and healthy fresh foods, taking home what they’ve learned through provider/parent/child interaction.  After participation in the project providers will be comfortable with new skills and recipes that they can introduce to families who join their care for years to come.

After the successful pilot, we can take this to other providers in L.A. county and potentially reach the more than 78,000 children in licensed in home child care.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/culinary-skills-in-a-box-giving-children-in-child-care-the-tools-to-establish-healthy-habits,

Teach For America-Los Angeles supports our teachers through teacher coaches, weekend workshops and seminars and most recently, trauma-informed practices. We believe trauma-informed and culturally responsive teaching lead to more effective instruction aimed at meeting the needs of students.

Research consistently shows that providing high-quality and empathetic teachers to students and communities that need them the most can fundamentally address the education opportunity gap, and have a long-lasting impact on a child’s trajectory in school and in life. Students enrolled in low‐income schools are more likely to experience sustained trauma, which has short and long‐term implications in regards to their mental and physical well‐being and future success.  Studies demonstrate that chronic stress can change the chemical and physical structures of the brain, leading to severe challenges in schools.

Recognizing the need to equip our teachers with the skills to help their students overcome the trauma of poverty and other systemic issues, we became one of the first Teach For America regions to launch our Trauma-Informed Teaching Initiative as a pilot in our teachers’ professional development in 2015. On average, our first and second year teachers, who we call corps members, receive approximately 31 hours of individualized coaching, grounded in our research-based framework “Teaching As Leadership,” per year. Our professional development enhances our corps members’ learning by providing more than 92 hours of targeted professional development each year, including Trauma-Informed Workshops.

Our Trauma-Informed Teaching Initiative benefits corps members and students. Corps members are provided with mindfulness tools of their own, such as knowing when and how to self-regulate their emotions and psychobiological responses to the stress that comes from working in high-need school environments. If teachers better self‐regulate their own emotional triggers, they will be more aware of and able to support students. This in turn allows teachers to apply trauma‐informed practices with their students, leading students to self‐regulate and attend to their own emotional needs.

While educators cannot remove stress triggers from students’ environment, our trauma‐informed professional development will enable them to provide their students with coping mechanisms to better deal with the stress, allowing students to focus on learning. As part of the initiative, we also provide optional process groups for corps members through a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist (LMFT). The initiative has led to favorable feedback from teachers and positive results in the classroom.

One basic readiness unit consists of 100 registered TR volunteers, 25 of which are deployable, 8 of which have completed Tools, Tactics and Techniques Training, and 3 of which have completed Command and General staff training.  The Basic Readiness Standard is not intended to be able to meet the response needs of an overwhelming event in LA, but rather contribute to small-scale operations and plan and execute impactful projects. 

An Advanced Readiness Standard is achieved when TR's volunteer density in a city regressively scales to approximately one BRU per 100K residents.  At an Advanced Readiness Level, Team Rubicon is capable of delivering meaningful assistance to the municipality during Type 1 and 2 level responses.  For Los Angeles, that would require 22 BRUs.","[""Money "",""Volunteers"",""Advisors/board members"",""Publicity/awareness"",""Network/relationship support""]","Spending money on resiliency and readiness saves money.  An organized, trained and equipped Team Rubicon will help stabilize LA once disaster hits, allowing municipal and emergency services to perform core functions enabling them to focus on getting residents back to normal life as quickly as possible.  By leveraging the skills of veterans, TR is preparing for and responding to disasters as well as providing purpose, community and identity to our nation's veteran's, easing their transition home.","[""Resilient communities""]","Cities' ability to respond to our rapidly changing climate and the changing nature, magnitude and quantity of natural disasters in general is insufficient.  People, property and local economies are being disrupted and undermined at an alarming pace, and financial resources for disaster response are stretched thin at county, state, national and charitable levels.  That said, new thinking and programming suggests that a gap between a disaster striking and the first response can be mitigated in ways that save lives, and help restore communities and economies faster in ways that save billions.

Since our founding in 2010 Team Rubicon has responded to disasters both domestic and international ranging in size from Hurricane Sandy (with more than 450 volunteers over six weeks) to a flood recovery operation in Iowa (ten volunteers for one week), and the earthquake in Nepal (60 volunteers).  Early on, Team Rubicon made the decision to become fully compliant in National Incident Management Systems (NIMS), making it fully interoperable with Federal, State and Local emergency services.  

Imagine as families scramble to save their loved ones, their property, and their livelihoods, that teams of local Angelenos who are trained in disaster response mobilize immediately to support their communities.  Imagine that work is already underway and that these local relief agents are local Los Angeles veterans.  Men and women trained for exactly this type of uncertainty and confusion from their days serving our country.  

Based on our experience during the past six years responding to over 140 disasters, Team Rubicon is launching our community resilience program which consists of veteran-led relief teams who can respond immediately to natural disaster should one strike Los Angeles; the teams will show through action, how an immediate, local response complemented eventually by external disaster support can more effectively save lives, protect property and restore economies more rapidly than traditional relief modalities; and ensure that post-disaster response work continues long after media attention and external relief agencies deploy to other crises helping to fully rebuild Los Angeles neighborhoods.  This will be achieved through the creation of a Basic Readiness Unit (BRU), a discrete capability level achieved within a single city limit.  

The Los Angeles Basic Readiness Unit is comprised of trained local community volunteers ready to intervene as a natural disaster strikes, with the number of responders calculated based on the size of Los Angeles and geographically allocated throughout the city to ensure no one is left behind as the disaster unfolds; that basic needs are met; coordinate access to leadership at national level to ensure national relief resources are deployed most effectively and efficiently when available; and ensure the ability to monitor response, recovery and rebuilding efforts in ways external agencies simply cannot mimic.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/localizing-disaster-response-to-meet-the-challenges-of-the-21st-century,

As a result, parents, coaches, and administrators will be able to better coordinate their efforts to support program initiatives.

The Advisory team then consults with the program administration and coaches them on how to use their data, network with funding sources, and advises them on how to improve their programs. 

In addition, we have been working with our community and school partners to research and  correlate the data of their programs, to student performance metrics: GPAs, attendance/truancy, graduation, and discipline data. By utilizing this data, we are empowering schools to be able to identify what programs are having the greatest impact on their students. What our initial research shows is that afterschool and athletic programs have measurable impacts on these key academic indicators. Through our data we can help direct funding (and help programs highlight their impact) to the programs that are having the greatest impact on children in Los Angeles.

Turnout in the 2016 election ranged from 0 to 7.5% participation.  Turnout at meetings is much less, and many people have not heard of them.
Instead, imagine Angelinos from all over getting on their smartphones, tablets, and PCs to connect with each other and their neighborhood councils (NC’s) to define the vision they share, identify the challenges they face, and productively work together to bring the dream to life.
In-person deliberation works! - There is a facilitator who organizes people into small diverse groups and puts a structure to the conversation that keeps it on track to a goal. 
We build on existing tools that take in-person deliberation online, and work with a representative neighborhood and NC to define and develop new features to fulfill the mission: help people engage and productively work together with their council. And we make this is available to all NC’s in LA.
We will work with the NC and you to define, prioritize and add features designed to make engagement interesting and productive, including:
- Enabling committee members to interact with the community online while maintaining compliance with the many CA regulations
- Creating a new video message based discussion format so online discussions can have a more personal and visual connection.
- Allowing NCs to link to discussions from their existing web sites and postings so all can view and participate
- Letting neighbors GPS check-in to show their authenticity online and share their stake in discussions
- Providing neighbors with notifications of updates on (and only on) the topics that interest them – to stay up to date but not overwhelmed.
- Provide Android and iPhone apps.
This project is also about outreach – to define, implement, measure, and report on programs that reach out and engage neighbors and get them involved in the neighborhood discussions that are important to them.  And not just online, we work through offline and in person means as well to reach people where they are.
You have seen that online discussions of controversial topics go badly. But with the lessons of in-person discussions these challenges can be solved:
- Trolls - start in small, diverse groups. If others find a post to be uncivil they can flag it, and vote up the better posts.
- Discussions gone wild – apply structures like pro/con, and problem/solution, side-by-side comparison, and list prioritization to keep discussion moving forward.
- Overwhelming participation - let people vote up the comments that speak for them and break large groups into many small groups and hold rounds (like march madness) so that, for example, a thousand people could find the most representative comments of a community in 4 rounds of groups of 6.

Individual:

Number of youth applying to TAP
Daily Attendance 
Baseline metrics established via evaluations (academic, physical, mental) given upon joining The Co-Op and monitored throughout
Academic proficiency and general well being
We will conduct monthly review interviews and survey our youth and staff before, during and after selected milestones to measure satisfaction with program.  As an example:  With the guidance of The Department of Social Welfare at  UCLA we evaluated the success of Camp Xavier 2016 with surveys given to campers on the first & last day of day camp & the last day of sleep-away camp. 
Community: Several studies (The Invisible Achievement Gap) have provided baseline metrics for LA’s foster youth. TAP will work with Partner Schools to establish & track key performance indicators like:  
Student attendance
Transfer rates to alternative schools
 Suspension & expulsion rates
CST scores and participation
Drop-out rates

Many foster youth fail during middle school and without support, dropout of high school.  Some don’t make it to high school at all. TAP will provide intensive support to our youth through middle school with summer and afterschool programs, so they are ‘high school ready’, performing at or above grade level, while being emotionally & behaviourally prepared when matriculating into high school.  

The Academy will pilot its afterschool program, The Co-Op in April of 2017, before launching full time in September of 2017, building on the continuing success of our summer program, Camp Xavier, extending its reach and effect.  Camp Xavier is a 2 week summer program held the last two weeks of July, focused on building trust & community within a day camp & sleep away camp.  It will be followed by The Co-Op, an exclusive after school program for the same 20 foster youth, providing enrichment, remediation, & a safe place to belong.  Supports will continue to be available to our members throughout high school.  By maintaining connected services, we will support the Student Education Pipeline, following the youth from middle to high school and beyond. 

Research has shown that keeping  school as the point of stability in a foster youth’s life, is essential in lowering dropout rates & increasing proficiency & interest in academics. Unfortunately, foster youth attend an average of  7-10  schools & can change placements 20+ times.  With the systems set up as silos, it is nearly impossible to guarantee a foster youth continued enrollment in school.  As we work to change this, TAP has taken another approach. TAP members are guaranteed a continuous, tuition free placement within The Academy Project, regardless of placement changes, through to the completion of high school. Because of the support & security TAP offers, youth can look forward to going to school and are freed to invest in their education, lowering truancy rates.
Although this is a difficult promise to keep, we will do whatever it takes to keep our youth engaged with the group they belong to.  We will work with the school & foster placements as soon as an issue arises so we can prevent placement changes in the first place.  There will also be events & field trips throughout the year where transportation is provided to all of our youth, regardless of distance of placement.    By increasing academic proficiency & making high school graduation a reality for our most vulnerable population, suspension, expulsion and dropout rates will decrease and graduation & college matriculation rates will rise. The Academy Project will provide the necessary support & motivation to give our youth the chance to own their own narratives & future successes.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/supporting-las-foster-youth-by-creating-a-dependable-community-built-on-trust-and-consistency,

This creates great opportunity but also great competition, especially for those who are young and unestablished.  It is difficult for a majority of artists to have their work seen and even more difficult to build a full-time career making art.  We think artists, and the conversations they and their work stimulate, are central to a vibrant, thoughtful community.  As such, our goal is to help shine light on emerging artists and to bring more art to Angelenos – connecting these two important constituencies.  Existing institutional channels of the art world are fundamental but leave many behind.  Our work is to help artists without access to traditional channels find outlets for their work and a leg up in their careers, and to help the residents of LA encounter art in their everyday lives.

 
The Billboard Creative (TBC) will help make LA the best place to create by:

-	helping to lift young and emerging LA artists above systemic obstacles to gaining exposure with art enthusiasts & mass audiences, as well as with members of the arts community who can help them in developing their careers.  
-	exposing tens of thousands of Angelenos to public art without requiring them to make a special effort because billboard art is part of our daily commutes. According to the companies from which we rented billboards for our 2015 show, its 33 boards made 12 million impressions.
-	inspiring budding artists, including those in the segments of our population for whom traditional art exhibitions prove inaccessible for a variety of reasons, through widespread access to innovative art. 
-	stimulating cultural conversations by bringing thought-provoking art on a massive scale to the streets of LA.
- and, showcasing the work of LA artists in a quintessentially LA medium.  Billboards are intertwined with with the city's history & culture & let the city itself serve as gallery walls.

This grant would allow us to stage a second show in 2017 focused exclusively on LA-based emerging artists.  (TBC currently mounts 1 show per year that is open to artists from around the world.) 

For the 2050 Billboard Art Show, we will open a call for submissions from LA artists.  We can accept art from all disciplines except for video art.  Works to be displayed in the show will be selected in two ways:  a curator will select approximately 25-45 works and residents of LA will vote to identify 5 “public choice” entries.  The exhibit will last one month.

New to TBC for this show will be a content feature on our website, social media streams, and app highlighting several emerging artists each week of 3 months.  This will allow us to help artists beyond those who are selected for the formal exhibition.  

We plan to bring art to as many communities of Los Angeles as possible by purchasing boards across the geography of LA and LA County.

57% of homeless teens spend at least one day every month without food and a large percentage of LGBT homeless youth are at high risk for HIV infection & substance abuse. Reaching out to them and encouraging them to seek services can be a challenge through traditional means currently available. A Youth Center that offers regularly scheduled (fun) activities like dances, movie screenings, and social mixers, is more likely to attract the attention of these teens and serve as a 'first-step' in their rehabilitation process. As we like to say, 'The fun gets them in the door, but the resources inside can save their lives!'.

We anticipate servicing as many as 2,000 youth via our signature dances alone in the Center's first year. An additional 1,000 (or more) can be serviced through workshops, incentives, and special activities. These numbers are a significant increase of our current reach and LA2050 would allow us to have a greater impact in solving the issue of homeless LGBT teens in Hollywood. 

All major events & activities at the Youth Center would partner with local service providers as a way to link youth to valuable services like transitional living, GED  programs, HIV & STD Testing, emotional support, & other social services. As we have done for over 10 years at our events, we would engage existing youth organizations in the area by offering them outreach tables, the opportunity to present workshops, distribute informational materials, and interact directly with our attendees. These partnerships are key and would serve as a centerpiece for both our work and our on-going effort to help get kids off the streets. While some organizations may already have their own youth center, ours would serve as a crossroads for all agencies and a neutral ground where we can all come together and service these teens.

In an effort to involve the surrounding community, this Youth Center would regularly reach out to local residents, schools, neighborhood councils, and community leaders. Increasing our current volunteer base from 50 to 200 affords more people the opportunity to have a stake in the overall mission and to bring something different to the table.

Computer Science careers are the fastest growing in the entire country, and African-American and Latino youth are still woefully behind in CS degree college graduation rates.According to Forbes, Computer Science is the high-paid college degree. And according to NSF.gov. less than 2.4% of college students graduate with a degree in it! 9 out of 10 K-12 schools don’t even offer computer-programming classes, according to Code.org. 

And then there’s this, from Time.com’s own Keith Wagstaff: “If technology is the future, however, we are doing a woeful job of preparing our kids for it. Computer science is the only one of the STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) fields that has actually seen a decrease in student participation over the last 20 years, from 25% of high school students to only 19%, according to a study by the National Center for Education Statistics. Take a look at the curriculum of many classes labeled “computer science” today, and you’ll find not much has changed from the days of dial-up modems. Most cover the basics: Learning how to type and use Microsoft Word and PowerPoint. “ Not encouraging!

Here is how the CLF’s #CodingIsCool Workshops will continue to advance our overall mission of transforming the lives of LA’s at-risk youth, as well as these more specific goals of our Care through College Educational Program:

 -Increase in the percentage of community college students completing a certificate, degree, or transfer-related program in six years AND  College matriculation rates: 

This is already the primary goal of the CLF’s Care through College Program, under which CIC will be operating. We are certain that CIC will only further, positively impact and greatly increase our students’ college graduation rates. ALL of our students in our Care trough College Program who have graduated high school are currently attending college (usually starting with SMC.) CIC will only maximize these metrics!

 -Youth unemployment and underemployment: Computer Science and programming, being able to build and create a killer app or computer game- this is the future career for young adults, and will impact any job or career in a positive way. (And did you know that skilled high school coders and computer engineer interns have earned over $5,000 per month?) Coding is Cool will not help them get “a” job, but get “the” job of the future in LA, if they want it. CIC will  offer them an unparalled and very competitive edge. 

 -District-wide graduation rates: Coding is Cool will exponentially amp up our students’ creativity, specific CS curiosity and STEM-based, academic skills.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/help-us-create-and-inspire-the-future-tech-leaders-of-la!,

Objective 2: By December 31, 2017 at least five EF supported teams of at least 10 members each will successfully design, build and enter projects into local regional engineer-related competitions.

Objective 3: By December 31, 2017 Engineer Factory will successfully execute an agreement with the UCLA MESA program to be its first non-school-based MESA program based in South Los Angeles.  EF will conduct due diligence to meet program training and requirements, partner wih LASC UTF to hire at least two student instructors and recruit at least 30 students to enroll in the EF MESA program.  The program will be fully operational in 2017-18 school year.

Objective 4: By December 31, 2017 the Engineer Factory will have strengthened internal capacity by achieving the following: hired at least 1.0 FTE staff; complete comprehensive strategic and fund development plan; secured Network for Good Donor Management software to support fund development activities; and completed the EF Resource website that will link students and educators to various resources.","[""Money "",""Volunteers"",""Advisors/board members"",""Staff "",""Publicity/awareness"",""Infrastructure (building/space/vehicles etc.)"",""Education/training "",""Technical infrastructure (computers etc.)"",""Community outreach "",""Network/relationship support""]","The Engineer Factory, in collaboration with the UCLA MESA Program, Los Angeles Southwest College Urban Teachers Fellowship (LASC UTF) and the Girl Scouts of Greater Los Angeles seek to spark the interest of 4th- 8th grade females and students of color in being engineers.

Historically, women, African Americans, and Latinos have been underrepresented in STEM employment. Men are employed in a STEM occupation at twice the rate of women and Blacks and Hispanics have been consistently underrepresented in STEM employment. Engineering is one of the fastest growing industries in this 21st century economy, providing high incomes and quality of life for its practitioners.  The Engineer Factory’s goal is to positively impact these disparities with early introduction to the engineer education pipeline via one-day builds for 4th-8th graders at community venues; we hope this leads to longer term projects and competitions;  and finally culminate in more structured MESA programs and elective classes offered in Inglewood, South Los Angeles and surrounding neighborhoods.

Pop-Up Community Workshops: The Engineer Factory will conduct at least twelve (12) one day project-based workshops at community sites in South LA and surrounding areas (e.g. schools, faith organizations, Girl & Boy Scouts, afterschool programs, etc.).  Participating 4-8 grade students will learn Next Generation Science Standard (NGSS) engineering concepts while building fun projects.  Examples of projects include, but are not limited to: mouse trap cars, gliders, etc.  Many of the workshops for elementary and middle school students will be led by trained high school students.  The Engineer Factory plans to have at least 500 students participate in its Pop-Up Workshops in 2017.   Since the EF launch in December 2015, 448 students have participated in our Pop-Up Community Workshops.  Pre- and post-test found that 71% had increased science knowledge as a result.

Engineer Related Competitions: Engineer firms and aerospace organizations conduct engineer-based competitions throughout the year. However, girls and students from underserved communities are underrepresented.  Competitions help students gain skills such as team work, problem-solving, engineer design, testing and modifications and the scientific process.  Pop-up workshop sites interested in deepening their investment in STEM will develop teams to enter competitions such as JPL, MATE ROV, Rubes Goldberg, etc.  Our goal is to enter at least five (5) teams in competition in 2017. EF’s ROV team won 2nd place in the regional MATE ROV contest in May 2016.

Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement (MESA): MESA provides a 40 year evidence-based track record of success.  EF will partner with UCLA to create MESA programming in neighborhoods that lack MESA schools, led by the teachers-in-training in LASC’s Urban Teacher Fellowship, a program with the goal of increasing the number of teachers of color.

LA is home to over 20 STEM-based organizations, and to hundreds of tech firms of all types and sizes.

Tech LA Cares would help facilitate connections between area STEM-based organizations with local tech companies via four distinct, interconnected initiatives:

PHASE ONE would be to work directly with the local STEM organizations to assess their needs: Are they looking for funding? Manpower? Mentors? Internships? Marketing help? Instructors? Hardware? Software? Project management tools? 

Understanding how each organization is set up to ask for, and receive, such help will be crucial in building a program that serves their needs.

Phase One would also involve working with area tech firms to understand their capabilities. Do they have a dedicated Corporate Social Responsibility team? Do they have a framework for individuals or teams to seek opportunities to volunteer their expertise? How do you make volunteerism part of a company's DNA without interrupting their pursuit of growth, no matter their size? How do you instill a sense of community service into a company's existing mission and values?

PHASE TWO would involve building out a website to reflect all this -- having a mechanism that catalogs organizations and their needs, that calendars one-off and regularly-recurring events for easy signup, that has profiles of organizations and companies, any resultant partnerships, and the fruits of their labors. The listing of local / statewide / national grant / award competitions and deadlines will also come into the fold over time.

PHASE THREE would be a springtime event to bring area tech firms and STEM organizations together in real life, to facilitate connection, to inspire action, and to give practical advice on how to run successful campaigns.

Roundtables, breakout sessions, and workbooks featuring each org's story will help turn connections into actions long after the event ends.

PHASE FOUR would be to follow up with the businesses and the orgs to monitor progress, to help strengthen any ties made at the event, and to foster long-term relations between the two worlds.

All this is a lot of work for a third party to enable, but I truly believe that an organization such as Tech LA Cares can be the training wheels for success.

Tech firms and STEM organizations are overwhelmed with their current responsibilities, but by building an entity solely dedicated to facilitating such partnerships, it will strengthen us all -- by creating opportunity for minority youth, for creating a smarter local workforce, and for creating a more DIVERSE workforce that truly reflects the international nature of LA's population.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/connecting-la-tech-companies-with-area-stem-organizations,

Low-income teenagers and young adults who have a history of in-depth arts involvement earn better grades and demonstrate higher rates of college enrollment and attainment[2].

Harmony Project provides these outcomes for children who have the greatest need and fewest resources in the poorest, most vulnerable communities by offering a safe space with supportive resources for students to grow emotionally, socially, artistically, and intellectually during afterschool and weekend hours. Our data-driven, research-based model started with only 36 students and now has an enrollment of 2,000, focused in LA’s most disadvantaged areas.

The program is provided at no cost to youth from families whose income is below 185% of federal poverty level or whose children attend schools in which at least 80% of students qualify– a guideline used by Head Start. Since 2008, of the kids who participate three or more years in the program, 97% graduated on time from high-school and went on to college. On average, our graduating seniors are with us for 7 years. 

2016’s graduates were accepted into colleges across the country, including Princeton, Georgetown, UCLA and USC. Our alumni continue to report successes that include post-graduate studies, a number of Posse Scholars, one Gates Millennium Scholar and two Fulbright Scholars. 25% of our alumni graduated from/are studying at top 50 nationally ranked schools; 36% have a 3.5 or higher college GPA.		
Our College Program informs students and their families on the reality of college costs and prepare them to arrive on campus armed with knowledge to succeed. Students who participate in the program for three years or more are eligible to apply for a College Scholarship. Through the Harmony Project Scholarship program we have awarded over $400,000 to 173 of our students – 62 additional scholarships have been awarded to 2016’s graduates. 
The majority of our students are the first in their family to pursue and attend college (67% of 2016 seniors). Further, most of them attend large public schools that lack the resources to reach and acknowledge every student in the room, let alone every students’ individual needs[3]. We aim to fill that gap for our students, preparing them for the reality of college, adulthood, and the job market.

Once students leave for college, we have summer reunions and bi-annual check-ins with alumni, flagging issues that are disrupting students’ progress. When needed, we follow up closely with students and put them in contact with additional supportive resources.

Each year we serve some 6,000 students & their families with a range of services, operating ten specialized schools on six campuses across greater LA.  Our most recent is a groundbreaking model school, STEM3 Academy, where we have developed a unique approach for educating special learners in STEM subjects, infusing advanced studies with 21st century skills of collaboration, critical thinking, creativity & communication. STEM3 fills a void that has been blocking many highly capable individuals from succeeding. 

A staggering one of every 68 children born today is diagnosed with autism. Some 6.4 million are diagnosed with ADHD; 2.4 million with learning disabilities. Countless numbers of these children across LA are underserved in STEM education, creating barriers to future jobs in high tech industries. Since opening STEM3 Academy in 2015, we have successfully transitioned tech-savvy special learners to college, but we would like to reach more.

Our proposal is to expand the reach of STEM3 through afterschool & summer camps in coding, computers, cyber security, space, animation, robotics & more. Cultivating STEM literacy through informal programs helps students build competence, apply skills & gain confidence in a relaxed environment. We know there is a need for this among our community.  STEM3 camps were piloted this summer and were embraced by children and families.  Afterschool STEM pilots underway at STEM3 high school have also been enthusiastically received, with enrollments exceeding expectations. We believe no similar STEM camps for special learners exist in any city across the nation.  LA2050 support will allow us to purchase supplies and hire part-time coordinator at San Fernando Valley and Westside of LA sites.

Academically, 34% of students on autism spectrum choose STEM majors, as opposed to 20% in general population. These students often have heightened pattern recognition and can focus for extended periods, traits helpful in engineering, coding, or any of the sciences. However, because most STEM programs are not designed to accommodate diverse learners, they inadvertently exclude them. Highly capable special learners often drop out of college due to poor 21st century skills and fail to live up to their promise. Studies show some 85% are either underemployed or unemployed as young adults. This signals lost opportunity for individuals and a drain on society as unemployed seek public aid; it also represents a rich, untapped resource for our city. 

The Help Group’s STEM3 Academy signals a revolution in the way special leaners are educated, but also in the way they think about themselves, their futures and their roles in society.

The stage will be set for youth participants to serve as volunteers and leaders in their communities over the course of a lifetime.

Fostering strong communities is vital to making LA one of the best places to live, work, and play by 2050 and rates of volunteerism are key to measure local investment in communities. R&S will engage school administrators, educators, and youth during and after school hours to develop a culture of service. Peer groups will be established that serve as strong social networks and result in increased social and emotional support from peers and community members. Projects will culminate in celebration of service events that convene the community to honor the volunteers and create an increased “sense of place” for young Angelenos. 

LA educators will have access to an online professional development course in the R&S methodology. The course empowers educators to guide a youth group through the process of mapping communities using pen and paper or high tech mapping tools (e.g., Esri ArcGIS and Google MyMaps), identifying local issues through the mapping process, strategizing a plan of action, and implementing a service campaign. The curriculum, developed in collaboration with the Pearson Foundation, a global leader learning company, supports academic learning and development of critical thinking and interpersonal skills. It is Common Core compliant and fulfills 21st Century Learning Skills. It is expected that educators from at least 25 schools will complete the course and guide 750 students through service campaigns.

On campaign completion, each school will hold a celebration of service to convene participants with peers, families, educators, and community members to honor their hard work. At year end, R&S will hold a citywide celebration of service event to convene youth and their educators as well as representatives from community organizations and local government.  

In the first quarter, R&S will work with educators to identify and recruit five students to serve on the National Youth Leadership Council (NYLC). These students, who model and inspire civic responsibility in their peers, will receive access to a national network of peers, benefit from training in topics such as community mapping, campaign planning, and fundraising, and attend a national summit of their peers. They will lead the process of implementing the citywide celebration of service and engage their peers via school visits and webinars year round.

•Raised test scores 
•Increased student compassion

•The number of students raising their grade-level reading

Teachers observe that an average of 72% of their students showed increased concern for others during and after our program. A 4th grade teacher in Central L.A. reported that students “became more aware of various causes and thought of ways they could help in the world.” An East L.A. 5th grade teacher noted that “My students became conscious about how they treat each other. They refrained from teasing and calling each other funny names. They learned how to respect people.”","[""Money "",""Volunteers"",""Advisors/board members"",""Publicity/awareness"",""Network/relationship support""]","We will bring our Reading Makes A Difference program to 5 low-income elementary schools to develop a love of reading and kindness through read-a-thons benefiting ill kids.

The RMD program–with “The Jester Has Lost His Jingle” as its inspiration–is the catalyst for this empowering experience.Students read in free time not to gain anything for themselves but to help sick kids. Students fall in love with the story of a banished Jester on a quest to rediscover laughter, only to find it in the heart of a little girl in the hospital.They realize how much the book & doll will help real kids, and the world changes for them. 
When young children are introduced to giving back, they make more positive choices. Instead of going down the wrong path,they find fulfillment helping others. Schools are likely to see truancy & suspension rates go down, as graduation rates rise and students stay in the education pipeline.
When their school supports a charitable venture that changes lives around them, the experience transforms students’ own lives. “The outreach component of your program motivated many of our students to perform community service,” said one of many principals. “Your program provides a wonderful catalyst for understanding the importance of giving of ourselves to help others.” We have worked closely with educators in 170 Title I schools, motivating 104,769 students to read 36,110,952 pages. 
Our plan is to build systemic change through the children we inspire. We address the high percentage of illiteracy among low-income elementary students, most of whom do not perform well on standardized tests. In L.A., 54% of 4th graders eligible for free lunch read at a level considered “below basic.”  Among Latino students, 56% read below basic compared to 16% of Caucasian students. Children who suffer failure in the classroom lose interest in school at an early age, a predictor of dropping out of high school. A N.Y. Times report on an NEA study reinforces the importance of reading for pleasure on student achievement: “The data showed that students who read for fun nearly every day performed better on reading tests than those who reported reading never or hardly at all.”
Students also become personally engaged in helping others with our program. A 5th grader at Vermont Elementary in an RMD program funded by USC’s Good Neighbors Campaign decided that she and fellow Tigers should add to the “Jester” books & dolls generated by student reading for Children’s Hospital. Although most Vermont students receive free lunch, they rallied to collect loose change to help even more CHLA patients. When the principal announced at the Recognition Assembly that students raised $330, the CHLA Trauma Program Manager’s eyes filled with tears. “You all have such good hearts,” she told students who were waving hand-made Pharleys. “This is such a beautiful thing to do.

As a nonpartisan platform, our goal is not to push a particular political agenda. Rather, we aim to get as many people involved in their community as possible and give them the tools to improve their city. Although it is difficult to measure civic engagement on the local level, there are a number of reliable indicators we will consult, such as voter turnout, the instances of locally driven campaigns and petitions, and the prevalence of community oriented discussions around public issues.

After meeting with dozens of local organizations, neighborhood councils, and community leaders, we realized that the central problem facing local civic engagement is how widespread and disconnected our communities are. The online hyperconnectivity that defines our relationships with our friends, family, and even our work life is noticeably absent when it comes to local civic involvement. In fact, there is no easy way for a community to share information and take action over local issues.

In response we created The Burg, a digital public square built exclusively for your community. The Burg is an online and mobile based platform that brings together the different elements of civic engagement on a single platform, from local discussions and citizen driven projects, to information about upcoming policy and city planning.

Residents submit posts which are then seen, discussed, and upvoted or downvoted by the community. In this way the most pressing and important issues are brought to the forefront for everyone to see and interact with. Community members will have the option of making different types of posts, including simple text posts as well as more complex options such as petitions, campaigns, videos, polls, and projects.

The Burg will also connect communities with their elected leadership and government organizations. Elected officials and publically funded offices such as LAPD, LAFD, Neighborhood Council and City Council will have unique verified pages to inform and communicate with their Burg. From these pages they can make public posts as well as solicit feedback on certain issues through polls and direct Q&A’s posts.  

When a new user wants to join The Burg they will need to either prove they are a registered voter, or register to vote online, right then and there.  We also provide an option to join The Burg for those unable to register to vote. We have collaborated with the nonprofit group Rock the Vote to provide a quick and easy way to verify and register voters online through The Burg.  A Burg user’s community will consist of their City Council district, with the option to expand to include neighboring areas if they choose.
    
At the heart of this project is our belief that cities are home to a vast reserve of untapped potential in the form of actively engaged residents. People do care about the areas they live in and they want some say in direction of their city. By making communication easier, information about local issues more accessible, and organizing readily available for all, we can unlock some of that potential. We believe through the use of technology, we can make LA the best place to connect by lowering some of the barriers that inhibit civic engagement.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/local-civic-engagement-is-hard-lets-make-it-easier,

Grieving is often a tough, lonely process but necessary process, though some individuals have a hard time reaching out and asking for help. The context usually is, 'Something is wrong with me,' 'nobody understands,' 'It's too painful.' 

We are connecting people who have chosen creative expression to transform emotional states like depression, anxiety, and anger into art as a way to process their grief. By offering them a safe and personalized space in the form of a hardcover documentary art book designed by a community of artists sharing openly and authentically about their experiences in grief, The Love Story will be able to inspire our community to write, reflect, and share their personal stories in a digital and live platform. Using augmented reality technology through our partnership with Live Portrait, the artist illustrations inside the book will turn into videos when scanned through the Live Portrait app, allowing our journalers to write, paint, sketch, doodle, rant, and create directly inside the book. The journals will include 40 interviews and 40 journaling prompts.

By creating a book designed by artists, aggregated into one documentary art journal, we are able to not only connect the broken hearted with those who have transformed from it, but we are also able to  change how we perceive the pain of loss.

By leveraging the power of art and expression to transform the mindset of loss and grief, those who are experiencing difficult times will view their circumstances as an artistic opportunity to discover their inner artistry rather than a mental health issue to be fixed. By journaling, writing poetry, painting, and expressing creatively, we will be able to bring Angelinos together to have open, honest, and authentic conversations about grief and share our creative expressions (music, poetry, spoken word, film, etc.) to transform our pain.

This program, in brief, provides a holistic green school approach that addresses the school buildings, the school grounds, the curriculum, and the student experience for the benefit of the entire community.

Yet these solutions are frequently conceived of in isolation—there is often little dialogue between various disciplines, policy makers and the public at-large. This inability to know how to handle the vast amount of data severely limits articulating well-informed strategies that will affect comprehensive, holistic change. 

CONNECT: An intelligent direction for LA can only come from harnessing the distributed knowledge network of LA’s multiple public utilities, government agencies, research institutions, civic organizations, and citizens.

Our proposal’s main goal is to provide this connection. Our web portal will serve not simply as a one-sided communication tool, but as a hub for all the multiple inputs and outputs that shape LA. 

We’ve begun to make progress on connecting data patterns to neighborhoods, building typologies, and planning proposals. Our goal for this portal is to make an interactive hub where researchers will want to add their data because it helps them visualize their data. Civic organizations and nonprofits can collect information that will help them better advance and champion their own goals.

LIVE: The complex relationships between disparate datasets and their stakeholders can be difficult to understand. Our portal will make these relationships clear and visible. Information that’s not readily accessible to the public will be made transparent and easy to use.  By helping citizens to understand their everyday choices within a larger context, we can measure the collective impact of many people acting independently toward a sustainable future (e.g. converting a lawn to xeriscaping, installing rooftop solar panels, or riding public transit).

Communities and nonprofits can now visualize, plan, and understand the impacts of neighborhood-scale collaborative efforts (e.g. a new park, a streetside bioswale, or renewable energy storage).

Planners, politicians, and researchers can identify and develop real-world solutions that are readily implementable and effective on a large-scale. This means comparing different strategies and measuring their viability based on their infrastructure costs, environmental impact, and lifestyle changes.

For example, this portal could easily identify existing housing and job opportunities within a ½ mile-radius access of current transit nodes, and can help citizens and planners map out the best locations for future development. This is the kind of service the community can expect us to provide through this project.

A modern version of ancient dialog practices of indigenous peoples around the world, council involves the use of a few basic elements. The first of these is circular seating. The quality of the circle is that the form itself creates a sense of connectedness. Gathered together in a circle with others we know we are part of something greater than ourselves. In our age of digital/virtual/virtually-anonymous connection, having a space and process to actually come together to connect in circle is perhaps our most pressing need…and deepest yearning. Meeting this need is the purpose of CCSI.

By engaging residents in a collaborative, hands-on process of creating a unique, special place to meet in ceremony, the design and build component of this proposal will instigate the connection CCSI envisions. By training elders to serve as stewards of community dialog, CCSI will reduce the residential segregation they frequently experience, while increasing community participation in all manner of civic activities, cultural events and public gatherings. By establishing a place and a process for residents to listen and speak to one another from the heart, CCSI promises social and emotional support for all who participate. By creating a forum for voicing their needs and collective wisdom, CCSI offers residents the opportunity to mobilize for systemic change and the development of grassroots solutions to civic obstacles, as well as the increased likelihood that those needs will be addressed by government or volunteers. Finally, as a pilot program exemplifying the profound social impact of meeting in circles, CCSI will inspire the creation of community circle spaces in neighborhoods throughout LA and this will truly make LA the best place to connect.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/community-circle-space-initiative-creating-a-place-and-sharing-a-process-for-authentic-connection,

The teachers also complete a 60 page portfolio of photographs, video footage, dialogue, and examples of children’s theory development.  These portfolios document both the teacher’s and the children’s learning over time. The finished product is a multi-media record of the teacher’s journey in implementing new teaching practices.

Compounding the problem, the State’s new mandate that Transitional Kindergartens (TK) be offered throughout California’s public schools has resulted in elementary school teachers without adequate training in early childhood education staffing classrooms with 4 and 5-year-olds. Consequently, California children are subjected to curriculum that is inappropriate for their developmental level, setting them up for early failure and burn-out at a time when they are defining themselves as learners. This has been a great setback for children in low income communities where scripted lessons that fail to measure the dispositions needed for school and life success take precedence over creative experiences and engaging intellectual challenges. Our goal is to support classrooms that nurture tenacity, curiosity, flexibility, creative thinking, and democratic values that provide children with the best preparation for academic success and responsible citizenry. 

The Collaborative Teacher Project (CTP) directly addresses LA’s economic gap by bringing innovative programs to LA's most at risk public schools. We begin by connecting master teachers with public elementary school teachers who often lack the resources or exposure to more creative, child-centered approaches. Together with parents, teachers and community volunteers, we refurbish the TK classrooms, transforming them into environments that enable children to interact, reflect, analyze and create together. During the months that follow, CTP mentors work side by side with the TK teachers in their classrooms –  mentoring, modelling and inspiring deeply reflective teacher practices.

Our project is based on the strong affirmation that ALL children, regardless of economic or geographic considerations, possess an innate desire to make meaning in the world, and thus should be provided with quality early learning experiences that nurture their creativity, curiosity and wonder. We know that quality early childhood education can change the trajectory of a child's life. But who is to provide this quality? Teachers, of course. Yet so many teachers lack support and training. With the help of LA2050 we can right this wrong. Let’s give teachers the support they need so they can indeed change the trajectory of a child’s life, not just in affluent neighborhoods, but everywhere.

Unfortunately, the area has suffered for 12 years from overwatering and neglect and is overrun with exotic and invasive plant species. Since key community and business access points were never realized, it is used far less than original envisioned. Pedestrian and bike traffic has decreased substantially, given lack of stewardship and viable access. As a result, the area is a haven for many homeless, further discouraging community use.  

Our project will restore the Greenway’s positive public benefits, reduce water needs, and build capacity among the community and City park maintenance staff for native plant care and stewardship best practices.  We will reshape the Greenway into a vibrant amenity, create educated stewards, activate access and connection points, and encourage safe use. 

The LA River Revitalization Plan designates Rec & Parks as responsible for long-term maintenance of future projects so collaboration with the Department is key. Building staff capacity in sound maintenance practices is critical to long-term success. With this project, staff will receive training that City budgets currently prohibit. The training will inform planting and maintenance practices for resilient native landscape management city-wide. 

River greenway plants are chosen for their historic habitat benefits and low water needs. Proper maintenance practices need one-fifth the labor and one-seventh the water of traditional landscapes. Native plants become susceptible to disease and mortality when consistently overwatered, but exotic invasive species thrive, choking out native habitat and creating fire hazards. Learning to identify and manage invasive plants is crucial to successful native landscape management. 

To foster long-term stewardship and reintegrate the greenway into community life, we will engage local businesses and LAHSA in a design charrette to reactivate greenway access points, create a more vibrant and meaningful river-business interface, and enhance public health and safety. 

The project’s three phases are:

1) Survey and inventory existing native and invasive plants along the Greenway; create a plan for invasive removal; design a revitalizing native planting; and produce a clear plan for ongoing maintenance;

2) Remove invasive weeds, mulch the site and plant natives. Manage any emerging invasive plants; monitor the irrigation schedule; and trim, mulch and evaluate ongoing program needs. This will be coordinated with Rec & Parks’ bi-monthly site visits and will engage community volunteers; and

From hotter heat waves and increased smog to drought and rising seas, Los Angeles will be acutely damaged as climate change worsens. There is a lot at stake for Los Angeles in how quickly we stop relying on fossil fuels, which cause climate change. 

The city is acting to reduce our use of fossil fuels by phasing out dirty coal and expanding rooftop solar and energy savings programs. Importantly, the city is expanding its programs for low-income residents to ensure that every Angeleno can benefit from clean energy programs.

Still, we have work to do. Los Angeles is in the process of replacing 70 percent of our energy resources over the next 15 years. Will the city double down on fossil fuels or expand clean energy resources like wind and solar? As it builds clean energy, who will benefit? Will the people of Watts have the same access and reap the same benefits from clean energy as people in Brentwood?

With your support over the next year, we will: 

●Engage residents and other stakeholders in a city-wide discussion about what Los Angeles’s energy future should look like, ways to ensure that we are  training the next generation of workers to build the clean energy economy, and how the transition will benefit frontline communities impacted by fossil fuels;

●Track and evaluate the mechanisms being used by the city to help spur clean energy, ensuring that those mechanisms are localizing our energy infrastructure, building a more resilient system, and providing equitable access to clean energy programs; 

●Develop popular education materials to educate the public about the impact of climate change and the benefits of clean energy; and

●Use social media to help launch city-wide dialogue about the role of clean energy in our grid.

How would that artwork, already such a magnet, inspire new forms of play? That’s what the Triforium could be: a place where people and technology meet to make music, light, and wonder.

Joseph Young designed the Triforium as 'the Rosetta Stone of art and technology,” using motion sensors and a computer system to translate pedestrian footfall in the nearby LA Mall into patterns of light and sound displayed by prisms and the glass bell carillon, at the time the largest musical instrument in the world. It didn’t quite work out that way. 

But time has caught up to Young’s vision: replaced with LED bulbs, the Triforium’s lights could last longer, burn brighter, and respond to an inexpensive computer system designed to invite musical interaction. Motion-sensitive components could allow pedestrians not only to look at the sculpture but to dance with it. 

The interactive urban light is not only possible—it can move from the streets and into the pockets of Angelenos. Using a free Triforium app, Angelenos of all ages could create simple compositions and “play” the instrument in public space. This is interactivity as Joseph Young could never have imagined it. It is networked, creative, and will meet citizens where they are—between the digital and the physical, between the wide world and the city.

Los Angeles is the most park-poor major city in America, and we need fully utilize what little open space we have in the city. The Triforium stands in the shadow of City Hall, a stone’s throw from Grand Park, in Fletcher-Bowron Square. Flanked by a bike lane and located near dozens of Downtown landmarks, it’s an underutilized public square with a history both inspiring and largely unknown by the public. 

Restored to its intended grandeur, the Triforium can become an opportunity for pedestrians, downtown workers, tourists, children, artists, and commuters in Los Angeles to stop, play, and illuminate the city. It will encourage sustained collaborative play; the more people interact with the instrument, the more brightly it will shine.

As Los Angeles’ historic Downtown finds itself at the center of massive civic reinvestment, we look to the Triforium restoration as a positive metaphor for the ways in which urban renewal can revitalize from the inside. By investing in the neglected infrastructures all around us, we honor and preserve the city’s rich history while weaving it seamlessly into the fabric of the future. The thousand-plus points of light radiating from the Triforium are reminders of all the Triforia everywhere—the faded municipal underpinnings in every city that we take for granted, and which with modest preservation can serve our cities in ways well beyond what their architects ever imagined.

o	Implement stormwater BMPs that will capture and infiltrate runoff
o	Improve community fitness by creating a fitness loop
o	Increase bike and pedestrian safety through traffic calming measures
o	Increase safety through planting low growing plants and installing light fixtures to increase visibility at night
o	Create murals, mosaics, and decorative fencing in the alleys to create beautiful public space that reflects the community.

By implementing stormwater capture elements in the alleys, rainwater will be able to recharge local aquifers and increase our water supply. South Los Angeles is ideal for green infrastructure implementation because it is located over the Los Angeles Forebay, which is capable of storing large quantities of groundwater and allows percolation into deeper aquifers that replenish the groundwater basin. Ongoing monitoring of the stormwater captured by the alleys will provide valuable information that will be used to inform water and green infrastructure policy at the local, regional, and state level.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/green-alleys-initiative-–-transforming-polluted-alleys-into-vibrant-water-smart-green-space,

From local utilities to state government, from brown lawns to dry fountains, it’s impossible to escape signs of the drought. Drought has brought urgency to the task of crafting a more sustainable Los Angeles, and is an exceptional opportunity to make LA more livable for all its residents, human and otherwise. 

Grow Local: Plant Native extends our concerns beyond water conservation, to bring sustainable choices, practices, and landscapes to residents of all ages and the staff of LA public housing. 

Theodore Payne Foundation and Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles have been working together to pilot native plant gardens at four public housing sites throughout LA. The Foundation has trained the Authority’s landscape staff and some residents in basic native plant horticulture. Foundation staff is guiding crews through design, installation, establishment, and maintenance of new plantings at San Fernando Gardens in Pacoima, Imperial Courts in Watts, Estrada Courts in Boyle Heights, and Mar Vista Gardens in Del Rey.

With Grow Local: Plant Native, we seek to extend this project to Rancho San Pedro, and closely engage the Rancho San Pedro youth in shaping the future of their city.

It starts with water, but it doesn’t end there. Native plants protect the air, and ground and marine water resources because they require little or no fertilizers or pesticides. No aerial application of pesticides will impact residents and there will be no potential outgassing from artificial grass. Further, when compared to tuft grass, established native gardens use 80% less water yet these lush, habitat-rich environments include shade trees that invite people to go outside or take a walk. In the face of climate change and an uncertain economic outlook, converting turf to resilient native plant landscapes will allow public housing resources to be used on other priorities.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/grow-local-plant-native!-youth-advocacy-for-sustainable-landscapes-at-la-public-housing,

These performances are often the most difficult to permit, but most attractive to branded collaborations with corporate sponsors: an important tool in the innovator's production realm toolbelt. 

Our program will prep local directors from A-Z, including media deck creation to pitch to sponsors, press kits, networking with city officials, permitting, location identification, and many more areas. Ultimately, a successful program will generate one or more candidates for a sort of 'grant' that functions as the start up capital for one or more productions in collaboration with their creative entity and Think Tank Gallery.

Succeeding the Arts District & Gallery Row, the epicenter of LA is in the midst of its own cultural renaissance. Councilman Jose Huizar’s Bringing Back Broadway initiative has succeeded in activating many of DTLA’s empty spaces, and the Think Tank sits as co-pilot on that initiative’s landmark event as creative directors on Huizar and CD14’s 65,000+ attendee Night on Broadway festival. The opportunity to activate the dormant theaters and streets with superstars like Reggie Watts and Cirque du Soleil has taught us how malleable the City of LA can be. 

We haven’t always been so privileged to work parallel with the City to produce such exciting programming in our neighborhood; the first few years running our venue required we dig for information to get our events compliant enough to expand. As we grew, we began accruing the info and network needed to execute big ideas in the city of Los Angeles, and we see a lot of exceedingly creative talents here who could benefit from such knowledge. We’ve also run across hundreds of inspiring but inactivated spaces itching for those artists. 

Because most creatives buckle at bureaucracy, starting with an idea rather than the legal feasibility, the red tape that ties up cultural opportunity can be hard-to-see and act as a landmine that takes a big idea’s legs out from under it before they see the light of day. If more creatives could produce work within City guidelines, they could empower their own practice and employ their collaborators more often; we believe this collaboration is fuel for creation. 

Fitting ideas into the laws of various government agencies is hard enough, but in LA it seems that finding those laws is the hardest part. Dialog with LAPD shows that they aren’t trained on the Fire Department’s restrictions, and even the Department of Cultural Affairs has no resource on which permits to get for an artistic venture, nor where to get them. If even the DCA can’t find this info, imagine the plight of low-income creators in and around DTLA trying to figure it out. Our project does this step for them – taking an idea and applying it to the correct procedure, in a concise package that law enforcement, building owners, and artists can easily buy into.

LA is critiqued for its sprawl, but that has ultimately become our greatest artistic resource. Across the city are empty buildings with such character that creators worldwide are chomping at the bit to engage them in a site-responsive manner. Democratization benefitting building owners by bringing positive attention to their property while empowering artists to create in a government-approved manner takes one of LA’s greatest slights – vacant sprawl – and turns it into our biggest strength.

(1)	Enhancing organizational capacity
The State of California contracts with Tierra to provide basic support to adults with disabilities; However, the level of government funding does not allow for the innovation and customization necessary for people with disabilities to fully connect with their community. Tierra creates change-based community involvement to support adults with disabilities to be valued for their contribution.

(2)	Engaging residents and stakeholders
During the discovery phase of Tierra’s program, participants experience and evaluate career opportunities. These experiences culminate in a planning session, in which they meet with family and a representative of the California Department of Developmental Services, to create a three-year plan for achieving their goals.

(3)	Expanding a program
Volunteer and Employment Developers create partnerships to expand opportunities for career-driven volunteerism.

(4)	Mobilizing for systems change
Employees and volunteers, at partner organizations, learn the possibilities for their family member(s) with disabilities, and spread these values throughout the organization. These organizations reported that their partnership with Tierra improved their workplace’s morale and atmosphere.

Six partners found such value in the skills of Tierra clients, that they hired them as permanent employees. As a result, volunteers shifted from a temporary volunteer position, to connecting with their co-workers via a paid job. Companies increased their inclusiveness of people with all ability levels, allowing employees to connect with often-isolated individuals.

The impact extends beyond volunteerism into all areas of community life.

(1)	The number of potential VOTERS with disabilities exceed that of either Latinos or African-Americans (Rutgers 2016). However, their voter turnout is 5.7% lower than those without disabilities (U.S. Election Assistance Committee 2013). Volunteerism strengthens the communication and self-advocacy skills necessary to engage in the electoral process.

(2)	Volunteering is linked to improved social/communication skills and inclusion (Disability & Rehabilitation Journal 2016), which are critical to SOCIAL/EMOTIONAL SUPPORT. Participants learn how to continue the relationships established via volunteerism by making SOCIAL MEDIA CONNECTIONS.

(3)	Tierra’s staff have wifi-enabled devices which allow clients to ACCESS FREE WIFI.

(4)	Participants’ consistent efforts allow partner art galleries (i.e. da Center for the Arts) and museums (i.e. Discovery Cube) to more effectively and efficiently execute CULTURAL EVENTS.

(5)	Travel training empowers participants to MINIMIZE TRAVEL TIME to volunteer positions by using PUBLIC TRANSIT systems, such as Metro, in lieu of costly and time-intensive options such as Access.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/pathways-to-employment-through-professional-volunteerism,

Densely populated urban cities such as ours are particularly prone to high levels of air pollution.  Although everyone is affected by it, hundreds of thousands of people in LA such as asthmatics, young children, the elderly, pregnant women, people with heart disease, lung disease or compromised immune systems are particularly sensitive to the health hazards of air pollution. Reducing the health impacts of air pollution requires not just public policy, but also individual action. 

To provide an interactive tool for Angelenos with easy access to air quality information, we developed and launched a free air quality app – AirForU – a few months ago for iPhones and Android phones. We use information from the Environmental Protection Agency’s air quality monitoring and reporting network and provide it on our app as real-time air quality updates and next-day forecasts. Through AirForU we make air pollution, often invisible, more visible. So far we have about 2400 users and we have received tremendous positive feedback from many of them.  By knowing when air pollutions levels are high based on real-time updates and next-day forecasts, app users are empowered to take measures to protect their health and their family’s health.  Parents/caretakers can decide what times are best to their children outdoors to play; particularly for asthmatic children. Those who exercise outdoors frequently can determine best times to exercise outdoors. 

AirForU is also a research tool; we collect research data through surveys in the app and embedded analytics to understand who is using this information and how they are using it. Current research on air quality communication is still undeveloped and through our project we hope to address the some of the existing research gaps. Research data from app users will help determine how to further engage sensitive people with air quality information, use targeted messages and alerts for specific populations, and develop additional strategies to reduce the health impacts of air pollution.

Through this proposal, we are planning to expand and improve our project by enhancing the app technology, incorporate new research methods, recruit more users and develop new strategies for protecting the health of sensitive populations.

What better way to transform Los Angeles than to provide a tangible pathway from the streets, and from under the bridges, from cars and motels, from hopelessness to healing and to a home. 

Our dream for LA in 2050, is a city where no-one is homeless. LA will be a place where EVERYONE has the chance for a job, food, and LIVE with a roof over their head. As part of this $100,000 Grants Challenge, Union Rescue Mission wants to team up with the people of LA to help 15 mothers and their children get into permanent housing over the next year. 

In Los Angeles, our city, there are more than 46,000 people who live on the streets. More than half are women and many of them live in one of the most dangerous parts of Central Los Angeles—Skid Row. Right now, Union Rescue Mission has 735 women and children living at the Mission. These are record numbers and for the first time in history, we have more women than men living at the Mission. Union Rescue Mission is one of the only places where families experiencing homelessness can go. We never turn a woman or a family with children away, setting up emergency shelter in the chapel when at full capacity. The women and children we serve come to us lost and broken. They are depressed and deeply worried about their children. Many have simply given up hope. 

As a result of this Grants Challenge, more women and children will get off the streets of Skid Row and get their lives back on track. This starts with the provision of emergency food and shelter at the downtown shelter, followed by transitional housing and access to comprehensive, holistic services at Hope Gardens Family Center. This is followed by help finding a job and moving into permanent housing. More than 1200 women have found a pathway to healing and hope at Hope Gardens Family Center, since the program began in 2007. We plan for many more miracles to take place in this life-transforming place. 
  
At Union Rescue Mission, we provide more than a meal. Our comprehensive services and transitional housing programs provide a tangible pathway to health, jobs and housing.

1) Confidence and Communication 2) Healthy Relationships and Mentoring 3) Educational Enrichment and Civic Leadership 4) Entrepreneurship and Employment.

Unite A Nation, Inc., has addressed the specific needs of our young people (children, youth and young adults). We have identified the solution to the problems of our students by creating two unique programs: 1) POWER, 2) Brilliant Imagination.

Program 1. The comprehensive POWER Goal Setting and Professional Development programs mission is to build self-esteem, confidence, awareness and resiliency in young people, preparing them for positive relationships and successful futures through financial empowerment, history, education, mentoring and civic Leadership and self-advocacy. 

POWER is a series of workshops offered year around at Dorsey High School. During the POWER program, with funding, we hope to provide the platform for each youth to create and adopt a Career Portfolio that contains their life goals, personal and professional plan, financial goals, photo’s, certificates of completion and awards. The end result is for youth to participate in professional Development, Leadership and Exposure through a 6 week volunteer or paid work internship that matches their career goals. 

Program 2. Brilliant Imagination Cultural Arts and Multicultural program's mission is to infuse positive self-reflection, developing the minds and health of local youth, while refining feelings and thoughts that represent our customs and values as a society with dance as our primary focus.

At Unite a nation, we use cultural art as a refinement or development of talents and interests through exposure and training. Along with, multiculturalism to examine many group cultures and the things that represent them.  Studies prove that Students who participate in rigorous, arts-based programs perform better in school and have higher graduation rates than that of their peers who do not participate in the arts.

UFC’s College Readiness (CRP) and College Sponsorship (CSP) programs work harmoniously to create this pipeline for success.  

The goal of the CRP is to help foster youth graduate from high school ready to succeed at a 4-year college or university.  The CRP supports students from 7th through 12th grades.  College Counselors meet one-on-one with each student in their homes and maintain frequent contact with students via telephone and email. The content of these meetings is driven by both the student’s needs and the counselor’s recommendations.  Counselors serve as the main conduit for delivering a range of program content to CRP students. Acknowledging the crucial role caregivers have in helping maintain stability for students, UFC offers training in communication, conflict resolution, and other subjects designed to help them cope during a challenging developmental stage in the lives of all youth. 

UFC also uses monthly Saturday workshops and college tours, facilitated by CRP College Counselors, to deliver program content, and encourage social interaction and the development of a college-bound culture among participants. Through these various activities, participation in the program helps students to earn their high-school diploma, graduate four-year-college eligible, apply to and attend college. We will serve 500 youth in the CRP in the coming year.  

The College Sponsorship Program is a commitment of personal and financial support for up to 5 years to foster youth attending 4-year institutions.  In addition to a $15,000/ five-year scholarship, each youth is paired one-on-one with a College Counselor.  Counselors serve as the key source of support, guidance and as a resource throughout a student’s college experience.  The program also includes paid internships, enrichment activities and post-graduation planning.  By keeping youth involved, engaged, and interested in their education through close, mentoring relationships with UFC counselors, the CSP is increasing college graduation rates for foster youth.

In ever increasing numbers, youth are graduating from high school through the CRP and attending universities through the CSP.

A zero net energy (ZNE) building must provide on-site renewable energy sources equal to the amount of energy used by the building annually. In order to achieve the ZNE target, a building must be designed with super-insulation, daylighting, natural ventilation, and many other energy-efficient passive strategies. Only after a building first reduces energy demand should it be fitted with solar, wind, or even geothermal on-site energy sources to take care of its remaining cooling, heating, and lighting needs. California's future ZNE homes, and commercial buildings will produce energy savings that the CEC estimates will also reduce about 160,000 metric tons of carbon emissions per year. By reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, and increasing our use of renewable on-site energy sources, we will stop polluting our climate with dirty fuels and will create more resilient, self-sufficient communities that will help to reduce strain on the grid and prevent future blackouts.

California's current goal for reaching their 2020 and 2030 ZNE targets is to educate builders and engineers and to have some of the energy efficiency techniques that have been in development, such as high performance windows and better insulation, become part of the building code in 2019.

Young people especially are running *away* from office at record rates, with 90 percent saying they would never want to serve in any of the nation’s more than 500,000 elected offices. In short, our democracy is facing a crisis of leadership that can only be solved when a larger and more diverse group of Americans runs for office. 

At a time when most of the world’s information is only a click away, it is nearly impossible to find a clear and complete list of offices one is eligible to run for. This lack of basic information about how to run for office prevents the people of LA, and especially young people and other politically underrepresented groups, from being equally informed about leadership opportunities in their communities. The good news is that unlike the major structural and cultural barriers to running for office, the problem of data access is one we are equipped to solve today. 

With support and guidance from LA election officials and the CA Secretary of State, our team at the University of Southern California will work within Greater Los Angeles - and ultimately in all 58 California counties - to transition our elected office data into a streamlined and open platform. The database would not only allow users to see all available elected offices based on their address, but also provide crucial details like filing windows, salaries, application requirements, and who else is running.

Primary users of this public database and API will include nonprofits like She Should Run and Veterans Campaign, which encourage and support first-time candidates. The database will also be used by technology companies like Facebook and Nationbuilder, which is already designing solutions that make it easier for their users to run for office.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/open-ballot-la,

Develop students’ critical thinking and problem skills, 5. Inspire, mentor and guide students towards business ownership and careers in STEM 

The lure of STEM has been the excitement generated by projects, experiments and activities as well as the potential for high income earning jobs and careers.  The Common Core and Next Generation Science standards attempt to integrate STEM into everyday curriculum. However, simply changing standards in isolation cannot overcome the inertia of public educational institutions.  Data has shown that participation in engineering curricula is dependent on interest, aptitude and prior success in mathematics and science courses. Thus, underrepresented and disadvantaged minority students who have not had the opportunity to develop interest or experience success in math and science may be excluded from participation. 

In the study, “Pipeline Persistence: Examining the Association of Educational Experiences With Earned Degrees in STEM Among U.S. Students”, Maltese and Tai (2009) indicate that the majority of students who concentrate in STEM make that choice during high school, and that choice is related to a growing interest in mathematics and science rather than enrollment or achievement. According to the NACME White Paper Increasing the Achievement and Presence of Under-Represented Minorities in STEM Fields (2013), “Strengthening the educational pipeline for minorities in STEM fields will have a huge impact on their motivation to study and work in those fields”. 

Based on these studies, there is a benefit to minority and educationally disadvantaged students and to the Los Angeles community for programs that spark, nurture, encourage and support students’ interest, aptitude and efforts to pursue careers in STEM. To that end, SCIE provides instruction, support and guidance to students from a STEM and business perspective that also increases student academic and social self-efficacy and skills.

This study was developed with the collaboration of a group of students who tested bike mounted sensing kits for air quality measuring within the physical boundaries of the USC campus. Through this study, the sensing kit has been tested and the data has been validated. Therefore one of the main points of success for the presented project would be to scale the pilot project developed at USC campus to a city wide initiative by installing sensing kits in LA bikes. 
On the other hand the involvement of LA citizens in the sensing as well as in the data interpretation process is a critical aspect to guarantee a successful development of the project. Citizen participation through citizen science initiatives can motivate urban policy level transformations which are determinant for the reduction of health hazards such as air pollution. Therefore the public participation on the devised digital and workshop based LA CitySense engagement platforms will be a crucial measure of success of the proposed initiative.","[""Money "",""Volunteers"",""Advisors/board members"",""Publicity/awareness"",""Infrastructure (building/space/vehicles"","" etc.)"","" etc.)"",""Community outreach "",""Network/relationship support"",""communication with the LA municipality""]","LA CitySense proposes to couple air quality sensing kits to bikes, enabling the citizens, to map as they ride recording the pollutant concentration in different areas of the city. The goal is to engage the citizens in the process of reading and documenting air pollution data which would not only increase sensitivity towards the built environment but could trigger formulation of locally informed urban policies.","[""Exposure to air toxins"",""Resilient communities"",""Tree canopy cover"",""Walk/bike/transit score""]","Urban air quality is one of the most alarming problems of contemporary cities. The World Health Organization reported that “in 2012, around 7 million people died – one in eight of the total global deaths – as a result of air pollution. This finding confirms that air pollution is now the world’s largest single environmental health risk” (WHO 2014). It is well known that air quality is primarily an urban problem. Therefore strategies to improve air quality in cities would introduce tremendous health and comfort benefits for their citizens. 
Given the high reliance on the private vehicle, LA is one of the most polluted urban enclaves in the US. In this context, and with our increasing awareness of the negative effect air pollution can play in human health, initiatives that contribute to the improvement of air quality in the city of LA are paramount. 
With the ambition to increase social and improve the air quality of the city of LA, the proposal has two main focuses:
a)	Urban sensing through the involvement of LA citizens in the sensing process of the air quality data of the city:
 The current data available from governmental weather stations is insufficient to understand the air quality conditions we are exposed to in our daily routines. A higher spatial resolution mapping of the environmental data is necessary to rationalize the air quality variability across the city and be able to understand the air quality we are subject to as well as the possible implications it may have  in our health. The advantage of crowd sourced air quality data acquisition resides precisely in its capacity to increase the spatial resolution through an affordable technical approach. Furthermore it also takes advantage of the LA Bike municipality project which seeks to promote the use of bicycles to reduce the vehicular emissions to the atmosphere. The sensing kits will be attached to the LA bikes to perform crowd-sourced mobile sensing. Through this approach, the spatial resolution of the recordings will be further increased, enabling the acquisition of a city wide air quality data.
b)	Data sharing for urban action and the establishment of urban policies:
The data collected by all active bikers, will be shared with LA citizens to spread the air quality awareness through a city wide open platform. The management of the sensing kits as well as the rationalization of the results will be shared through citizen workshops and through discussion forums in public databases. Therefore the collected data will not only serve for scientific research but will also motivate city wide public awareness platforms to discuss the air quality conditions of the city. Mobile applications and web-based interfaces are also being developed to enable a real time visualization of the collected data. 
The goal is to engage the citizens in the process of reading and documenting air pollution data and increase sensitivity towards the built environment.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/la-citysense-citizen-engagement-in-collection-of-air-quality-data-for-improvement-of-public-health,

However, opportunities for people to come together for intergenerational play—experiences that are equally playful no matter your age—are often difficult to find and access. 

CARPE LA: Collaborative Augmented Reality Play Experience for Families in LA’s parks has two key features that will make LA the best place to play. First, it will bring an exciting new intergenerational play experience to parks around LA, which will offer the added benefit of bringing communities together. Second, CARPE LA blends digital and physical play through augmented reality technology similar to what powered this summer’s hit game Pokemon Go! 
 
CARPE LA will increase access to open space and park activities through gameplay events designed for participants of all ages and abilities. As a team game, play is enhanced by including players with differing abilities and ideas. And, although the game has a technological component, it is not necessary for all team members to have a mobile device to participate.
 
The pilot will improve the number and quality of informal spaces for play in participating neighborhoods in two ways: 1) the events - held on what we’ll call Summer Saturdays - will provide a guided model for intergenerational play offered through a story that encourages families to slow down and discover together. Our team members are experts in both design and instruction related to intergenerational play. As families and communities participate, they will learn skills for designing their own intergenerational play experiences in the park. 2) We will install beacon technology within the park to facilitate the digital aspects of the game and offer ways for the families to use their mobile devices to collect, share and unlock more opportunities within the park and beyond. The hardware does not have to be permanently installed allowing us to expand the game beyond the initial pilot sites. 
 
The key metric we expect to impact is the number of parks with intergenerational play experiences. We see that technology has, in some ways, decreased the opportunities for true intergenerational play in parks—play in which the adults are as engaged as the children—due to the fact that adults can be always connected to work or home, even when outside playing. CARPE LA uses that same mobile technology to create a compelling, immersive play experience that blends digital technology with the types of physical and reflective play that parks encourage: running, jumping, climbing, all the way to observing, imagining and discovering. It is the best of both worlds, brought together through a compelling story and social connections.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/carpe-la-collaborative-augmented-reality-play-experience-for-families-of-los-angeles,

Other challenges are more subtle, such as the region's lack of diversity and, sometimes, lack of neighborliness, and debates over regional character and the role of businesses versus the role of residents. Jurisdictional challenges make these problems hard to solve. Likewise, the distance to L.A.

Why Middle School?

According to Johns Hopkins researcher Dr. Robert Balfanz, for most students, the process of dropping out begins in middle school, when the habits that predict whether or not a student graduates are formed. This is simply one data point of a new finding relative to the need for middle school interventions. The years leading up to high-school are make-or-break in the educational success of students. WeThrive strengthens the transition from middle school to high school by providing skills and lessons which are often not taught at all. Things like how to find and build your own mentor relationships for example. With the teaching of these life skills, our participants exit programming not only equipped with what they need to transition to high school, but also what it takes to graduate high school, attend college and obtain a college degree. Ultimately, WeThrive is part of a necessary change to create a high-quality K-16 system in LA for bringing students to a college degree. This is the most direct and reliable way of increasing educational capital. 

By creating a supportive environment that encourages relationship building, learning, planning, and financial achievement, WeThrive instills the drive and motivation needed to set ambitious personal and economic goals. Through programming designed to build skills, confidence, and support networks, participants are also provided with the ability to make decisions and take actions aimed at achieving those goals. WeThrive is ultimately making LA the best place to learn by serving middle school students in Los Angeles who build companies within WeThrive while gaining mentors and a support system.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/youth-mentoring-and-entrepreneurship-program-for-middle-school-students,

At the Whitaker Peace & Development Initiative (WPDI), we believe that education has the power to address some of the most salient issues facing our youth, such as bullying, violence, and high suspension rates.  We are convinced based on our experience that conflict resolution skills should be a part of the school curriculum just like any other subject area because conflict is a life-long issue that we all face no matter who we are.  However, conflict resolution skills are not innate – we must learn and practice these skills in our classrooms, and the sooner these skills are learned, the better we can create safe and productive learning environments in school, and provide our children with lifelong tools to constructively address conflict. The purpose of our program is to create campus- and classroom-based assets, which will strengthen and focus the resilience of students onto healthy living and making positive transitions to adulthood.  

Our Domestic Harmonizer Program is a trailblazing program that addresses these issues.  With our program partners, California State University, Dominguez Hills (CSUDH) and Andrew Carnegie Middle School in Carson (which is a LAUSD school), we have launched a truly unique curriculum that integrates Conflict Resolution Education (CRE) with the California Common Core subjects of math, science, social studies and English.  Students in the entire middle school will participate in this program beginning the 2016 academic year through the end of the 2019 academic year.  At the end of the program, students have an opportunity to create their own social justice projects on their middle school campus.

Our pilot project officially launched at Andrew Carnegie Middle School in August 2016, and will continue until the end of the 2019 academic year.

Providing college counseling geared towards creative students pursuing arts and/or broader liberal arts programs is especially challenging because it requires an individualized, intensive, intuitive approach that is time consuming in order for it to be effective. In the more resourced schools and communities of Los Angeles, many students have access to a vast network of college coaching support, be it through the school itself with offerings itself, or through access to a number of private college counselors and private tutors. There is a remarkably different picture, However, in the public schools of resource-challenged communities. In these schools, support beyond the most basic college application requirements is rare.

The YBA was formed in 2012, servicing one disadvantaged school. We are now in 16 schools serving roughly 400 disadvantaged high school students each year. The YBA provides a year-long school course ('Introduction to Business & Careers') to these students, who will receive high school course credit upon successful completion.  The course description/breakdown is as follows: 

1. Curriculum – Our program covers both the fundamental soft and hard skills a young professional will need to know to succeed in their future job or business. Students go through four modules (soft skills, career readiness, financial literacy, and business 101) and learn critical elements such as professional communication, resume writing, business plan development, and even participate in experiential exercises like a stock market trading game or a Shark Tank style pitch workshop.

2. Guest Speakers – Every week, each YBA class has a different guest speaker from the professional community come to their class and share their personal/professional story. This program is our version of “reverse job shadowing”, where students get to learn about the speakers’ life story/journey, their career/business, and ask questions. Our students meet approximately 30 professionals in a school year.

3. Field Trips – YBA students get to observe the behind the scenes of successful companies, many times meeting each department, learning about different job roles, participating in interactive workshops, and getting a VIP tour. What an impact it makes for our students to get out of the classroom and see a thriving company up close and personal. We've had teachers who have told us that after these field trips, some of their students are so inspired they pick up their grades almost immediately. Last year our students were able to check out companies like Google, SpaceX, Riot, etc.

Don’t you wish you had the YBA program when you were in high school? Would you credit at least part of your success today to a teacher or mentor who believed in you and shared some important principles with you? This is what YBA is all about - preparing future leaders, giving exposure, and creating opportunities for those with limited resources. 

YBA caters to disadvantaged youth in underserved communities, most of whom are minorities, at risk, and considered low income (free/reduced lunch). Yet, the majority of our students are at the top of their class, with some of the best GPA’s, and they volunteer to stay after school to be part of the YBA. They are not looking for a handout, but simply a hand up to be the success story in their family.

Getting into college takes a lot of time, effort and knowledge about just which colleges you should apply to and which ones may accept you. It’s an overwhelming process culminating in a decision that has long-term effects – college graduates have a lifetime earning potential of $2,927,000 compared to $1,193,000 among high school graduates (Harrington et al, 2010). No pressure, right? Now imagine you’re the first one in your family to apply for college, your parents have an 8th grade education and do not speak English very well, and your school’s college counselor is responsible for serving 700 students. That’s the reality for many of the kids we work with at YPI, and the lack of knowledgeable support results in 'undermatching' where, for example, a high school valedictorian accepted to UC Berkeley who opts to enroll in community college due to concerns for cost.

Ironically, the more academically competitive and expensive schools generally offer the most financial aid to low-income students. And academically competitive schools have higher success rates, so a qualified student who selects Harvard over community college is more likely to complete a degree than their undermatched counterpart. 

YPI sees undermatching as an opportunity. We place College Advisors (paid staff) and College Ambassadors (full-time AmeriCorps members) at high-need schools to offer college readiness workshops and 1:1 advising. Advising sessions use YPI’s College Choice Tool technology, in which students input their GPA, SAT/ACT scores, and personal preferences like distance from home, cost, academic reputation, campus feel, and diversity. The Tool then calculates best match schools for each student to reduce undermatching. 

Ambassadors and Advisors served nine schools in 2014-15. In these schools, only 33 students applied to a UC, 107 applied to other CA 4-year schools, and 172 applied to a community college. In 2015-16 (the second full year of services with the College Choice Tool) results were dramatically different. 106 students applied to a UC, 242 to a CA 4-year college, and 393 to a community college. After the 2-year pilot phase, YPI is ready to expand this program to nine new schools and serve even more students. YPI’s long-term goal is to take our College Choice Tool to scale so that by 2050, all LA high school students, but especially those with limited resources, will have access to this Tool to augment limited college counseling. This will ensure that every LA high school senior is matched to their most competitive and compatible college, resulting in higher college enrollment and graduation rates. This will ensure lifetime financial stability among LA’s youth, making LA not only the best place to LEARN, but the best place to PLAY, CREATE, CONNECT, and LIVE – all feasible thanks to the foundation of LEARNING.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/undermine-college-undermatching-using-technology-to-select-the-best-college-fit-for-las-students,

The first method will take place at the five-week point of the intensive. We will host a meeting for all of the parents and students in which they can provide verbal and written feedback to the Artistic Directors regarding the progress of the program. Progress will be determined by the students’ increased interest in the performing arts, physical abilities, and sense of community at ZPA.

The second method will take place at the final performance. We will provide a survey to all students and audience members asking for them to evaluate their experience, the quality of the instructors and performance, and whether or not they would continue to participate in the performing arts. 

The final method will be determined by student retention. We will count the number of students that continue to take class with Zeneith Performing Arts after the summer intensive. Considering the financial cost of class, despite the 80% subsidized tuition, might prevent some students from continuing to train with ZPA, a successful program would be measured by a retention of at least 65% of the students.","[""Money "",""Volunteers"",""Advisors/board members"",""Publicity/awareness"",""Infrastructure (building/space/vehicles etc.)"",""Technical infrastructure (computers etc.)"",""Community outreach "",""Network/relationship support""]","The Inner City Dance Project will bring professional dance training to students who other wise would not be able to access this training due to financial and geographic difficulties. We will identify 40 middle school and high school students, 5 foster youth, and 5 Zeneith Performing Arts (ZPA) students to participate in a ten-week dance and theater intensive that will conclude with a performance. The project will also subsidize class tuition for students who train with ZPA after the project.","[""Arts establishments"",""Employment in the creative industries"",""Measures of cultural and global economic influence (“soft power”)"",""Minority- and women-owned firms""]","With more than 28,000 performing arts jobs, Los Angeles has the nation’s best market for performing artists. However, young performing artists within Los Angeles’ low-income communities face poverty, crime, and other economic risk factors that can hinder their competitiveness in the performing arts industry. 

To counter these factors, Zeneith Performing Arts (ZPA) will identify 40 students from two inner city middle schools and two inner city high schools to participate in the Inner City Dance Project. These schools will be located in school districts that ZPA has a current working relationship with including Compton, Long Beach, Gardena and Los Angeles. These students will take ten classes per week in the areas of ballet, tap, hip-hop, jazz, Afro-Caribbean, modern dance, acting and performance. These classes will be challenging but not competitive, inspiring all students to work as a team and to value their performing arts community. In addition, students will take a field trip to the world-renowned Dorothy Chandler Pavilion to view a professional dance performance. This will introduce the students to the vast and masterful Los Angeles performing arts arena. Finally, the project will conclude with a student performance at an inner city theater to provide the students a well-rounded and creative experience as performing artists. ZPA will subsidize 80% of class tuition for all participants interested in training and performing with ZPA for the remainder of the year.

ZPA will also identify five foster youth to participate in the project. After implementing a dance program at a Long Beach group home in 2014, ZPA’s Directors recognized a critical need for an artistic discipline such as dance in these youth’s lives. The Inner City Dance project will inspire their creativity, talent and potential in the performing arts that will help them cope with the unique emotional and social risk factors they face in their homes and community.

ZPA will also identify five of its current students for the project, as more than 90% of ZPA students meet the target demographic of The Inner City Dance Project.

This intensive will also allow ZPA to employ professional dance and theater instructors who have overcome socioeconomic barriers to succeed in the performing arts industry. These instructors will serve as role models with whom students can relate.

For more than fifteen years, ZPA has professionally trained dance and theater students who have come from single-parent homes, poverty, families that deal with physical and mental health issues, and other disparities common to low-income communities. Despite these circumstances, ZPA alumni have graduated from college, performed on Broadway, become dance instructors and pursued other notable careers.  Just as past ZPA alumni have done, the goal of the Inner City Dance Project is to inspire all participants to believe that, in spite of their circumstances, Los Angeles is a place where they too can create and thrive.",https://challenge.la2050.org/entry/the-inner-city-dance-project-teaching-professional-dance-and-theater-to-las-inner-city-youth,
