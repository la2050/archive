We are strong believers in the power of storytelling, and the achievements we are most proud of include a multi-media journalistic exploration of migrant workers around the 2008 World Expo in Shanghai, another exploration of an amazing community of people that live in buses in Venice, and a public awareness campaign for Los Angeles that encourages people to meet their neighbors.

Thanks to the hard work of over 3,000 volunteers and countless supporters, 826LA has increased its reach substantially over the past few years. In 2008, 826LA opened a new center in Echo Park. This fall, 826LA moved its Westside operations to Mar Vista. This new Mar Vista center increases 826LAâ€™s capacity significantly, providing 2,625 square-feet of creative space for students as well as better visibility and accessibility for the organization. 826LA will have the capacity to serve 30% more students each day through After-School Tutoring in Mar Vista; to add a series of evening workshops targeted at middle and high school students; and to recruit and train up up to 35 volunteers per week.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>Last year, 826LA served 10,105 students last year--a 23% increase from the previous year. We are not only serving more students, but we are increasing the benefits of our programs across the academic curriculum. Over six years of assessments and surveys demonstrate that 826LAâ€™s programs build self-esteem, teach literacy skills, and improve educational outcomes. Last year:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>- 93% of students reported that they understood their writing assignment better thanks to the help of 826LA volunteers;</p>
 
 
 <p>- 90% of students reported that working with an 826LA volunteer in their classroom increased their confidence about writing;</p>
 
 
 <p>- 95% of students reported that they were proud of what they created during an 826LA workshop;</p>
 
 
 <p>- 100% of students reported that their grades have improved since receiving tutoring at 826LA.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>Other notable achievements include:</p>
 
 
 <p>â€¢ In 2006, 826LA received a Proclamation of Recognition from Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, and in honor of our 5th Anniversary in 2010, 826LA received an award from the Los Angeles City Council, acknowledging 826LAâ€™s dedication to the community;</p>

A+D is the only cultural institution in the United States showcasing continuous programs on architecture and design. Through exhibits, symposia, multi-disciplinary projects, educational and community programming, A+D is a showcase for the work of important regional, national and international designers, providing a forum for contemporary issues in architecture, urbanism, and design. <p/>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p> A+D has collaborated with important institutions such as the The Getty Center, AIA, SCI-Arc, the LA Forum as well as emerging and established architects. The museum has produced over 30 world class exhibits and received Awards of Merit for education programming from The American Architectural Foundation. It's also received multi-year grants from the Department of Cultural Affairs; explored the frontiers of design through concerts incorporating cutting edge computer graphics and electronic sound; and hosted panels moderated by a diverse group including L.A.

 <p> A+D has been awarded back to back grants from the Getty Foundation for Pacific Standard Time (2011) and Pacfiic Standard Time Presents: Modern Architecture in L.A. (2012). For PST, the museum presented â€œEames Words,â€ an exhibition that highlighted the ideas, rather than the creations, of the pioneering designers Charles and Ray Eames. For Pacific Standard Time Presents, the upcoming 2013 show, the museum has created â€œWindshield Perspective,â€ an examination of the Los Angeles urban landscape as seen through the cityâ€™s unexplored and unrepresented boulevards. <p/>

Law enforcement officials are thrilled by the reduced crime statistics, citing that there has not been a single homicide in the Watts housing developments since August 2011. Community members have reported that residents are now feeling more safe to travel and frequent stores within their community, and there have been notable decreases in youth gang membership and activity. While we are proud of our work in Watts, the Urban Peace program has also had a profound effect in improving community safety throughout Los Angeles.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>Over the past 12 years, Urban Peace has established unprecedented partnerships between gang intervention workers and law enforcement throughout Los Angeles, resulting in the lowest crime rates since the 1960â€™s. Since 2006, gang related crimes have been reduced by 32% and the number of shots fired within Los Angles has decreased from 3,288 to 1,723, representing a 52% reduction. Overall, the crime rate is at a historical low in both the City and the County of Los Angeles. Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) Chief Charlie Beck credits Urban Peaceâ€™s work with contributing to this historic decline. Former LAPD Chief William Bratton hails our success: â€œThe Advancement Project has been a force of nature. They have changed the way things are done in Los Angeles on gangs.â€ </p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>Similarly, Advancement Projectâ€™s Urban Peace Academy, the only publicly supported training program for gang intervention workers, has trained over 1,200 violence intervention workers and 500 police officers to work together towards violence reduction. Recently, our training of community intervention workers that operate the Los Angeles Summer Night Lights program contributed to a 35% drop in gang related homicides last summer in and around the parks where the program operates. Similarly, throughout Los Angelesâ€™ GRYD zones, where our Urban Peace Academy law enforcement and gang intervention graduates operate, there has been a 30% reduction in gang related crime and 42% reduction in shots fired. As crime rates continue to drop, the Urban Peace program is gaining national attention and requests for our innovative technical assistance have come from Seattle, Memphis, and Sacramento.</p>",,,2014003

For example, our Brokechella and No Budget festivals -- which today stand as our most far-reaching and well-attended events -- started very small. Brokechella started in a coffee shop, and in April 2013, 2000 people will join us downtown for a day of music, food, and art (weâ€™ve literally had to shut down an entire street in order to accommodate everyone and everything). No Budget began in a 50-person theater with no curating process and 16 videos submitted by friends and fans; it now is in its fourth year and has a red carpet, panel discussions led by arts professionals, a sold-out 300-person theater and has been a launchpad for young artists to create work and launch meaningful relationships within the film industry. The winners of the very first No Budget festival just released a trailer for a series based on their winning film, and many past Brokechella bands have been featured as â€œbandsâ€ to watch and have developed large local followings. The growth is so exciting to watch and defines what success means to us.",,5102009,2013030

 Our most significant achievement to date is partnering with the National Shared Housing Resource Center to lead the revival of the shared housing movement by rebuilding the Centerâ€™s capacity and launching a national campaign to strengthen existing programs. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Through a collaborative six-month process ALA worked with stakeholders from around the country to develop the Strategic Guide on Scaling Shared Housing, which highlights the exciting work happening in the field and identifies the new opportunities for growth. For example, New York City used shared housing as a disaster response solution in the wake of super storm Sandy. 
 
 
 
 
 
 With the support of Enterprise Community Partners and the Archstone Foundation, ALA hosted a Shared Housing Symposium that convened leaders from Illinois, Vermont, New Jersey, Maryland, Washington, Michigan and California to launch the Strategic Guide and discuss ideas for reinvigorating this decades-old movement.

Access to care has been a long-term investment of effort by out organization. In 1992, the California Southland Chapter was the lead and originator of the nationâ€™s first program serving Latinos with dementia, El Portal.

It was also adopted in parts of Great Britain. The local chapter of the Alzheimerâ€™s Association has led three statewide efforts to create and disseminate an evidence-based practice guideline that teaches primary care providers about quality post-diagnostic care for people with Alzheimerâ€™s disease. This California Guideline for Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Management became the stimulant for numerous quality improvement projects in health care organizations throughout California including Kaiser Permanente, Scripps Health Care, UC San Diego Health Care and SCAN Health Plan.

This past fiscal year alone, we responded to 328 emergencies and assisted 457 families, opening 10 shelters and activating feeding canteens more than 15 times. This is only possible through our dedicated staff and volunteers taking the required training, being on-call, and working as a team to support the communities we serve. It is this preparation that allows us not only to respond to emergencies here but also support national operations such as Superstorm Sandy. To date, we have deployed four Emergency Response Vehicles and more than 160 staff and volunteers from Los Angeles to the East Coast. In addition to supporting relief operations, deployment also helps our local volunteers to get the hands-on experience they will need when a large disaster occurs here at home.

 KEY ACHIEVEMENTS<br>
 
 
 * Laying the groundwork for $40 billion in transportation funding: our CEO Summit at the City Club on Bunker Hill brought together prominent business leaders to get everyone together on the need to dramatically increase the momentum for change. The next day's LA Times announced the support by business leaders for a sales tax for transportation, and the LA Business Journal featured a dedicated editorial praising the event and the newfound sense of possibility. Speakers included David Fleming (recent Chair of the LA Chamber, and Chair of BizFed), Bob Lowe (Chairman/CEO of Lowe Enterprises), Pam O'Connor (Metro Board Chair), among others; event partners included Metro, the LA Chamber, and BizFed.
 
 
 <br><br>
 
 
 * Programs attracting key elected officials and policymakers. Our events have attracted leaders from the LA City Council & Mayor's Office, Santa Monica City Council, Assembly, Senate, Metro Board, etc.

Composed of a senior corps of emerging platform strategists, Curious Catalyst engages subject matter expertise as well as citizen stakeholders to develop breakthrough MVPs. We use a license model to incentivize project pioneers to open the core of the solutions we develop to other mega-cities. For example, when we design a business model for addressing food deserts in Los Angeles, the plug-and-play core â€œExperience Blueprintâ€ will be released to other cities for a nominal license fee; this positions the pioneers as leaders in a given area of urban challenge but benefits the broader global community while providing upside to the initial stakeholder. And we provide consulting services for localization and contextual adjustment.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>This disruptive business model was developed by founder, Kaz Brecher, as part of an accelerator project at THNK, the new Amsterdam School for Creative Leadership. The members of the Curious Catalyst team have collectively worked on strategy and implementation of solutions for everyone from the Library of Congress to Microsoft, and Disney to Oprah. Weâ€™ve done hundreds of agile sprints in emerging platforms, and our expertise is easily applied to the complexities of urban challenges facing Los Angeles.</p>

 In the mid-2000â€™s, the facilities thrived as a center for at-risk youthâ€”servings over 300 students per year. During this time frame, Art Share L.A. created its FACT program (Families and Communities Together). This program, created in collaboration with Stevenson Middle School in Boyle Heights and the LA County Probation Department, has helped families in crises for 8 yearsâ€”pairing trained social workers with families in creative and expressive environments to explore conscious and constructive problem-solving skills. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The economic downturn of 2008 hit Art Share L.A. in an almost devastating manner. The organization and its management struggled to make ends meet. By the summer of 2011, all staff had been cut and the agency was operating on a shoe-string budget. Property buy-out offers were on the table, but the new board of directors was dedicated to keeping Art Share L.A. owned and operated by and for the community. The new directors, under guidance of city planner, Elizabeth Peterson, brought the facilities into a new era, complete with new paint job and new staff. 
 
 
 
 
 
 In the summer of 2012, Art Share L.A. ventured on a partnership that would bridge the worlds of outdoor advertising and street artâ€”two sectors who until recently have rivaled for public space and the rights to it. In March of 2013, Art Share L.A. (in collaboration with Casey Zoltan of Known Gallery and 15 of the cities most renowned street artists) launched the second installment of the project. Since inception in 2012, more than two-dozen street artists have legally showcased on billboards through a rotating citywide gallery exhibit.

Our work demonstrates the impact of advocacy by parents, students, teachers, small business owners, and government, corporate, and private foundation supporters. During 2012, 4,538 unique arts advocates sent 16,259 letters to policymakers through the Arts for LA website on 12 local campaigns. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Our most recent advocacy success was the unanimous passage of the â€œArts at the Coreâ€ resolution by the Los Angeles United School District (LAUSD) on October 9, 2012. The resolution affirms and protects arts education as core curriculum, like science and math, and its impact has been nationwide. Arts for LA has been contacted by education advocates in New York City and Chicago who want to pursue similar resolutions for their districts. This success is even more remarkable considering that in December 2011, LAUSD had announced its plans to eliminate arts education for elementary students in response to budget cuts. Throughout the spring of 2012, Arts for LA devoted its communication platform to generate public awareness of the issue, and our efforts resulted in 4,928 letters to LAUSDâ€™s school board members and Superintendent Dr. John Deasy, PhD. In June, LAUSD reached an agreement that restored arts education for elementary school students, which laid the foundation for passage of the â€œArts at the Coreâ€ resolution.
 
 
 
 
 
 The success of our campaigns has demonstrated the value and role of advocacy, not only for arts and culture groups, but for nonprofits of all disciplines. In 2012, the Los Angeles City Admin. Office recommended the city abolish a program that allows a number of nonprofits to pay $1 rent per year on city-owned buildings, instead of market rate rent. This measure would save the city $3 million, but endanger, if not eliminate, the nonprofits that provide health, arts, education, conservation, and other human services to vulnerable populations. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Arts for LA rallied arts organizations and other community stakeholders such as LA Conservation Corps, ONE Generation, People Coordinated Services, West LA FamilySource Center, and others. Through the Arts for LA communications platform, over 3,000 advocates wrote to the LA City Council urging them to require a public hearing, including an economic impact statement on the nonprofit infrastructure. The City Council agreed, and the proposal has not been pursued since our stakeholders took action.
 
 
 
 
 
 Campaigns such as this have generated thoughtful responses to advocates from public officials, while the focus on positive, solutions-based advocacy has earned the organization and its network of advocates the respect of local policymakers, who are increasingly willing to meet with organizational leadership. Arts for LA believes these indicators point to a more engaged and empowered creative community, and policymakers who are recognizing the role of arts & culture in the health of the region.",,,2013016

 Since then we have been asked to be a part of Los Angeles official green business certification program, sharing administrative duties with the Los Angeles Community College District (LACCD) and Los Angeles Visitor and Tourism Board. AEP will assess and administer any business in the arts and culture sector (Museums, Theaters, Art Galleries, Dance Studioâ€™s, Production Offices, Arts related non-profits and Cultural Centers.) LACCD will handle restaurants, garages and general offices and Los Angeles Visitor and Tourism Board will handle green hotels and lodgings. Any business that goes through AEP certification will be recognized as a green business by the City of Los Angeles. We also have the exact same arrangement with the City of Santa Monica and their green business administrator Sustainable Works. This is a powerful new system of greening businesses through non-profits rather then city departments and is unlike any in the country or world.

It started at 6:00 a.m., to coincide with the time of the attacks. We collected thousands of pounds of food for pantries, which was nice, but what was great was that the more than 500 helpers included corporate groups; school groups; groups from churches, temples, and a mosque; fraternities and clubs; vets; residents from group homes, including people in recovery and homeless people; and individuals and families. Everyone helped sort and pack the food, and then we all broke bread together. We had a great, donated buffet, and lots of tables set up, with loads of people inside and out, enjoying one another's company on that sad and somber day. And Max turned up. He jumped right in and was great company for everyone he talked. He had a wonderful time, too. Getting Max, the world's most reluctant volunteer to participate, was an excellent achievement. (Next time, we'll get him to bring some food, too.)
 
 
 
 
 
 Also: Since 1999, we've engaged and empowered more than 250,000 people of all ages and backgrounds in thousands of community services projects throughout California. For many, helping at Big Sunday is the beginning of a longterm commitment to a nonprofit, whether it's Big Sunday or another group. We have worked with hundreds of nonprofits, both local and national. We have made major capital improvements at all kinds of nonprofit sites, including Phoenix House, The Venice Family Clinic, North Valley Rescue Mission, Operation Ready Families and many more. We have collected and donated tens of thousands of books; tens of thousands of pounds of food; truckloads of clothing; roomsful of furniture. We started as a single day or service and now have a year-round community calendar listing more than 1000 ways to help each year; Monthly on Melrose, which is a different special event for a different nonprofit, every month; our annual holiday giving list, with more than 150 ways to help at the holidays; Youth In Action, a special toolkit for civic-minded kids; The End of the Month Club, our monthly food drive to fight hunger; theBIGlist, our cool online wish list for nonprofits and donors; theARTlist, our upcoming list for all kinds of artists of all ages to publicize their work; and our ability to fill emergency needs by reaching out to the Big Sunday community.

 In one program I designed we taught teens to read by using their own music, asking them to rap freestyle into the computer and then sending them home with a CD, their lyrics and the assignment to produce a 2 song album in 9 weeks. Not only did all students complete the assignment, a large portion of the students improved their reading and writing tremendously, many jumping multiple grade levels in a matter of weeks while showing great motivation for the process of creative music production. Two students won demos in local studios for recording contracts and overall engagement and retention of this at-risk population was the highest we witnessed in years of teaching.
 
 
 
 
 
 I saw the sadness, desperation, the expressions of fear that come from feeling lost - and I also saw that the creative arts education can rapidly change this situation and the motivation of the individual learner.
 
 
 
 
 
 Our team at EDDEFY met at Singularity University's graduate program in 2012 at NASA/Ames where we galvanized around a mission to provide educational access to anyone, anywhere, anytime. We saw mobility, ubiquity of resources, tracking and personalization to be essential along with sharing the most engaging learning opportunities available to motivate individuals to be their best and achieve their goals. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Many of us could not SEE THE PATH TO MASTERY and so we began creating the EDDEFY toolkit and this MASTERY campaign for Los Angeles. We aim to map and visualize learning for the city of LA.

ERW Design (www.erwdesign.com) is an award-winning, multi-disciplinary architecture firm whose work is based on the intersection of the built form and the landscape. Founded in 1999, ERW Design has completed over 40 institutional, residential, and landscape projects throughout the Los Angeles area. 
 
 
 ERW Design is experienced working with a wide array of neighborhoods and communities throughout Los Angeles. Some notable projects include the Marsh Park Pavilion at Marsh Park, the first regional park on the LA River in Elysian Village; the Vista Hermosa Park structures in downtown Los Angeles; Beverly Gardens Park Restoration in Beverly Hills; and an all-ages exhibition gallery at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.
 
 
 ERW Design received the Grand Prize, as well as the award for best Civic Project for their work at Vista Hermosa Park. The project received Best Urban Project by the Los Angeles AIA in 2009. 
 
 
 SALT Landscape Architects (www.s-a-l-t.com) is a Los Angeles-based design studio focused on creating enduring, engaging, and innovative landscapes on a range of scales. The firmâ€™s name, derived from â€œsalt of the earth,â€ reflects the sense of grounding that we strive for in all of our projects. 
 
 
 SALT has been working with the Trust for Public Land (www.tpl.org), also our partner for Park-in-a-Box, over the past year to bring significant changes to the Avalon community of Los Angeles, south of downtown. SALT developed a master plan for the pedestrian opportunities in the community, including a thorough analysis of the existing pedestrian challenges and degraded mobility infrastructure. We also developed designs for the conversion of more than 1,800 linear feet of alleyways into storm water infiltration centers and enhanced pedestrian and bicycle pathways. This project has already received over $1.7 million in funding to date in public funding from various local, county and state agencies and expects to have the construction documents completed by the end of 2013.
 
 
 SALT also co-founded the Take Back the Boulevard (TBTB) initiative in 2011 in the Eagle Rock neighborhood of northeast Los Angeles. TBTB is seeking to bring significant pedestrian improvements to Colorado Boulevard through a grass-roots and community based effort, focused on recapturing a portion of the public right-of-way from automobile traffic and reallocating it for other modes of transportation. Through a series of outreach efforts facilitated by the TBTB steering committee, the initiative has brought the community together to identify ways of making Colorado Boulevard more humanely-scaled and more of a â€œMain Streetâ€ with a vibrant business district and pedestrian life. 
 
 
 Both SALT and ERW Design continue to seek unique opportunities to work closely with local constituencies to develop innovative approaches to remaking Los Angeles incrementally more humane and sustainable.",,,2013062

In 2000, after a successful capital campaign, the Club celebrated the grand opening of its new 30,000 sq.ft. facility at 2232 Lincoln Boulevard. The new Club features a basketball court and gymnasium, stage area, kitchen, teen/career center and store, counseling department, community room, music room, wellness center, art studio, activity center, computerized learning center, library, and administrative offices. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The past year has been an amazing culmination of opportunity meeting execution. Through the generosity of our donors and volunteers and with the care and commitment of our staff, we have created an environment where reaching new heights is the norm, and excellence prevails in many areas of the Club.
 
 
  
 
 
 Since 2006, we have increased the number of college scholarships distributed annually from one to eight with the total amount annually distributed increasing from $1,000 to over $60,000.
 
 
  
 
 
 In the fall of 2010, the Club completed its fourth major renovation project in the last five years when it opened its doors to the newly renovated teen lounge. The renovation of the teen lounge comes after major renovations of the art center, technology center, and gymnasium.
 
 
  
 
 
 In 2011, the Club chartered its fifth after-school site at Mark Twain Middle School, where we will service middle school students through our Tomorrowâ€™s Leaders, PowerHour homework help, the arts, sports, fitness, and recreation programs.
 
 
  
 
 
 These services are critical and are coming at a time, when children and families need the support of the community to navigate the challenging waters of unemployment, decreased government spending, and unforgiving streets.

The establishment of this clinic has streamlined care for chronically ill patients with brain cancer, and the demands placed on accommodating patients within this clinic highlights the need for this integral service to the population of LA County as a whole. Over the past decade, we have treated thousands of patients with complex benign and malignant brain and spine tumors using various combinations of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, and have always strived to maintain the highest comparable standards with regard to quality of care as we have done for patients at our affiliated USC Norris Cancer Center (one of three National Cancer Institute-designated Cancer Centers in Southern California). Perhaps most importantly, we have maintained an open door policy in treating all-comer patients with brain cancer referred from dozens of hospitals all over Southern California, and have never turned a patient with the diagnosis of a brain tumor away based on insurance or socioeconomic status. We have enrolled hundreds of patients in some of the latest and most promising clinical trials available worldwide. Our program has been the major site of the Los Angeles County Cancer Surveillance Program, and chronicles information on all new cancer cases in LA County (approximately 30,000 patients per year). The LA County Cancer Surveillance Program is now the largest contributing registry to the NCI-funded Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. Many of our Brain Tumor Center physicians are internationally recognized for their contributions to patient care and clinical-translational research, and have won numerous awards in recognition of their research contributions.

We have also received generous start-up funding from the Annenberg Foundation and the Kaplan Family Foundation for our Connections Program.
 
 
 
 
 
 Since its inception, the Connections Program has had 100% participation. The Connections Program is currently serving 747 students in grades 7-12. During the 2011-2012 school year:
 
 
 â€¢ Connectors helped 18 seniors prepare 262 applications to 63 colleges.
 
 
 â€¢ 100% of 2012 seniors graduated from high school 
 
 
 â€¢ All high school graduates were college-bound
 
 
 â€¢ Connectors increased communication between home and school (by meeting with family members and providing social service referrals)
 
 
 
 
 
 Connectors have made great strides creating a college-going culture on our middle and high school campus. This year, Connectors established â€œCollege Clubsâ€ for middle school students and our juniors and seniors to encourage college and career exploration. These after-school clubs provide fundamental information on the college admissions process and help students explore their career interests. Students learn how to research colleges online, navigate the admissions process, and receive the information and guidance when applying to colleges and universities.

We began simply by examining what was growing in our own neighborhood in Silver Lake, and we found numerous overlooked fruit trees, often a bit neglected, growing in or over public space. We mapped them, wrote manifestos about them, documented them and then brought people to see them. <p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Our neighborhood began to transform: more trees appeared and people started picking the fruit. We mapped other neighborhoods nationwide, and were invited around the world to create a range of work on things from the vast expanse of berries in the arctic to the contentious history of banana plantations in South America. <p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Our most ambitious project to date was EATLACMA, a yearlong residency at LACMA in 2010, which included an exhibition, five artist-commissioned gardens, several events including two Public Fruit Adoptions, and a day-long curated performance and intervention in the museumâ€™s spaces that broke attendance records. It was funded in part by a $100,000 MetLife Foundation Community Connections Grant, and received over 100 million press impressions. EATLACMA included our Public Fruit Theater, an intimate amphitheater built with recycled city sidewalks around an orange tree, which delivered a slow and beautiful performance of the seasons: blooming, leafing and fruiting. <p>
 
 
 
 
 
 In the last three years weâ€™ve had two projects titled Accion Fruta Urbana, one in Tijuana, Mexico, and the other in Madrid, Spain, as part of ARCO 2010. In the latter, we worked to populate a working-class quarter of the city with 50 fruit trees. Temporarily impeded by an uncooperative municipal government, the trees found a home in a communal park, Esta es una plaza. The project was accompanied by a billboard and bus shelter campaign in over 300 locations, which contributed tremendously to raising public consciousness. <p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Most recently, we completed the new Del Aire Public Fruit Park in Hawthorne, near the intersection of the 405 and 105 freeways. Funded by an award from the Los Angeles County Arts Commission, the park is planted with an â€œeyeâ€ of 27 fruit trees, with 65 trees â€œadoptedâ€ and planted by residents in the neighboring streets. It received a tremendous reception in the press, and KCET is currently shooting a documentary on the park and our collaboration.<p>

In 2011 we co-presented the STATE OF THE ARTS with the PGA: Producers Guild of America and also hosted a think tank to address how arts and media professionals could help to address 15 global challenges through their work. The event was held in The Vortex Dome, a 50 foot immersive dome theater and was streamed globally. During the think tank several ideas were generated including an idea to create an educational program called MYTHIC CHALLENGES that would help to inspire youth to create modern day myths addressing the 15 Global Challenges and create films about their stories. In 2012 the first class was launched and students from Grove Cleaveland High School Media Lab in Reseda collaborated with High School students in Afghanistan through the internet to create Mythic Challenges projects. Fantastic! Seven films were created by these students. To view these films visit the c3 site page and scroll down to the bottom of the page: http://consciouscreativity.com/millennium-project/mythic-challenges Not only did the students learn about mythic challenges storytelling and filmmaking they also learned about what a professional futurist is and does.

With 31 community groups organized in 11 strategic counties, California Calls is mounting a long-term, ambitious civic engagement program to build a powerful base of voters in low-income and immigrant communities of color, with a special focus on educating and turning out new, occasional and young voters.
 
 
 
 
 
 California Calls member organizations work on many issues: health and human services, education, immigrantâ€™s rights, environmental justice, housing, jobs, living wages. In addition to the electoral mobilization program, the member organizations employ a broad range of strategies to advance their work: grassroots community organizing, leadership development, policy research, direct action, legislative advocacy, and public policy campaigns. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The long-term goal of California Calls is to develop a bottom-up statewide alliance of organizations with the power to turn out 500,000 supporters of progressive tax and fiscal reforms who normally do not participate in elections. In addition, California Calls actively works to build collaborations with other statewide organizations who share the same vision of renewing the â€œCalifornia Dreamâ€ wherein the state can offer a world class public education system, a vital social safety net, and a modern public infrastructure to support dynamic and sustainable economic growth.
 
 
 
 
 
 Since 2009, California Calls has identified more than 574,000 unlikely voters in 11 counties across the state who express support for progressive tax and budget policies. In November 2012, the California Calls Action Fund supported Proposition 30 (see video), a ballot measure which has already generated over $6 billion annually for Californiaâ€™s K-12 schools and the UC/CSU higher education systems. Through a massive â€œground gameâ€ of get-out-the-vote activities, California Calls contacted 293,613 voters, of which 80% made it to the polls! This compared with average statewide voter turnout of only 71%. These voters represented a crucial margin of victory, providing over 3% of the statewide vote total for new funding for education, social service and public safety programs. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Key groups of historically under-represented constituencies voted at even higher margins: 
 
 
 
 
 
 â€¢ Among young voters age 25 to 34, California Calls supporters voted at a rate of 72% compared to the statewide average of only 57%--a 15% point increase!
 
 
 â€¢African-American voters identified by California Calls as supporters participated at a rate of 85%, compared to 67% of African-American voters statewideâ€”an 18% point increase!

 James is completing his senior year at Evans Community Learning Center in the heart of Downtown Los Angeles. James is on probation for being involved with a grand theft auto incident. He would like to attend San Diego State University in the fall. His interests lie in Human Behavior and Philosophy. James has participated in community service activities such as feeding the homeless and neighborhood beautification projects. People who meet James find it hard to believe he has any association to Probation. However, James recently shared that, â€œI thought I was living life the way it was supposed to be lived in the inner-city. I just didnâ€™t know better. I now realize there are options and opportunities.â€

BLOOM is also one of five philanthropic initiatives featured in Where Do We Go from Here?: Philanthropic Support for Black Men and Boys, a report published in October 2012 by The Foundation Center. The report examines U.S. foundation giving explicitly in support of Black males by issue area, type of support, and geographic area served.

Part of that fight has been to ensure that the children in our communities receive a quality education and cultural teachings. Through educational reform advocacy, educational programs, and active roles in the design and implementation of new school structures, CARECEN seeks solutions everyday to the obstacles our youth face in achieving success and in the development of the arts and culture component that defines their and that of their families personal struggle. 
 
 
 Currently CARECEN offers an Art & Culture Program for children and youth in the Pico Union/Westlake Community, as well as, a dedicated Parent Center, which provides families education around the role of community schools. Each program is based around the need of the community to never lose sight of the roots of their native culture and an in-depth analysis of the continuous struggle for immigrant children to receive a quality education. 
 
 
 CARECEN has offered after school programs for youth since 1992; then called, Nueva Generacion (New Generation), the original program was focused on helping youth learn work skills and become familiar with the computer. In 1998, when the agency moved into its 30,000-sq.ft community center it was able to expand the age range of participants as well as the programs offered. From 1998 until today, education programs have included academic enrichment, cultural projects, a summer youth program, parent involvement, field trips and a special focus on being college-ready.
 
 
 With the continuous educational cutbacks on all levels (local, state and federal), schools within a 5-10 mile radius of CARECEN will experience continuous setbacks, for example â€“ the cuts to arts and culture, parent centers and academic enrichment programs. Given this reality, CARECEN feels it is important to open its doors to the community and provide children and youth the best educational experience during their lengthy break from school.",,,2013029

Our show now regularly features more than upwards of 175 performers representing a wide variety of dance companies, studios, individual choreographers, and even school programs. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The performance opportunities provided by Dancescape have helped emerging artists to gain representation, exposure, and experience as well as network with leading professionals in the industry. Numerous dancers have gotten jobs, joined companies, or been asked to dance in new works or projects as a direct result of Dancescape.
 
 
 
 
 
 The students who participate - whether from private dance studios or those who participate in school programs - are given the chance to watch professional dancers in an intimate setting, to perform in a state of the art facility outside of their usual environment, and interact with other students their age from different programs who specialize in styles of dance that are different from their own. They gain perspective on the role arts can play in the world at large, beyond the walls of the classroom, while simultaneously developing the discipline, responsibility, and self-esteem that comes with participating in a performance related activity.
 
 
 
 
 
 In 2007, we began working with DonorsChoose.org to identify the local arts and music education programs we wished to support. Since then, we have fully or partially funded 39 classroom proposals, mostly in high needs, high poverty schools. These programs have reached more than 6,000 students in Southern California.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 In 2011, we officially incorporated, and were also awarded tax-exempt status.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 This year, we are preparing for our 15th Dancescape production. The show will be moved to Club Nokia, downtown in the LA Live complex, and will be hosted by the most recent winner of â€œSo You Think You Can Dance,â€ Chehon Wespi-Tschopp. We have the support of renowned choreographer Denise Leitner, the Bloc Dance Agency and numerous other dance studios and choreographers throughout Los Angeles. This will be our first Gala Event, and we could not be more excited for it!
 
 
 
 
 
 In 2013, we are taking our first steps toward a full fledged â€œDancescape Edâ€ program. We are working with La Leadership Academy (LALA) to provide a one week of dance instruction to two different age groups during summer school. Dancescape will identify the dance instructor, cover the costs of all necessary background checks and clearance procedures, and also pay the salaries of both the dance instructor and the LALA staff member who will assist with the program. The curriculum will be developed together with the LALA faculty to determine what will be best suited to the students in attendance. We will be conducting careful evaluation of the studentâ€™s performance and participation during the program, and also solicit feedback from the LALA administration so that we can implement any necessary changes or improvements bef",,,2013031

After participating in our community outreach events or after school programming, we have seen countless children â€“ most of whom are themselves challenged by poverty, community violence and limited educational opportunities â€“ gain a sense of empowerment as they discover that they have an innate capacity to make life better for someone else. As their sense of pride and self-esteem grows, they become eager to reach out and help in their communities.
 
 
 Some of Children Mending Heartsâ€™ additional achievements include:
 
 
 - Providing free, sustained after school programming for hundreds of youth living in Los Angeles neighborhoods challenged by drugs, gang violence and poverty;
 
 
 - Developing a CMH blog that educates thousands of Los Angeles parents and youth about volunteerism, Global Citizenship and positive social activism;

 - Holding large-scale public childrenâ€™s events in Los Angeles, Las Vegas and New York, where hundreds of children learned about the importance of volunteerism and Global Citizenship and participated in projects to help their local communities;

With a focus on young children, we were one of the first professional providers of foster care in the nation. Childrenâ€™s Bureau was a vital partner in establishing the Community Chest, a precursor to United Way and played a key role in establishing the USC School of Social Work. In the 1980â€™s we transitioned from focusing on treatment and moving on to prevention as a key means of keeping children safe from harm. Our successes in the critical battle to prevent child abuse earned us a highly regarded reputation. The California Department of Social Servicesâ€™ Office of Child Abuse Prevention awarded Childrenâ€™s Bureau a grant to form the Family Resource Center Technical Training and Support Team which acts as a training model for other organizations. Childrenâ€™s Bureau continues to be awarded numerous contracts and grants to implement county programs designed to protect vulnerable children and enhance their lives.

 <p>In 2008, we successfully completed a $22 million capital campaign and opened our new headquarters in one of the poorest, most densely populated neighborhoods in Los Angeles. From this center we launched the Magnolia Community Initiative - a ground-breaking model for large scale community mobilization where children, especially those under age 5 living in the most vulnerable neighborhoods, break all records of success in their education and health milestones and in the nurturing they receive. </p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>Our Magnolia Community Initiative has rapidly gained the attention and recognition of national leaders, policy-makers and funders including members of the U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, The Tides Foundation, United Way Worldwide, Gates Foundation and East LA Initiative. Through our work with the UCLA Center for Healthier Children, Families and Communities, we have collected and mapped the school readiness of young children in a 500 block area of Los Angeles.

 <P>Arguably, the most frustrating situations for educators and parents alike include: not being able to support children by giving each child the tools he/she needs to navigate through his or her day with confidence and independence.<p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <P>Our success story: in the fall of 2012, Karen met Lola, a bright, kind-hearted, eager and willing third-grader, the type of student that inspires any teaching heart. As the first week of the school year unfolded, Karen observed Lola, despite her powers of persistence, struggle consistently with recalling/retrieving information that she needed to followed multi-step directions. <P>
 
 
 
 
 
 <P>Karen a veteran third grade teacher, knows that by third grade, kids start to take pride in â€œdoing things on their ownâ€ and too many reminders by a teacher elicit painful embarrassment. Fortunately, she had just participated in â€œStructuring the Learning Environmentâ€ a special ed professional development series offering strategies to help special needs kids get through â€œtasksâ€. Building on what was learned, she began to create work systems on strips of paper for Lola that broke done daily routines and academic situations into â€œone step at a time listsâ€ and added a little animal clip for Lola to move as she progressed through each step. Karen, in collaboration with Lola's Mom, Carrie, formalized these systems for Lola by posting them in her planner and empowering her to check off her tasks as she went - allowing her to feel far more in control and independent. <P>
 
 
 
 
 
 <P>It was almost magical: Lola went from being frozen to completely independent, with her â€œwork systemâ€ at hand. Building on Lolaâ€™s achievement, Karenâ€™s principal requested that she share her strategies with other teachers, who in turn successfully applied work systems with their struggling students. <P>
 
 
 
 
 
 <P>The recent course Karen had taken, coupled with the perfect timing of having Lola as student along with the professional development she shared with other teachers made Karen realize just how many kids would in the future, benefit tremendously by a ""work system"" like she had informally developed for Lola, and an idea took root: an App version.<P>",,,2013095

Having both grown up outside of Los Angeles, both Keely Hopkins and Samuel Alleyne noticed the lack of social connectedness and civic engagement among youth in L.A. , particularly among underserved communities. As a response to this, Keely Hopkins and Samuel Alleyne launched Youth 4C, a new initiative aimed at increasing leadership, advocacy, and volunteerism among youth. Instead of just focusing on preparing youth as the next generation of leaders, Youth 4C recognizes youth as the leaders of today that are capable of advocating and organizing for change in their communities. 
 
 
 <br /><br />
 
 
 Youth 4C is a dynamic and rapidly growing initiative that already has two projects underway in the first few months of launching. Youth 4C has developed an entrepreneur curriculum for children aged 7-15 that will be implemented this summer at Los Angeles City College. Youth 4C has also partnered with the College of the Bahamas to develop and lead an international youth summit that will bring together youth from urban and rural areas to tackle top issues affecting their futures. 
 
 
 <br /><br />
 
 
 Prior to launching Youth 4C, Keely Hopkins and Samuel Alleyne both came from non-profit and government relations backgrounds. Keely Hopkins, a government relations attorney and development specialist, has led statewide political campaigns, advocated on behalf of non-profits before state legislatures, and has led youth advocacy trainings in South Los Angeles. Samuel Alleyne, who specializes in project management and development strategy, comes from an extensive background in youth leadership and engagement. Samuel has served as a project coordinator the California Department of Public Health, has organized and led international youth campaigns, and has taught youth leadership and entrepreneurial classes at CSU and LACC.",,4102036,2013105

It gained worldwide recognition and the national spotlight with its open design competition, WPA2.0-Working Public Architecture, the results of which were presented to lawmakers in Washington DC and key members of President Obamaâ€™s urban advisory team. cityLABâ€™s important role in Los Angeles is increasingly evident through its frequent mention in the news, its work to revitalize Westwood Village, its studies about the ways high speed rail and transit systems can improve civic life, its role in advancing new urban policy, and its championing of good design in our region. cityLAB is successful when it explores new ideas for urban design that reach the public, studentsâ€”our next generation of urban activists, and urban leaders of all stripes.

We promote educational and interpersonal practices that encourage participants to find their own voices, become independent thinkers, be leaders within their community, and develop into adults who are good neighbors and active citizens who value learning as a means to personal growth, economic benefit and social change.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>During every session of CityLife, participants tackle an urban issue and propose solutions to those challenges. Middle school students have designed an urban park, created public art for a redevelopment district, proposed an â€œAlley Districtâ€ in Downtown, designed possible replacements for the 6th Street Bridge across the Los Angeles River. In addition, they wrote â€œThe Sacred Spaces of Wilshire Boulevard, a Guide for Kids, by Kids,â€ published jointly by CityLife and the Los Angeles Conservancy, and remains on the Conservancy website (http://www.curatingthecity.org/sacred_spaces_kids.pdf). This project, funded by a grant from the History Channel, was a finalist for an award, which allowed us to take two participants to Washington, DC, where, among other adventures, they got to meet with staffers of Senator Feinstein and watch a debate on the Senate floor.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>High school students created a Peopleâ€™s Promenade to connect the residential community of the William Mead Project with the Cornfield. This project was featured in an exhibit, RETHINK LA, Perspectives on a Future City, in 2011 at the A + D Museum. Students at Lincoln High created a brochure, Exploring the Centennial, using the schoolâ€™s Centennial Celebration as the impetus to identify and propose projects that would improve the campus.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>Many of our participants have had their first exposure to classical music and have brought their entire families on CityLife outings to the Hollywood Bowl, also a first for them. Families have attended CityLife activities at MOCA, again often for the first time. And all have experienced broadening their horizons by exploring neighborhoods outside of their own, often for the first time. They have learned to examine evidence, explore issues from different perspectives, ask questions and develop opinions.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>We know that many of our former CityLifers have gone on to attend and complete college and are starting out in careers in education, the arts, web design and marketing.

Since its inception, the partnership between MÃ¡s and MLA has aimed to create sustainable communities comprised of innovative civic buildings, well-planned open spaces, and green infrastructure. In our combined efforts we employ a diverse method of research, planning, and design. All of our projects begin with a foundational immersive research phase, which uncovers new design considerations - leading to employable, innovative solutions.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>In 2010 the founders of LA-MÃ¡s, Inc. conducted a three-week immersive research program in partnershipâ€¨with Cincinnati Childrenâ€™s Hospital Medical Center in which we identified impediments to care for children with cerebral palsy.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>Through this research we identified â€¨a need for hospital guidelines that prioritize the provision of spatial accommodations for children who had the greatest physical disabilities. This â€œHierarchy of Needsâ€ document served as a graphic outline for retrofitting childrenâ€™s hospitals in the United States as well as internationally.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>Mia Lehrer + Associates most important achievements have been their work on the Los Angeles River Revitalization Master Plan and Vista Hermosa Park. The Los Angeles River Revitalization Master Plan aims to transform 32 miles of concrete-lined river into public green space in the heart of one of Americaâ€™s most populated cities. As a vital work of civic infrastructure, the river has the potential to integrate a divided city. Key civic leaders joined forces to fund a visionary and technical look at changing the river into a new amenity, a source of socio-economic revitalization and a crucial step towards re-greening the â€œCity of Sprawl.â€
 
 
 ML+A designed Vista Hermosa Park as an urban watershed demonstration project that accommodates community and school recreational programs, integrated with an extensive network of introduced natural features and ecosystems. Located at the edge of a dense residential zone, the park incorporates active recreation including a synthetic turf soccer field, trails, water features, a childrenâ€™s adventure area and picnic areas in native habitat landscapes.</p>",,,2013116

Our first pilot program at Manual Arts High School provided 25 students with free dance instruction and resulted in all program graduates going on to attend 4-year universities, as well as continuing to pursue the arts. </p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>In 2012, we expanded our pilot program to include instruction in all three performing arts disciplines for 35 students at Dr. Maya Angelou Community High School. CITYstage also ensured high-quality instruction by employing working professionals in the LA performing arts community. During an Arts Discovery pilot, 25 students were taken to a variety of events including youth stand-up comedy at The Improv, Hubbard Street Dance Chicago at the Ahmanson Theatre and music and dance performances at the Colburn School. </p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>Students who visited the Colburn School live in the shadow of Downtown LA, yet had never visited the cultural center of their own city â€“ less than 3 miles from home. They marveled at the sight of LAâ€™s skyline; the discipline and training required to develop the ballet dancer physique and enjoyed the opportunity to apply their newfound knowledge of classical ballet positions in their discussion of the performance.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>In late 2012, CITYstage formed a partnership with All About Kids to serve 50 additional children who are victims of domestic violence and abuse. With this partnership, mental health support was made a new priority for CITYstage. </p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>In a conscious effort to provide our youth with leadership opportunities, we have added a former graduate of the Manual Arts High CITYstage pilot program to our Board of Directors as the first Student Director. We believe that including students on our board empowers them to become the next generation of leaders and advocates of LA culture and art. The Student Director role also gives a powerful voice to our most important stakeholders â€“ our students. We can only ensure the viability of our programs and build a lasting foundation for the arts if we actively listen to and address the needs of the communities we serve. </p>",,,2013039

Americaâ€™s second-largest city did not have an organization dedicated to the climate crisis. Since then, Climate Resolve has collaborated with scientists and government on cutting-edge scientific research, communicated science to the public, and created solutions to meet this generational challenge and make Los Angeles a more livable place today and in the future. Climate Resolve is the only organization exclusively working to get Los Angeles ready for 2050.
 
 
 
 
 
 <br><br>From the start, Climate Resolve forged key relationships with local researchers, including a lasting collaboration with UCLAâ€™s Dr. Alex Hall, a leading global expert on regional climate impacts. Dr. Hall developed a groundbreaking research method to model climate impacts at the local level. Released last June, â€œMid-Century Warming in the Los Angeles Region,â€ shows temperatures at the neighborhood level. Before this study, global climate models lumped Los Angeles into a single data point, ignoring key influences of the local landscape such as mountain ranges, coastal zones, and valleys. UCLA will continues its research on how other climate factors will transform Los Angeles by 2050.
 
 
 
 
 
 <br><br>In June 2012, Climate Resolve organized the public release of the UCLA study on mid-century warming that reveals, with unprecedented specificity, how much warmer Los Angeles will be by 2050. We now know that most neighborhoods will be warmer by 4 to 5 degrees (F) by 2050, and certain neighborhoods will experience especially severe changes. Hollywood, Eagle Rock, Downtown, and Watts will have between two to four more days per year of extremely high temperatures (above 95ÂºF). The San Fernando Valley, specifically Woodland Hills, Porter Ranch, Sunland and Sylmar will have twelve to twenty more days per year of extremely high temperatures.
 
 
 
 
 
 <br><br>After the release, Climate Resolve immediately began working on solutions to help Los Angeles prosper despite a warmer future and identified a cost-effective proven solution that works well in our climate, cool roofs. In March 2013, Climate Resolve launched a Hot City, Cool Roofs initiative to help homeowners and apartment dwellers cool down, by hosting a free conference attended by over 300 Angelenos including Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa who gave the keynote address. The Mayor announced that Los Angeles Building and Safety will develop new codes for the installation of reflective roofing materials on all homes and apartment buildings. LADWP announced it will expand cool roofs incentives to offset the cost of installation. 
 
 
 
 
 
 <br><br>Climate Resolve also developed a web-based centralized clearinghouse of information on solutions for climate change in Los Angeles located on the Do Something tab of the webpage C-CHANGE.LA. Here anyone can locate helpful ideas and incentives provided by local and states governments to support implementation and learn about success stories for climate acti",,,2015038

The agreement is the nationâ€™s first master project labor agreement approved by a regional transportation agency. The campaign ensured the agreement incorporate rigorous diversity language.

 <p>Community Monitoring System and Compliance Report Card: The LA Black Worker Center (BWC) developed and piloted a community monitoring tool to foster greater community and worker participation in decision-making processes and to increase access to information in the public contraction arena. The tool provides a mechanism for accountability to the community on public infrastructure investments and how jobs are created. The BWC worked with graduate students and undergraduate research interns to develop a community monitoring tool called the â€œPublic Construction Report Card,â€ which allows local residents and workers to evaluate and grade contractorsâ€™ past practices of employing a representative workforce. The report card evaluated contractors by using indicators such as community outreach and relations, accessibility, civil rights compliance, and transparency. The BWC supervised a team of BWC members and students who tested the report card tool in the field. The tool focused on four bidding contractors on the $1.7 billion Crenshaw/LAX Transit Corridor Project. Though this was a test of the tool, the results proved the public construction report card was a powerful monitoring mechanism in the high-stakes conversations with the contractors. In the end, each contractor team pledged to improve their â€œgradesâ€ and invited the BWC to be directly involved in their workforce pipeline process. The results of the report card pilot became the subject of high-level discussions between the office of Congresswoman Karen Bass, construction team executives, BWC members, and LA Metro staff. </p>",,,2013041

My first job out of college was shadowing an environmental reporter at CBS affiliate WRAL-TV in Durham, NC where I put together a reel which landed me my first job reporting, at NBC affiliate KIEM-TV in Eureka, CA. As morning and then evening anchor, I wrote, produced and filmed dozens of stories on the local environment, including a three-part special on Coho salmon and their plight, and stories on the headwaters of the old growth coastal redwoods in Humboldt County.

In 1998, Blinky received the Medaille dâ€™Excellence, presented in Switzerland to only 14 people worldwide in conjunction with the 50th anniversary of the United Nationâ€™s Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Blinky has earned over eighty-three awards for his work. He was selected by LA Mayor James Hahn, A&E Television and their Biography series as a 2002 Biography Community Hero for his service to LA. Blinky and the staff of CIS were featured in the November 2002 Reader's Digest article on ""Everyday Heroes"". In 2003, he received the Angel of Peace Award from the Violence Prevention Coalition of Greater LA, The SFV Interfaith Council Human Relations Award, Simon Bolivar Liberty Award and was appointed by Mayor Hahn to The Commission for Children, Youth & Their Families. The following is a sample of our achievements:
 
 
  
 
 
 Helped reduce gang-related deaths from 62 to 2 in one year
 
 
 Connected over 1300 youths with mentors 
 
 
 Helped place 554 people in jobs
 
 
 Helped place 220 people in college
 
 
 Conducted over 252 Sports Events with over 11,000 participants
 
 
 Conducted over 106 Peace Rallies/Community Events with over 50,000 attendees
 
 
 
 
 
 The Public Safety and peacekeeping efforts of CIS were the subject of a 1999 study, funded by the California State Legislature under AB 2650. Conducted by Cal State University at Northridge, it found the peace treaty to be effective in demonstrating peacekeeping strategies and recommended that it be replicated statewide. CIS has been named the â€œmodelâ€ program for gang intervention by the State of California, LA County and the City of LA.
 
 
 
 
 
 A most significant achievement occurred in 2012. After a journey that exceeded eleven years, CIS celebrated the grand opening of our Job Training & Opportunity Center on October 22, 2012. The Center has been a dream since 2001 when CIS first realized the positive impact that having a job had on helping youth continue their education and avoid violence. The Centerâ€™s construction was funded by a partnership between the County of Los Angeles, the City of Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency and the U. S. Dept. of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The Center represents an unprecedented joint partnership between CIS and LA County Probation. Under a ten-year rent-free lease, the brand new CIS Job Training & Opportunity Center sits on County land and houses job training, educational and other support services programs. County Probation officers share the facility with CIS to serve probationary youth, dropouts and their families.

The most notable victories are in the arenas of public safety, child welfare and education:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>Public Safety
 
 
 â€¢ One of the Coalitionâ€™s first campaigns â€œRebuild South Central Without Liquor Storesâ€ led to national recognition and implementation of the Coalitionâ€™s public health model, which uses nuisance abatement and land use policy to improve public safety. After the 1992 Civil Unrest, this campaign led to the prevention of the rebuilding of over 150 liquor stores that were destroyed. Following this success, Coalition members helped author the citywide Nuisance Abatement Ordinance that was passed in 2008 with support from City Councilwoman Jan Perry. </p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>Child Welfare
 
 
 â€¢ In 2004, South LA relative caregivers helped Community Coalition along with Casey Family Programs, the nationâ€™s largest provider of private foster care, secure and establish a kinship-care support center in South LA, the first ever in the region to combine services with advocacy and community organizing. Community Coalitionâ€™s Relative Caregivers have been one of the first organized and politicized constituencies in the nation to advocate around kinship-care policies and engage elected officials around providing relative caregivers public resources. Community Coalition has won significant and important victories over the years including reaching greater parity in the amount of monthly government payments compared to their foster care counterparts. </p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>Education
 
 
 â€¢ The â€œEqual Access to College Prepâ€ campaign achieved the landmark A-G Resolution in 2005, mandating that A-G college preparatory curriculum be made available in all schools in LAUSD. Coalition youth leaders recognized that the majority of South LA youth were not on track to graduate and were ineligible for college based on college pre-requirements. In this five-year effort, the Coalition trained student leaders to engage with elected officials and decision-makers. The Coalition also co-founded Communities for Educ</p>",,,2013044

This approach provides an exceptional opportunity for people of different backgrounds to build a shared understanding of the degree of health justice issues, allowing them to examine the root causes of health inequity. Among many accomplishments CHC has:
 
 
 -Trained hundreds of community members to conduct neighborhood level assessments to document food and physical activity inequities in South LA leading to local policy change.
 
 
 -Led the adoption of the Baldwin Hills Oilfield Community Standards District, South LA Fast Food Interim Control Ordinance and Fast Food Moratorium.
 
 
 -Convened the Re-Imagining Empty Space Tour and Summit: http://goo.gl/UOogw-

 C-Lab, Columbia University Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation: C-Labâ€™s research focuses on techniques for communication about urban environments. Work has included a vision plan for an estuary in South Korea, awarded the first-prize by the South Korean Urban Design Institute and a masterplan for Chengdu, China. C-Labâ€™s projects use mapping as a means of uncovering hidden potentials in cities. A current project maps new, unacknowledged â€˜neighborhoodsâ€™ of New York, based on commonalities and underlying networks of support. C-Labâ€™s project â€˜Locating the Middle Class in New York Cityâ€™ considers several possible criteria for defining the â€˜middle classâ€™ in the city, and uses GIS data to map their footprints. In researching aging urban populations, C-Lab has produced maps of NORCs (naturally occurring retirement communities) in NY, and is currently partnering with Tongji University in Shanghai to develop strategies and research for housing the aging middle class in China. 
 
 
 
 
 
 596 Acres: In 2011, 596 Acres launched an online interactive map of all the publicly owned vacant land in Brooklyn, NY. Since then they have expanded the map by compiling and releasing data for Manhattan, Queens, and the Bronx. Workshops and online networking tools have been created to help communities share knowledge with each other and build relationships with decision-makers. In the short time since the project launched, 8 new sites have been granted official status as community-run open spaces, and 6 additional sites have been pre-approved by city agencies who have jurisdiction over them. Currently 105 groups city-wide are in the process of campaigning for access to public land. With the recent release of vacant land data for the Bronx, the 596 Acres has mapped 1394 vacant lots in 4 of the 5 boroughs and is currently working on data for Staten Island.

It builds relationships and develops future leaders. We have a track record of innovative, impactful projects. Our project timelines favor deep, long-term engagement, with work measured in years not months. Our most important achievements are those we accomplish through our programs:
 
 
 
 
 
 Market Makeovers, Proyecto MercadoFRESCO, UCLA-USC Center for Population Health and Health Disparities (CPHHD) â€“ Funded by a five-year grant through the National Institutes of Health, we worked with Torres High School, Roosevelt High School, The Office of L.A. County Supervisor Gloria Molina (D-1), Volunteers of East L.A., other local organizations, and Nathan Cheng to transform two stores in East L.A.; two more are forthcoming in Boyle Heights.
 
 
 
 
 
 Market Makeovers, Healthy Eating Active Communities Initiative â€“ Funded by the California Endowment, we worked with The Accelerated School, The Office of L.A. Councilwoman Jan Perry (CD-9), and Nathan Cheng to transform two stores in South Los Angeles and created a media-rich online resource, www.marketmakeovers.org.
 
 
 
 
 
 PDUB Productions â€“ We worked with Pilipino Workers Center, HyperCities, UCLA REMAP, The Office of L.A. Councilman Eric Garcetti (CD-13), and local stakeholders to create an innovative youth media + civic engagement program through which local youth created digital content about Historic Filipinotown for distribution on multiple platforms: interactive Mobile Hi Fi Tours via mobile devices and a Pilipino Jeepney; and HyperCities, an online, map-based time-travel application. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Working with mostly low-income students of color, we have a strong track record of creating emerging adult leaders. Defying the odds of low college admission rates for East L.A. students, our entire class at ELARA was accepted into a four-year college. Past students have gone on to colleges and universities including Brown, NYU, Sarah Lawrence, UCLA, and UC-Berkeley. We have helped place youth leaders in local nonprofit jobs. We currently have four Proyecto MercadoFRESCO young adult leaders who are implementing Market Makeovers, training high school students, conducting cooking demos and social marketing campaigns.

It was phenomenally successful, with over 90 students coming to a one-teacher hosted Saturday school workshop. The students wanted to succeed, and virtually each student who attended the study workshop achieved academic results far beyond what was ""expected"" of them. That first workshop was the icing on the cake of a record-breaking academic year for 8th grade science at South Gate Middle School. However, while 86% of students passed their science exam, only 14% of students passed in mathematics.
 
 
 Two years later, smartestk12 finally became more than a pet project with funding by the Wolfen Foundation. We are now getting ready to procure content for all subjects and will become a tool that is perfectly suited to complement any classroom digital device.",,,2013167

The Los Angeles Basin Water Augmentation Study, begun in 2000, assembled a technical and funding advisory committee of federal, state, and local agencies and nonprofits to investigate the challenges and solutions for capturing stormwater in an urban environment. Early findings showed that it is safe to use polluted water runoff to increase our underground water supplies. Our publication â€œStormwater: Asset Not Liabilityâ€ (2nd ed. 2010) changed the way the region thinks about stormwater as a source of local water supplies.
 
 
 
 
 
 In 2005 the Council brought together additional partners to design and build the Elmer Avenue Neighborhood Retrofit Project. With phase I completed in 2010, the award-winning project is the most comprehensive â€œgreen streetâ€ in Los Angeles, converting a disadvantaged street in Sun Valley into a model of urban sustainability. Elmer Avenue captures and cleans more water than is used annually by the 24 houses on the block. The project is a focal point in the community with its meandering sidewalks, solar street lights, and diverse native and drought-tolerant plants. In 2012 the second phase, a mid-block alley-way, Elmer Paseo, was completed. The formerly asphalted alley now is a visually pleasing connector between the block and schools nearby that also captures and infiltrates water. 
 
 
 
 
 
 In 2005, the Council began management of the first watershed monitoring program in the region for the San Gabriel River. In 2007 we began management of a similar research program on the Los Angeles River. In 2011 we produced an authoritative State of the San Gabriel River report and symposium; the State of the Los Angeles River report and symposium will be produced in 2013. Both programs operate with a workgroup of stakeholders that set the annual research and monitoring agenda. 
 
 
 
 
 
 In 2008 we began work on a framework of indicators of watershed health in urban regions, the first such project in California to focus on cities. Completed in 2010, the project included a report card-style analysis of the state of the Arroyo Seco watershed. We are now working with the Santa Ana Watershed Project Authority on indicators development and we have a US EPA grant for the Los Angeles River Watershed. Executive Director Nancy Steele focuses her 2012-2013 Stanton Fellowship on this topic and we will have a UCLA graduate fellow from the Luskin School of Public Policy for 2013-2014.
 
 
 
 
 
 We host a Watershed Symposium series in which we bring divergent viewpoints together around timely topics. Examples include â€œRestoration and Development Challenges of the Los Angeles Riverâ€ (2013), â€œOn Track? High Speed Rail and the Los Angeles Riverâ€ (2010), and â€œNature Needs Water, Tooâ€ (2009). In 2012, the Council convened a multi-day international conference, â€œThe Mediterranean City: A Conference on Climate Change Adaptationâ€ which kicked off the Mediterranean Cities Climate Change Consortium (mc-4.org).",,,2015046

As a result, the County Registrar replaced the double-bubble ballot with a new ballot for DTS voters & the California Secretary of State revised ballot documents to clarify instructions statewide.</p><p>Prop 8 Trial Tracker: After gathering 140,671 signatures in three days calling for the Prop 8 trial to be televised, Courage launched Prop8TrialTracker.com, to promote transparency in the historic trial.

The online tool encouraged Californians to contact their legislators. One by one, we won the key votes.

In 2012, the guide contained the recommendations of 14 progressive organizations, important deadlines including voter registration & vote-by-mail, a Spanish version, & a mobile-optimized version for voters to easily access even while voting. The Progressive Voter Guide was viewed more than 252,365 times.<p>Prop 30: Courage Campaign played a key role in creating and passing Prop 30 in 2012, which produced much-needed public revenue. Courage and partners created a ballot initiative, The Millionaireâ€™s Tax, which was more progressive than the Governorâ€™s revenue proposal. As a result of Courageâ€™s research and organizing, along with partners, the Governor compromised to incorporate aspects of The Millionaireâ€™s Tax & made Prop 30 more progressive & ultimately more feasible to pass, providing important revenue for vital services and education.</p>",,,2013045

The significant movements weâ€™ve been part of building, including MoveOn.org, Live Earth, and CicLAvia, connect masses of people through simple, fun actions and transform our cultural understanding. Recent successes include the creation and funding of â€œSpin the Vote,â€ the first-ever national voter registration initiative for the dance music community, and the creation of the Paul Frank Art Supplies Round-Up, which generated close to $100K in cash and in-kind donations to support childrenâ€™s art programming nationally. </p><p>Our partner, the Los Angeles City College Foundation, has had several recent programmatic achievements in supporting low-income students.

 Cristina Victor/ L.A.Novela Special: ""As the daughter of Cuban-American exiles born and raised in Miami, exile experience is at the root of my desire to contextualize a sense of cultural displacement. Through performance/food events, I create environments where parody, contradiction and nostalgia are ingredients to addressing the complexities of representing identity. My practice often involves appropriating stereotypes present in mass media, specifically about Latinos, through my alter ego Miami. By way of humor, kitschy aesthetics, and 'authentic' food, I intend to seduce people into a situation in which they are immersed in stereotypes that are familiar yet very clearly performed.""
 
 
 
 
 
 Jennifer June Strawn/Superstition & Sustenance: ""Reportedly, superstitious belief is on the rise in modern society, neck-and-neck, it seems, with an ever-widening faith in scientific fact. The purpose of this project is to examine the mechanism of superstition, its role in our private and public lives, and its relevance. As sensitive creatures vulnerable to the harsh realities of the world we live in, superstition, as a complicated system of smoke-and-mirrorsâ€”regardless of its actual efficacyâ€”is necessary to our survival as a species. Through the scope of whimsy, play, and humor, my mission is to present superstition in the form of food and food-for-thought.""
 
 
 
 
 
 Japanther/69Â¢ Only: ""In our research, we found that a nickel in 1930 is valued, coincidentally, at 69Â¢ today. But while automats used to provide public dignity for pennies on the dollar, in 2013, questions about value, quality and service are still highly contended. Our intention in creating a 69Â¢ Only store is to provide a place where people can eat and hang out affordably in LA. Weâ€™re challenging ourselves to fully consider the costs and value of things that are too-often omitted in the conversation: labor, modern manufacturing processes, etc. It is without a doubt that we will need to rely on creative resource gathering, careful proportioning, DIY processes, and the generosity of friends and strangers to realize a 69Â¢ Only store.""",,5102082,2013181

When the Center first opened in 1978, it was the first and only resource for women living on Los Angelesâ€™ Skid Row.
 
 
 
 
 
 In 1986, DWC opened the United Statesâ€™ first permanent supportive housing for women, a program that has since been modeled as a national prototype. DWC now offers 119 units of permanent supportive housing among our two Residences to women who are primarily elderly, mentally ill, and/or physically disabled. More than 95% of the 500 women we have served through our Residence program have remained permanently housed.
 
 
 
 
 
 We have also scaled up our housing efforts beyond our own 119 apartments by piloting our Critical Time Intervention (CTI) model with clients housed off-site. Our CTI model, a proven evidence-based program launched in 2011, provides intensive case management for individuals transitioning out of chronic homelessness, ensuring that they have the support and access to resources they need to stay housed. DWC is also committed to sharing best practices; this April, our Director of Clinical Health Services and Lead CTI Case Manager will present DWC's CTI model at the Housing California Conference in Sacramento.
 
 
 
 
 
 As the need on Skid Row has continued to grow, DWC is grateful that we have been able to expand our programming and services, offered through our Day Center, Learning Center, two Residence locations, and on-site Medical and Mental Health Center. In 2012, DWC served 4,300 women with 90,000 meals, 23,000 showers, and 6,500 case management and counseling sessions. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Along with our direct service, DWC contributes to national and local policy discussions and to best practice research in service provision for people experiencing homelessness. In 2001, DWC spearheaded the Downtown Women's Action Coalition, addressing womenâ€™s policy and research needs. The coalition has since performed several needs assessments for women on Skid Row.
 
 
 
 
 
 DWCâ€™s well-reputed history is a testament to our mission and work in the community. DWC received a Los Angeles Office of the City Attorney Commendation in 1993, a Bank of America Neighborhood Excellence Initiative Neighborhood Builder Award in 2007, and ""Organization of the Year"" by the Los Angeles Business Journal in 2011.
 
 
 
 
 
 Several other organizations have utilized DWC as a prototype for creating services for homeless women, including Friends In Deed in Pasadena, and organizations in San Francisco, San Jose, Amarillo, Texas; and New Orleans.
 
 
 
 
 
 Finally, we attribute our long-term success to the overwhelming community support and volunteer efforts that allow us to make the greatest impact with limited resources. DWC has been recognized as a Blue Ribbon Service Enterprise by the state of California, and our model has been developed into a case study in best practices in nonprofit volunteer engagement.",,,2015051

In March 2012, thrdPlace sold its first, pilot services to Whole Foods Market.

To execute that campaign, Whole Foods identified, vetted and collaborated with over 200 Non Profits all on thrdPlace. </p><p>Since the pilot, thrdPlace has secured technology and distribution partnerships with ESRI and ADi Global. ESRI (www.ESRI.com) is global leader in geo-data mapping and visualization with $1B+ in annual revenue and 500K global clients.

Similarly, ADi Global (www.ADi.com) is contracted to distribute thrdPlace to its existing clients. ADi is a global leader in supply chain and philanthropic efficiencies. Their 300K clients around the globe face the same challenges in community outreach as ESRIâ€™s clients. ADi, therefore, integrates thrdPlace into its salesforce and distribute thrdPlace on our behalf.</p><p>Furthermore, HUB Los Angeles (www.theHUBLA.com) invited thrdPlace and its co-founders to be founding members in its membership club. HUB Los Angeles is dedicated to build the local, sustainable economy in Los Angeles and beyond. ThrdPlace and HUB are working together to certify Certified B Corporations and Benefit Corporations, display their impact on surrounding communities and invite community members to optimize their impact in LA.</p><p>April 3, 2013 thrdPlace will demo its services alongside Mayor Antonio Villarigosa as he debuts his MYLA311 App. The Mayorâ€™s mobile application will enable Angelenos to report issues in community development like potholes, illegal trash dumping and burst downed power lines directly to City officials for repair. ThrdPlace is 1 of 7 technologies invited by HUB Los Angeles and the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce to promote emerging civic engagement tools Angelenos can use to develop their communities.</p><p>ThrdPlace has achieved a lot in a short period of time with little money. Whatâ€™s more, industry leaders like StartEngine, ESRI, ADi Global, HUB Los Angeles and the LA Chamber of Commerce have all vetted thrdPlace.

In my earnest efforts at overcoming such limitations by streamlining design operatives, I founded UNITEDLAB as a private practice in 2006. It strives to develop and refine said operatives by periodically participating in international competitions while engaging in theoretical and adaptive research. To that effect, chosen topics vary from architecture and landscape architecture to urban design and cross-disciplinary systems with locations in Asia, the United States, and Europe. Projects such as the Magok Waterfront and Busan River City are provocative urban scenarios which combine city planning with infrastructure, landscape, architecture, social policy, and development as urban expansion merges with green belts or farmland merges into cities. When working on these proposals it was important to understand that the city is not merely the sum of many objects but a kind of organism which relates to and is composed of those that are visible as well as numerous invisible variables. The Magok Waterfront Project was awarded by the American Institute of Architects (New York) and by the State of New York.
 
 
 In the Yongsan Park Masterplan, we proposed a project to ecologically regenerate an urban site that had been used as a military base for more than 100 years. Its location in central Seoul, as well as its proximity to Old Seoul eventually distorted its natural axis. The site needed to incorporate the historical situations of the Second World War, the Korean War, and the societal atmosphere which Korea was forced to face. Its solution demanded research about the ecology and sustainability inherent to the site. UNITEDLAB was fortunate enough to receive the ASLA Professional Award and an AIA LA Award for this project.
 
 
 More recently, I developed a research project called â€˜Los Angeles Affordable Apartments,â€™ a multi-unit residential prototype based on traditional village housing schemes. I proposed unit prototypes for the low-income which compels pedestrian activity in DTLA. For a mobile city like Los Angeles, I believe this could be new typology that encourages such activity.",,4102058,2013207

This has been achieved through the following programming efforts:</p>
 
 
 <p>Creative Fundraising: One example would be our 3rd Annual Valentine's Day Tournament. We worked with private local and national companies to create a unique themed event. This was an incredibly successful fundraising effort with proceeds going towards on-going activities for kids, including Kids dodgeball, Yacht Grub, Yacht Plot, Yacht Pix and forthcoming programs.</p>
 
 
 <p>Kids Dodgeball: Friday nights from 7:30-9 PM: Continuing our efforts to create positive experiences & growth for the youth of Glassell Park & Venice (& starting the program this spring in North Hollywood), we host our Kids Dodgeball League on Friday nights. This program was started under the Mayor's Summer Night Lights initiative over two years ago, which we used as a platform to gauge interest & create an on-going program. We are very proud that this informal league has helped us build relationships with kids in the neighborhood, which has furthered our ability to create new efforts & programs.</p>
 
 
 <p>Yacht Plot: We have firmly planted ourselves in a new spot in Glassell Park - The Drew St. Community Garden. The Yacht Club volunteers, along with helpful neighborhood kids, maintain the garden a few times each week-routinely watering, weeding, tidying up, monitoring plant growth, & dealing with challenges presented by seasonal change. Once mature, the plotâ€™s produce will supplement the culinary needs of the Yacht Grub kids cooking class. To assist in supplementing the needs of our gardening crew, our adult dodgeball league rallied & donated our wish list of kid's gardening tools.</p>
 
 
 <p>Kids Cooking Classes: In 2012, we formed Yacht Grub in collaboration with Whole Foods, creating a cooking & nutrition class for at-risk-teens associated with recreation centers in Venice & Glassell Park. The goal of this six week course is to give students confidence in the kitchen while they learn healthy cooking, practical nutrition information, basic knife skills & complete awareness of how to read ingredient labels. 8-10 students learn two new recipes each week in this 2 hour class.</p>
 
 
 <p>Yacht Pix, an introduction to photography course for kids at the Oakwood Rec Center in Venice. The goal of the class is to learn a variety of techniques & ways of shooting, honing the studentsâ€™ critical thinking skills. Guest photographers showcase their work, allowing students to see how photography can be a profession. At the end of the session, the students work is hung for a â€˜gallery openingâ€™ where one photo is chosen as the winner based on skills learned, directions followed, & positive behavior displayed.</p>",,,2014029

 LaShia Ransom, EYM Graduate 1999
 
 
 USC 2003, B.A. DEGREE, SCHOOL 2007, M.A. Counseling- Marriage and Family

 Founder Non-Profit ""Enriching Communities""
 
 
 
 
 
 Once upon a time, I was known as a ""selfish little girl with a horrible attitude"", who at 14 knew everything and ""didn't need anyone to tell me â€œAnything"", until that one late evening when my mother found me sitting on my bed crying into my Trigonometry book, with my TI-82 in hand. My mom asked, ""What was wrong?"" With tears in my eyes, I looked at my mom for the first time feeling like a failure. I responded, ""I don't know how to do this! I've failed my 2nd math test!"" My mom felt the defeat and sadness in my words. She hugged me and told me, she would figure it out and she would get me some help.
 
 
 
 
 
 By the end of the week, my mother had found Educating Young Minds (EYM) and Ms. Echols in the yellow pages. I arrived at EYM, embarrassed to admit I needed help. (Please take note I had been an honor roll student since the first grade.) Asking for help was something I didn't know how to do. As my mother and I sat with Ms. Echols she looked at me, then at my mom, asking a lot of questions. I gave one word responses with the most negative attitude you could imagine. That's when Ms. Echols respectfully asked my mother to leave, no, she told her to get out of her office. What happened in that office I rather not mention today, just know that it was done with love and respect and I learned a lot of humility! The rest is history and was truly a blessing!
 
 
 
 
 
 Needless to say, not only did I pass my Trigonometry class, I became one of the first students to receive a scholarship from EYM in 1999 and graduated from USC with honors in 2003. In 2007, I graduated with a Masters Degree in Counseling- Marriage & Family Child Therapy. Today I am a very humble and proud wife and mother, who is employed with the Los Angeles County Probation Department as a Deputy Probation Officer II. Last year I co-founded my own non-profit organization, ""Enriching Communities"", to be an advocate for inner city youth suffering from substance abuse.",,,2013056

You'll experience the extraordinary power of fulldome immersive cinema during the conference, engulfed by phenomenal planetarium programming, vivid music visuals and stunning live dance productions. This is storytelling at its most innovative and transformative.

These gardens range from 1 acre farms, to wildlands schoolyard habitats, to reading gardens, or small edible raised beds. Our school gardens are inexpensive. They are built on a shoe-string budget using the power of community volunteers to fuel these massive transformations.
 
 
 
 
 
 In addition to building school gardens, we have also provided â€œHome and Garden Economicsâ€ programs at many of these schools. With this program, our garden stewards plant seedlings with students and provide regular maintenance to the garden. Once these fresh fruits and vegetables are ready to be harvested, students prepare healthy snacks in their outdoor kitchen. Throughout this process students are learning about science, life-cycles, composting, the importance of recycling, and they are developing a hands-on relationship to the source of their food. 
 
 
 
 
 
 We have seen middle school students enthusiastically exclaim that beets are their new favorite vegetable. In surveys, students demonstrated that after the garden program they not only ate more fruits and vegetables, but also had more fruits and vegetables available to them in the home, suggesting that the impact goes further than just the classroom. At one school, the edible school garden program was the catalyst for a new â€œenvironmental magnetâ€ program and has been credited as one key component in the improvement of overall test scores on the campus.",,,2014032

Some numbers from the first year of the competition best illustrate our organizationâ€™s achivements:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>- The competition drew 83 teams from 34 universities throughout the west coast, including more than 20 from Southern California</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>- Young entrepreneurs developing energy from waste water treatment, robots for cleaning solar panels and solar cell films with 20% more efficiency took the top prizes at the regional finals competition.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>- Fifteen teams continued after the competition to form new companies</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>- Four raised additional money, as much as $250,000, directly from their connection to FLoW.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>- Jobs created: based on the first year exit survey, 23 of these early stage ventures, intended to add 1-10 jobs over the following 18 months, according to a survey. </p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>- Teams from Flow have proceeded to join in regional and national business development programs, including the LA Cleantech Incubator, the Cleantech Open, and the UC Davis Green Technology Entrepreneurship Academy.</p>

 We convene Congressional Forums, held in the U.S. Capitol, where lawmakers and their staffs are invited to learn about the latest Report Cards and to dialogue with experts in the field on child abuse, dependency courts, foster care, and child protective services. The discussions provide guidance and feedback on pertinent policy areas. They also provide a rare opportunity for youth who have experienced Foster Care to speak directly to government, face to face.

 <p>Beginning with its successful efforts to bridge the 1990s divide between mostly small, culturally specific media arts centers, Freewaves has established itself as one of the most adventurous advocates for raising media arts to a truly democratic vector for ideas and images.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>Freewavesâ€™ activities have consistently been in the vanguard of the field, models for others to emulate. Specific areas in which it led the way include:</p>
 
 
 <p>â€¢ Placing experimental media arts in public spaces, reaching hundreds of thousand of people who may never have seen art in this genre;</p>
 
 
 <p>â€¢ Showing 3000 artistsâ€™ works</p>
 
 
 <p>â€¢ Producing 11 festivals celebrating the newest artistic developments;</p>
 
 
 <p>â€¢ Positing live internet links as an art form;</p>
 
 
 <p>â€¢ Positioning interactive media (CD-Roms) as predecessor to web interactivity;</p>
 
 
 <p>â€¢ Placing experimental media arts on cable, PBS and public access television, plus in all L.A. libraries and high schools;</p>
 
 
 <p>â€¢ Presenting large format, video display of experimental media arts on video billboards previously dedicated almost exclusively to paid advertising;</p>
 
 
 <p>â€¢ Engaging international, web-implemented curation of its festivals, using the latest web technology to stream hundred of hours of video worldwide;</p>
 
 
 <p>â€¢ Offering workshops bringing new media technologies to underserved communities and to working artists seeking new avenues of expression.</p>
 
 
 <p>â€¢ Exhibiting videos at Hammer, MOCA, LACMA, Getty, and 100 other venues</p>

We are proud of these numbers and equally as proud that they represent a connection to content that has ranged from presenting the more than 20 exhibitions that have been directly related to telling the story of the African Diaspora around the worldâ€¦and all still for Free Admission! We have proudly collaborated with numerous organizations from the Skirball Cultural Center to the Japanese American National Museum, the Chinese American Museum and others like Self Help Graphics to the obvious connections with the Watts Towers, St. Elmoâ€™s Village, and commercial galleries owned by African Americans. We encourage artmaking and training by children and showcase the work of other organizations serving this purpose like Ryman Arts. But perhaps we are just as proud of our outreach efforts with Target that were designed to allow us to showcase the achievements and contributions of the African American and collaborative communities through our Target Sundays at CAAM programs. Through this effort, we have not only created places for the community to showcase what they do but this showcasing of talent also included bringing to the public important discussions and representatives that could assist with everything from healthy living to safety in the water. Target Sundays even helped us create our Artpreneur program making it possible for solo art entrepreneurs to have a place to sell and expose audiences to their work and earn income accordingly. Our most heartfelt achievement is the growth of our Young Docents program having grown it from a 2 person 4 week program that is an integral part of our program today employing, training and educating 30 high school youth year round for their personal and professional career development.",,,2013075

In the last five years, FLTS has worked on healthy living community engagement projects in the cities of Inglewood, Gardena, Lawndale, Hawthorne and Lynwood. 2012 was a landmark year for From Lot to Spot. FLTS constructed and opened the first ever community garden in the community of Lennox, CA. , opened the 118th/Doty Ave Pocket Park: the first community-designed pocket park in the City of Hawthorne.

The Fulfillment Fund provided mentoring to help students graduate high school and educate them about college access. Through the interactions with students, parents, and educators, we saw the great need for the community to be educated on college acccess for all students especially those in first-generation, low-income or under-resourced areas. We were able to build on our mentoring program and develop proprietary high school curriculum that is delivered in partnership with schools during class-time and one-on-one counseling through our College Access Program Advisors. We also have a CAP (College Access Program) Leadership Crew that meets once a month. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Experiential learning opportunities are provided for the students in our program including college overnight tours and the annual Destination College event. Destination College has successfully been held for 16 years and we have been able to provide a unique college experience for thousands of high school students. Fulfillment Fund provides financial aid workshops and also has a robust scholarship program open to students that go through our program. Parent workshops during Destination College are provided in English and Spanish to help them provide support for their children in high school and college. 
 
 
 
 
 
  A testament to our success has been the recent ability to provide the city of Las Vegas the tools to replicate the Fulfillment Fund model as a pilot in their schools. The participating schools have already started seeing a shift in perceptions on attending college from the students.
 
 
 
 
 
 The Fulfillment Fund program students have a 90% high school graduation rate compared to 64.2% in LAUSD overall. In 2012, 90% of our students planned to enroll in college versus 54% of students from low-income communities nationwide. An impressive 81% of Fulfillment Fund students become the first in their family to attend college, helping break the cycle of poverty in their family and community.

Our Seed to Table curriculum, to be published this June in partnership with the verynice.co design company, is the first of its kind to create a simple, concise, standards-based framework for integrating gardens into elementary schools, and stands to transform garden-based education in Southern California for many years to come.
 
 
 
 
 
 In addition to piloting this program at the 24th Street Elementary School, GSF has worked with Widney High, a school for students with multiple physical and developmental disabilities, to create a Horticulture vocational program that includes a commercial greenhouse operation and vegetable garden. We are working with the school to create job opportunities for these students, connecting them with local urban agriculture organizations and farmersâ€™ markets so they can make meaningful contributions to their local community.
 
 
 
 
 
 GSF has cultivated a sustained network of community volunteers that contribute over 4,500 hours of volunteer labor each year to our organization. We train 6 interns each semester that go on to hold jobs furthering garden-based education opportunities for Los Angeles youth, and host hundreds of visitors to our site each year that come to learn from our model.

Farm to Preschool is viewed at a model program nationwide, is a national leader of the emerging Farm to Preschool movement, and was given a recognition award by Michelle Obamaâ€™s Letâ€™s Move! Child Care initiative in 2012. UEPIâ€™s Farm to Preschool program partners with child care agencies, preschools and family child care sites, as well as many local and national organizations. Begun as a pilot program in 2009, it is now expanding throughout the state, has been tailored to Hawaiian culture, and is currently working with the Navajo Nation.

 <p>Since our website launched just three years ago on Earth Day 2010, Grades of Green has grown rapidly and expanded internationally with more than 104,000 students in 27 states and four countries enrolled in our programs. Grades of Green has been honored with several awards over the last four years, including the Environmental Protection Agencyâ€™s prestigious Environmental Award, a United States Conference of Mayors Award, as well as being instrumental in two Grades of Green schools being designated as â€œGreen Ribbon Schoolsâ€ by the U.S. Department of Education. </p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>PROGRAM WORK</p>
 
 
 <p>Through our program work, we have brought and are bringing real environmental change to our communities. Some examples include: helping more than 50 Los Angeles County schools divert over 50,000 bags of trash from local landfills through our Trash Free Lunch Program; helping several California schools districts stop the use of toxic cleaning supplies in their schools; performing a â€œgreeningâ€ of 10 underserved schools in the Los Angeles area and helping them set up waste reduction programs, including in-class recycling and lunch-time sorting systems; and assisting several local schools end the use of Styrofoam trays at lunch time. Should we receive one of the LA2050 grants, we look forward to continuing this hands-on program work in the schools within the LAYC. </p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>EMPOWERING OUR YOUTH</p>
 
 
 <p>While we are proud of the recognition our organization has received and the projects we have led, we believe our most important work is teaching our children that they have the power to make a difference. As noted above, it was Grades of Green students who went to their City Councils in Manhattan Beach and Hermosa Beach to ask for bans of plastic bags and Styrofoam. Inspired by those stories, El Segundo High School students recently went to their City Council to ask that additional recycling containers be placed around town. </p> 
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>Several of our existing Youth Corps students have received national and regional recognition for their environmental efforts, including Grace C and Sam H who were named as Champions for Change by the White House, and Max R and Reese R, who were featured in a Washington Post article about banning Styrofoam. </p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>Other Youth Corps and Grades of Green students are tackling environmental problems big and small at their schools and in their communities. For example, Yaeeun H is using Grades of Green 3R curriculum to teach kids at her school about how and why to protect the environment; Sydney H, a sixth grader, is organizing an e-waste collection drive at her school; Sam H is collecting used shoes to donate to Soles for Souls; and Lauren S and Jenna R, both sixth graders, are working to plant a native garden at their school. These kids are the future of Los Angeles and our best hope of making our vision for Los Angeles a reality in 2050. </p>",,,2013082

We have consistently created productions, workshops and art programs that have grown from our engagement with diverse communities. Our longevity reflects our ability to change, innovate and respond to the needs of the times. 
 
 
 
 
 
 In 1978, Founder/Artistic Director, Nobuko Miyamoto established Great Leap as a non-profit arts organization creating concerts and musical theater works reflecting the Asian American experience, successfully mounting and touring musicals â€œChop Sueyâ€ and â€œTalk Storyâ€ on the West Coast and Hawaii. 
 
 
 
 
 
 In response to the racial conflicts of Los Angeles Uprising in 1992, Great Leap became a multicultural arts organization, presenting the first-voice stories of Asian, Latino and African American artists in â€œA Slice of Rice, Frijoles and Greens.â€ To this day the performance tours colleges including a yearly show at UCLAâ€™s Medical School as cultural awareness training for new interns. Our youth version toured schools for 10 years, reaching 50,000 youth yearly with the Music Center on Tour program.
 
 
 
 
 
 In 2001, the events of 9/11 pushed us to create workshops and that brought together people from the Muslim, Buddhist, Christian and Jewish communities. We created a sacred space where people could share their stories and traditions, and experienced the power of the bonding that resulted. From this we developed the theater piece â€œLeaps of Faith,â€ performed at the 2009 World Parliament of Religions in Australia. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Great Leap has also designed Arts and Yoga for Youth, a program for USCâ€™s Upward Bound program, training and creating performances with young people. In 2005 we created our artist mentorship program, Collaboratory to pass on our creative practices to the next generation. We are now doing the tenth cycle of Collaboratory in Long Beach, with Cambodian, Samoan and Tongan artists and community members who will learn Great Leapâ€™s creative and collaborative methodology in theater making and community building. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Now we are using our environmental music video series, â€œEco-Vidsâ€ as an innovative way to engage communities of color with the critical issue of Climate Change and highlight the sustainable practices passed down the generations. The first, â€œB.Y.O. Chopstix,â€ promotes conservation by using disposable chopsticks; â€œMottainaiâ€ tells the story of the Japanese tradition of â€œNo Waste,â€ and â€œCycles of Change,â€ a collaboration between Quetzal and Nobuko, encourages urban families to bicycle for their health and the environment. Since 2010 the Ecovids have received over 45,000 views on YouTube.",,,2013084

The organization has been a resource for families for over 13 years, continually refining programs and services to best meet the changing needs of a diverse population. Consequently V2K HELPER has access to a large population of low- and middle-income families who trust the organization to provide respectful guidance and effective services.
 
 
 
 
 
 The organization is consistently sought out as a collaborative partner by other community agencies and has an excellent track record of responsibly managing funding from state, county, public, private, and corporate funders. Following are some specific ways V2K HELPER has been recognized as exemplifying excellence in its field:
 
 
 
 
 
 â€¢ Since 1999, V2K-HELPER has been funded by the City of Los Angeles services to implement a comprehensive violence prevention/intervention program.
 
 
 â€¢ Since 2007, V2K-HELPER has implemented City of Los Angeles GRYD Program in multiple Zones, providing services to youth and young adults with an annual budget of at least $750,000. 
 
 
 â€¢ Community Development, with an emphasis on low-to-moderate (LMI) communities and individuals addressing: small business education, business retention, entrepreneurial and employment training, and workforce development programs 
 
 
 â€¢ Community Development, with an emphasis on affordable housing 
 
 
 â€¢ Currently we provide direct service and linkages to the following services free of charge each month to approximately 200 men, women and children:
 
 
 o Comprehensive wrap-around services that include 
 
 
 ï‚§ counseling, 
 
 
 ï‚§ gang intervention, 
 
 
 ï‚§ conflict resolution, 
 
 
 ï‚§ substance abuse, 
 
 
 ï‚§ Job training and placement services, 
 
 
 ï‚§ tattoo removal, 
 
 
 ï‚§ mental health services
 
 
 We provide a myriad of services throughout Los Angeles County, with primary emphasis in Venice Beach and South Central Los Angeles. Our academic arm provides a professionally and socially enriched facility for graduate and undergraduate training. Venice 2000/ H.E.L.P.E.R. Foundation is considered to be a model at-risk youth service facility and therefore attracts interns and social work students from major universities, such as USC, Loyola Marymount University, and University of California Los Angeles. We subscribe to comprehensive, integrated, community-based collaborative approach providing services to youth that enhances community safety while strengthening and preserving families. Our guiding philosophy is that children and youth must be preserved if the integrity of our society at-large is to be preserved. If families are to be responsible units, they must have access to healthy living environments, adequate food, and education for all its members, employment, and access to health services and freedom from gang, domestic and civil violence.",,,2013086

The Hammer is also proud of its 14 year old Hammer Projects exhibition series which features emerging local and international artists in what is often their first solo museum exhibition in the United States. Through our public engagement program, launched in 2010, the Hammer has established itself as a leader in innovation through unique and unexpected artist projects that challenge visitorsâ€™ notions of traditional museum experiences. As a cultural center, the Hammer also attracts tens of thousands of visitors each year to our multidisciplinary public programs which take place in our state-of-the-art Billy Wilder Theater and adjacent Courtyard, and which include literary readings, artist performances, film screenings, musical acts, meditation sessions, and scholarly and popular culture presentations. All of the Hammerâ€™s public programs are free to the public and we feel strongly that we could be helpful to both artists and our neighbors if the vitality and sense of community that the Hammer enjoys could spill out into our commercial neighborhood as well.",,,2013087

 A feature that distinguishes Harmony Project among other local arts education programs is that we commit to children throughout their entire childhood, regardless of their changing schools and circumstances. With a strong focus on peer mentorship, family support, and college incentives, Harmony Project changes the course of disadvantaged childrenâ€™s lives. While dropout rates exceed 50% in the communities we serve, 95% of Harmony Projectâ€™s high school seniors have graduated in four years and virtually all have gone on to college or trade school. In addition, Harmony Project provides college incentives and scholarship opportunities to help facilitate the difficult transition to college. In May, we learned that one of our former students, Brettany Tucker, became a Fulbright Scholar for the 2012-13 school year! Moreover, four current students were accepted and now attend the Los Angeles County High School for the Arts, one of the premier public arts high schools in the US!

 Heal the Bay's first major challenge as a grassroots organization was taking on the Los Angelesâ€™ Hyperion Sewage Treatment Plant. At the time, Hyperion was breaking the law on several counts, including the dumping of sewage sludge into the Bay. Heal the Bay attacked on many fronts: holding rallies at the beach, informing the media and the public about what was happening, packing hearing rooms, testifying before regulatory agencies, and signing up members along the coast. Due in large part to Heal the Bayâ€™s efforts, the City of Los Angeles was forced to rebuild Hyperion and stop dumping sludge into the Bay. In the years since, Heal the Bay has been overjoyed to see the return of plant and animal life to the former ""dead"" zone in the Bay, and to know that ocean users are much less likely to become ill from swimming in contaminated coastal waters. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Recent achievements:
 
 
 
 
 
 The Education and Environment Initiative (EEI) 
 
 
 As a co-author of AB1548, more commonly known as the Education and the Environment Initiative (EEI), Heal the Bay has helped bring environmental education to classrooms throughout the state and at all grade levels. Staff continues to work closely with National Geographic and local school districts to ensure that the new curriculum is accessible to classroom educators and their students.
 
 
 
 
 
 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) 
 
 
 Due in large part to Heal the Bayâ€™s efforts, new MPAs have been established along the Southern California coastline. These underwater â€œsafe havensâ€ allow marine life, especially those fish stocks suffering from the great decline, to replenish and thrive. Heal the Bay will continue to educate ocean users, including anglers, about the benefits of MPA and monitor activities through our citizen-led MPA Watch program.
 
 
 
 
 
 Combating Plastic Pollution 
 
 
 Heal the Bay continues to lead the charge on banning environmentally harmful and fiscally wasteful single-use plastic bags throughout the state. Staff is gearing up to work closely with policymakers and additional stakeholders to facilitate the adoption of a bag ban in the City of Los Angeles.
 
 
 
 
 
 Environmental Stewardship and Volunteerism 
 
 
 An astounding 36,400 volunteers participated in Heal the Bay-coordinated beach cleanups in Los Angeles County from November 2011-September 2012 (includes Coastal Cleanup Day 2012).
 
 
 
 
 
 The WAYS Reading & Fitness Park 
 
 
 In partnership with Wisdom Academy for Young Scientists (a charter elementary school in South Los Angeles), Heal the Bay is developing a multi-use park, which will serve as an outdoor classroom, community green space, fitness area, and water-quality improvement project in a community that is already underserved and disproportionately lacking park space.",,,2015083

 - In the last academic year, 324 students participated in intensive art classes in a multi-level class structure that built and advanced with each session. Each quarter, HOLA offered the community 33 free visual art classes and 37 hours of professional art instruction.
 
 
 
 
 
 - HOLAâ€™s Visual Arts students attended 19 field trips to museums, art institutions, art studios and more. HOLA also welcomed a diverse group of more than 36 visiting artists to its campus.
 
 
 
 
 
 - The first year of the Public Art Project culminated in a community-wide event in MacArthur park that brought together more than 2,000 community members.
 
 
 
 
 
 - In 2011, the completely renovated Lafayette Park Community Center reopened, an expansion that helped HOLA significantly increase the number of students served annually. Throughout its nine academic, enrichment and support programs, HOLA served 2,497 students in 2012, an increase of more than 60% from the prior year.
 
 
 
 
 
 - HOLA provided FREE programming six days a week all year long.
 
 
 
 
 
 - At the core of HOLAâ€™s success is a strong team of volunteers. HOLAâ€™s volunteer corps has grown to more than 700, 190 of which donated 10 hours or more in the last year alone. 
 
 
 
 
 
 - The number of HOLAâ€™s youngest students performing at or above grade level increased from 69% to 84%
 
 
 
 
 
 - While area high schoolsâ€™ graduation rates often fall below 50%, HOLA saw 100% of its seniors graduate from high school and enroll in colleges and universities across the country.
 
 
 
 
 
 - The Alumni and Scholarship Program now supports over 150 alumni enrolled in 75 colleges and universities; of those students who began college in the last three years and participated in the formal Alumni Program, 93% are still enrolled in a two- or four-year institution.
 
 
 
 
 
 - This year, HOLA awarded more than $195,000 in college scholarships to 83 alumni and assisted these students in securing over $1,189,972 in State, Federal and Institutional Funds.
 
 
 
 
 
 - HOLA has consistently facilitated community engagement and helped to beautify and activate the Rampart neighborhood. In 2003, families were too scared to enter into the local park, but since HOLA partnered with LA City Recreation and Parks to bring unprecedented financial and programmatic resources, thousands of families now utilize Lafayette Park on a regular basis.",,,2013089

Hollywood HEART was initially created as Camp Pacific Heartland (CPH) in 1995, and has since welcomed more than 1,750 campers. Created by entertainment executive David Gale, the camp was founded to address the social and recreational needs of Southern California children affected by HIV/AIDS. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Camp Pacific Heartland was held for 17 years in Malibu, California for kids aged 6-16 â€” providing them with opportunities to build skills, confidence, and hope. CPH allowed campers to take a break from the stress and stigma of living in a family impacted by HIV/AIDS while providing a safe, healthful environment in which these children could enjoy themselves and experience the normalcy they often lacked in their lives.
 
 
 
 
 
 The Movie Team sought to utilize the film industry backgrounds of Hollywood HEARTâ€™s founders, board members and volunteers to give children and teens the opportunity to participate in the art of filmmaking. Through the Movie Team experience, the youths learned to write, produce, and star in their own short films. The program collaborated with local social service agencies including foster homes, community groups and Boys and Girls Clubs to produce over 70 films throughout the United States and South Africa. The model has since been integrated into Camp Hollywood HEART as well as the ongoing Educational Arts Workshops.
 
 
 
 
 
 Our Educational Arts workshops are a condensed version of Camp Hollywood HEART and distill performing and visual arts skills into after-school and weekend-long formats throughout Los Angeles. Collaborating with local social service agencies and community groups, these workshops continue to share industry expertise and creativity with dozens of at-risk youth across Los Angeles. The goal of the Educational Arts Workshops is to provide skill sets to groups one workshop at a time. Programs include everything from intensive writing and documentary filmmaking workshops to fashion and set design. This allows our participants ample time to absorb, practice, and sharpen skills passed on from Hollywood professionals. Being able to provide these opportunities in collaboration with volunteers and small budgets have allowed Hollywood HEART to achieve unforgettable programming.",,,2015087

In that time, we have become the largest, most comprehensive and most successful gang prevention, intervention and rehabilitation organization in Los Angeles â€“ if not the entire country.<br>
 
 
 <br>
 
 
 Currently we provide the following services free of charge each month at Homeboy Industries:<br>
 
 
 â€¢ 200 men and women are employed in entry-level positions at our headquarters and in our social enterprise businesses, and all receive case management to stay on track with employment and educational goals;<br>
 
 
 â€¢ 120 trainees receive individual substance abuse and mental health counseling with licensed clinicians;<br>
 
 
 â€¢ 200 trainees and community clients receive employment counseling services;<br>
 
 
 â€¢ 400 trainees and community clients participate in our broad curriculum of practical, educational and vocational classes; and<br>
 
 
 â€¢ 750 trainees and community clients receive tattoo removal procedures.<br>
 
 
 <br>
 
 
 Due to the breadth and impact of our services, Homeboy Industries was cited as a model program in a 2005 report by the CDC focusing on the ills accompanying gangs and gang violence. The report stressed that Homeboy, by focusing on intervention, serves a vital need and is instrumental in helping break the ongoing cycle of gang violence. The CDC has also endorsed job training programs as a youth violence prevention strategy. Related to, but distinct from traditional job training programs, they noted the importance of â€œsocial microenterprise,â€ as modeled by the small businesses of Homeboy.<br>
 
 
 <br>
 
 
 Importantly, these services are far more cost effective than incarceration. The state and county spend $150,000-200,000 to incarcerate a minor for one year, and a high risk youth will cost society between $1.7 and $2.3 million over their lifetime. Likewise, incarceration of an adult for one year costs approximately $65,000. Employment and support services at Homeboy Industries, on the other hand, cost approximately $35,000 per trainee per year.<br>
 
 
 <br>
 
 
 Perhaps our greatest achievement to date is the unparalleled level of support we have generated among community members and the unequaled level of trust we have achieved among those seeking our services. Homeboy Industries does not conduct formal outreach to current or former gang members. Rather, as a demonstration of their commitment to personal transformation, trainees and community clients reach in to us knowing that they will get the help they need.",,,2018053

From there we gained the additional support of 10 Neighborhood Councils throughout Los Angeles: Del Rey, Greater Griffith Park, South Robertson, Silver Lake, Hollywood United, Atwater Village, West LA, Boyle Heights, Lake Balboa, and Chatsworth. Our thorough campaign work resulted in Councilman Bill Rosendahl putting our motion before the Los Angeles City Council where it is currently being studied by the Planning and Land Use Committee. And while we can't say that we have achieved full legalization yet, in creating the community model and approaching it from a grassroots level we've created momentum which cannot be stopped. <br><br>
 
 
 
 
 
 Our most important achievements are not measured in legislative changes but in the number of people we reach, teach, and impact. In that respect we have been enormously successful. In a short time we've connected with people all over the world through monthly workshops, mentoring sessions, honey bee rescues, education outreach, neighborhood council involvement and social media connections. Our proudest single achievement is creating a global community of conscientious, active urban beekeepers who now share HoneyLove's mission with an ever-growing audience.

Human Resources is a team of creative individuals, whose mission is to broaden public engagement with contemporary and conceptual art. Our organization emphasizes underexposed modes of expression and interdisciplinary arts practices that do not fit easily within existing institutionalized structures.
 
 
 
 
 
 Human Resources was identified by the Los Angeles Weekly in 2012 as one of the city's ""most dynamic arts venues."" We foster active public appreciation of performative, participatory and multi-disciplinary art practices by encouraging maximum community access. Events are free or very low cost. Members of our broad community generate exhibitions, performances and readings - artists who attend our events are encouraged to bring proposals to directing members. Our programming procedures encourage direct conversation with artists, musicians and writers in order to educate our audiences about our mission. These conversations also shape our understanding of the needs of artists working in non-commercial and experimental paradigms. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Human Resources serves as an important point of convergence for diverse and sometimes disparate art communities. We offer regular platforms for conversation and idea-sharing in order to promote the sustainability of non-traditional art forms. We nurture the kinds of artistic intelligence produced by working closely with different artistic communities - such as that of experimental music and performance art. We have also collaborated with other art spaces and events, including Pacific Standard Time, Silvershed's Collective show, fundraisers and events for Les Figues Press and Darin Klein's Box of Books, and the Chinatown Perform!Now! Festival.

 <p>The Imagination Foundation is a new organization, but is rapidly becoming the leader of a worldwide movement to foster creativity, imagination and entrepreneurship in children. The film that launched the Imagination Foundation, â€œCaineâ€™s Arcade,â€ has been widely cited as one of the most inspirational stories of 2012. The film has received nearly 8 million views, trended worldwide on Twitter, gathered a Facebook community of 130,000+ fans, and inspired a wave of cardboard creativity in backyards and classrooms across the globe. The Christian Science Monitor calls the film a â€œgreat American story,â€ and Wired Magazine writes, â€œItâ€™s a sweet story that brings viewers back to a time of potent imagination and creativity.â€</p>

 The â€œConversationsâ€ events began in 1999 to bring together new and potential friends and supporters, in a relaxed environment to discuss new and exciting ways to support Jenesse. The events also provide an opportunity to discuss domestic violence without the stigma that is usually associated with this issue and remind people that victims of domestic violence should be applauded and supported in their efforts to stand tall, and ready, to improve their lives and the lives of their children.

Since hiring our first executive director in 2009, we have grown from a small program serving fewer than 300 children to serve more than 1,200 children annually. Through partnerships with leading universities, early education providers, and school districts, along with support from the funding community, Jumpstart has quickly established a strong reputation in the community.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>Jumpstartâ€™s program at UCLA, founded in 2009, is among our best and enjoys support among the schoolâ€™s faculty and administration. Now in its fourth year, Jumpstart at UCLA engages more than 70 college students each year. UCLA hosts two full-time, paid Jumpstart staff members who work on-campus and have developed strong partnerships with leading early education providers, including Los Angeles Unified School District, Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District, and Neighborhood Youth Association in Venice.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>Nationwide, Jumpstart has trained more than 25,000 college-student and community volunteers to serve more than 100,000 pre-school children in hundreds of early learning centers, and has been widely recognized as an innovative and impactful organization.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>Jumpstartâ€™s program is a model in efficiency. As the organization has grown rapidly since its founding in 1993, Jumpstart has consistently decreased the cost per child-served hour from $35 to $7, a reduction of over two-thirds in fewer than 10 years. The Stanford Social Innovation Review found that Jumpstart has reduced its costs by at least 6% annually, while simultaneously achieving substantial growth. Numerous organizations have recognized Jumpstart with awards that highlight its creative partnerships and effective programs:</p>

These include the L.A. Leadership Academy in Lincoln Heights in an exploration of the L.A. River; the Environmental Charter High School in Lawndale to uncover the social history of Compton's Richland Farms; Venice High School to examine the myth and reality of Venice; the Chinatown Service Centerâ€™s Youth Council to highlight the rich and diverse history of Chinatown, and Franklin High School to share the stories of the people, places and historical events that have shaped Highland Park.
 
 
 
 
 
 The award-winning Youth Voices program is a vital outreach component of KCETâ€™s Departures, a multimedia documentary series, community engagement tool, and digital literacy project that explores the social and cultural vitality of Los Angelesâ€™ diverse neighborhoods. Departures has received funding from non-profits and public and private agencies, including the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Adobe Youth Voices, Boeing, the L.A. Department of Cultural Affairs, and the California Council for the Humanities.
 
 
 
 
 
 An important aspect of Departures Youth Voices is our website, where we have built an archive of all student generated media from each of our neighborhood documentaries. The Youth Voices Curriculum can be accessed through our website, allowing educators and youth advocates open source access to our lesson plans. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Specific achievements include when students from the L.A. Leadership Academy were selected to perform their songs and poetry at â€œCorrido of Los Angeles,â€ an event celebrating the bicentennial of the Mexican Revolution at the L.A. County Museum of Art. In the winning entries the students positioned themselves as agents of change in their neighborhood, working as a team looking to reclaim the streets and make them a better place.
 
 
  
 
 
 Another student producer, Mo Rahman, traveled to Washington, D.C. and took part in a panel discussion at the Silverdocs Festival where he shared his Youth Voices experience. He presented student produced work from the L.A. River installment, and discussed how the skills he learned offered new opportunities for his future. He, along with several other Youth Voices student producers, have continued their study of media, while others have had an opportunity to intern at KCET Departures.
 
 
 
 
 
 An on-going example of our achievements is how our work is advancing and evolving. Currently we are continuing our collaboration with The L.A. Leadership Academy, and developing new partnerships with two newly-established schools: ArtLAB and The L.A. River School at the Sotomayor Learning Academies in Glassell Park.

 <p>1. The creation of the LA STAGE ARTS CENSUS, in partnership with TRG Arts, that is now the largest and most robust collective dataset of cultural patrons in LAâ€™s history with over four million unique households currently included.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 http://www.laimyours.com/40804/what-is-up-with-la2050/2.

 <p>3. The creation of LA STAGE Magazine in 2001, which moved online to become the award-winning LASTAGETimes.com in 2009.

 <p>4. The founding of the LA STAGE Warehouse Co-op, a 10,000 square foot shared materials facility for the LA theater community, saving LA theaters thousands of dollars a year and preventing the loss of tons of reusable materials (sets, props, costumes, equipment) that would otherwise be sent to landfills.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>5. The creation of the LA STAGE Ovation Awards, now in their 24th year, the highest-profile awards for excellence in theater on the West Coast. The Ovation Awards consider over 400 productions each year; celebrate over 150 nominees and 35 Ovation recipients at an annual black-tie ceremony, which is attended by 1300 leaders of the LA cultural community.</p>

 - API Scores have risen 10%, or 57 points, at Manual Arts High School in the two years LAâ€™s Promise has managed the school and 21%, or an impressive 111 points, at West Adams High School in five years. In 2011-2012 alone, the most recent data year available, the overall API across LAâ€™s Promise schools rose by 52 points. Manual Arts experienced a 21-point increase and John Muir a 31-point increase.
 
 
 - Four-year graduation rates increased by 6% over three years at Manual Arts and 11% over five years at West Adams. 
 
 
 - The important indicators of ELA and Math Proficiency have increased across the board. The percentage of students that passed at Proficient or Advanced on the ELA California Standardized Test jumped 43% (from 19.6% to 31.2%) at Manual Arts in the three years LAP has managed the school, and increased 36% in five years (from 15.5% to 24.1%) at West Adams. Meanwhile, the percentage of students that passed Proficient or Advanced on the Math California Standardized Test rose a very dramatic 66% (from 3.2% to 5.3%) at Manual Arts in three years and 77% (from 2.4% to 10.6%) at West Adams in five years. Proficient or Advanced scores at John Muir also increased, including ELA scores increasing by 19% (from 23% to 27.3%) and Math scores increasing by 33% (from 18% to 24%) since LAP management.
 
 
 - Over the last three years, the schools average 94% attendance rates. As of today, West Adams itself now has one of the highest attendance rates (nearly 92%) and lowest dropout rates (2.3%) in LAUSD. Manual Arts and John Muir also have LAUSD-topping attendance rates of 93% and 96%, respectively.
 
 
 - The number of instructional days lost to suspensions have dropped by 69.6% at Manual Arts, 59.8% at West Adams and 27.3% at John Muir since LAP management began.
 
 
 - Seniors at West Adams Prep accepted to a four-year college more than tripled from 9% to 39% over 5 years and seniors at Manual Arts accepted to a four-year college more than doubled, from 18% to 40% in only two years. A full 100% of the recent Manual Arts High School graduates were admitted to a two- or four-year college.

 LAUP is a non-profit that was initially created in 2004 by First 5 LA, our primary funder, to fund preschool for four-year-olds in Los Angeles County. First 5 LA was created by the California Children and Families First Initiative of 1998 (Proposition 10).

 The organizationâ€™s landmark project was the 2012 Performance and Public Art Festival, co-organized with the Getty Foundation under the umbrella of the major regionwide initiative, Pacific Standard Time: L.A. Art 1945-80. The 11-day festival featured new public artworks throughout the city; a dramatic sampling of the large-scale spectacles, expansive performances, and small-scale interventions that punctuated the history of postwar art in Los Angeles. In addition, new performances premiered each day, including outdoor visual spectacles, experimental theater and sound art, social and political interventions, and media art. A nightly after-party, Black Box, provided a space for socializing, and included surprise performances each evening.
 
 
 
 
 
 LAXART welcomes the community to interact with contemporary art as part of the everyday through L.A.P.D. initiatives. Our programming is central to the history of public art in L.A. Highlights include: Ruben Ochaâ€™s 2006 Extracted Freeway Wall Intervention, a photographic image of a Los Angeles landscape stretched on and interrupting a freeway wall; Jedediah Cesarâ€™s Gleanerâ€™s Stone, a resin sculpture temporarily sited at the NE corner of Washington Blvd. and Marcasel Avenue in Culver City as part of the 2008 California Biennial; Doug Aitkenâ€™s Migration, the acclaimed artistâ€™s first monumental public project in L.A. seen from Santa Monica Boulevard at Almont Drive in 2009; Joel Kyackâ€™s Superclogger, a mobile theatre mounted in the back of a pick-up truck, which traveled all around Los Angeles to the surprise of other motorists in summer 2010; and Piero Goliaâ€™s Luminous Sphere, a blue globe mounted on the top of the Standard Hotel in West Hollywood in 2010-11.",,,2013119

While all performances are free, all Levitt artists are paid a competitive fee to perform, ensuring excellence. Levitt venues serve as catalysts for change in a community by reclaiming green spaces, activating underused public spaces, & breaking social & economic barriers that often preclude access to the arts.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>There are now six state-of-the-art Levitt pavilions in places as diverse as Los Angeles & Pasadena; Memphis, Tenn.; Arlington, Texas; Westport, Conn.; & Bethlehem, Pa. Each Levitt Pavilion is a community destination. Levittâ€™s open lawn settings encourage people to mingle, strengthening social connections.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>But it wasnâ€™t always this way. Consider what Levitt locations used to be:
 
 
 the nationâ€™s largest brownfield; a problematic landfill; crime-ridden & abandoned parks; & a dormant downtown with little economic activity.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>Today, the Levitt network serves more than half a million people each year through 300+ free concerts nationwide. Pavilions are currently in development in Denver, Sioux Falls & Houston, & we are in conversations with nearly a dozen other cities across the country.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>The L.A. region is home to two Levitt venues. Levitt Pasadena opened in 2003, reviving an abandoned, WPA-era band shell in the once troubled Memorial Park. The national Levitt organization approached city officials with the idea to renovate the pavilion & create an annual series of free performances featuring acclaimed, emerging talent to seasoned, award-winning artists, using the arts as a vehicle to transform the park. Ten years later, Levitt Pasadena is now a treasured community asset & the park is an active & thriving magnet for families.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>In 2007, Levitt L.A. opened in MacArthur Park, transforming this once crime-ridden park into a welcoming destination. The band shellâ€™s renovation served as the catalyst for the overall parkâ€™s renewal. Levitt L.A. is the only organization that provides consistent free performing arts programming each year in the Westlake District, one of L.A.â€™s most densely populated & underserved communities. With 40 percent of the Westlake community living at or below the poverty level, Levitt L.A.â€™s childrenâ€™s series gives thousands of underprivileged youth access to exceptional arts programming that would otherwise be cost prohibitive to attend.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>Both Levitt venues in Southern California have a proven track record of success, & every year audiences increase. In 2012, both Levitt L.A. & Levitt Pasadena were voted â€œBest Free Summer Concert Seriesâ€ by LA Weekly, & Levitt Pasadena was voted â€œBest Live Music Venueâ€ by Pasadena Weekly. The pavilions are both centrally located & accessible by car, bus, Metro & are in walking distance of neighborhoods.</p>",,,2015113

Over the last decade, LIFT has established a track record of success in supporting families on their path to economic security.

Using research, organizing, coalition-building, policy advocacy and communications, LAANE has won programs that uplift job quality in local industries, provide health benefits for workers, and increase the number of and access to good jobs as well as training for them. Our work has won policies that link economic development to cleaning up the environment in low-income communities.</p>
 
 
 <p>LAANE helped to launch the Community Benefits movement in 2001 and built coalitions that won Community Benefits Agreements for major economic developments, guaranteeing a wide range of environmental, economic and other benefits for communities. Our groundbreaking work on the CBA for LAX Airport allocated $500 million to environmental studies and mitigations that have reduced noise and air pollution generated by the Airport.</p>
 
 
 <p>LAANEâ€™s work on trucking at the Ports of LA and Long Beach established a â€œconcessionâ€ program that has resulted in scrapping 16,000 polluting trucks and replacing them with trucks meeting the highest standards for low emissionsâ€”reducing truck-caused pollution by 80% to date.</p>
 
 
 <p>We have won approval of policies to uplift job quality and improve job access and training in construction, including developments at the Port of LA, work under the Department of Public Works, and, most recently, major transit projects planned by the County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. These Construction Careers Policies have already yielded training and employment for thousands of disadvantaged workers and will ultimately reach close to 90,000. One of our newest projects provides for training disadvantaged LA workers to carry out energy efficiency measures in buildings all over the City in partnership with the Department of Water and Power.</p>
 
 
 <p>Much of our work has been about job qualityâ€”beginning with our victory in the 1997 landmark LA Living Wage Ordinance. Since then, we have won other living wage policies and upgraded the original policy several times.</p>
 
 
 <p>We have produced the highest quality research reports on the industries that we have targeted and on poverty and jobs. We developed a communications program that rivals those of many much larger non-profit organizations.</p>

The Task Force is a coalition composed of over 35 public and private non-profit agencies as well community leaders, research partners, advocates for mothers, infants, and families, survivors of maternal depression and affected family members. Through its programs and initiatives, the Task Force aims to: (1) Raise public awareness of the disorder so that women who are suffering are not ashamed or embarrassed to seek help; (2) Increase perinatal depression screening and referral rates among community and health care providers; and (3) Advocate for legislation that supports the identification and treatment of perinatal depression. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Since its inception, the Task Force has:
 
 
 
 
 
 *Obtained the dedication of May of every year as Perinatal Depression Awareness Month throughout Los Angeles County and the state of California. 
 
 
 *Distributed over 800,000 Speak Up When You're Down: Six Things Every New Mom and Mom-to-Be Should Know About Maternal Depression posters and brochures (available in 7 languages).
 
 
 *Developed a Training & Technical Assistance program that has delivered tailored perinatal mood disorder trainings to over 1,500 health care and community-based providers.
 
 
 *Published a Community Providers Perinatal Mental Health Toolkit, which includes information and handouts on the signs, symptoms, risk factors, effects, screening, assessment, prevention, and intervention for perinatal depression and related mood and anxiety disorders for providers. 
 
 
 *Launched an innovative, first of its kind, pilot project with USC-Eisner Family Medicine to implement an IMPACT model in which perinatal mental health is embedded in primary care visits both for screening and intervention. 
 
 
 *Co-sponsored ACR 53 (Hernandez), the Kelly Abraham Martinez Act, which urges hospital providers, mental health care providers, health plans, and insurers to invest resources to educate women about perinatal depression risk factors and triggers.

LAFPC is the subject of two national evaluations and was profiled as a model in a report by the Applied Research Center entitled, Good Food+Good Jobs For All: Challenges and Opportunities to Advance Racial and Economic Equity in the Food System.</p>
 
 
 <p>Key LAFPC achievements include:</p>
 
 
 <p>â€¢ Good Food Purchasing Pledge. LAFPC developed and successfully advanced the most comprehensive Good Food Procurement policy in the nation. The policy was adopted by the City of LA through a Mayoral executive directive and a LA City Council motion on 10/24/2012, and by the LAUSD, the second largest food purchaser in California, on 11/13/2012. GFPP is the first municipal food procurement policy in the country to include labor standards.</p>
 
 
 <p>â€¢ Community Market Conversion (CMC) Collaborative. LAFPC created the CMC Collaborative to continue the work of the Community Redevelopment Agency-initiated CMC program and received funding for at least three additional store conversions, in partnership with a CDFI. LAFPC has pioneered the use of business and leadership development trainings for neighborhood markets interested in offering healthier fare. The first event, â€œFrom Corner Store to Community Grocer: Everything You Need To Know To Be a Healthy Food Retailer,â€ held in July 2012, offered over a dozen workshops and provided storeowners and community groups with technical, marketing and produce management skills to expand healthy food retail. Over 150 people participated, including 60 storeowners from across LA County. The second training, held on March 19, 2013, focused on Korean American store owners.</p>
 
 
 <p>â€¢ National Food Day, October 24, 2012. LAFPC organized an information fair in City Hall Rotunda of its seven Working Groupsâ€™ priorities and achievements with over 100 guests; hosted a speakersâ€™ program with an announcement and signing by Mayor Villaraigosa of the Good Food Purchasing Policy executive directive, and comments from Council Members Paul Koretz and Jan Perry, and Dr. Jonathan Fielding, Director of LA County Department of Public Health; received a Food Day resolution from Council Member Eric Garcetti; followed by the unanimous adoption of the Good Food Procurement motion by City Council.</p>

The Forum has organized lectures, symposia, events, exhibitions, competitions, and publications throughout its history. We are a non-profit organization that operates outside of the realms of professional practice and architecture schools. Our members consist of architects, planners, engineers, designers, educators, students, artists, and other people interested in the built environment in Los Angeles.
 
 
 
 
 
 Our publication history includes a significant pamphlet series between 2003 and 2010 that included Dead Malls, Out the Window (LAX), Polar Inertia, After the City, This (Is How We Live), Pendulum Plane, and Meet the Nelsons. The series explored Los Angeles urban design and architecture through creative responses, such as comic book styles and fake screenplays, as well as through speculative architectural projects as part of the Forumâ€™s sponsorship of competitions. In addition, the Forum has published a quarterly newsletter since our founding that provides space for critical thinkers to write about Los Angeles. We have also published larger-scale books, including Experimental Architecture in Los Angeles (Rizzoli International) and Everyday Urbanism (Monacelli Press).
 
 
 
 
 
 The Forumâ€™s public events, including lectures and symposia, continue to play an active role in the identity of LA design. One of our most significant past events focused on the aftermath of the LA Uprisings in 1992, when we brought together our members and the National Organization of Minority Architects for the event â€œAlternative Disorders: On Designing Communities.â€ We also sponsor quarterly Pecha Kucha events for designers to share their work with the community, as well as a lecture series called â€œOut There Doing Itâ€ that spotlights emerging design practices and the â€œOn the Mapâ€ series that provides architectural tours of buildings given by the architects who designed them.
 
 
 
 
 
 In our 25-year history, we have sponsored design competitions to focus attention on opportunities for rethinking the vitality of urban LA. These have included Civic Innovations (1994), Dead Malls (2003), Liner (2008), and Dingbat 2.0 (2010). Our most recent competition on Dingbats focused on the reinvention of this classic LA housing prototype for a new generation of urban citizens, resulting in a forthcoming book and an exhibition of the competition entries. 
 
 
 The Forum continues to actively engage all of Los Angeles and has two exhibitions planned this summer for our space in the Woodbury University Hollywood gallery. These exhibitions focus on alternative housing typologies for Los Angeles and will be open throughout the summer for free to the public.",,,2013124

Our mission is to build healthier, stronger and safer neighborhoods through the creation of urban parks and community gardens. We are dedicated to bringing accessible, recreational green spaces to LAâ€™s most park-poor areas. Through grassroots organizing, community leadership development, and programming, we empower residents in low-income areas to transform their neighborhoods through action, involvement and ownership. This unique and highly effective business model delivers parks and gardens where they are needed most, eliminating bureaucracy and assuring long-term sustainability. Based on census tract data, we currently serve approximately 21,240 residents annually with our parks and gardens, and will add the equivalent of seven football fields of green space by 2015. 
 
 
 
 
 
 In 2012, we completed six projects, including: building two new parks (Fox & Laurel Park & Community Garden, set to open summer 2013); a new childrenâ€™s community garden (Mariposa-Nabi); a community garden at an existing park (Unidad); and a major remodel of another garden (MC Francis). Through a tax default process for non-profits, we were able to purchase an existing garden (Glazer) and protect it from public auction. We worked with committee members to hold 50 community meetings, 15 cleanups and 10 community-led events, and offered leadership training and educational and recreational programming. 
 
 
 
 
 
 In a general sense, our most important achievement is the creation and implementation of a unique methodology. We emphasize grassroots organizing and community involvement in the creation and management of our spaces. We work with the community to identify vacant land in low-income areas for future park and garden sites. Properties are acquired fee-simple or leased and held in perpetuity to ensure protection of the site. Outreach is performed in the surrounding Â¼ mile, mobilizing nonprofits, schools, parents, health clinics and community groups. Meetings are held to see if residents want a park and what facilities they desire. Community Organizers help residents create a park stewardship committee, identify neighborhood needs and train volunteers to spearhead planning, development and maintenance. Whether the goal is to grow fresh foods, provide after-school activities or create a place of beauty, projects fulfill community needs. Our management approach ensures long-term community involvement, proper maintenance and stewardship.",,,2015127

We have received extravagant praise from the larger literary community. The New Yorker called us â€œan instant jewel of the internet,â€ Pico Iyer said we are â€œlike 1000 angels descending,â€ Salman Rushdie claims ours was the best piece of criticism written about his work, & writers Jon Robin Baitz & Michael Tolkin call LARB â€œthe best literary magazine in the country.â€ But more importantly the best writers in the country want to write for us, & continue to come to us not only from all over L.A. County, but also from New York, Boston, the Midwest, the West, & overseas. We have achieved the status of a major voice in the cultural conversation in a remarkably short time. We have been recognized by the publishing industry in Publisherâ€™s Weekly, the business community in Forbes, & the academic community in Chronicle of Higher Education, & many other venues. The accolades are based on our daily achievements in bringing forth smart, dynamic, beautifully written, carefully curated, edited, & fact-checked essays, reviews and interviews and the conversations that develop about them on the website. Primarily, in other words, our site is our achievement, an ever-growing, intelligently interlinked conversation on literature, art, music, film, TV, politics, new media, & the rest of our shared culture. We have succeeded in bringing together writers from around the world, bringing together new writers with top professionals, writers from a wide variety of different cultural worlds: literary fiction, SF, fantasy, mystery, thriller & other genres; the commercial publishing world & the nonprofit & academic worlds; the big presses and the small and the self-published; artists, architects, sociologists, medical researchers, musicians, filmmakers, scientists, & TV writers; & all of these from across a broad array of the immigrant communities that define L.A. We cover a much wider range of texts, genres, media, & topics than the traditional periodicals in this field, reflective of the less hierarchical, less tradition-bound culture of Los Angeles. While the other arts have enjoyed national prominence, literature & criticism have lagged. We feel we have succeeded in making people (including the New York publishing world) understand the importance, diversity, and vibrancy of the literary culture of this, the largest book market in the world, & in making the perspective of L.A. writers we provide part of the necessary reading for publishing professionals around the world.

LTSC reaches 18,000 people each year.

 As part of our community development work, LTSC has made significant efforts to revitalize Little Tokyo into a vibrant community. LTSC has worked in partnership with other entities to designate a major portion of Little Tokyo as a National Historic Landmark. LTSC has renovated and upgraded three buildings in the historic district:<br/><br/>
 
 
 
 
 
 *San Pedro Firm Building. This 1923 building was threatened with demolition by the City but quick action by LTSC and community advocates saved the building. After a $3 million renovation, it now provides 42 units of safe, clean, affordable housing to low-income seniors and other residents, and commercial space to longstanding and new small businesses. <br/><br/>
 
 
 
 
 
 *Old Union Church Building. Immediately next-door to the San Pedro Firm Building is the historic Old Union Church, one of the earliest Japanese American Christian church structures built in Los Angeles. In the 1970â€™s, the church congregation relocated and the aging building suffered in the ensuing years from neglect. Again LTSC led the effort to raise $4 million to bring this building back to life and now this once abandoned space is The Union Center for the Arts.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 *The Historic Far East Building with its famous Far East CafÃ© is located in the heart of the Little Tokyo Historic District, bearing witness to the birth, growth and development of what was, during its heyday in the 1920s and 30s, the largest Japanese American community in the mainland United States. After suffering severe damage during the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the buildingâ€™s future was uncertain, possibly taking with it all of its history. LTSC was able to save the building to keep this part of Little Tokyoâ€™s history alive. 
 
 
 
 
 
 *Casa Heiwa. Additionally, in 1996 LTSC completed the first new family-oriented housing project to be built in Little Tokyo in over 70 years. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Through LTSCâ€™s community organizing efforts we have established relationships with Little Tokyo residents and have taught them to collectively and formally represent their concerns. Moreover, we have worked with residents to develop a model for community involvement in planning. With our support and guidance, the residents have lobbied for two crosswalks, a post office and helped successfully fight to preserve affordable housing at a 100-unit building. They have also lobbied against a proposed 500-bed jail and have fought to limit bail bonds businesses in the area.",,,2013128

We design networks of patients, physicians, and researchers in collaborations that create breakthrough solutions.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Over the past three years Lybba is a founding designer of the Collaborative Chronic Care Network (C3N), a new model for devising and testing innovations in clinical care and research. We are designing tools that help patients track their health between appointments, visualize their health over time via clear and engaging graphics, communicate with physicians using online and mobile applications, and choose to share their medical data with other patients and researchers. By increasing patient engagement, the C3N can transform the experience and outcomes of illness, and accelerate the discovery and application of new knowledge. (Supported by the National Institutes of Health.) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Lybba is currently designing and building an automated decision-support aid for doctors and patients to use together to achieve better outcomes. By using this software product, patients with serious chronic illnesses will arrive at decisions about the treatment options most suitable to their particular situation. (Supported by a major L.A. research medical center.)
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Lybba designed a Genetic Care Interchange that networks the collective experience of patients, researchers, and physicians, along with genetic information, to supply insight for creating new genetically defined targets for drug development. (Supported by southern California life-sciences company.)
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Lybba designed a knowledge base of medical diagnostics, including knowledge-sharing models for how potential contributors--such as MDs, patients, organizations, and others--will participate in the creation and cultivation of an online knowledge base of medical diagnostic information and techniques. (Supported by The California Endowment.)
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Lybba is a co-designer of the Regional Resource Network of quality improvement leaders throughout the country. With the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, we are devising prototypes that will make it easier for people to develop, curate, and spread knowledge.

 For ten years, M&A has transformed a parking lot in Silver Lake into an internationally-acclaimed center for materials research and artistic expression on an architectural scale exhibiting large-scale installations. M&A projects at this site are designed by artists and architects and built with volunteers from the community - winning three American Institute of Architects (AIA) awards, as well as other design awards and recognitions. M&A produced the inaugural performance for The Gettyâ€™s Pacific Standard Time with Judy Chicago - coordinating hands-on workshops for the public alongside the legendary artist to create an environment out of 25 tons of dry ice. The founder, Jenna Didier received the Neutra Spirit award 2010 and the Silver Lake History Collective award in 2011 for a lasting contribution to the cultural fabric of the Silver Lake district. 
 
 
 <br>
 
 
 <br>
 
 
 While M&A has been committed to working with â€œsustainableâ€ materials and environments long before the term was popular, projects that have specifically sought to bring public attention to environmental and sustainability issues include a pneumatically-operated origami robotic garden by Eddy Sykes and the community-designed Taco Garden which explored sustainable gardening techniques in an aquaponics garden that re-circulated rainwater for growing tilapia and other fish taco ingredientsâ€”onions, cilantro and tomatoes.
 
 
 <br>
 
 
 <br>
 
 
 Via a series of hands-on bilingual workshops commissioned by the Los Angeles Environmental Affairs Department, M&A managed the successful transformation of another blighted parking lot into a rainwater capturing surface with edible perimeter plantings tended by grateful mixed- use building residents and employees. Some benefits were: decreases in stormwater runoff from the parking lot, decreases in heat island effect, increases in social engagement between building residents and employees working downstairs. Prior to our work, then had not even been introduced.

 Rate of Planting-6X the last two administrations
 
 
 
 
 
 According to the City of Los Angeles Urban Forest Division, Los Angles (including the City, NGOs and developers) planted an average of 10,000 trees annually during the previous two administrations. With limited resources and no direct funding from the Cityâ€™s General Fund, MTLA has increased the annual tree planting six-fold (average 60,000/year).
 
 
 
 
 
 Rate of Survival -Double the National Average
 
 
 Research conducted by the US Forest Service, the national new tree mortality rate is between 10% and 12%. MTLAâ€™s mortality rate is half the national average at 4% and 5%. 
 
 
 
 
 
 A National Model
 
 
 The US Forest Service conducted a national study of large municipal tree planting programs in 2010/11 and found Million Trees LA to be a top model.

Because of Measure R Los Angeles has embarked on this countryâ€™s most ambitious transit expansion â€” a virtual doubling of the size of LA Countyâ€™s light rail, subway and bus way transit system from 120 miles and 103 stations to 236 miles and 200 stations. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Former Santa Monica Mayor Denny Zane recognized the opportunity created by the commitment of Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, then in his first term, to building a transit system. In January 2008, with the help of the Annenberg Foundation, Zane convened a â€œtransportation conversationâ€ with major stakeholders, including business, labor, and environmental leaders, agency leadership, elected officials, a pollster and a political consultant. It was decided on that fateful day to mount a campaign to get a county sales tax measure to build out a robust transit system on the ballot that November.
 
 
 
 
 
 Mayor Villaraigosa has proved an energetic and skillful champion, and this coalition succeeded in passing the 30-year Measure R sales tax to provide $25 billion for public transit â€” even as the Great Recession came howling down upon the nation. The Mayor, LA Metro and the Move LA coalition worked with the Obama Administration, Senator Barbara Boxer and Congress to secure funding and to create an ambitious new low-interest loan program, that is the largest transportation infrastructure financing fund in the history of the U.S. Department of Transportation. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Measure R construction is in full swing: Last year LA Metro opened the Expo Line to Culver City and the Orange Line extension to Chatsworth, construction began on Expo to Santa Monica and continued on the Foothill Extension of the Gold Line to Azusa. Utilities are being relocated so construction can begin on the Westside Subway and the Regional Connector, and Metro is showing off station designs for the Green Line extension to LAX and options for the Sepulveda corridor. Buoyed by this momentum this business-labor-environmental coalition went back to voters in November 2012 to extend Measure R and enable Metro to use the longer revenue stream to secure financing and accelerate construction â€” at a time when interest rates and construction costs are at historic lows. Measure J won an overwhelming 66.1% of the vote, proving voters enthusiastically support this transit revolution, but failed to pass because of a â€˜technicalityâ€™ â€” only in California do such measures require 2/3 voter approval to become law.
 
 
 
 
 
 One clear measure of Move LAâ€™s success is that the Measure R campaign secured $25 billion for transit capital and operations, an investment expected to result in 400,000 good jobs and a major boost to the local and regional economy.",,,2018084

The guiding vision for the $135 million NHM Next Campaign is to bring the Museumâ€™s most important collections and ambitious discoveries out of our science labs to create new visitor experiences that explore the â€œbig pictureâ€ of life on our planet and the interrelatedness of our natural and cultural worlds. We are only four months away from completion of this historic transformation. NHM Next is changing the way we can educate our visitor base. Each year, 200,000 visitors from local schools visit the Museum â€“ more than a quarter of all the students in LAUSD â€“ free of charge. NHM has the most diverse, broadest visitor base of any comparable museum in the Western U.S.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Among the seven major exhibitions that comprise NHM Next are the NHM Nature Gardens and Nature Lab. These exhibits form an expansive indoor-outdoor interface with the urban wildlife of Los Angeles, a site where visitors and researchers can study biodiversity and environmental change as it happens. Visitors will be able to observe and take part in the scientific process, and to learn valuable lessons about our environment. The Nature Lab will be the Museumâ€™s center for Citizen Science. It is a hub of nature investigation and scientific research outfitted with interactive media and tactile â€œhands-onâ€ experiences to connect the Museumâ€™s exhibits and collections indoors to the â€œraw materialâ€ visitors encounter outdoors. The exhibit will invite visitors to experience the cityâ€™s rich biodiversity and give them a way to contribute to real, ongoing study of our urban ecosystem. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 In addition to the massive physical accomplishments at the Museum, NHM has a team of dozens of researchers, in fields ranging from archaeology to entomology. These world-class researchers are contributing to academic and scientific discourse every day. NHM researchers are frequently published in the highest echelon of scientific journals. Some recent, notable accomplishments from the Museumâ€™s research and collections department include Project 23, a massive, historic discovery of thousands of Ice-age fossils operating in the public eye in Rancho La Brea, in the heart of Mid-City Los Angeles; an NSF-funded biodiversity inventory in Costa Rica led by NHM Entomologist Dr. Brian Brown; and the â€œPregnant Plesiosaurâ€ displayed in NHMâ€™s new Dinosaur Hall â€“ NHM paleontologists discovered a perfectly preserved plesiosaur (a 72 million year-old marine reptile) with a fetus inside, that has yielded tremendous scientific knowledge about live birth in these ancient reptiles.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 With NHM Next we are setting a new example of how a museum can be a part of the life of a great 21st century city. We will serve as a nature, science and culture destination in the heard of Los Angeles County. It is a transformation unprecedented in our history and designed to set the course for the next hundred years.",,,2013141

Netiya cultivates gardens to tithe nutritious food and build community food security, and organizes community to seed a more just and resilient local food system. Netiya's objectives are to address food insecurity proactively, and to organize around the ethics of our institutional-scale food choices.
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>Netiya's Just Gardens program converts unused land at our institutions, and teaches how to grow and tithe nutritious food sustainably. Netiya then trains these communities to sustain Just Gardens from seeding through tithing. Since March 2011, Netiya has installed eight sustainable Just Gardens & runs over 40 community events a year in LA. Netiya will complete two new Just Garden installs in 2013.
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>Netiya's Just Foods program teaches our institutions to make informed and ethical food choices about procuring food, and distributing leftover or community-grown food. We strive to forge alliances to source food from LA's local farms with intent to place purchasing power from our 32-institution network behind our local farms. Just Foods has launched the Netiya Council to enhance collaboration between our network institutions. It functions to collaboratively produce campaigns, events and educational materials.
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>Seeds of Hope is a network of more than 200 institutions within the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles committed to the physical and spiritual wellness of individuals and communities. The Diocese currently has more than 30 community gardens, school gardens, and small farms producing fresh produce for distribution to food insecure individuals and families through its more than 40 food pantries and 50 feeding programs.
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>Seeds of Hope combines and coordinates these efforts in a way that leverages their collective strengths. Individuals and institutions can access books and a website of resources to guide participants on these topics as well, each prepared by network participants on topics of community gardens, edible landscaping, and urban farming and can take advantage of more that 30 training opportunities in the Diocese each year around specific topics from soil preparation to pruning and harvesting.
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>Seeds of Hope Executive Director Tim Alderson was the founding chairman of the California School Garden Network, which provides the structural model for Project 10. CSGN was created as a network of more than 40 organizations from the public and private sectors, who, despite their disparate and sometimes conflicting agendas, all shared a common interest in instructional school gardens. CSGN works to coordinate the efforts of these various organization in support of school gardens throughout California. The network has funded over 4,000 school gardens, developed extensive training for educators, and created lesson plans aligned to the state standards for teaching all core subjects, K through 12, in a garden setting.",,,2015144

Our research and practical exploration aim to break-down barriers to innovation within municipalities, allowing for deeper relationships between residents and government.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>CCIP launched in April 2012, and in our first year we have assembled a team of staff, interns, advisors, and partners that are dedicated to supporting CCIP in achieving long-term sustainability and changing the way California local governments work in order to be more responsive to their residents, enhancing social connectedness..</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>Major project accomplishments include:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>- In 2012, Vallejo, California launched the first city-wide participatory budgeting process in the United States. The City of Vallejo will invite residents to decide how to spend over $3.4 million in sales tax revenue. Through a year-long PB process, thousands of residents will engage in critical discussions and decisions about the future of the city. The process aims to generate more informed spending, develop new grassroots leaders, build stronger communities, educate the public, expand civic participation, and forge deeper connections between government officials and citizens. CCIP serves as a research partner on this project because we are interested in the numerous impacts participatory budgeting can have in a community.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>- In September 2012, CCIP began an exploration of how innovation spreads in local government, through a study of how local governmental leaders use formal and informal networks to share information. The project uses a diverse set of methodologies -- from conversations with experts on networks and city administration, to surveys and interviews with public servants and city government associations, to documentation of knowledge sharing practices in several innovative projects undertaken by cities and counties in California. Together, these methods will allow us to explain how city staffers currently receive and disseminate information related to innovation, the barriers to more effective diffusion of ideas and approaches, and the ways in which existing formal networks might be modified to promote better collaboration and communication. We hope that the study will build on successes in the civic innovation space by helping to institutionalize the spread of innovation within and between cities. We seek to provide a roadmap to formal networks for effective modification and replication of successful projects. Our findings report will be released the week of April 1st.</p>",,,2013144

Green Dotâ€™s dramatic expansion has been fueled by a commitment to â€˜doing what it takesâ€™ to break down the barriers that prevent students from thriving. Our first five schools were located throughout Los Angeles, with an emphasis on diverse neighborhoods that were underserved by traditional public schools. In 2012, those schools scored an average 764 on the Academic Performance Index (API), Californiaâ€™s primary measure of accountability; higher than both district and state averages. The schools are among the highest performing â€˜minorityâ€™ schools in California.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>In 2008, in collaboration with teachers and the community, Green Dot won control of Alain Leroy Locke High School, one of the lowest-achieving schools in the nation. Four years into the transformation, the Locke schools scored over 600 API compared to a pre-transformation score of 511. In 2010, Green Dot launched a new strategy to address the chronic attainment levels of incoming 9th graders through the opening of high-quality middle schools, two the result of a takeover of Henry Clay Middle School, ranked as the worst middle school in California. Concurrently, LAUSD invited us to take over David Starr Jordan High School, located in the heart of the Jordan Downs housing project in Watts. Early indicators suggest that students at these schools are already experiencing significant gains under the Green Dot model. </p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>Joining Green Dot, No Right Brain Left Behind brings expertise in design-centered problem solving. NRBLB started a movement in 2011 that highlighted the wide-scale concerns for the countryâ€™s creativity crisis and the desire to find solutions. During a seven day innovation challenge, NRBLB asked the best in the creative industries to develop â€˜creativity generatorsâ€™ to be used in the classroom. Renowned innovators and experts including Sir Ken Robinson, Yves Behar, Daniel Pink, Deepak Chopra, and Scott Belsky joined the cause. Over 150 world-class companies such as Frog Design, BBDO, Wolff Olins, and Saatchi&Saatchi developed over 300 concepts. The winning concept received in-company funding to bring their concept to action. </p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>NRBLB has been awarded accolades by Core77Design and The Swedish-American Chamber of Commerce; presented at events such as TEDx, Art Directors Club, and LiveWire; and been featured in FastCompany, GOOD Magazine, Core77, BrainPickings, Design Mind, and Art Rebels. To date, NRBLB has built a strong coalition of companies, design schools, education networks, and creative professionals able to develop scalable, low-cost, and adoptable innovation tools that enhance creativity inside and outside of classrooms. </p>",,,2013145

Since 1995, we have originated over 3,200 loans, totaling $35 million, to disadvantaged microentrepreneurs in Californiaâ€™s largest urban centers. As noted above, our borrowers have an 85% business survival rate, and each Opportunity Fund loan creates or maintains an average of 2.5 jobs. Additionally, Opportunity Fundâ€™s loans result in a â€œripple effectâ€ of new revenues, wages, and taxesâ€”every $1 we lend generates nearly $2 in new annual economic activity. 
 
 
 
 
 
 In 2011, Opportunity Fund successfully launched the pilot of our EasyPay loan product. EasyPay builds on our successful microlending results, taking this proven strategy one step further by leveraging technology to expand the pool of potential microloan borrowers, simplify the repayment process, and help entrepreneurs improve business performance. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Since its inception, Opportunity Fund has grown from a local, multi-bank consortium serving Silicon Valley to a nationally-recognized microfinance institution. In the process, the organizationâ€™s leadership has seized on opportunities to introduce innovative strategies to expand our impact on underbanked communities in the San Francisco Bay Area and Greater Los Angeles. Opportunity Fund has successfully adapted to the shifting economic landscape by developing new products, implementing new outreach initiatives, and nurturing new partnerships that enable clients to build assets despite changing market conditions. At the same time, Opportunity Fund has followed a smooth growth curve from a staff of five people to more than 50 in four locations. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Opportunity Fund is seen as a thought leader in microfinance, with a track record of community impact and a reputation for innovation in developing new microfinance strategies that promote economic opportunity and meet clientsâ€™ needs. As Californiaâ€™s largest nonprofit microlender, Opportunity Fund is the only organization providing affordable, appropriate credit to LAâ€™s low-income small businesses at any scaleâ€”we originated more than 300 microloans in the County in 2012 (and 1,002 microloans state-wide). 
 
 
 
 
 
 Opportunity Fund has always been distinguished among economic development organizations for our commitment to reaching the hardest-to-reach clients and achieving deep impact.

Residents learned to identify environmental hazards and access resources to address those hazards, how to increase awareness of environmental health issues and become advocates for change. From 2006 through the present, our Community and Environmental Planning work has focused on community wide environmental issues and to date program staff has engaged hundreds of residents in workshops and presentations in order to identify and prioritize environmental concerns. Most recently this has included advocacy to reduce the impacts of diesel pollution and to promote policies to transform Environmental Justice communities, such as our landmark Clean Up, Green Up campaign working with organizations throughout the city to reduce, mitigate, and revitalize communities like Pacoima. 
 
 
 Weâ€™re proud members of the Donâ€™t Waste LA Coalition to create a more efficient waste and recycling industry in Los Angeles and ensure Clean Air, Good Jobs, and Recycling for All, and the RePower LA Coalition to lead LA into an energy efficient future with a plan to save money on energy bills, reduce dependency on dirty coal, and create local, career-path jobs. Through these coalition efforts, we are working to improve the quality of our local jobs and environment, while limiting the concentration of environmental harms and increasing the availability of environmental benefits. We also partner with UCLA Community Research In Cancer (CORICA) - the aim of the CORICA Network is to build community-university partnerships to conduct cancer prevention and control research in underserved communities in Los Angeles and surrounding areas. It aims to conduct research that will help eliminate socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities in cancer. We also have a long history of partnership with the US Environmental Protection Agency. 
 
 
 Our adult membership meet every month (on the fourth Thursday,6-8pm) to participate in advocacy, hone their public speaking skills, engage in environmental education, spread the word to their neighbors, and plan projects.
 
 
 Since 2002, our Safer Homes for a Healthy Community program has provide Pacoima families with information and support to reduce lead, asthma triggers, and home health hazards, including through Integrated Pest Management trainings. Since 2004 the Promotoras (community health workers) have reached hundreds of residents per year through presentations at schools, churches, fairs and other venues. The Safer Homes Program has been recognized by the US Environmental Protection Agency as a model program to prevent the impact of toxins.
 
 
 Revitalization - Increasing Environmental Benefits and Promoting Alternatives
 
 
 In 2008, Pacoima Beautiful was awarded a PLACE grant (Policies for Livable, Active Communities and Environments) from the LA County Department of Public Health, the only organization with an LA city-based project to receive such a grant. Through this grant, we worked with youth, community residents and experts to create a Vision Plan to revitalize the Pacoima Wash,a tributary of the LA River. The Wash holds amazing potential as an open space amenity for our community and we are continuing to work to realize our Vision with funds from Urban Greening and other sources.
 
 
 Pacoima Beautiful held over 20 community meetings to get input on the project with different community organizations including: parent centers, neighborhood councils, homeowner associations, and youth groups.
 
 
 â€¢ Held 2 large community events including a Pacoima Wash Mobile Charette where the community walked along the Pacoima Wash and gave input which over 100 people attended.
 
 
 â€¢ Successfully included our vision plan for revitalizing the Sylmar portion of the Pacoima Wash into the Pacoima Community Plan.
 
 
 â€¢ Received Urban Greening Grant to create a plan for implementing vegetated bio-swales along streets in Pacoima which will capture and treat storm water runoff before it enters the wash.
 
 
 â€¢ Cosmetic improvements to a pedestrian bridge over the Pacoima Wash used by over 200 students.
 
 
 â€¢ Plan to develop a 2 acre vacant lot adjacent to the wash which is currently blight into a new pocket park.
 
 
 
 
 
  As part of this work, we also serve on the Disadvantaged Community (DAC) committee of the Greater Los Angeles County Integrated Regional Water Management group (GLAC-IRWM). Integrated Regional Water Management is a statewide effort to promote more efficient water resource management and planning by encouraging regionâ€wide collaboration.
 
 
 In spring of 2010, we were awarded a RENEW grant (Renew Environments for Nutrition, Exercise, and Wellness), also from the LA County Department of Public Health. This grant is part of the Center for Disease Controlâ€™s Communities Putting Prevention to Work initiative. Through this grant, we worked to create a vision for Complete Streets based on community and expert input, and worked with our public partner, CRA/LA, to incorporate community priorities for more pedestrian/cyclist friendly streets into their proposed Streetscape Improvement Project for the Pacoima Town Center. Due to state budget cuts, CRA/LAâ€™s funding has been closed, so we will continue to pursue other avenues to promote Complete Streets infrastructure, walking and biking. As part of this campaign, we also hosted a 12 session workshop series, Peopleâ€™s Planning School. Some accomplishments of the Caminos del Pueblo/Complete Streets Campaign include:
 
 
 â€¢ Gathered input from over 300 residents to identify priorities for streetscape improvements needed to improve Van Nuys Blvd. and promote walking, biking, and public transit use.
 
 
 â€¢ Presented the project goals to dozens of community organizations including: parent centers, neighborhood councils, homeowner associations, and youth groups.
 
 
 â€¢ Held 12 Peopleâ€™s Planning School workshops.
 
 
 â€¢ Participated in the Mayoral ThinkBike Summit with LADOT,LACBC, and others to create a vision for a more bike-able Van Nuys Blvd.
 
 
 â€¢ Received Itâ€™s Up to All of Us pedestrian safety advocacy grant.
 
 
 â€¢ Collaborated with LADOT to inform a Safe Routes To Schools grant application to improve Pierce and Herrick.
 
 
 â€¢ Grassroots-led improvement projects and events such as tree plantings, tile murals, public art, PARKing Day, and joint pro-bike and pro-walk events with Youth.
 
 
 â€¢ Joined the burgeoning equitable transit and transit-oriented development coalition, Alliance for a Community Transit, LA (ACT-LA).
 
 
 
 
 
 Youth Environmentalists â€“Building the Future Generation
 
 
 Our Pacoima Beautiful Youth Environmentalists program (PB-YES) trains the next generation of community leaders, giving local teenagers opportunities for meaningful community involvement and promoting leadership development, civic learning and environmental awareness.
 
 
 Students get involved through year-round after-school groups, Youth United Towards Environmental Protection (YUTEP),and intensive summer service-learning Institutes on topics such as â€œHealthy Eating, Active Livingâ€.
 
 
 YUTEP members have helped conduct surveys on key community issues and outreach to residents. Recent Institutes have drafted policy briefs, uncovered toxic contamination in a trailer park, and created open space proposals.
 
 
 Most recently, YUTEP has expanded its efforts by forming high school chapters in Arleta High School, San Fernando High School, Discovery Charter, and Vaughn International Studies Academy.",,,2016161

 In 2009 our first major success was passing LAUSDâ€™s historic Public School Choice resolution. It opened up hundreds of failing and newly constructed campuses for bidding by quality charter school operators, teachers, and other non-profits.
 
 
 
 
 
 We ran a grassroots campaign that generated over 4,000 supportive postcards from parents and then organized 3,000 parents for a rally on the day of the vote. 
 
 
 
 
 
 When we passed LAUSDâ€™s Public School Choice policy we gave birth to the parent empowerment movement.
 
 
 
 
 
 The Parent Trigger Law
 
 
 
 
 
 In January 2010 we passed Californiaâ€™s Parent Trigger law â€“ a concept far more powerful than Public School Choice. The law empowers a majority of parents at failing schools to transform them. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Parent Trigger law has reframed the public debate on the role organized and empowered parents can play in public school reform. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Comptonâ€™s McKinley Elementary School Campaign
 
 
 
 
 
 In December 2010 we helped parents at McKinley Elementary School in Compton, CA become the first to successfully use the Parent Trigger law by submitting signatures of over 61% of their schoolâ€™s parents. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Parents Union Chapters and Policy Training
 
 
 
 
 
 Parents Union Chapters are dedicated to improving educational outcomes at local schools through organizing and activism. A major project we undertake with each chapter is to provide parents comprehensive education policy training to help them formally evaluate the strengths and weaknesses within their schools. 
 
 
 
 
 
  â€œParent Power Expressâ€ Bus Tour
 
 
 
 
 
 In September 2011, our â€œParent Power Expressâ€ bus tour made stops at our Los Angeles area chapters before ending in Sacramento. The tour showcased the incredible, important organizing work Parents Union Chapters are doing to transform their childrenâ€™s under-performing schools through the Parent Trigger law.
 
 
 It was a hugely successful media campaign that promoted the continued expansion of growing parent empowerment movement. It proved that the work we started in L.A is on the cutting edge of the most dynamic school transformation movements in the country. 
 
 
 Parent Trigger Law Regulations
 
 
 In 2011, we completed a campaign to pass final State Board of Education Parent Trigger law regulations. We mobilized a powerful grassroots movement and generated supportive editorials from almost every major newspaper in California. 
 
 
 Desert Trails Elementary School
 
 
 In January 2012, parents launched the nationâ€™s 2nd Parent Trigger campaign. In January 2013 the Adelanto School Board finally complied with two court orders. This is the first time in the United States a school board voted to approve Parent Trigger implementation. 
 
 
 LAUSDâ€™s 24th Street Elementary School
 
 
 In January the 24th Street Elementary Parents Union Chapter launched the first Parent Trigger campaign at an LAUSD school. 69% of school parents signed the petition. 
 
 
 In February, on a 7- 0 vote, the Board of Education unanimously approved the parentsâ€™ petition.",,,2013150

 In 2010, Pasadena Arts Council began conversations local leaders on the legacy and potential of Southern Californiaâ€™s arts and science assets â€“ assets, it was agreed, that distinguish the area in a unique way on a national basis and provide a framework for thinking about future economic and cultural development. These conversations led to the notion of a â€œvision summit,â€ gathering together community leaders for an extended version of this conversation. Later that year, a number of institutional and corporate leaders were invited to explore ideas for tapping the full potential of the unique fabric of arts and science. It was proposed that these intellectual and institutional assets define the region as a place where ideas and creativity abound, and that they reflect an unharnessed regional and national identity that can leverage the local economy, its cultural tourism, and its citizensâ€™ sense of pride and belonging. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Pasadena Arts Council is also very proud of its EMERGE fiscal sponsorship program. This cultural entrepreneurship program currently incubates 60 individual projects and emerging organizations, offering them the ability to seek funding through fiscal sponsorship, and supporting participants during a crucial stage. It provides an opportunity to develop a project and determine its trajectory with the guidance and oversight of an established nonprofit.â€‚ EMERGE supports artists who are launching new endeavors, those who are in the process of obtaining 501(c)(3) determination, and also projects and programs that prefer to remain fiscally sponsored, making use of PACâ€™s nonprofit infrastructure to support their ongoing efforts. In FY 2013, PAC helped these projects raise over $800,000 and serve over 43,000 people, including 12,000 young people, through after-school art and music programs, theater, dance and music performances, visual art exhibitions, public art commissions, literary and cultural festivals, photography and film projects and many other diverse, artist-driven projects throughout Southern California.

In 1976, the organization expanded the hotline to include counseling for victims of domestic violence. Over the years, Peace Over Violence has evolved beyond one-on-one intervention in sexual assaults and domestic abuse, toward one-by-one prevention of youth violence and child abuse, serving over 22,000 individuals a year. A leader in advocacy for victims of violence, Peace Over Violence played a major role in the acknowledgement of rape, battering, and stalking as crimes, changes to criminal procedure to respect the rights of victims, the development of anti-violence policies and curricula, and the training of emergency room and other medical personnel to recognize and intervene in cases of domestic violence and rape. POVâ€™s national Denim Day in LA & USA sexual violence prevention education campaign registered over 5 million participants in 2012, in all 50 states and in 117 foreign countries.
 
 
 
 
 
 In our four decades of service, survivors, volunteers and staff have identified the following consistent needs: culturally and linguistically appropriate crisis intervention services; long term therapeutic services for children exposed to and directly impacted by violence; effective primary prevention approaches that reduce risk and eliminate violence among youth and within families; and the need for comprehensive, no cost legal services to meet the unique needs of immigrant and youth survivors of domestic and sexual violence. 
 
 
 
 
 
 POV has responded to these needs through developing new, innovative programming integrating feedback and input from the target population. In 1987, we established our Deaf and Disabled Services program--the first in the nation to address deaf/disabled survivor needs--with representatives of the Deaf community who began a crisis hotline delivered via a TDD and in-person services delivered in ASL. In 1991, In Touch With Teens was conceived out of the understanding among youth that their dating relationships contained the same power/control dynamics as adult married couples; and youth acted as leaders in peer education, prevention and advocacy activities. In 2000, we established the Legal Advocacy Project, which provides free civil legal services to address survivors' family and immigration law matters. In 2008, we began to provide weekly violence prevention education groups and direct intervention services to former gang members through our ties with Homeboy Industries. In 2011, our advocacy efforts resulted in the Los Angeles Unified School District passing a Teen Dating Violence Prevention Policy for the entire school district.",,,2014184

 <blockquote>""My mom struggled to make ends meet. I had no sense of direction. I began using drugs and stealing to find happiness. I got caught and was referred to Bresee, where my perspective on life changed. I took anger management classes and met weekly with my counselor Rene who helped me to look at life differently. Bresee gave me this sense of accomplishment-something I had never felt before. One day Rene told me about a job opening at Bresee. I took the job and began working with first-time offenders, opening Bresee's first community service program. This was the first real job I had ever had. I worked part-time at Bresee, went to community college, and eventually transferred to UCLA. With the help of Bresee and their scholarship opportunity I graduated - something unimaginable during my younger days. Without Bresee's financial and emotional help I never would have gotten this far.""</blockquote></p>",,,2013154

Since its founding, PFLA has staged a series of provocative events in diverse locations in the city.
 
 
 
 
 
 Hungry Urbanism
 
 
 In this panel discussion series taking place over 4 months, PFLA engaged diverse thinkers to help look at the food system as an urban planning/design issue. The series of four discussions were staged at locations including Habeas Lounge and Southern California Institute of Architecture, the MAK Center in West Hollywood, and the Watts Labor Community Action Committee in Watts. The discussions tackled a range of topics including the role of local urban planning in the context of a global food system, a survey of urban food practices, the cultural conditions of health in South LA, and proposals for an urban farm in Watts.
 
 
 
 
 
 Fragrant Flavor Freeze
 
 
 Six local chefs were asked to create ice cream featuring a local, seasonal herb for a tasting event on Fatherâ€™s Day. Visitors were invited to sample, smell, touch, taste the herb and the ice cream on which it was based. The goal of the event was to celebrate flavor and local, seasonal ingredients. Participants were challenged to reconnect multiple senses to the experience of taste.
 
 
 
 
 
 Sage Table
 
 
 For an exhibition of creative family practices with Broodwork at Otis College of Art & Design, PFLA created the â€œSage Table.â€ This table was an apothecary of sorts, cataloguing 17 types of local sage in a unique table. The tabletop contained the sage varieties as well as a series of seeds for collection and home planting. Visitors were invited to sow the seeds with pots and organic soil that were provided. The table also housed a variety of reference materials and didactic information about the sage so common in California.
 
 
 
 
 
 Micheltorena Tree Planting
 
 
 With a grant from Closed on Mondays, PFLA was able to provide materials and labor for a tree planting at Micheltorena School in the Silverlake area of Los Angeles. As part of the schoolâ€™s community work day and the United States Green Building Councilâ€™s day of service, PFLA engaged a school mission to transform asphalt to permeable surface and fruit trees. A Guava Tree was planted in the playground, and has grown since we implemented the project.
 
 
 
 
 
 Mudtown Farms
 
 
 PFLA has been engaged with Mudtown Farm, an initiative of the Watts Labor Community Action Committee. We have been involved with a series of events for this project. With a successful Prop 84 grant of nearly $5 million, PFLA has staged tours, cross promoted and advocated for the realization of this project.
 
 
 
 
 
 In addition to these past events, the Potluck Truck is something we have discussed for quite a while. Currently, events are being planned around the conflict between indigenous Mexican farmers and the Monsanto Corporation as big agriculture attempts to take over the Mexican production of corn.",,,2013156

Since then, Prototypes has rapidly grown to be one of the leading behavioral health care providers of comprehensive treatment for vulnerable families with co-occurring disorders. Prototypes is also one of the largest social service organizations in the United States serving high-risk women and their children. Highlights of Prototypesâ€™ past achievements include:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>â€¢In 1989, Prototypes became one of the first agencies in the United States to offer AIDS prevention and outreach programs specifically targeted to women at risk. </p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>â€¢Prototypes opened STAR House in 1999 as a transitional domestic violence shelter for women and their children that provides comprehensive treatment at a confidential location. </p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>â€¢Through an innovative partnership with the LA County Criminal Courts, Probation, District Attorney, Public Defender and California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Prototypes begins providing services for the Womenâ€™s Second Chance Re-Entry Court program in 2007. </p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>â€¢In 2011, Prototypes began accepting most PPO and HMO insurance plans and developed affordable payment options for those who do not qualify for Prototypesâ€™ government-funded programs. This allowed us to serve even more individuals while also preparing for healthcare reform.</p> 
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>â€¢When Assembly Bill 109 became effective on October 1, 2011, Prototypes was notified that its Community Prisoner Mother Program would close. Through legislative action and advocacy, Prototypes was able to keep the program open after its scheduled close date on June 30, 2012. Today, Prototypes operates the only program in the State of California that allows mother to serve their sentence in residential treatment instead of prison. </p> 
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>â€¢Given its history and success, Prototypes has led other social service organizations in strategic advocacy efforts. In October 2012, Prototypes conveyed its First Annual Think Tank, bringing together experts in the field of treatment for women and children. With rapid changes in health care, it is imperative that organizations have a unified voice that helps shape further legislative action. The discussion and understanding that arose from the Think Tank is currently being developed as a white paper to disseminate throughout the State. </p>",,,2015161

The campaign focused on obtaining incentives for increased affordable housing, environmental justice, and good jobs. As a result of our efforts in providing lead legal and policy support, along with the efforts of other community partners, the plan is expected to be an effective tool for producing affordable housing in the area and for preventing displacement of existing residents. The plan is being touted as a model for transit planning throughout LA.
 
 
 
 
 
 Public Counsel won a preliminary injunction this year, preventing the State from taking $38 million in affordable housing funds from the LA County Housing Authority. Acting on behalf of the Southern California Association of Nonprofit Housing, we protected these funds that are designated for affordable housing for low-income seniors, people who are homeless, families, and transition-age youth within 15 miles of the City of Industry, which includes many areas around transit.
 
 
 
 
 
 Our staff attorneys led a team of lawyers in reaching an agreement, in 2011, with the developer of the Lorenzo project in South LA, in which the developer agreed to concessions worth $9.5 million. The Lorenzo project is the largest of its kind along the cityâ€™s planned Expo Line extension. The agreement delivered a wide range of community benefits, including 7,500 square feet, rent free, dedicated to community-based health care services, and 5% of the units built to be made affordable to people who earn less than 50% of the area median income.
 
 
 
 
 
 With Public Counselâ€™s leadership, the Alliance for Community Transit-Los Angeles engaged in a strategic planning process; finalized its vision, mission, and principles; solidified its membership base of 20 diverse organizations; strengthened its infrastructure; and developed the key parameters of a citywide equitable TOD campaign.
 
 
 
 
 
 Public Counsel represented the interests of low-income tenants whose affordable housing was at risk of being lost in Los Angelesâ€™ rapidly gentrifying coastal zone, which already had a limited supply of affordable housing. In 2011, we reached a historic settlement with HUD and the owners of the Holiday Venice apartment complex that provides for 20 years of affordability provisions and protects current tenants from being displaced. 
 
 
 
 
 
 We are engaged in a long-term campaign in the southeast cities (Bell, Bell Gardens, Cudahy, Huntington Park, Maywood, and South Gate) to increase familiesâ€™ access to child care and green space through changes to those citiesâ€™ general plans and zoning codes.

The academic arm of our Center has focused on: (1) researching how students, families and schools define and address challenges related to college going and (2) identifying effective strategies for improving college going outcomes. Our publications are widely used as guides by practitioners across the country. Yet just as significant, our Center has developed a three-pronged outreach approach where we work with schools and students to provide high quality college guidance and support; the three programs we run rank among the Centerâ€™s most important achievements to date. The first program we developed â€“ I AM (Increasing Access through Mentoring) provides targeted college guidance support to juniors and seniors in high school as they prepare to apply for college. Many of the students we work with will be the first in their families to attend college. Many also attend high schools with exorbitant counselor to student ratios. I AM mentors work with school based counselors to identify students who might slip through the cracks and then meet with students regularly to make sure the (very complicated) college application process goes smoothly. Once students are accepted to colleges, mentors help students figure out financial aid awards and provide students with support as they decide where to go. Weâ€™ve helped over 1,000 students get into college since starting the program in 2005. The SummerTIME (Tool Information Motivation Education) program focuses on college completion. We bring students who have graduated from LAUSD schools and who will be heading to four-year colleges/universities to USC for a month-long intensive writing program. The curriculum is infused with lessons on college knowledge such has how to balance finances, how to interact with professors and how to cultivate effective study skills. The third program provides a twist to traditional college outreach approaches. We decided to meet students where they choose to spend after-school hours â€“ in cyberspace! We partnered with USCâ€™s Game Innovation Lab and students from Foshay Learning Center to create a series of role-playing games about college and careers. Our games were developed and pilot tested in Los Angeles and are now utilized nationally. My LA2050 funding would enable us to expand these programs and train practitioners on how to make use of the game-based tools.",,,2013158

Ryman Arts executive director Diane Brigham and our staff have a strong commitment to the philosophical underpinnings of the initiative and gained unparalleled experience in both producing large scale public drawing events in complex collaborations, and coordinating the efforts of numerous and varied groups who produce their own BDLA events. Our organization has engaged over 65 organizations in The Big Draw LA, leading to over a hundred public drawing events. Approximately 8,000 members of the community have participated in The Big Draw LA flagship events, â€œMake Your Mark in the Parkâ€. The success of The Big Draw LA initiative mirrors the success of its presenter, Ryman Arts. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Recently named a National Program of Excellence by the Presidentâ€™s Committee on the Arts & Humanities, Ryman Arts harnesses the talent and promise of Southern California youth who would otherwise not have access to advanced art education to help these teens reach their high potential. Ryman Arts believes that through the arts, youth can learn essential skills for both creative expression and life. Ryman Arts fosters studentsâ€™ artistic development and personal confidence, and provides the knowledge and resources they need to pursue higher education and careers in the arts. Ryman Arts offers free intensive studio classes taught by master teaching artists, college and career planning, field trips, support services, and community engagement opportunities--all free of charge. Beginning with a single drawing class for 12 students in 1990, Ryman Arts has grown to 30 classes for 450 students annually, engaged 4,500+ Southern California teens in its core program, and provided outreach activities to 7,500+ inner city students. Classes are held on Sundays at the studios of Otis College of Art & Design in Los Angeles, and as of January 2013, we have expanded to offer classes on Saturdays at a second location on the campus of California State University, Fullerton in Orange County.
 
 
 
 
 
 At our recent College Day, 23 universities and art schools met with students and reviewed portfolios of their work. The Spring Career program includes a panel for students and their parents, a â€œPackaging Yourselfâ€ workshop, and behind the scenes tours at studios including Disney and DreamWorks Animation. Since 2005, the annual Ryman Arts student exhibition and graduation has been held at the California African-American Museum. We ensure broad access to the program with specialized outreach to underserved, low-income neighborhoods, including workshops at Title 1 high schools. There were over 225 applications for the Spring 2013 semesterâ€”the highest number of applications in years.",,,2016186

Our greatest achievement to date is the development of over 1,600 units of high-quality, sustainable, and affordable homes for the lowest income, formerly homeless, and disabled population. The Star Apartments, currently under construction, builds on our successes by pushing innovations in social service delivery, architectural design, and construction. The Star will be the home to 100 formerly homeless individuals. In addition to a full medical clinic on the ground floor, the Department of Health Services will be headquartered on-site. By implementing pre-fabricated modular housing, the project uses new construction methods for cost-savings and time-efficient construction. With the inclusion of over 15,000 SF of community building activity space, the Star will be the hub for social interaction between all the Trustâ€™s projects. The project will be the first of its kind for supportive housing in Los Angeles.
 
 
 <br/><br/>
 
 
 We believe that shelter alone is not enough to break the cycle of poverty; by providing intensive on-site social services along with therapeutic activities such as yoga, gardening and art classes, we have been able to see personal transformations within our resident community. We have successfully partnered with many financing institutions, public agencies, council members, service organizations, foundations, and other community stakeholders to develop our housing projects. 
 
 
 <br/><br/>
 
 
 In addition to service-rich environments, we have partnered with leading architects and designers, such as Michael Maltzan Architecture, Koning Eizenberg Architecture, and Killefer Flammang Architects, to bring high design and high-quality homes to our residents. Our projects push for design equity and bring design excellence to populations who need it most. Our work has won accolades from AIA/LA, Westside Urban Forum, SCANPH, CSH, and others and include an AIA/HUD Secretary Excellence in Affordable Housing Design Award. Our projects have been included in numerous publications including the NY Times, LA Times, Architectural Record, NPR, Atlantic Cities, the Wall Street Journal, Dwell Magazine, local news channels and beyond.",,,2014081

 <p>Economic Development: For nearly 20 years, SBCC's career training and placement programs have opened up access to living-wage employment for residents of low-income communities. Over the past 5 or more years, these programs have provided training and placement assistance to more than 150 individuals per year in employment sectors including energy, renewables, digital arts and media, film and video production, and K-12 teaching. Placement rates exceed 75%, and 24-month community college completion and transfer rates have been as high as 90% (as compared to statewide, 6-year rates of less than 30%).</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>SBCC has adapted this approach to youth entrepreneurship with our innovative Streetcraft LA project, which supports at-risk youth as they develop and market their own lines of apparel and accessories. Additional projects in community-based agriculture, food service, and neighborhood financial services are currently in development.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>Finally, SBCC has used our community organizing project's extensive reach into low-income, immigrant-dense communities to launch a highly successful Deferred Action initiative, placing young adults on the path toward legal residency and full participation in the legitimate economy.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>Healthy Childhood and Early Education: SBCC's Community Doula program mobilizes community advocates for women during pregnancy, birthing, and in the post-partum months. These doulas help new mothers navigate the medical system, form healthy attachments with their infants, promote good nutrition and breastfeeding, and engage from birth onwards in activities that support children's cognitive, social and emotional development. The program has proven effective at eliminating infant mortality, significantly increasing rates of breastfeeding, and significantly reducing numbers of low-weight births.</p>
 
 
 <p>Our Preschool Without Walls program works with families in these communities to address critical gaps in early learning and preschool resources. PWW brings early learning experiences to more than 500 parents and children in community institutions and locations that serve as learning and development resources. In homes and neighborhoods, parks, libraries, and community centers, the program engages parents and children in a shared early learning experience leading to improved child development and school readiness through supporting parents' role as their children's primary educators.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>In all of our work, our primary commitment is to develop community capacity to address education, economic development, and other issues in an ongoing way. Provision of high-quality direct services is necessary, but does not go far enough: what is needed is the growth of leadership and ownership within communities themselves to carry these initiatives forward on a self-sufficient, sustainable basis.</p>",,,2013168

The program has been meeting the many economic, physical, and societal needs of the community and successfully adjusting to changes in the area since 194.
 
 
 
 
 
 In the past few years, the program has also sought to increase linkages between different parts of society. Baldwin Park and surrounding cities have had some issues with having government, business, organizations, and the population working together such as with redevelopment issues. 
 
 
 
 
 
 An example is the start of the Cesar Chavez Interfaith Breakfast, which for the first time brought together community leaders, business owners, labor leaders, clergy from several denominations, public sector employees, and politicians together in a non-formal gathering. The event allows people to meet others while also hearing different perspectives, such as a rabbi who worked with Cesar Chavez to a local graduate who has become principal of one of the cityâ€™s high schools. Attendees leave with new contacts and possibilities.
 
 
 
 
 
 There has been great success in having community voices heard with more influence at city hall. After a fatal traffic accident, the program teamed with LA Voice and other congregations to seek a solution to an ongoing danger. This combined campaign led to a rapid decision by the city to install a new traffic light, which is now in service. The campaign prompted local officials to act far faster than normal.
 
 
 
 
 
 An ongoing success has been getting community members much more involved in local issues. An example is the cityâ€™s study of whether to retain the local police department or contract with the Los Angeles Sheriffâ€™s Department. Now, community members are attending hearings, giving their opinions and staying informed of events in the debate. In previous years this process would largely have been ignored by the public and not been influenced by their views. The local officials now know their decisions are being monitored. Creating public accountability is a major gain for this area.
 
 
 
 
 
 A significant achievement has been making connections to more effectively serve those in need, something that before was more provincial. The Social Services program has adjusted the annual Thanksgiving food drive to partner with the school district and their family liaison officers to identify people in need. This has led to a much better evaluation of the needs of the community and reduced fraud. Now, verified families in need have Thanksgiving food boxes delivered to their homes. This partnership is helping both parties ensure aid is effective to maximize results. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Social Services program has been developing greater and deeper linkages in the community to provide better delivery of resources. This project will take this process even further to yield wonderful dividends. The foundation of social connectedness has been established; now, the program looks to grow the structure.",,,2013171

 In addition, after participating in Step Up:
 
 
 â€¢ 80% of students felt comfortable speaking in public, as compared to 60% before

 Here are some stories of our girls that help bring these successes to life. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Kayla, Class of 2013: â€œStep Up has shaped who I am today. Iâ€™ve learned to speak my mind and become an independent woman and a leader. After graduation, I plan to go on to college and continue my journey, to try out all of the great things that the world has to offer me. I would definitely encourage other girls to join Step Up. Step Up is a family you build, and it will only make you stronger.â€
 
 
 
 
 
 Yosselin, Kenyan College Class of 2015: At 10 years old, Yosselin left El Salvador to join her mother in Los Angeles and a troublesome period of her life began. She was skipping a lot of school and got involved with a gang. She turned a corner her freshman year of high school when she joined Step Up. Through Step Up, she was able to imagine a better life for herself for the first time. â€œMy best moment with Step Up has been interviewing Jane Wurwand, founder of Dermalogica, and having been able to visit her office and see her in action, running her company. This is when I realized that school was very important and I had to get serious. In 9th grade, Step Up not only became my escape, it became my new family. It has been the influence of so many strong successful women that have kept me working hard. It has been the Step Up college tours, internships, and my Step Up mentors that have helped me envision the future I know now I am capable of achieving. Through Step Up, I discovered my passion for writing and my potential to thrive in college.â€
 
 
 
 
 
 Jaâ€™Nai, Gettysburg College Class of 2016 â€œBy participating in Step Up they taught me all about the business world and what I needed to do to be successful in it. In addition, it taught me exactly what my working style is and helped guide me in my search of what career I may want to pursue in the future by providing me with several exceptional mentors who are successful businesswoman. Through this program I was also able to obtain an internship at The JAR Group. I want to be a writer when I get older so my internship really helps me exercise my skills, since I spend most of my time finding content and sampling copies to go along with it. The Step Up program has given me the opportunity to have a voice.â€",,,2013172

SBCC is a long-standing non-profit organization that has been working to empower low-income communities in the greater Los Angeles area since 1976. SBCC has a long history of being one of those do-gooders that operates job-training programs to mitigate unemployment. The organizationâ€™s career pathway programs have been recognized by the United Way of Greater Los Angeles as a national best practice and were awarded a Everychild grant (one of the most competitive grants in LA) to apply its model to unemployed at risk youth. In addition, the organization founded the Urban Teacher Fellowship, an initiative that moves underrepresented groups into the teaching profession funded by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation; and The Promo Pathway, a career pathway funded by The James Irvine Foundation and recognized by The Aspen Institute as a national best practice. In doing this work, however, we came to believe that job training wasnâ€™t good enough. We needed to train entrepreneurs who can create their own jobs. So a team of us launched Streetcraft LA as a related, but autonomous social venture to train and incubate youth-led micro ventures. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Streetcraft is currently testing its core components and theory of change in a proof of concept pilot state funded the James Irvine Foundation. Guided by our board of directors, the focus of this planning stage was to test three assumptions critical to our model: marginalized youth engaged in graffiti culture or other illicit entrepreneur activities have talents that can be re-directed; a process of engagement can be created including partnerships with public systems and community based social networks; and youthâ€™s talents can be monetized and professionalized. Streetcraft has piloted its model with 50 Streetcraft fellows, referred through probation and other community-based networks, who went through a work based contextualized learning experience and developed products for a retail store located on main street, Santa Monica. During this pilot period 100% of participants completed the pilot and 85% percent increased their annual income by 50%.",,,2013174

Some exciting recent developments include: <BR>
 
 
 <BR>
 
 
 1) A recent report released by the Harvard Strategic Data Project found that Teach For America Los Angeles teachers and Career Ladder teachers (a pathway for LAUSD paraprofessionals such as teacherâ€™s aides) are more effective than other novice teachers within LAUSD at promoting student learning in math. The effect of having a TFA teacher corresponded to a month and half, or nearly 20 percent, of additional learning, compared to other teachers. <BR>
 
 
 <BR>
 
 
 2) This yearâ€™s Los Angeles corps represents diversity of background (two-thirds identify as people of color); diversity of experience (30 percent came from graduate school or professional backgrounds); and diversity of teacher placement (more than one-third teach math or science). <BR>
 
 
 <BR>
 
 
 3) As noted above, alumnus Tommy Chang (corps year â€™97) was appointed by Superintendent John Deasy to be one of five local superintendents in LAUSD. As superintendent of intensive support and innovation, Tommy oversees 130 schools and 130,000 students, including a majority of chronically failing schools in the district. He and his team work aggressively to transform outcomes for students across these schools. Other notable TFA alumni in the district include Drew Furedi (corps year â€™93) who is spearheading the new teacher evaluation pilot in his role as the executive director of talent management for LAUSD. Drewâ€™s team includes at least six other TFA alums. <BR>
 
 
 <BR>
 
 
 4) One hundred percent of Camino Nuevo schools K-12 principals are TFA alumni, as is the charter networkâ€™s chief executive officer, Ana Ponce (corps year â€™91). Ana was also named one of the Worldâ€™s Seven Most Powerful Educators in Forbes magazine this year. <BR>
 
 
 <BR>
 
 
 5) In the KIPP LA network, six out of seven schools currently operating are run by TFA alumni. Alumna Angella Martinez (corps year â€™01) led KIPP LA Prep to become the top-performing middle school in LAUSD and now supports all KIPP schools in Los Angeles as their chief academic officer. Other alumni continue to increase their leadership presence in charter organizations like the Alliance College-Ready Public Schools, PUC, and Inner City Education Foundation (ICEF), as site principals, assistant principals, and school-based instructional leaders. Alumna Allison Bajracharya (corps year â€™00) supports all charter partners as vice president of regional advocacy at the California Charter Schools Association. <BR>
 
 
 <BR>
 
 
 With the striking evidence of what our corps members and alumni are capable of we can only imagine what our leaders will accomplish toward our goal of educational equity over the coming decades.",,,2016209

Our results speak for themselves: Of our most recent class, 94% have graduated from high school, and 96% of those are in college. This more than doubles the average graduation rates that typically characterize these depressed areas. Program-wide, 97% percent of Dreamers report that IHADLA is like a â€œsecond familyâ€ to them and Ninety-eight percent of Dreamers feel that their mentor will be there for them â€œno matter whatâ€ and can trust them with their problems.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>Additionally, in 2011, IHADLA received the FBI Directorâ€™s Community Leadership Award for outstanding service to the community. Only one organization nationally is honored each year. We were thereafter able to forge a partnership with the FBI, and were able to match many of our Dreamers with FBI mentors. </p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>Each of our current classes has achievements from this year which exemplify the success of our program overall:
 
 
 
 
 
 In 2002, IHADLA adopted an entire grade level of almost 150 first grade students from Murchison Elementary School. Almost all of these students lived in the Ramona Gardens Projects in East LA, and many still do. These Dreamers are now on the eve of their high school graduation. Eighty-three percent of our graduating Dreamers from this class will be attending college, and that number will grow next year when our second year seniors graduate as well. Colleges that Dreamers will be attending include: UC Irvine, UC Santa Barbara, UC San Diego, USC, UCLA, Stanford University, Ithaca University, a host of Cal States throughout California, and many, many more. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Adopted back to back in 2006 and 2007, IHADLA has two grades of Dreamers in Inglewood. This year, we are proud to report that these middle-school Dreamers are performing better than their peers on the California English Language Development Test. Seventy-one percent of Dreamers were rated as â€œearly advancedâ€ or â€œadvancedâ€, compared with only 39% of their peers. These Dreamers continue to flourish academically, with 66% improving their grade point averages this year overall. Despite turbulence within the Inglewood school district, the majority of our Dreamers have above a 3.0 GPA, and many of those below are Dreamers in our special education program.
 
 
 
 
 
 Our newest group of third grade Dreamers have not only melted our hearts, but inspired our organization as a whole. These children come from extraordinary circumstances, including domestic violence, familial gang membership, and unbelievable scenarios of poverty. Despite it all, these children are well on their way to becoming the future leaders of our society. Over the course of IHADLAâ€™s first six months of programming, these Dreamers went from 32% only passing their quarterly assessments to 62% at advanced/proficient level.</p>",,,2013182

Without intervention, individuals caught in the cycle of abuse may be at risk for death, disability, injury, and involvement with the criminal justice system.

 <p>All of Relationships 101 was very interesting, but my favorite part was acting out the different situations, they put everyday life into a perspective, and showed where you can make clear choices, you can chose NOT to argue and make things worse, by using I messages, saying how you feel, I feel this, and I feel that or I donâ€™t like that, that makes me feel bad â€¦.that really helped !!!</p>

 <p>I feel like I can handle certain situations in my relationships better than I did before. I feel better knowing that it isnâ€™t bad to stand up for yourself or do what you think is right, even if it is going against your boyfriend or girlfriend. Communication is key to a healthy relationship, we are all worthy of a healthy relationship! </p>
 
 
 Student - Verbum Dei High School</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>I learned in relationships 101 that anything that happens to us in the real world looks better when we act it out. This program, helped me with a lot of frustrations. I learned to collaborate, be respectful, responsible, and ready. I am so happy I had the opportunity to realize that you need to think twice about what we really go through and how to work things out with every human being in the world. I learned how to accept things that I canâ€™t change and to change the things I can. </p>

We are the only organization in Los Angeles that focuses exclusively on environmental education for young children during their most impressionable years: birth through age 8. CNI works with more than 100 schools, early-education centers and social service agencies to serve 15,000 children each year. We focus on reaching children in underserved communities to share with them the wonder of nature as a tool for academic achievement, personal growth, and community building.
 
 
 CNI was founded in 1985 by three mothers who were anxious to find ways to teach young children about nature outside of the classroom. We have been at the forefront of the movement to connect children with nature ever since. The organization was run by a core group of volunteers that led young families on walks at area parks and beaches. After the Los Angeles riots in 1992, motivated by the call for equity, justice and inclusion, CNI launched the outreach Nature Discovery Program to give children from low-income neighborhoods and academically low-ranking schools of Los Angeles the opportunity to learn science, math and reading skills through experiences with the natural world. In 2000, CNI added a traveling classroom called the WonderMobile to the program (a visit that includes live animals and various natural artifacts).
 
 
  In 2010, CNI became the ""environmental arm"" of the Magnolia Place Family Center. As part of the groundbreaking Magnolia Community Initiative, CNI actively collaborates within a network of more than 70 service providers to improve the quality of life, including educational outcomes, for the 100,000 people living within a 500-block radius of the Center. CNI offers a wide range of hands-on activities for families living in West Adams, Pico-Union, and the North Figueroa Corridor. These communities represent some of Los Angeles County's most challenged neighborhoods with historically low educational access and a high rate of families living at or below the federal poverty level. We have served more than 350,000 children, their parents, and teachers in the greater Los Angeles area since we started, and show no signs of slowing down. 
 
 
 Joining MCI gave CNI the latitude and capability to embark on the leadership role for ExN:LA, a collaboration modeled on MCI and focused on bringing continuous, high-quality environmental education to schools throughout Los Angeles. Now in its second year, ExN:LA has grown to include the entire 2nd and 3rd grades at 2 schools, 6 partner organizations and the MCI network of collaborators and community. ExN:LA is part of national Education by Nature umbrella with iterations throughout California, Hawaii and Massachusetts, each of which is designed to meet the specific needs of its community, and to share best practices and ideas with each other",,,2013184

 <p>Everybody dance! is the largest dance program in Los Angeles providing sequential, long-term dance training to inner-city children. Our programâ€™s achievements have been highlighted in the Los Angeles Times, Dance Magazine, People Magazine, Biography Magazine, California Lawyer Magazine, Family Circle Magazine and on multiple television and radio stations. Our faculty of professional dancers has been described by the Los Angeles Times as ""some of the best children's dance instructors in the world.â€</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 The dance program has opened doors for our students, enabling them to win prestigious awards and scholarships to acclaimed dance schools and academic institutions, including Juilliard, Rock School of Ballet, Kirov Academy of Ballet and summer programs at American Ballet Theater, San Francisco Ballet, and Bolshoi Ballet. Some of our alumni are now using their training to become professional dancers with companies such as the Los Angeles Ballet, Vox Dance Theatre and Complexions Contemporary Ballet in NYC. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Gabriella Charter School was honored at the 19th Annual California Charter Schools Conference in 2012 with the Hart Vision Award for Charter School of the Year as an innovator and leader among charter schools statewide. GCS received the Music Centerâ€™s 2011 BRAVO Program Award, which honors educators and schools for their commitment to delivering exemplary arts education in both visual and performing arts. Our faculty and staff are frequently invited to give presentations at universities, arts institutions and national conferences, such as the Colburn School of Performing Arts, UCLA, the Delta Kappa Gamma XI Education Conference (an educational honor society for school leaders and teachers), the California Charter School Summit and the National Dance Education Organizationâ€™s Annual Conference. 
 
 
 
 
 
 We believe our dance program is directly responsible for our schoolâ€™s academic success as well: In 2010, the California Department of Education (â€œCDEâ€) awarded Gabriella Charter School the Title I Academic Achievement Award, recognizing significant academic achievement by disadvantaged students who had doubled the academic targets set for them by the CDE for two consecutive years. GCS also received six-year accreditation (the highest possible) from the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, which sited GCS as a â€œmodel school for any number of schools wishing to get high academics in a predominantly low-income and underserved community.â€ (WASC Self Study Visiting Committee Report, April 2010.)",,,2014201

We were accused of perpetuating homelessness, encouraging criminal behavior, despoiling the neighborhood, and destroying property values -- all this for serving hungry people something to eat once a day -- and we were effectively run out of town and into Hollywood, suddenly an orphan group of volunteers but with a reputation in the media for having fought city hall and survived. From that point forward we have only gotten braver, because little by little we came to know that there were a lot of people like us in the community who wanted to do something ""good"" but didn't know where to begin. We have since fought any number of running battles just to keep going -- against neighbors and neighbors' groups, against politicians and other ""social service agencies,"" and, just two years ago against a company which sued us for creating ""a public and a private nuisance."" When that happened we were defended pro bono for eight months by a partner and four associates of one of the largest law firms in town, and at the end of it the judge in the case threw it out with prejuidice. We are now stronger and more effective than we have ever been, and we continue to grow stronger still. We serve an ever-better meal, to between 150 and 200 people every night. We have two or three new volunteers coming to us every day, and our ability to network in the community at large is nothing short of extraordinary. As far as we know, no other ragtag grass-roots organization formed to help the homeless has lasted as long as we have and attracted so much support.

Our long-term arts programs reach communities and students who otherwise lack access to the arts, proven to be one of the most effective ways to engage teenagers in their education and community. Our professional artists teach real-world skills needed in todayâ€™s creative economy, and impart a sense of confidence and purpose that leads to graduating from high school with a plan for the future. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Highlights of our recent achievements include:
 
 
 
 
 
 Responding to an increasingly urgent need to address the high school dropout crisis, The HeArt Project partnered with the LA County Office of Education to open the Hollywood Media Arts Academy (HMAA), an alternative arts high school for students at high risk of dropping out. The Academy celebrated its 2nd anniversary in August 2012.
 
 
  
 
 
 An important measure of the success is how many students advance from Level 1 to Level 2 and participate and complete HPâ€™s advanced levels. In the past two years, HP has had its largest cohorts ever participate in these advanced levels, and this year, for the first time, all Level 2 arts residency students applied for Level 3 summer arts scholarships. 
 
 
 
 
 
 As students advance up HPâ€™s program, they continue to realize more successes in the larger community. Since July 2012, HP students have:
 
 
 Enrolled in West LA Collegeâ€™s Communications, Entertainment, and Media Arts Division in a partnership program with Hollywood CPR, an entertainment industry training program. 
 
 
 Performed at REDCAT with the CalArts CAP Program
 
 
 Attended Earthwatch Instituteâ€™s Los Angeles Student Fellowship Program on scholarship and studied the Diamondback Terrapin turtle in New Jersey. It was this teenagerâ€™s first time on an airplane.
 
 
 Our first student was accepted into the Ryman Arts Program, a rigorous and highly selective classical arts training program for teens. 
 
 
 Been accepted into the Mark Taper Forumâ€™s Young Ambassadors program
 
 
 
 
 
 Scholarships have traditionally taken place in the summers, but this past fall, HP has an unprecedented 8 students participating in advanced programs - 6 at Art Centerâ€™s Saturday High and their college-level program Art Center at Night; one at the Taper, one in Ryman Arts.",,,2013188

Our inaugural class of 20 high school juniors, one high school intern, two college interns, and seven high school teachers has met in a summer intensive Los Angeles history and culture seminar at The Huntington Library, and we've met one Saturday a month since then. Each Saturday session is focused on a different ""node"" of regional infrastructure. The day usually begins with a speaker and discussion, and then the LASA group goes into the field and to various sites which fit that day's themes. Our investigation of water started with a history overview of regional water development -- with rare documents -- and we then went to the dispersal facility for Colorado River water coming into the Metropolitan Water District system. Our business investigation took us to a private aerospace manufacturing facility, in business for 57 years, in Glendale, and a tour with that company's chief technologist. We ended that day with a discussion with Idealab executives and entrepreneurs. Our law enforcement day featured a morning with Connie Rice of the Advancement Project (we all read her book on the LAPD), and an afternoon tour with LAPD leaders of the new station and the regional 911 call center; we ended the day with a tour of SWAT team equipment and vehicles. For our investigation of regional transit and transit history, we began our day with seminars by experts from The Getty and the Automobile Club of Southern California on the history of automobiles, freeways, and railroads in the region. Following an on-foot journey from LAPL to Union Station, we met with the lead architectural design team tasked with re-imagining Union Station in the urban fabric of downtown (a stop at the Bradbury Building completed that day). A more recent investigation of the entertainment landscape of Los Angeles took us to AEG's Staples Center, the GRAMMY Museum, the Disney Concert Hall, and an end-of-the-day Bunker Hill discussion with the architecture critic of the Los Angeles Times. </p>

Kitchen is brand new. Many of its core ideas have been proven successful â€“ though, never quite in this dynamic combination. L.A. Kitchen is the latest venture of Robert Egger, the author of the award winning book â€œBegging for Change, The Dollars and Sense of Making Nonprofits Responsive, Efficient and Rewarding for Allâ€ and the pioneering creator of D.C. Central Kitchen, The Campus Kitchens Project, and CForward.
 
 
 
 
 
 D.C. Central Kitchen, founded in Washington, D.C. in 1989, is now a thriving $11 million nonprofit with a $6 million social enterprise portfolio. Egger created DCCK to turn leftover food into balanced meals in a â€˜central kitchenâ€™ that could in turn deliver them to 100 other nonprofits that were spending too much for substandard meals. There, he launched a culinary training program that brought in some of the cityâ€™s toughest cases â€“ men and women written off as hopeless, helpless, or both â€“ and prepared them for lasting careers. Since 2008, DCCKâ€™s 370 culinary graduates have averaged a job placement rate of 90%, despite the weak economy, and are 96% less likely to return to prison than ex-offenders nationwide. Eggerâ€™s results inspire 14,000 individuals to contribute their time and effort as volunteers to DC Central Kitchen each year.
 
 
 
 
 
 Egger launched The Campus Kitchens Project in 2001, because he saw a generation of young people dedicated to community service, but few nonprofits capable of maximizing their tremendous potential. Today, there are 34 CKP sites in 20 states across America, led by 5,000 tireless student volunteers who turned idle college and high school dining halls and cafeteria leftovers into new tools in the fight against hunger. In addition to preparing meals, CKP is preparing a new generation of community leaders. In 2012, 45% of CKPâ€™s student volunteers reported that their experiences had changed their entire career path, opening their eyes to new needs and new opportunities. 
 
 
 
 
 
 His work in Washington earned him numerous accolades and awards, including being named an Oprah Angel, the James Beard Humanitarian of the Year and a Washingtonian of the Year.
 
 
 
 
 
 In 2006, Egger Co-Convened the first Nonprofit Congress, and in 2011, he launched CForward, Americaâ€™s first Political Action Committee for nonprofits. Nonprofits comprise 10% of the US economy and 10% of the American workforce, but they speak with no common voice in our electoral process. In 2012, CForward made history by endorsing 8 candidates, representing both major parties, who had strong, clear plans for strengthening nonprofits and their role in solving key problems. Most won. This work also earned him a spot on the â€œTop 50 Most Influential Nonprofit leadersâ€ four years in a row.
 
 
 
 
 
 Now, Eggerâ€™s energy, experience, and entrepreneurial spirit are here in the region where he grew up in the 1960â€™s and 70â€™s, with an added focus on fighting the needless waste of fresh produce and strengthening our senior citizens. Itâ€™s time for change.",,,2013190

With very little funding, The Learning Garden has demonstrated the true meaning of sustainability through community spirit and volunteerism. Over 250 high school students a year are trained in organic horticulture, and many have pursued careers in horticulture related fields. In our Seed to Sale program, students learn the process from planting to harvesting to selling at the local Farmers Market. Our art students regularly use the garden to draw and paint. The science classes are out in the compost piles learning the nitrogen and phosphorus cycles.
 
 
 We have inspired and supported gardens at many of our feeder schools so that garden curriculum is developing from Kindergarten thru High School. 
 
 
 The Learning Garden has one of the most extensive Chinese Medicinal gardens in the country and our local Traditional Chinese Medicine schools are trained from seed to harvest to medicinal use at our garden by world experts. Our Native Californian and Succulent gardens are works of beauty and an example for homeowner to strive for in water wise gardening. This year, our Natural Arts Garden is in the process of being installed and will be home for classes in weaving, dying, painting, all with natural fibers and dyes. Upcoming plans include simple designs for water catchment and water gardens as demonstration for homeowners to emulate. We offer classes through UCLA extension and the UC Davis Master Garden programs, as well as our own Victory Garden classes and regular gardening, tai chi, chi gong and cooking classes. The Learning Garden works with organizations such as Occupy Venice and Sivananda Yoga to make sure that all extra food goes to those in need. 
 
 
 Our community events, including the Spring Equinox Celebration, the July 4th Ice Cream Social (with ice cream made from the garden), Pesto Day (our garlic and basil whipped into a heavenly meal) and our Winter Solstice all bring together our community in celebration.

 ARTS MATTER: is an unprecedented campaign to revitalize arts education in the nationâ€™s second largest school district. The campaign has been developed to drive public awareness for the critical role of arts education in public schools. By bringing together leading contemporary artists, including Barbara Kruger and John Baldessari, as well as Los Angeles entertainment, civic, and education leaders, Arts Matter is focused on rebuilding arts education in the creative capital of the world. The Los Angeles Fund for Public Education was inspired to spearhead this initiative to address the creativity crisis existing in Los Angeles public schools. Today, only 2% of all instructional time is devoted to the arts in L.A. elementary schools. The purpose of Arts Matter is to develop a system that integrates arts instruction with traditional core subjects to dramatically increase creative thinking and learning for all students. All proceeds raised throughout Arts Matter will directly support an innovative R&D fund to develop arts integration programs in L.A. public schools. In addition to the successful awareness campaign, the fund raised over $850,000 to fund multi-year arts integration programs.
 
 
 
 
 
  ANTI-BULLYING CAMPAIGN
 
 
 Bullying is a pervasive problem in our schools with 71 percent of students report bullying as an on-going problem. Studies have linked bullying with anxiety, depression, and lower academic achievement. We realized that in order to create a safe school environment where every student feels free to pursue their dreams without the fear of harassment or intimidation, students must take personal responsibility and show courage to stop bullying when they see it. When individual students stand up to bullying, they can ignite a cultural change school-wide. Together with LAUSD, the LA Fund brought together close to 7,000 students from 49 different schools to the Nokia Theatre for a screening of the documentary â€œBullyâ€ followed by a townhall discussion. The largest gathering of youth against bullying in California, the students that attended were given the inspiration to be the change agents to combat bullying on their campuses. The LA Fund will be providing anti-bullying grants to further support schools in their cultural transformation.
 
 
 
 
 
 BLENDED LEARNING: We have established three different exemplar â€œblended learningâ€ programs that integrate online curriculum with traditional teacher-led classroom instruction. Our programs are pilots to create new instructional models to support LAUSD in its bold initiative to cross the digital divide for every student through the use of tablet computers. Each program leverages technology as part of a rotation model where students circulate between classroom instruction, online learn",,,2013193

Members of the council have given their time and resources freely and willingly to ensure the success of LAMCII. To date, we have expended 2,000+ hours of research, extracted 4,000+ pages of reports and engaged over 75 people and organizations not previously involved in the council. Council members, who already have significant commitments and responsibilities, have spent 300+ hours in committee meetings in 2012 and many more hours working independently towards Council goals.
 
 
 
 
 
 -LAMCII has developed two engaging and robust websites â€“ lamcii.org and edge.la. Both sites are quickly becoming hubs for information directed to those who want to understand how the future of LA is being navigated. The purpose of our websites is to be the gateway or aggregator of information about Los Angeles - involving the innovation and tech community, events and activities, real estate opportunities and contact lists. These sites act as an uber-connector for anyone wanting to become involved in this community. They help others realize the potential of the city and its members. 
 
 
 
 
 
 -As described above, the following initiatives are scoped and underway for 2013:
 
 
 
 
 
 -Texpo Innovation Hubs
 
 
 -EdgeLA Fellowship Program
 
 
 -The EdgeLA Awards
 
 
 
 
 
 Beyond those three major initiatives, the Council has identified the following action items for scoping and next steps in 2013:
 
 
 -Better publicize LA-based capital sources
 
 
 -Attract Tier-1 capital sources to Los Angeles
 
 
 -Support existing LA-based venture capital
 
 
 -Cultivate and expand the angel community
 
 
 -Improve access to city/county information
 
 
 -Encourage mayor to more closely align and promote LAâ€™s innovation economy
 
 
 -Build an entrepreneurial ambassador program with City Hall
 
 
 
 
 
 -Upon completion of the first year of the council LAMCII produced The Leading Edge Report â€“ a 44 page report outlining the councilâ€™s motives, initiatives and vision. 
 
 
 The report is available here: http://lamcii.org/resources.html
 
 
 
 
 
 -LAMCII has captured the interest of both the leaders within the city and the media who have followed the journey and endorsed the vision. Key publications and media outlets include: NBC, Los Angeles Times,LA Business Journal,Yahoo!,Wall Street Journal

Also since Tia Chucha's creation we've seen the birth of independent groups like El Hormiguero (the Anthill), Bikesanos Bike Club, the San Fernando Arts Collective, Youth Speak Collective's Sports, Mural, Gardening and Digital Arts projects, and the establishment of a new high school with academies in Social Justice and Humanities, the Arts as well as Engineering and Technology called the Cesar Chavez Learning Academies.

Use of the land will instead be directed by â€“ and forever controlled by â€“ low-income community residents, to meet the needs of their families and neighbors. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Important achievements include:
 
 
 Maintained a formal, voting Membership of grassroots community residents to hold ultimate authority over organizational assets and decisions, and to elect a grassroots Board of Directors.
 
 
 
 
 
 With partners, raised $5 million in equity from private and public sources for land acquisition.
 
 
 
 
 
 With the City of LA, secured: $1 million for pedestrian improvements, in a high-traffic near an elementary school; and $5 million for development of a 4 acre park in LAâ€™s most park-poor Council District.
 
 
  
 
 
 Led the Housing Working Group of United Neighbors in Defense Against Displacement (UNIDAD) Coalition Housing Working Group during the Lorenzo community benefits agreement and USC Specific Plan campaigns, which resulted in over $20 million in funding for affordable housing, 4000 new beds of student housing, and a tenantsâ€™ rights legal clinic at USC.
 
 
 
 
 
 With the City and non-profit developer Abode Communities, advanced plans to develop the 7 acre Slauson&Wall Brownfields site with a 4 acre park, community center, and 120 affordable homes â€“ all designed by the community.
 
 
 
 
 
 Established a vibrant Slauson&Wall Neighborâ€™s Organizing Committee to move forward all planning, community engagement and campaign work related to this transformative project.
 
 
 
 
 
 Used Theatre of the Oppressed as a community education and advocacy tool, including utilizing street theatre to explain dynamics of gentrification around light rail.
 
 
 
 
 
 Organized a tenant-led campaign that resulted in the ownersâ€™ agreement to sell the 48 unit, 2 acre Rolland Curtis Gardens property adjacent to USC and the Expo line, rather than displacing families to convert to student housing; and conducted a participatory planning process to rebuild as a key Transit Oriented Development with affordable housing for 140 families, bike and care share programs, and community-serving commercial uses.
 
 
 
 
 
 Brought CicLAvia to South LA, opening up the streets for thousands of people to use as recreation space, for walking, biking, running, skating, and simply hanging out â€“ as a step in TRUST South LAâ€™s growing mobility work which seeks to better utilize public land to serve local families.

The Labor Center has conducted research on immigrant youth, actively promoted their civic engagement, taught the first courses in the country on undocumented students, and published two nationally acclaimed books written by and about undocumented students. The first, Underground Undergrads: UCLA Undocumented Immigrant Students Speak Out is currently in its fourth printing and has sold more than ten thousand copies. The second, Undocumented and Unafraid: Tam Tran, Cinthya Felix, and the Immigrant Youth Movement, is being promoted as part of a national book tour during the 2012â€“2013 academic school year. To drive activities in this area, the Labor Center established the Dream Resource Center, a project to promote equal access to education by developing educational resources, support, and leadership development for immigrant students across the country. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Labor Center engages in other activities to address the needs of undocumented immigrant youth, including hosting Dream Summer, the first national internship program for undocumented students. This program has placed 250 students and awarded a total of $1.25 million for interns to continue their education. Through Dream Summer, interns learn skills and build the capacity of host organizations focused on specific issues or campaigns such as health and health care access, civic engagement, education, youth leadership, and LGBTQ issues. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Both Dream Summer and the Undocumented and Unafraid book publication and tour have been models for developing online resources that have connected with thousands of undocumented immigrant students throughout the country who are in need of basic information. These activities are just two among several at the Dream Resource Center that have served to create an online and in-person support network to give undocumented students the encouragement they need to pursue their dreams.",,,2013202

In our model, solutions to a problem are developed by those most affected. It places the community first and at the center of our work. We take a bottom up approach. We start with the communityâ€™s understanding of their problems and engage the community in addressing these issues. We organize block by block, neighborhood by neighborhood and bring this network together. We do this through reflection, action, analysis and start again with each phase bringing new information. Through this process community members learn to negotiate and prioritize their demands amongst themselves. Our organizing campaigns as identified by our community members include the following: preservation of healthy affordable housing; the right to clean water; the right to clean air; and the right to safe and healthy neighborhoods. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Bienestar committees success in transforming their alley clearly demonstrated the potential for creating healthy alleys through the do-it-yourself community action our long organizing history makes possible. In addition to this we have the following accomplishments:
 
 
 
 
 
 EJ and Neighborhood Health and Safety
 
 
 o Neighborhood base improvements, Installed physical improvements to transform the use of 5 alleys in Boyle Heights and identified 6 more to begin transformation this year
 
 
 o Negotiated to reduce costly police engagement in neighborhood activity in our community
 
 
 o Reduced violence and fear on Fickett St without criminalization or police intervention through neighborhood occupation
 
 
 o Worked with Environmental Justice Coalition for Water and Assemblyman John Perez to pass a state law allowing for the City of Maywood to have more regulatory powers over the water companies
 
 
 o Gained support from Assemblyman Rendon to develop a policy to create a public water district in Maywood
 
 
 o Organized and won two new parks in the City of Maywood; 
 
 
 o Passed a law in the City of Maywood that allows street vendors to obtain vending permits; 
 
 
 o Reprioritized how the City of LA distributed resources for basic services;
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Housing
 
 
 o Trained and developed tenants to understand RSO Regulations and the cityâ€™s inspection processes.
 
 
 o Identified and worked with 188 tenants during their inspection processes in the last year
 
 
 o With LACAN, formed an LA Citywide multi-cultural coalition that puts homeless, tenants, and public housing residents voices at the front of the struggle to expand rent control rights and protect public housing.
 
 
 o Successful in swearing in one of our members as a Housing Authority of City of LA Board of Commissioner (HACLA);
 
 
 o Stopped HACLAâ€™s elimination of public housing for a 3 year period;
 
 
 o Passed 2 advisory measures in Maywood protecting families from the demolition of their homes;

Given our strong homeless partners, instead of administering homeless services, we focused on improving the homeless systems that hamper the work of our partners. We have seen tremendous results in our work together over these past two years:
 
 
 
 
 
 â€¢ Leadership: Over 125 leaders from a broad cross-section of nonprofit, public, and philanthropic organizations, including the Mayor of LA and all 5 of our County Supervisors, signed onto the Home For Good plan.
 
 
 
 
 
 â€¢ Funding: $5 million from 16 private funders was leveraged to secure $100 million from 7 public funders, creating the first ever Funders Collaborative for permanent supportive housing in LA County.
 
 
 
 
 
 â€¢ Awareness: Over 20,000 volunteers have participated in HomeWalk, an annual 5k to end homelessness.
 
 
 
 
 
 â€¢ Systems Change: The time it takes for a homeless veteran to move from the street into a home was reduced by 2 months.
 
 
 
 
 
 â€¢ Housing: Well over 5,000 chronically homeless persons as well as an additional 2,000 homeless veterans were permanently housed.
 
 
 
 
 
 We are also proud to work with the Rapid Results Institute (RRI) and their 100-day model. RRI uses a model that challenges communities to quickly and collaboratively design complex systems and create lasting systems change within 100 days.
 
 
 
 
 
 RRI has worked globally to use the catalysts of network support, a time-limited process, clear goals and the expertise of line staff to engineer remarkable results. Those successes (all in 100 days) include:
 
 
 
 
 
 â€¢ Reducing the days required for placing housing homeless vets in Detroit from 143 days to 34 days (76% decrease) in collaboration with the 100k Homes Campaign
 
 
 
 
 
 â€¢ Reducing operating costs for CALPERS (CA public pension) by $99.6 million (annualized) 
 
 
 
 
 
 â€¢ Getting 15,400 people in Sierra Leone tested for HIV in 100 days, compared to 1,000 in the previous 3 years

 In 2002, LAUSD high school student Glenda Garcia joined WriteGirl, not knowing what to expect. During her four years in the program, she attended monthly workshops, worked with several mentors, attended college readiness sessions, read her creative writing at public readings and had her work published in several of WriteGirlâ€™s award-winning anthologies. In her senior year, WriteGirl nominated her for a Posse Scholarship. She won, and attended Dickinson College on a full ride. Upon college graduation, Glenda was awarded a prestigious Fulbright Scholarship. Weâ€™re very excited to say that she is taking a year to work with us at WriteGirl as our Membership Coordinator. Where will Glenda be in 2050? We are confident that she will be a key contributor to the success of any community in which she resides..<p>Here are a few more alumnae success stories:Emily is on her way to Harvard University, where she received a full scholarship.</p><p>Lovely has a summer fellowship in nuclear policy at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory and will spend next year researching in China.</p><p>Jamilah, a junior at Dartmouth, spent the last semester doing community outreach work in Los Angeles and will travel to China in the fall to conduct research for her senior thesis.</p>Our success has been recognized:

In 2011 and 2012, YI led a coalition of over 50 national and local partners around our â€œGetting Coveredâ€ health care education campaign that provided information to millions of young adults on and off-line about how to get covered up to age 26 under the new law. As part of this campaign, YI released and distributed online a health care education toolkit to educate young people on the importance of health coverage, timed around Valentineâ€™s Day, with a reach of over 1.5 million young adults. Already, over 3.1 million uninsured young adults have taken advantage of the dependent coverage provision and gained affordable insurance, far exceeding expectations. In fact, young adults are the only demographic to see uninsurance rates decline during the Recession.
 
 
 
 
 
 YI has also established expertise on coverage issues for young adults. YI successfully advocated for major improvements to student health plans following the ACA, changes that have helped over 3 million students on college plans see more comprehensive, better coverage. Similarly, YI has worked with the White House and congressional leadership to get national coverage of YI members benefiting from reform, and released the first comprehensive national report and poll on the economic and health challenges facing young adults since the Recession. YI has established itself as the go-to media source for information on young adults and health care, appearing in the LA Times, San Francisco Chronicle, NY Times, Wall Street Journal, NPR, MSNBC, Fox News, and CNN, among other outlets.
 
 
 
 
 
 Last March, YI launched our National Youth Bus Tour. YI staff visited 43 cities in 20 different states, including 43 campuses and hosted over 100 youth events and roundtables designed to hear the perspective of diverse young adults on the economic, educational and health challenges they face. At our events, we provided state-specific materials on health care needs of young adults and options for coverage. The tour was covered widely, including this feature in the New York Times. The tour expanded our youth networks across the country, and particularly in California.
 
 
 
 
 
 In LA, YIâ€™s mobile app won LA Social Innovation Fast Pitchâ€™s grand prize of $15,000. Tamika Butler, California Director, pitched at the competition and described plans to expand mobile app in low-income LA communities.

Along with other mentors, Jason was able to give Wonder the mentoring relationship that Jason had received from caring mentors who changed Jason's life. Wonder is now on a healthy path and thriving. In fact, Wonder received an award for Male Athlete of the Year at his school. 
 
 
 Wonder is responsible for the birth of Young Warriors. During Wonder's success, Jason decided to give other boys broader horizons. YW started with a small group of boys, their single moms, and a circle of friends. The program was extremely successful, and quickly grew to over 20 boys, with moms calling from as far as two hours away, asking to come Young Warrior events. YW participants are committed; they enjoy being in the program and attendance rates are over 96%. Adults in these children's lives have noticed almost an immediate change in the boy's attitudes and behaviors. In addition, grades are showing improvement.
 
 
 YW has expanded its program throughout the community. YW community members (such as Galpin Ford, Nestle, Wells Fargo, the city of Van Nuys, and many private investors) are excited to participate in the program. YW now has two programs: (1) the original YW group, and (2) two elementary schools consisting of 24 fatherless 5th grade boys. Other principals heard of YW and are expressing a strong interest in hosting the YW program at their schools. In addition, Jason has peaked the interest of various gang-prevention units.

YPI created the first national anti-poverty program based on a community action approach, in which local organizations could operate federally funded program with community input. YPI continues that work in Los Angeles and now serves over 100,000 Angelenos each year at 125 sites throughout the city with education, technology, and training programs. YPI is a recipient of U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer's Excellence in Education Award, and has also been recognized by Cisco's Growing with Technology Award, as a National Council of La Raza Affiliate of the Year. YPI has been honored as an international ComputerWorld Honors Laureate for our 80 Public Computer Centers serving families with broadband services and access throughout the city. YPI's Hollywood FamilySource Center received a 2012 California Award for Performance Excellence by the California Council for Excellence.
 
 
 
 
 
 While we are proud of these achievements, YPI is most proud of the direct impact our agency has in the lives of low-income youth and adults in Los Angeles. Our staff of over 800, many of whom come from the communities we serve, are dedicated to doing whatever is needed to ensure youth have the resources and skills to graduate college and career ready. YPI's recent accomplishments include opening the San Fernando Institute of Applied Media (SFiAM) in 2010 on the campus of San Fernando Middle School, a persistently lowest-achieving school. SFiAM increased its API score from 629 to 704 (+75 points) in two years. Notably, SFiAM has surpassed the achievement of San Fernando Middle School in only two years of operation, thanks to the hard work and dedication of teachers, the principal, other school staff, and the programs YPI provides on campus, including an afterschool program, AmeriCorps tutoring, parent education workshops, an iMac computer lab, and a School2Home program that provides all students with iPads. YPI's LA CollegeReady program trained 129 College Ambassadors who assisted 2,115 high school students and 900 parents prepare for college, including helping with applications, financial aid, and learning more about college options. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Beyond the numbers, YPI staff makes other differences. In 2011, ""Maria"" and her son were referred to YPI by Maria's job training program. Maria was keeping her son home from middle school because he was being recruited by an area gang. YPI staff immediately intervened by connecting Maria and her son with the on-site LAUSD counselor, who enrolled Maria's son in a new school that same day. Last year ""Maria"" and her daughter participated in YPI's Just Me and My Parent early childhood education classes. When Maria's daughter began preschool this past fall, her teacher was impressed by her fine motor skill development and ability to adapt to preschool. Maria expressed how grateful she was for YPI's early education program and how it has helped her and her daughter tremendously.","Central LA, LAUSD, San Fernando Valley, City of LA",,2018140
